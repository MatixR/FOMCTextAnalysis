4579,1991-12-17,PHILLIPS," Thank you I must say that, speaking toward the end of this discussion, there's not much I can [add] I would say that the discussion has been extremely helpful, and it does portray the very difficult balancing situation that we find ourselves in now I wish that some of the positive signs coming out of St Louis could have carried through a little further The negative economic signs that are portrayed in the Greenbook have been confirmed If you make a list of the negatives and of the positives, the negative list is longer than the positive list Nevertheless, the restructuring that has been discussed around the table does lay a very good foundation Once we get through bumping along the bottom, I think we will be poised to move up with stronger productivity, better efficiency in the  -27-    12/17/91  services sector, and so on And I do think the monetary aggregates are showing signs of getting back on track  So, we're in this balancing situation and, perhaps a bit like Larry Lindsey, I've been trying to weigh what the penalties are on the down side I haven't been in Washington that long but I am becoming sensitive to the political pressures; there might be worse things coming from the Hill or downtown--however one words it Nevertheless, I do come down on the side of accommodating this continued balance sheet restructuring From my perspective, David Mullins described the monetary easing that has occurred very, very clearly I think we do need some more easing [I don't know] whether the timing is right now or whether we should wait for a bigger bang, so to speak, to get that maximum impact I could be persuaded on that Nevertheless, I do think some easing at this time to continue the accommodation of the [business] restructuring would be helpful I'm afraid, unfortunately, that I agree with the Greenbook that the economy is still likely to be moving along the bottom for a while So, some easing at this point would seem to be helpful, but we're likely to need even more later on To the extent that we can do it earlier rather than later, I think we're better off because if we go into the spring and we start to see that black hole widen, we might start seeing more [unintelligible] And about February is not a grand time to be seeing a panic situation Thank you  I also am pleased to support the proposal I could have gone further, but I'm happy to support this proposal "

4615,1992-02-04,PHILLIPS," Thank you Coming toward the end of this discussion, there's really not as much to say Based on the Greenbook analysis and the comments that have been put forward describing what is going on in each of your Districts, it still seems to me that at best we can say the recovery is sluggish We've been saying that for quite a while and I agree with Governor Angell in that I can't see where that source of light is that will lead us out of this Some of the disappointing news that we're continuing to hear really confirms the hypothesis that we're seeing some structural changes This is not just a cyclical move The problem with that is that it may take us longer to come out of the recession than might have been the case in the past I will say, on the positive side, that the positive signs we are seeing are very good for the long run The balance sheet  -26-    2/4-5/92  restructuring certainly is good for the long term, as is the strengthening of the banking sector; and the fact that inflation does not seem to be as much of a concern in a broad variety of sectors is good for the long term We're seeing some change in people's viewpoint toward savings We've been saying for a long time that we need to have savings policies in this country, and I think we're starting to see some improvement there And the easing that occurred in late December was about as positively received as we might have hoped So, that was very helpful I do think that a lot of the easing that has occurred over the last year and a half probably has been soaked up in the balance sheet restructuring So, a lot of the easing that we may have thought was in the pipeline may be used up I do agree that we're not yet seeing in the real economy the easing that occurred in late December We certainly saw [mostly positive reactions], with the exception of the long bond situation Certainly the stock market reacted very favorably I'm concerned, as is Larry, about what might be happening on Capitol Hill to fix the situation In view of the fact that I don't think the easing is fully reflected in the real economy, I don't feel quite the same pressure to ease that I was feeling in December But like the Vice Chairman, I think we have to be quite vigilant over the next perhaps couple of weeks In the next couple of weeks there may be a window before Congress starts doing all kinds of things If there is a desire generally to ease, from a political perspective--though I hate to say it--it may be better to do it sooner than later On the one hand, it's not expected before Congress gets going, and it may well strengthen the hand of those who wish to try to address the deficit situation So, if we're thinking in terms of ease, I'd be inclined to urge that it be sooner rather than later Nevertheless, having said that, I'm not feeling quite the same strong pressure that I was in late December  As the native Virginian, it seems to me that elements of the Virginia Plan--  Right, these carpetbaggers I do have sympathy for the tunnel plan, and I'd like to see it continue to be discussed and kept on the table because I think it is better for the long run As a person who has not spent as much time on monetary policy matters as on other policy matters, I've noticed a tendency that whenever the time is inappropriate to make a change that's when it's on the table and is brought forward If we were at the midpoint of the range, it probably would not be as much of an issue I think it's very difficult to make policy changes when you're at the middle; there's just not an incentive to do it I do understand the politics of the situation, so, like several others who have spoken, I'd like to see the tunnel plan remain on the table for discussion, particularly for looking at the long-range policy implications  I could support alternative I Maybe I'm not even as optimistic as some; I'd like to see us get to the middle of the cone but I certainly could tolerate going to the upper parts of the ranges If growth does get to the upper part of the range, I'd be willing to bet that there will be a discussion then for tightening So, it will be interesting to follow this discussion as we move into the year  SPEAKER(?) I hope so  I support your recommendation "
4640,1992-03-11,PHILLIPS," What about agriculture? There seems to have been be a runup of prices in the last couple of weeks Is that something related to the weather?  Yes, it's here right now! Apparently corn and livestock prices have firmed; it's sort of across the board "
4666,1992-03-31,PHILLIPS," Thank you I guess I'm on cleanup again! I find myself in a great deal of agreement with what has been said around the table I am pleased that the positive signals seem to be strengthening in more than just a few parts of the country At least today we were hearing a little more positive signs from both coasts Like others, I am concerned about whether this fledgling recovery is going to be self sustaining or if we're going to continue to bounce along the bottom for a while or falter again I won't go through all of the areas of risks because several folks have elucidated most of them One area I would mention that hasn't been talked about quite as much is the question of employment and unemployment the pervasiveness of the levels of unemployment and how long it's going to take until we start to see something on the unemployment rate with the first digit being a ""6"" as opposed to a ""7"" And like the Greenbook, I'd be pleased if it didn't get worse before it got better But  -29-    3/31/92  because corporate America is on an efficiency drive in a recessionary period, I believe the cost-cutting and the drive to cut out layers of management are creating a situation where it's going to be harder to pull out of the unemployment situation To the extent that occurs, it may keep us either bumping along the bottom or create a situation where it's going to take longer to climb out  The question of restructuring is also an issue I'd like to talk about a bit We clearly have made a lot of progress, as Governor Mullins mentioned, on the restructuring The question I wonder about is How much more progress are households and corporate America looking to make? I wonder how much longer that restructuring is going to take and whether that will continue to draw away some of the monetary ease that I do think remains in the pipeline So, along with the questions of long-term rates and the vulnerability of exports, there are some [other] areas of risks I'm not sure that necessarily indicates that we should change our monetary policy at this point However, I do think we need to be vigilant If we don't start to see some improvement, we perhaps should be prepared to reassess that situation Some of the tightening that has occurred in the last couple of weeks that Governor Lindsey alluded to may be the early signs of a need to be vigilant But certainly at this point we have every reason to be pleased with the progress that has been made and [with the signs] that the monetary policy steps that were taken last year are beginning to bear fruit  I support your proposal of ""B"" asymmetric, and I appreciate your comments on getting past this period of conflicting data I hope that we will start to see better corporate earnings reports coming out following the first quarter so that we can see some sustainability in the equity market that is at a fairly high level With regard to the Ms, I agree with you, President Syron I'm not sure exactly what they mean I know they mean something and maybe they only mean something in hindsight So, I certainly agree that it's something we need to pay attention to but shouldn't get rattled by But there are a number of remaining concerns, so I would support your proposal based on them, Mr Chairman "
4692,1992-05-19,PHILLIPS," I would prefer ""B"" asymmetric toward ease, but I'll support symmetric recognizing that we may have to talk again in the intermeeting period "
4718,1992-06-30,PHILLIPS," Well, I think I'm batting clean-up again I'm going to change the analogy a bit because I feel as if we're running both the top and the bottom of the ninth inning at one time and the bases are loaded on both sides In any case, I certainly agree with the Greenbook forecast of a slow, modest, sluggish recovery One of the things that seems to have changed since last time is the question of how long this period of sluggishness is likely to continue The longer it goes on, the more I am starting to question whether or not we're going to start to lose consumers at some point and a slowdown will begin [Various] drags on the economy have been identified--the [financial] restructuring and the operating restructuring; the defense restructuring is really only getting started at this point We're starting to see a fall-off in demand While the confidence indexes look better, as Mike indicated, they're still below their high points I tend to wonder whether when people respond to the confidence surveyors they say one thing but when they respond to the political surveyors they say another thing, and thus we have a three-way race at this point The international side has started to weaken and, of course, state and local government constraints may be starting to come in I am encouraged about the progress on inflation I tend to wonder whether the concentration on the CPI or even the core CPI is perhaps overstating the price pressures that people are really feeling given this inability to raise prices, the bargain or sales shopping, and so on that are going on So, I'm a little more encouraged about price pressures than perhaps concentration on the CPI might indicate  The study and analysis of the monetary aggregates that we all appear to have engaged in since the last time do help to explain, partially, what has been happening in the monetary aggregates And that I think is helpful I wonder whether the banks, instead of aggressively bidding for deposits, are now out making loans; I wonder if they're really out building their CRA files instead of spending time on loan development In any case, we're not seeing the credit expansion So, I think we understand a bit more about the monetary aggregates Nevertheless, we're still seeing weakness in those aggregates Again, if we concentrate only on looking at the Ms in the short run we may not know too much, but in the long run I do think  -33-    6/30-7/1/92 -34-  they tell us something And we're having a [relatively] long period of weakness in those aggregates, so I think that is disturbing I do agree with Presidents Boehne and Corrigan that the key is employment growth And to the extent we have slow GDP growth--if it does drop down below 2 percent for an extended period of time--we're going to have some problems seeing sustained growth So, while things haven't changed a lot substantively since the last time, it does seem to me that the length of time and the cumulating effect are heightening the downside risk  Clearly, we're in this terrible gray area that Governor Kelley talked about yesterday I'm having a bit of a hard time separating the discussion on the longer-range goals and the short-term action To try to comment on the goals outside of some discussion about the short-term action I find a little difficult It seems to me that if they were taken in conjunction, we'd have an opportunity to give two messages A message about the strength of the economy and at the same time a signal with respect to our seriousness about inflation As a citizen I also have some difficulty setting goals that we have no chance of meeting and that we're not intending to meet In a managerial sense I've generally thought of goal-setting as something that makes a statement as to where one wants to go I don't think goals are always set in an environment where one has full knowledge of all of the variables that make up what goes into those goals So, I'd rather see a bit of a conjunction in the message that on the one hand we're going to ease to try to deal with the economy but at the same time we are making a statement about inflation with respect to our longer-run objectives  -52-    6/30-7/1/92  I would prefer to ease to accommodate the restructuring, but I could live with an asymmetric directive "
4754,1992-08-18,PHILLIPS," So moved  Thank you On the one hand there has been some progress in the sense that I've managed to move myself from the bottom or the last on the list to talking at least before a few other folks! On the other hand, and even after listening to the Gipper last night, it's a little hard to find the bright spots--or maybe I should say the points of light The economy and the monetary aggregates appear to have weakened since our last meeting Maybe I should say the monetary aggregates have weakened and then the economy has weakened In trying to locate likely sources of strength, I don't think we're going to see it from the consumer Housing may be a potential source of strength, but with the unemployment uncertainty and because trying to get out of the recession into a stronger recovery situation has taken so long, it seems to me questionable that housing is going to provide the spark that we may need And, certainly, the news from different parts of the country tends to be spotty Investment spending is a possibility, but again that may be    8/18/92  somewhat constrained by the retrenching that we're seeing in business, the emphasis on efficiency, and just simply the slowdown in spending The downward Greenbook revision in GDP for the third quarter is particularly disturbing in view of the fact that last time we did not assume there would be an easing What this implies to me is that it has taken an easing to feed this restructuring process that we've all talked about and that we've all observed It appears that it is deep- seated and more widespread than many of us might have thought As for the unemployment situation, I tend to wonder whether or not there's more pain out there in the labor market than is evidenced even by the 77 percent [unemployment rate] I cite that because people know there is more restructuring to occur; the defense cutback is really only getting started The fact that it is taking such a long time to move [along] is protracting some of the pain And I guess the question for us is how satisfied we are with this picture of slow growth and an economy that doesn't seem to be generating jobs  So, for me, the risks seem decidedly on the down side I certainly recognize the arguments that another easing may not help On the other hand, the question is What are the risks of another easing? Inflation doesn't appear to be flaring up And maybe, as Governor Kelley mentioned, we are approaching the point where we have to start wondering if we are overshooting The politics, the press, and the concern about timing are problems only if we make them problems That is to say If we allow ourselves to be dictated by whatever happens to be going on in a particular week, then it becomes a problem We have to do what we think is right And I don't think we should be waiting around for fiscal policy That is tenuous at best So, on balance, it seems to me that since last time the risks have moved more to the down side  I'd prefer ""A"" but will support ""B"" asymmetric "
4782,1992-10-06,PHILLIPS," But it's a long lag  Well, since I think I am the last one to speak, I'll be very short I'm much more comfortable with the Greenbook forecast this time--the marking down [of the economic growth projection] I've been a bit more pessimistic all along with respect to the real economy I'm not pleased to see a markdown to 12 percent real growth in the fourth quarter, but I think it's fairly realistic I'm also in agreement generally that inflation is under control by almost any measure And I think we're getting to where--with the discussions of what the CPI means, the measurement problems, and so on--we're recognizing that we may be getting close to that deflationary point that Governor Kelley mentioned The fact that we've gone on so long with this weak economy adds another uncertainty generally The uncertainty is reflected in the market We've talked about the political uncertainty, and certainly the international uncertainty is reflected in the markets As for the uncertainty with    10/6/92  respect to how long this balance sheet adjustment is going to go on, though, the duration of this weakness and of the adjustment process is continuing to drag people down and that is further damping the capability of the economy to recover  The last couple of times we've scratched our heads trying to figure out what M2 was telling us and whether or not we should change the cones or move the cones around So we said we weren't going to do anything because we didn't know enough about what the monetary aggregates were telling us We've seen some small improvements in M2 lately but it still looks as if it's moving sideways Maybe the monetary aggregates were telling us more than we were paying attention to earlier With respect to exchange rates, I recognize that if we allow the dollar to be a policy constraint for us, we may end up lengthening the cycle--lengthening this long period of slow economic growth--and in fact it may hurt us in the long run  Adding all of these things up, I come out thinking that we probably are going to need another easing move I'm somewhat concerned about its timing; care needs to be given to when we do it I'm not enthusiastic about this reputation that we seem to have garnered that we react to various things and I'm a little concerned about getting ""gamed"" by the traders who I think are having a rather grand time these days So, I come out for a move toward ease but I think the timing needs to be considered carefully  First of all, I'd like to support President Jordan's suggestion that we take another look at the M2 cones In essence, if M2 is a policy guide, we should have eased earlier If it's not a policy guide but only an aggregate that we forecast, then we should be lowering our forecast So, I find this inconsistent attention to M2 somewhat troubling I would prefer to ease today, so my preference is alternative A However, having said that, because of my concerns about the traders' voracious attempts to ""game"" the System --and having had first-hand experience with that crowd--I will reluctantly support [""B""] asymmetric  -49-    10/6/92 "
4809,1992-11-17,PHILLIPS," Well, perhaps echoing a lot of the comments that have been made around the table, I think we're certainly entering what I call a crucial time to assess a potential shift in direction We've all been very cheered by some of the recent positive, although tentative, reports I think many of these positive reports are due to the accommodative monetary stance that we have been in over the last several years Some of that is beginning to pay off, certainly in the GDP; and we're starting to see life in M2 and even some loan activity, although some of that is anecdotal at this point Consumer confidence appears to have turned around and certainly the inflationary situation at least [in terms of] current inflation is much improved, although, as David notes, this dichotomy between inflation expectations and current inflation continues to be troubling  In spite of this generally improved atmosphere in tone, there's still considerable room for caution I continue to be troubled by the labor market situation Although we've seen some improvement in the unemployment rate, we are still seeing declines in aggregate employment We are still seeing major restructuring in a number of industries, with permanent job losses which are being reflected to some extent in real disposable personal income Although we've seen improvement recently in industrial production, it has not improved in the aggregate over the last few months While the banking situation has improved--maybe somewhere between ""somewhat"" and ""considerably""--there is still some fragility to the banking situation, and we are going to have to watch that very carefully It's not clear when this restructuring process that we've all talked about is going to wind down There is still considerable room for restructuring in the defense industry and in some of the major, Blue Chip companies We mentioned GM around the table today but other major corporations are going through restructuring, and that probably is going to continue to hit the headlines  The export situation is also a source of potential concern Japan and Germany have been mentioned and the German question could  -22-    11/17/92  probably be broadened to more of Europe While our export situation may not have been saved, it has not been as bad as it otherwise would have been because of the improvement in some of the underdeveloped countries It's not clear how much more some of those underdeveloped countries can continue to expand In summary, while I'm cheered by the improvement, I think we have to question whether it is a sustainable start or whether we are heading for another potential swoon I do think we will have a fiscal package; it's only a question of size and shape, but it is coming If the economy is continuing to improve, I would think the new President is going to want to get out ahead of that and be able to take some credit for it So, we're likely to see a stronger situation in the medium term The short term, though, I think still remains at question  Let me do the ranges first I thought that the Feinman-Porter study was immensely helpful and added to our understanding of what was going on Having said that, I was on the bus that wanted to lower the ranges in July, so it'll come as no surprise that I continue to want to lower the ranges I don't see it as just a technical matter I think the study did identify some substantive, real kinds of effects It also seems to me that lowering the ranges now is consistent with the testimony that was given in July that we were continuing to study it and would be back when we knew something It's certainly a consistent story, so I'd prefer to lower the ranges now I will say that with respect to the amount, I could go with either one half or a full percentage point reduction because I think the message of continuing to want to move toward price stability is the important thing  With respect to the short-term directive, I'm also persuaded by the argument for an immediate coupling I'd prefer to go with an immediate easing because I think there's still considerable room for improvement in this economy I do think we're going to have some kind of fiscal stimulus package, and I'd prefer to see a more balanced approach to a fiscal package when the time comes for that debate Having said that, I could live with ""B"" asymmetric toward ease but I'd prefer to ease  You are going to say that we're going to cut the ranges in February?  May I ask on what basis we close the meetings now?  Is there something in the Federal Reserve Act that allows us to close monetary--  We're not subject to it at all?  Why not?  It's just exempt completely from the Sunshine Act?  -59-    11/17/92  What about the Board of Governors?  But discount rate meetings aren't open  On what basis?  Financial speculation!  Right, right! Having found that out, the one thing that does seem unique in the FOMC compared to other regulatory bodies that do come under Government in the Sunshine is that we have a situation where 12 presidents come in from all over the country and the first part of the meeting is truly deliberative; and a lot of views aren't set until we go through that discussion process I think that's the uniqueness of the Federal Reserve that we need somehow to try to preserve, if that can be separated out  I think they're separable When you come down to the vote time under normal Government in the Sunshine procedures, that's the kind of thing that you'd have to record  Well, if we go to some kind of fairly quick disclosure, there's not going to be any more asymmetric anything We're just going to have to go to a straight vote, announce it, and that's it  That's right  Right  Well, if we announce that a vote has been taken and that it's going to be asymmetric--  I think that would be limiting In my understanding of Government in the Sunshine, though, there are ways to protect deliberative processes That seems to me something that could be pursued because I think other government agencies do differentiate between staff papers and a deliberative process leading up to a vote It's the final decision that has to be made public  Yes, we had closed meetings The basis on which we could close them included market-specific information, firm information, the IBM kind of information There are clear bases on which to close meetings And generally, unless you're subpoenaed, you can protect the deliberative process  From Sunshine, [not FOIA]  SPEAKER(?) That's why we gave it up in 1976  May I ask that we follow up on Jerry's suggestion about trying to get at least a little blurb on what other central banks do? "
4845,1992-12-22,PHILLIPS," Sensitive about this are you, Jerry?  The reports that we've heard today and the reports in the last week or so are certainly the strongest evidence since I've been on the Board that the economy appears to be breaking out of this pattern of fits and starts that have characterized this recovery Still, the persistence of regional differences remains a concern I think the signs that are perhaps the most encouraging coming out of this plethora of news include the steady improvement on the employment front and in consumer confidence Maybe it's the fact that we've now had six quarters of positive GDP that is finally dawning on people Or maybe, as some have suggested, it's the post- election phenomenon Or maybe people are just plain tired of being down in the dumps and generally depressed We're making good progress on housing; industrial production seems to be on track after a bit of a swoon in the early part of the third quarter We're seeing some small improvement, some strengthening, on the credit side It seems very tenuous considering the situation that we've seen on business bank borrowing in December but still there's some improvement there We have stronger corporate profits The stock market has been holding up The Dow hasn't moved a lot over the year; other indexes have improved But overall, given the rather high PE ratios that we're still seeing, the fact that the stock market has held in there as long as it has is a good sign The flattening of the yield curve is a generally good sign I hope that is sustained and that it continues to flatten on the long end Generally, the financial sector seems to be in better shape now to support a recovery than we've seen  I'm glad to see that some of our discussion here today has centered on inflation There are differing views as to whether or not we're starting to see a buildup of concerns with respect to inflation And I was glad to see the extensive analysis in the Greenbook on inflation Concentrating on a variety of indicators--looking at the PPI components, commodity prices, and the wage indexes as opposed to just the CPI--I thought was helpful  -23-    12/22/92  Like others, I have some gnawing concerns as we go into 1993 The trade balance has been mentioned I wonder if it's not just the concern about what Europe and Japan as trading partners may portend for the United States; if they get into bigger problems than might now be anticipated, I wonder if there will be some spillover effects that might come to our economy On the employment side we still have a ways to go on operating restructuring and defense restructuring, so employment still seems to be a key to sustainability I think the financial deleveraging has lessened, as [have] the Chairman's headwinds, but I'm not sure that we know how much further we have to go yet with respect to financial deleveraging As a final note, I must say that I am concerned about the monetary aggregates We're going to have to look very carefully at the M2 deceleration that we're seeing currently in December and that is projected for the next couple of months I think the monetary aggregates bear careful watching  ""B"" symmetric "
4886,1993-02-02,PHILLIPS," I was just wondering in the revised green sheets why the nominal GDP for the fourth quarter went down so much?  So, you think we might hear more on this yet?  Well, my story is probably going to be a bit like Larry's, but let me start with the economic situation Certainly we have the strongest or best prospects we've had since I've been at the Fed in terms of growth, production, productivity, and spending The financial sector, something we haven't discussed much, does seem to be in better shape, not just the banking system but the financial system generally, for a provision of capital Consumer confidence is dramatically improved, perhaps stronger than the fundamentals would imply, which is exactly the opposite of what we were talking about some six months ago here when we were saying that confidence wasn't as  -29-    2/2-3/93  strong and should be stronger based on the fundamentals The variance among the Districts, from what we've listened to in this discussion, seems to be widening The report from Bob Parry is that the Twelfth District doesn't seem to be getting any better So, that's certainly a disturbing wrinkle on the economic scene As John LaWare said, we still have some of the same continuing drags that we've had in the past We're making some progress, but we still have [weakness in] non-residential construction, the international slowdown may in fact be worse than even we've been led to understand, the federal deficit is still there, and state budget constraints are still there So, we have a number of the same kinds of constraints that we've seen before  As for the balance sheet adjustments that we've all talked about, we are clearly making progress but I don't think anybody really knows how much or how much more progress we still have to make What is the right amount of debt either for corporations or for individuals? There is this whole question of operating restructuring --Si Keehn's macho terminology, or right-sizing, down-sizing, and de- layering We're seeing a lot of it The corporate executives who are losing their jobs are certainly affecting all the other corporate executives who are not and who might be feeling the heat from some of their boards of directors I suspect that is going to keep pressure in the area of remaining tough on layoffs Certainly there are some real things that are driving this restructuring the drive for an increasingly competitive international environment, increased productivity, and so on Nevertheless, we've been saying for a long time that computers were really going to change our lives and now they definitely are changing our lives and changing the way corporations are assessing their needs in terms of their work force And it goes not only from middle management analyzing these various kinds of statistics to all of us who are now getting more facile at looking at the statistics directly, but also to just-in-time inventory management We're seeing it even in manufacturing Somebody, I don't remember who it was, has labeled this the second industrial revolution The social acceptability of these moves in corporate America seems to be continuing So, I think we're going to continue to see those pressures I think the employment situation remains the key to the sustainability [of economic growth]; it's certainly what the market is watching now People are not watching as much what's happening with the new growth measures but are waiting more now for the employment reports So, that remains a concern I'm hopeful that we're going to get that 130,000 a month increase in payroll employment, but that may be a bit optimistic  I'd like to follow up on some of Larry's comments with respect to the new Administration If you just watch your [computer] screen for a couple of hours, you can see trial balloons going across the screen at an increasing rate I'm certainly encouraged by the general direction that the new Administration is taking with respect to trying to address the deficit [and to enact] a small fiscal package Certainly the stated goals are something we'd all like to see happen in terms of jobs, deficit reduction, and even banking reform We're hearing some discussion about the need to examine the regulatory environment As a former manager I recognize, as I think we all can, that good ideas are in fact a lot easier to come up with than actually to get done I certainly hope that we're going to achieve all of these things, but I think we have to recognize that we're still in the trial balloon stage now  -30-    2/2-3/93  My gosh, I wasn't last I can't believe it!  Clearly, we have a lot of politics floating around; a lot of the discussion does seem to center on politics Unfortunately, politics is a lot perception, and at some point perception and reality start to merge And I worry some about our developing our own platform for criticism I think we clearly have to do something and I think whatever action is taken shouldn't need lots of explanation The action should speak for itself, which is one of the reasons I like the idea of lowering the bottom end but not necessarily the top end because I think [a wider range] would convey the increased uncertainty Having said that, though, [one could] say that the top end is probably the most irrelevant part of the whole range at this point I wouldn't wait until March or until our next meeting, though, to start discussing in the text that we are looking at some other types of Ms  The text of Humphrey-Hawkins  The report itself I might not shower them with all kinds of Ms, but I think an indication that we have been monitoring more than just M2--that is to say, we are looking at M2 plus bond funds, plus stock funds, adjusted for the yield curve, and so on--would be [appropriate]  Right  One could think of it even as a sort of surcharge during this period when things are so unusual that it's appropriate to deviate from looking just at M2 or the traditional [measures] and to start looking now at more--  -48-    2/2-3/93  Right, understandable! So, I guess my preference would be President Syron's approach I probably would end up supporting the 1/2 point [reduction] but with more explanation or some monitoring ranges [besides] just M2  ""B"" symmetric  Where is this?  First of all, let me say that this outline helped to identify all of the issues and to focus the discussion With respect to option ""E,"" I agree that that's an area that we should continue to look at I'd give some consideration just to making an announcement if there's an actual action and not making an announcement [if there is not] And I probably wouldn't go with any explanation At least at this point that's what I'd be thinking in terms of  An announcement of an easing move, for example I'd make an announcement if we were going to change the federal funds rate or make a big change in the [degree of] pressure on reserves  The same  I just see that as less confusing to the market--to announce when it's an intentional move as opposed to just being consistent with what was in the previous directive  Right  No, I don't think so As for the other suggestions that were made, I think doing some kind of summary of the policy directive probably would give us a better chance of getting more coverage because a lot of information does go out and it seems not to get very much attention It's partly just laziness on the part of the press If we have a one-pager for them, they'll cover it  Right With respect to periodic press conferences, I'd give some consideration to that I say that but I don't have a strong feeling about how often and so forth But right now our major public forum is Congress and that's a bully pulpit So, I think it might just give us a different forum for making a statement  No I think you'd be great, David!  What I'm suggesting is that those are the things [to be considered], like you did with the rest of this outline I'm just raising it as a possibility; I don't have strong feelings about [whether to do it] regularly or periodically I would urge a follow-up on the items that were suggested in the appendix the FOIA coverage, the practices of other agencies and the legislative and judicial [branches] I think those are all fruitful areas to explore "

4930,1993-03-23,PHILLIPS," I'd like to support Governor Kelley on this I thought the one-page summary was probably one of the more positive new things coming out of this A lot of these news services will extract from the summary; and if we give them what we'd like them to extract, I think we have a better chance of there being a fairer reading of the minutes So, I support Mike's contingent on this And like it or not, we are in a sound-bite, concise summary kind of environment  Well, with a few uncertainties or exceptions, the economy appears to be showing signs of being in the upswing portion of a more traditional business cycle, although certainly not of the same strength that we saw in the fourth quarter of '92 We are seeing consumer purchasing continue; it's not surging, but it's at least continuing at a reputable pace Employment is showing some signs of strength We're seeing pretty strong corporate cash flows Long-term interest rates, as we've discussed this morning, have finally come down, and the financial sector appears well positioned to continue to provide capital to a budding recovery Prices are firming in some areas and certainly that has negative connotations, but it's also a sign of a strengthening economy Now, given those traditional signs of an improving economy, I think there are some forces that are likely to continue to restrain [it and preclude] a more robust recovery; we're certainly seeing that in the monetary aggregates The corporate and household restructuring is continuing and this is both balance sheet repairing but also on the operating side I don't think we're seeing any diminution in the operating restructuring that began last year We still have ahead the defense restructuring and the effects of that on employment  On inflation I had written down some nascent signs of inflation reoccurring, although after listening to Governor Angell maybe I should just say plain old signs, not nascent signs I would have pointed certainly to some of the anecdotal evidence that has been reported--lumber prices and so on We could probably find some story for every one of these things, but we can't keep throwing out pieces of the indexes At some point, it all starts to add up As for the international situation, [problems] seem to range from a very weak G-7 to a potential crisis in Russia So, certainly that could have an effect on this economy On the fiscal side, we really don't yet know what the full impacts of the fiscal package are going to be And we have the health package yet to come We all have great hopes that we're going to see the deficit reduced, but I think there's considerable skepticism as to how much deficit reduction in fact is going to occur as we move forward with this package The taxes and redistribution effects may well be more contractive than some of us would like to see In sum, I think we really can't be complacent about this recovery Maybe a year ago we would have been glad to see a 3 percent type of recovery But any one of these downside risks could certainly upset a very fragile consumer confidence situation and send the bond market into orbit again  ""B"" symmetric This certainly seems the time to keep our powder dry I guess I have no objection to the alternative language; I'm not crazy about it "
4954,1993-05-18,PHILLIPS," I agree  Thank you Clearly, I haven't mastered the timing of when to get my name on the list, having to follow such an impassioned statement As I listen to the discussion around the table, I'm always struck, but even more so this time, by the vast regional differences and perceptions These people are trying to bring some anecdotal evidence that gives us some clues on where we're going as opposed to complete reliance on the statistics So I'm particularly struck this time by the differences regionally  My own read on the national situation is that I think we're more than likely returning to a slower, but I do believe sustainable, growth path And I don't think that this is necessarily bad Certainly, there are some areas of strength, and Mike pointed out a number of them But it does represent a continuation of this operating restructuring that we're going through--the defense restructuring and the balance sheet adjustments I don't think it's very clear how long this process is going to take Six months ago or eight months ago we were trying to make projections as to how far along it was [Now] I think it's pretty clear that we probably can't make those kinds of assessments People and businesses are trying to adjust to a new order of technology and more complete world  -33-    5/18/93  integration In fact, I think the whole inflationary/stable price argument is clearly becoming a central part of day-to-day business decisions There is the uncertainty that's associated with the Clinton economic program If you think about it, this Administration has been in office only four months but we've been on an amazing roller coaster with different thrusts Some of [the ideas] clearly were trial balloons, but some of them were certainly put forward with great fervor as proposed bills We are still not sure where all of this is going to end up Nevertheless, all of these arguments do appear to be leading us to more inflationary pressures So, no matter how it comes out--even though we didn't get the stimulus bill and I think some folks might question whether it was really a stimulus proposal--it is still leading to increased inflationary pressures  I know I have talked about this in the past but I continue to think--and I'll echo some of Si's comments--that the labor markets remain a key to the economic environment The economy is growing enough to produce some jobs but hardly enough, really, to accommodate even the population growth I think the unemployment rate does mask some of the adjustments and the turmoil that is occurring in the labor markets on account of the downsizing, the de-layering, and the changes in employment needs on account of new technology The huge fixed costs that are associated with taking on new permanent employees are clearly deterring many businesses from staffing up I come back to this whole labor market question continually because I think it's the flip side of what is going to happen with spending and whether or not consumers are going to be able to participate in the stimulation of the economy So, whether or not this is a setback or a blip, and whether or not this is a long blip or a plateau, I think it's not that unexplainable if we go back to this entire question of restructuring that is occurring  Let me turn to inflation Like everybody else I'm having a hard time reconciling the recent numbers with the economy One observation I would make is that we shouldn't necessarily assume or expect a smooth route of progress on inflation any more than we should necessarily expect a smooth route on a recovery Some bumps and plateaus are likely We should expect some experimentation in prices as folks attempt to see if they can get price increases to stick We've seen lumber prices shoot way up but we've also seen them come back down again In looking at cattle prices, for example, we've seen very strong prices, and they've finally been reflected in some of the meat numbers in the CPI Tobacco is another example We saw strong [price] increases--that was what was driving the CPI--but now we hear that we're going to have some cuts I agree with Jerry's argument on inflation psychology I think we had inflation for so long that people in demanding wage increases confuse growth with inflation It used to be that a 6 percent salary increase was nothing But now that would be fairly large So, I think it's going to take a long time to work through this entire process I don't think we should lose sight of some of the countervailing pressures on prices international competition; weak economies, certainly domestically but also internationally; quality improvements; improved productivity; and weak credit conditions All of these things may well start to be reflected in prices, so we will see this movement that's a bit up and down Having said all of that, the most recent CPI and PPI numbers and some of the commodity price increases are clearly disturbing But we have to recognize that we have considerable difficulty interpreting these  -34-    5/18/93  numbers, even the ones that are historical, much less trying to address some of the future ones So, I certainly agree with the Chairman that this is an area that we have to address our attention to It makes the policy questions that we're going to be facing in the next round even more challenging  I would prefer symmetric I still have concerns about the weakness of the economy, so I think one can make arguments in either direction I will say that, having listened to this discussion, I am persuaded that perhaps the perceptions of our being [watchful]--or maybe getting out the signal that we really are addressing inflation--might be helpful So, I could live with asymmetric toward tightening "
4981,1993-07-06,PHILLIPS," Could I ask a question? Are any of the CDs that are included in M2 indexed in any way?  Any with equity?  With equity?  SPEAKER(?) Citicorp  So we already have a piece in the CDs?  Let me say first of all that it's clear that this first-quarter slowdown we've had seems to be a return to a pattern of slower growth--you could call it moderate growth if you like--[near the] 2-1/2 percent rate that we've averaged over the last 18 months I don't have the same sense that I might have had a year ago that we're going to lapse back into negative real growth There has been considerable job creation; we have had enough job creation to lower the unemployment rate over the last year, but we're just barely keeping up with the demographics, so the unemployment rate hasn't gone down There are some real areas of strength or potential strength autos, housing, durables, capital equipment But, again, I'm really quite struck, as I listen to everybody talk, by the big differences from region to region And the uncertainties that remain are really quite considerable the continued layoffs; the deficits of federal, state, and local governments; the whole restructuring process; and the international weaknesses The uncertainty is casting a pall over spending and the expansion of investment We are getting investment for capital equipment, but the focus is on productivity and efficiency; it's not as much on expansion [of capacity]  I think it's quite appropriate that we've spent as much time as we have this afternoon on inflation--the increased emphasis in the Greenbook and the increased emphasis and analysis in the Chart Show presentation on inflation It is feasible that we could have some additional progress but I think it's quite right--and I've forgotten who said it--that any additional gains in inflation are going to be extremely hard to come by As the recovery continues, manufacturers and distributors are going to continue to try to make those price increases stick It's going to be incumbent upon us to try to discern whether or not some of these short-term supply distortions that we  -41-    7/6-7/93  have seen are short term, as Tom described in the case of cement or lumber, or whether [the suppliers] are going to be able to increase prices and make them stick generally I don't think we know the bottom line yet of how the weather situation is going to affect our inflationary situation The deceleration in labor costs appears to be leveling and we've not seen much break in this inflation psychology that has been discussed as we look forward and move away from trying to look back at where we've been on inflation We've seen a ratcheting up in inflationary expectations in the consumer confidence indexes and also in the steepness of the yield curve David described a couple of bouts that we've had recently on inflation expectations I find this very anomalous If people really expected inflation to start rampaging, we would start to see consistent shifting into real assets We're not seeing that so much in this country We've not seen it in housing We've seen it some in durables, but one could probably explain that as the replacement of old cars or on the business side as firms trying to deal with improved productivity We have a ways to go in terms of dealing with inflation, and we need to keep working on the analysis of inflation because I don't think we have a full handle on it  I also hope that we will continue to work on the monetary aggregates I agree with Governor Angell There is a concept of money that should be our guidepost Our problem is that we don't have it well measured We don't really know how to measure it, in part because of this [admixture] of capital and money accounts So, I continue to hope that we will focus on that; maybe M2+ isn't the right measure, but I do think we need to keep working on that  I wasn't last!  Switch to rice!  You're not going to get any takers  -43-    7/6-7/93  If there were a stock market correction--  Do we put that in M2?  I'd go ahead and lower the range to 1 to 5 percent for both 1993 and 1994 We have a half a year of information for 1993 and it seems to me that we'd look pretty foolish if we didn't recognize that And I'd vote for that [lower range] for 1994 because I think it may in fact put us where we'd like to be for [substantive] reasons I would urge, along the lines of President McTeer's comments, that we have some discussion in the written testimony somewhere on M2+ because I do think that helps in terms of the explanation  We know something, yes  And from all of this analysis that we have done this last year we have learned a lot more  I also support it I was swayed last time by the argument that we needed to be on record as being concerned about inflation It seems to me that we have less reason to ease or tighten now I do think that at some point we're going to have to address negative real rates But it doesn't appear to me that at this time they are causing particular harm to the economy And it seems to me that we're best staying the course and best staying with an asymmetric toward tightening directive I think a change would signal a lack of concern about inflation, and that would not be a good thing to do "
5008,1993-08-17,PHILLIPS," Do you have any sense as to where the demand for the yen is coming from?  -2-    8/17/93  So they're demanding more yen?  So it's just sort of a relative thing  Well, I think I'm about in the middle here; we certainly are seeing slow or moderate growth no matter how we slice it The labor market is seeing some improvement, but really only slightly more than handling the demographics And the quality of much of that job growth has not been that good Restructuring is clearly continuing Consumer confidence, I think, is taking its toll We're seeing hesitant consumers and the confidence problems spreading to the business sector with hesitance in some investment patterns As for potential home owners, we've not seen as much growth in the housing sector as I think the fundamentals would suggest Weak international trading partners, the defense downsizing, the deficits--federal and state--are going to continue to be a drag We haven't talked as much around the table today about the state deficit problems, but we may be hearing more about that in the upcoming quarter Then, of course, there's the realization of the budget package now that it has been passed As Larry has demonstrated, people are now really going to be understanding what that tax package meant And, of course, we still have to work through the flood problems and we still have health care on the horizon So, a lot of these factors are contributing to the outlook for slow growth  -26-    8/17/93  Now, having said that, we shouldn't forget or miss that there are some strengths in the economy that could bode well for the long run The financial markets are really reasonably strong The equity market is strong; the bond market is strong Banks are in better shape and individual balance sheets are in better shape There is at least a focus on trying to solve the deficit problem I can't say that I'm all that confident that the current package is the thing that's going to solve it, but at least there seems to be a focus on the fact that something needs to be done about it  We do have a number of anomalies that I think we're going to have to address over the coming months There is this question of productivity I haven't heard it mentioned today, but the fall-off in productivity in the first half of this year seems anomalous to me, given all of the downsizing and the focus on efficiency I don't know if this is a bad harbinger or if it's going to go away The persistence of low real interest rates, at least short-term real interest rates, doesn't seem like something that can continue forever That can't be a stable situation The weakness of the dollar is another anomalous situation Certainly M2 remains another anomaly I, like Tom, am a bit uncomfortable that we don't have a clear focus for monetary policy So, I hope that we will continue to work our way toward trying to define what is happening to M2 and how long these temporary factors are going to be temporary Maybe inflation fits into the category of an anomaly I've certainly been more encouraged by the recent news--the fact that in this most recent inflation report the last 12-month core inflation number is lower than the previous 12-month number So, there is still a possibility of making some progress, but we shouldn't think that the progress is going to be anywhere near as good as it has been in the last year or so I don't see the possibility of a big outbreak of inflation The usual indicia are simply not present We don't see an overheated economy; cost-push pressures aren't significant, if you look at the slack in labor markets; we're not importing inflation; people aren't rushing to convert to real assets So, I'm a little more encouraged on inflation But, again, if we in fact are settling into this 3 to 3-1/2 percent range, we can't be satisfied with that So, we may still have some work ahead of us  I also support ""B"" symmetric I think the economy has been weaker than we previously thought Inflation is better and we could declare victory Staying with asymmetry toward tightening may in fact signal more fears about inflation than might be necessary Doing it now would get us ahead of the curve so that we're not seen as switching under pressure I would like to see messages either in your testimony or in the minutes continuing to point toward our emphasis on price stability "
5032,1993-09-21,PHILLIPS," Well, I should follow right along with that First of all let me say that I, like a lot of people, have been disappointed by the [slowdown] in 1993 I also was disappointed to see the downward revision by the staff for the third quarter; but I can't really argue with it I do hope that the fourth-quarter bounceback that is projected in fact really happens If that's the case, then that would make 1993 all in all reasonably respectable I again am struck by the stark differences in outlook in various regions and also by Larry's comments about differences among groups Sometimes when we focus on the Greenbook or the national economy, we tend to gloss over some of these drastic differences One unifying factor in all of these comments, though, has been continued concern about the employment situation The employment gains we've seen so far in '93 have been encouraging; we have seen jobs added I think, though, that job quality is still a problem Employees are still trying to learn to adjust to the restructuring via temporary part-time employment This notion of downward mobility is still a concern I hope that Dick Syron is right and that there is light at the end of the tunnel I wonder whether this is more a function of learning to live with the adjustment as opposed to light at the end of the tunnel  All of this, I think, is continuing to weigh on consumer confidence That's likely to be exacerbated over the coming months because of the uncertainties regarding what is happening to health care reform and taxes and also the NAFTA rhetoric and the defense cuts Some of the other risks to the economy have already been discussed As for productivity, we've seen a marked improvement so far in the '90s, but the question remains as to whether that's going to continue or whether the downturn that we've seen for the first two quarters of this year is going to be more the shape of the future The fiscal drag that is likely to be setting in is a bit more worrisome because there's less room for error in projections If we're at a 12 percent projected growth rate for the third quarter, that doesn't leave as much room for error in potential effects of the  -29-    9/23/93  fiscal drag And we have yet to see the health insurance and other spending cuts that are supposed to be put into place play out yet State and local government shortfalls also are going to have more of a negative effect; that's going to mean either more cuts in spending or more state taxes, neither of which is very healthy for the overall economy If the first announcement of the third-quarter GDP is really around 1 percent, I wonder what kind of effect that's going to have It may well be that we're going to start getting more sentiment for a stimulus package It may well be--and both Gary Stern and Ed Boehne talked about this--that the light may be focused on monetary policy a little more brightly The other big down side that I'd mention, which has already been outlined by Bill McDonough and others, is the uncertainty in Europe, Japan, and the former Soviet Union I agree that the risks are not just on the export side but that other kinds of effects might be engendered if there are problems in those financial markets  Now, having said that--and a number of people have stated that they believe the risks are balanced around the Greenbook projection--I don't think we should forget some of the strengths that we do have in the economy The broader monetary aggregates and even credit are showing some signs of strength The banking system is stronger; the financial markets are stronger I must admit when I look at the stock market that I do see it as more problematic than the bond market, although I'm not one who has visions of tulips when I look at the stock market But it is at a higher level Perhaps the last good news or better news story to mention is on the inflation front commodity prices have retreated; the PPI has been showing a disinflationary trend And I agree that it's going to be possible to make some continued progress on core inflation  ""B"" symmetric "
5086,1993-10-22,PHILLIPS," Alan, this is Susan  I would think that there would be a chance that the Justice Department would see these transcripts as essentially staff materials--as material supporting the staff's efforts to prepare the minutes And I thought that Justice traditionally has taken a pretty hard line on trying to keep staff materials from being made public  That's a little different than going ahead with a proposal to go back and start making all these Memoranda of Discussion  I must say, I'm uncomfortable with going back and changing the procedures that we've had in the past because those folks aren't around and they attended those FOMC meetings under what they thought were certain ground rules And I find it somewhat difficult to go back and do that I don't object to doing it on a going-forward basis But going back, I really see those [older] transcripts as staff material supporting the development of the minutes, which was what the FOMC thought they were approving  I do agree that as a fallback position the Memorandum of Discussion is definitely better than publishing the raw transcripts But I would hope that we'd make a try not even to do that  This is Susan I agree I think it would be useful to have Virgil explore that and seek the advice of Justice  I agree  SPEAKER(?)

5139,1993-11-16,PHILLIPS," Most of my questions have been asked but let me ask one follow-up question In these two proposals, one for the MODs going forward and then the lightly edited transcripts going back,  -13-    11/16/93  you're talking about release to the public, not to the [Congressional] Committee?  Well, with respect to the past transcripts, I must say that I have considerable discomfort with changing the rules of the game for all of those people who sat around this table So my preference is no release, but I take it that that's not sustainable Assuming that it's not sustainable, I'd go with the lightly edited option, and as a second choice raw transcripts, annotated I'd have the Secretariat review it and state that it might contain errors I'd go with a five-year delay because of privacy [concerns]  Going forward, I would prefer the minutes the way that we are doing them and could see some enhancement of them But I could live with an MOD, which I have a slight preference for over the light editing I'd go for a three-year delay I also think that we're into this tit-for-tat, going back and forth with these letters, and that it would be good to seek hearings so that the only form of discussion is not letters back and forth  -34-    11/16/93  First choice would be lightly edited; second choice would be [releasing] both  Is this for the past?  Five and three  Enhanced minutes first; edited transcript second  What motion has been made and seconded?  If we do that, it would be a good idea to have your subcommittee [report] so that we have [options to consider] and we're not arguing about definitions of what ""enhanced"" means and so forth  I agree with that I just wanted to ask if we have in fact taken care of what Gonzalez has requested via the votes Have we responded?  Well, smoothing through the quarterly or maybe the half-year ups and downs, it does appear that we've returned to a path of slow or moderate growth The good news about this growth is that it does appear to be generally self-sustaining, which we haven't been able to say with a great deal of confidence But after all, this growth has continued and in fact strengthened in the second half of this year despite floods, drought, tax increases, defense downsizing, restructuring, a weak international economy, and the health insurance uncertainty The economy has a lot of good things going for it We have low interest rates; we're seeing pretty good business investment, which is giving us the spending, obviously, but also a productivity kick Consumers are spending; maybe it's mostly on cars and houses but they are spending Corporate profits are reasonably strong The financial sector is strong and able to assist in financing so we're not having bottlenecks of credit unavailability either in the direct financing markets or through the banking system I think it's a little ironic that we're now seeing much more acceptance of a growth rate of about 2-1/2 percent Maybe even a year or so ago we would have said that was not an acceptable growth rate for this economy compared to what we've seen in previous cycles Now, going forward, maybe this is not as acceptable as many folks would like, but I'm having a hard time seeing that we're going to move much off of that growth path And that's indeed what the Greenbook is suggesting Job growth is not strong enough to lower unemployment We're still having this question of job quality, which seems to be affecting confidence There is this question of whether or not the income growth we're seeing will be less than the increases in spending and thus whether that [spending] can be sustained We're seeing a lower saving rate And we still have the continuation of all of the [factors] we've talked about in the past that tend to slow growth the restructuring, the fiscal drag, and so on So I'm having a hard time seeing what is  -85-    11/16/93  going to move us much above this 2-1/2 or maybe 3 percent growth rate But at least it's a slow to moderate growth path  On the inflation front, we've seen continued progress on reducing inflation, albeit the rate of improvement has slowed down Labor costs don't appear to be causing pressure We've even seen some decline in unit labor costs because of the productivity increases We clearly have a ways to go on inflation, and it seems to me that the proper approach is to keep our eye on the ball here because there are pressures We're seeing some pressures, perhaps somewhat late, in the commodity prices and taxes But it seems reasonable and appropriate to me to focus on keeping the slope of the movement of inflation going downward I've been really quite heartened recently to see articles in the popular press talking about how [a firm] can survive when it can't increase prices And there has been a lot of discussion around the table about not being able to increase prices So I'd hope that we would continue to focus on keeping the [inflation] slope going downward  ""B"" symmetric "
5168,1993-12-21,PHILLIPS," Clearly, the economy is strong in the fourth quarter and on firm footing going into '94 I think the interesting thing about this is that people right now also are believing that things are better Confidence is up perhaps because the employment situation is stronger People are voting with their feet by spending, and they are borrowing to do it The Administration is saying that 3 percent growth is good and that's their projection for '94 All of this seems to be reinforcing the fact that the economy is doing well, and it's helping people to feel better about it I won't go through the list of [reasons] why the economy appears to be on a stronger footing Suffice it to say that it adds up to the assurance that this 2-1/2 year--almost [2 years and] 11 months--recovery is sustainable And the financial sector is certainly well positioned to support  -28-    12/21/93  growth I do find myself in the camp of those who believe there will be a slowdown early next year back to this 2-1/2 to 3 percent track I think there are still some head winds or drags on the economy that we have to work through the defense and other government cutbacks, the tax increase, the health care reform Hearing the comments around the table, they seem to be different in different parts of the country Most of the discussion about the health care reform has suggested that it's not going to be a net cost to the federal government and in fact it's going to reduce the deficit But I think there has not been very much attention on the cost to employers, which will serve as another tax Corporate downsizing, restructuring, and layoffs are likely to continue The employment quality effects may continue to exert their pressures The slowdowns in Europe and Japan are continued considerations  With respect to inflation, the most recent numbers are consistent with a continued deceleration of inflation but certainly the improvements are modest There are some very worrisome signs on the horizon, however, with respect to inflation the general acceptance of 3 percent as the right number, for example, by the Administration; the price of gold, which has been elevated now for quite a while; and the fact that we're likely to start hitting capacity problems as activity picks up Indeed, construction and industrial materials prices--scrap steel and lumber--are up Food prices and projections of further food price increases going into '94 began as a problem related to the floods But if we have another year of bad crops, [the effect] is going to work its way further into the food chain; we'll see it in oils and meats and so on I think the recent backup that we've seen in long-term rates is showing the deterioration in inflation expectations I'd hate to count on energy and import prices as what will hold down inflation  Well, it does seem to me that tightening is inevitable and appropriate The issue is when and in what form--with an asymmetric directive first or a direct move I certainly agree that we need to do it at a meeting So the question, then, is the timing If we do it too early, then there is a chance of derailing the recovery But I think that risk is slight If we're too late-- sort of a perennial Fed problem--we're going to be chasing [market] rates And even more of a problem is that we'd lose the confidence of the bond markets, which is crucial for growth My preference would be to go ahead and tighten now, but I'm not sure that there would be terrific damage to waiting But the time is definitely coming  My question is Do you think that allowing these folks to come and listen to this is going to resolve it?  Well, in taking this step I guess we have to think about the next steps and what might be the next things coming down the pike You raised the question of the precedent and I--  Yes I actually was not on this call so I don't really know what was said during that session I'm just trying to think about what would be the next steps If statements are taken out of context by different people, I'm wondering if this is likely to stir the pot more and in fact make it worse than standing pat  This is a difficult judgment call "
5198,1994-02-03,PHILLIPS," At least the one you wanted!  Thank you The sustainability of the recovery certainly seems considerably more assured now Leading the way are housing, autos, durables, clearly reflected in the IP index People are spending and they're dissaving to do so Inventories are lean so there probably will be no surprises on the supply side Productivity improvements can still provide opportunities for competitiveness and growth I think most encouraging has been consumer and business confidence; even the earthquake and the cold didn't provide much disruption So there is less chance that we're going to have another fading spell, and I don't think that this recovery now can be considered as fragile as it was a year ago At the same time, strong financial markets are continuing to provide financing, and banks are better positioned to contribute We are even making some progress on the debt side The risks and structural adjustments facing the economy are still there, but I think it's fair to say that no new insurmountable ones are appearing People may have gotten a bit tired, as John LaWare mentioned, of talking about corporate restructuring and defense restructuring, and the pace of balance sheet restructuring appears to have slackened On the international front, there's some glimmer that the economies of our major trading partners are beginning to bottom out, so we may see some improvement there The labor market is still showing some signs of stress due to the layoffs and re-engineering, resulting in part-time and temporary employment and downward mobility On the fiscal policy side, I think the focus on the deficit may well contain many of the new initiatives; even the health care proposals now appear to be open to negotiations So, I think there's a bit less to fear there, and there were no great surprises in the form of major new expensive initiatives in the State of the Union message  On the inflation front, the recent numbers certainly look good, particularly the PPI and the deflator, and I think the Committee should be very pleased with that Progress on the underlying rate of inflation, while it may still be feasible, certainly is going to be at  -27-    2/3-4/94  a reduced pace at best I'm a bit concerned, though, that we are likely to hit a stone wall over the next few months with respect to inflation, given the problem with the seasonals, obviously, and short- term supply distortions Many of those were mentioned around the table with respect to labor shortages and supply shortages in areas where demand is particularly strong We may well start to see commodity price increases working their way into the PPI and CPI I think that we're now seeing some major risks on the inflation front Certainly, the Greenbook acknowledged the food price increases and the risks with respect to the upcoming harvest, which Tom Melzer mentioned in particular On the energy front, it's hard for me to see that we should be depending on a cartel to keep the CPI in check And, of course, precious metals' prices have been elevated Certainly, the money numbers are difficult to read but I agree with those around the table today who mentioned that credit has picked up, so I think all of these things highlight the risk we now see on the inflation front  I actually had two questions When are the 1988 transcripts to be released?  I feel like I'm in a tennis match here!  So it's not next week that these are coming out?  It's probably going to be at least a month or so?  I wanted to ask Joan, or Bill from your former capacity, what do you think the market reaction would be?  Is this going to be helpful, do you think, or not helpful in terms of the market absorbing what is occurring?  Well, I do have a preference to tighten 1/2 point immediately It's probably too strong to say that a 1/4 point move is following the market but a good deal of that is already built into the market I do think that because of the cyclical influences a 1/4 point move won't have as much effect I don't see anything on the horizon that would warrant an asymmetric directive Now, having said  -53-    2/3-4/94  that, I will say that I can live with a 1/4 point on the ""Fed on hold"" theory and the expectation of more to come  I would keep the ranges where they are and not publish the 1995 forecasts "
5217,1994-02-28,PHILLIPS," Mike, I was just meeting with a group of bankers from the state of Kentucky and one thing that they mentioned was that people who could not make it to work could claim unemployment insurance Is that right? "
5238,1994-03-22,PHILLIPS," Thank you There has been a lot of discussion about where we are right now with respect to the real economy It does appear, no matter how we measure things and how January and February actually come in, that the economic strength is broad-based And as part of that strength, we are seeing strong productivity improvement, which really bodes very well for strength in housing and in household spending Certainly, the labor markets are a bit difficult to read right now given the changes in the survey method But even with that difficulty, it does appear that there is some improvement in the labor markets We are even getting some improvement with respect to the deficit There hasn't been much discussion of the deficit recently; in fact, I don't think anybody has even mentioned it today but that's something one should chalk up in the positive column Moreover, the capability for financing growth seems to be continuing to strengthen Certainly, there is uncertainty  -35-    3/22/94  in the secondary markets, both the bond and the stock markets, but the overall cost of capital remains relatively low Banks are in a strong position to finance further expansion  In terms of the outlook, I certainly can't disagree with the notion that whether we characterize this as an expansion or a recovery, it is sustainable and it may well be at or above potential Perhaps somewhat like Mike Kelley, I've been asking myself whether or not this is a picture that's too good to be true I do think that there are some checks on potential runaway growth Maybe this is the proverbial soft landing that Mike Prell referred to Re-engineering is definitely entrenched in corporate culture The focus is on cost savings and improved productivity There is a flip side, of course, with respect to job quality Even though we are seeing job growth, the question remains as to what kind of quality there is So in a sense that is a check on growth We have a low saving rate; Larry Lindsey has spoken about that recently I have a hard time believing that current household consumption levels can remain at the same rate given the income growth rates that we have seen recently There is a continued international drag; with our trading partners being weaker, we are certainly the ones that are leading this growth  With respect to inflation, certainly the recent history is excellent, but again we have to focus on the future It's hard to know when there is a problem with respect to when are we shifting from disinflation to either a flattening or an increasing trend Certainly we can look to some of the underlying price series, including commodity prices While commodity price run-ups are not sufficient to cause CPI increases, they would be necessary So, while the increases we are seeing may not work their way into the CPI eventually, I certainly think it's a signal that should put us on alert There are some vulnerabilities with respect to future price movements Low crop carryovers this spring make food prices quite vulnerable to whatever is experienced with respect to the 1994 harvest Oil prices have been obviously benign They have been the very thing that has kept our recent inflation performance very good I guess I have a healthy skepticism Maybe I stood in some of those oil lines too long to be comfortable with declining oil prices We are still not sure how the health care reform movement is going to shake out The economy has been running ahead of potential, and if it continues at that same pace, eventually at some point we are going to see price pressures We already are hearing some anecdotal discussions of bottlenecks and supply shortages So I think there are some vulnerabilities even though price increases haven't yet shown up in the inflation statistics  In terms of assessing the risks to the economy, I guess I come to the conclusion--and maybe it's because I've spent a lot of my life in the markets--that perhaps the markets themselves may be one of the sources of vulnerability I think they are undergoing a great deal of sorting out right now Market adjustments are not instantaneous, though if everybody heads for the door at the same time, we could get a massive movement But given the very complicated sets of portfolios now in markets--and I don't mean just hedge funds or pension funds or financial institutions, but portfolios throughout even the manufacturing sector--I think the price movements that one can get as interest rates change may be somewhat exacerbated when it occurs The steepness of the yield curve in fact may be exacerbating  -36-    3/22/94  the problem We were going through a shift in expectations with long rates coming down; maybe the decline overshot last fall; I don't know that we are ever going to know that fully But the process was under way last fall and long rates were shifting down When the Fed tightened, to use a bad analogy, that threw a monkey wrench into the gears of the market system and participants are having figure it out and work out a new direction Part of the problem is that it is not clear what unwinding of portfolios and adjustments are being made Sometimes we get mixed signals because portfolio positions are very, very complicated The markets themselves I think are certainly a reflection of this changing, shifting portfolio adjustment process that is occurring This whole process is compounded by other kinds of uncertainties, domestic/political uncertainties, Korea, potential trade wars with Japan and China, and trading partner weaknesses For me the bottom line is that the markets don't need any more uncertainty with which to deal So whatever we do, we shouldn't let the markets get in the way of economic recovery or expansion, however we characterize it  I certainly think it's appropriate to tighten For me the question is how to get there as fast as possible but without causing disruption in the markets It seems important to me that the Fed not add to the uncertainty So for that reason, I can certainly go along with 1/4 point increases But I'd underline your suggestion of emphasizing in some very constructive way when we are finished the tightening process We do not want to get into a precedent-setting mode because I think when we were easing it was important to be able to do it at the right time So I would prefer not to establish a precedent of just taking action at meetings I'm not sure what asymmetric language adds To me it may well increase the uncertainty So, I'd be more inclined not to have asymmetric language  That probably will cause problems in the markets  Can I ask Is there an auction today? Are we talking about announcing today?  The auction is over Okay, I'd announce "
5291,1994-05-17,PHILLIPS," Thank you It appears that the strength of the expansion is deeper and wider than we have seen previously, based on some of the comments made here today This is partially due I suspect to job creation and acceptance by employees of moves to different jobs--thus more churning in the labor market Confidence continues to be reasonably strong both on the business side and on the consumer side even in the face of a slowdown in the first-quarter GDP Credit demand has increased and the US economy appears to be adapting better to changes than our competitors--such changes as technology, labor conditions, balance sheet adjustments, and so on I find myself with an analysis very similar to Mike Kelley's and John LaWare's in that I see this strength as sustainable and don't see a runaway growth outlook We still have an environment of re- engineering and emphasis on cost savings and productivity This question of job quality I think is continuing to put pressure on income levels generally We're also not through the downsizing of the defense industry The deficit is going to continue to limit fiscal policy initiatives The low saving rate that we have seen I think is going to limit long-term investment opportunities The capital market volatility and stock and bond price declines do increase the cost of capital The volatility itself raises the cost of capital, and the wealth effects that are felt by individuals may start to be seen in reduced consumption and investment  On the inflation front, as we've heard in some discussion around the table, the recent history is quite good I do think that there are vulnerabilities, for example in commodity prices including oil And although farmers are optimistic at planting time, that's when they're the most optimistic That seems to be a universal truth in the ag community But we do have low carryovers, so this is a fragile time going into this planting season  One thing that hasn't been mentioned as much was the faster increases in the producer price index in the first quarter of this year Although the April report was better, the index is still up about 9 percent on an annual basis for 1994 We still have health costs as an uncertainty, and the strength of the economy generally I think is increasing the chances that inflation could start to heat up  I think both the appearance and the actuality of the stronger economy coupled with the realization that there are checks on this growth are feeding some of the uncertainty that is reflected in the wide range of forecasts for GDP, inflation, capacity constraints, and interest rates We see a little more diversity of opinion than we ordinarily do on the forecast front, and this is feeding into the capital markets They remain volatile and fragile I think we're still facing a continuation of the sorting out process that was begun in February At that time many people were on the same side of the  -28-    5/17/94  market and positioned for more of the same--slow growth, with long- term interest rates expected to come down, and inflation expected to be under control So when the jolts hit the market we saw more of an effect than might have been anticipated Those jolts, of course, were precipitated by the initial Fed tightening but also were supported by reports of stronger growth more generally People were having to fully assess whether or not real rates should be higher Then, of course, we have domestic political uncertainties, Japanese trade pressures, China, Korea, one can go on  Traders also have very short time horizons and they tend to think in terms of up or down, and neutral was really throwing them a curve That, I think, enhanced the uncertainty in the markets This portfolio unwinding that we've been going through is not an instantaneous process because the portfolios are complex We also are faced with internal firm risk management constraints The markets are efficient but they're not complete As Bill McDonough mentioned, there has to be a searching for hedge opportunities as people seek to unwind We have seen some market liquidity constraints as near substitutes have been sought and traders are trying to reduce exposures  In sum, I don't think the turmoil is over And in terms of the risks generally, while some people seem to think that they are more on the up side, I see some countervailing forces to those upside risks that are feeding the fragility and the uncertainty  I also support your recommendation It seems to me that it is appropriate to go ahead and make our statement in the market, and I think this proposal would do so When we started this series of moves of 25 basis points, we talked about the notion that  -36-    5/17/94  when we think the series of moves should come to an end we should so signal I don't think--  Right, right  I don't know whether we're at neutrality or not There is an argument that we may well be at neutrality because we may be getting more of a kick from our tightening actions as a result of the increase in long-term rates So, in any case, I support your recommendation "
5315,1994-07-05,PHILLIPS," I have one I'm not sure this is quite the right place In the Greenbook, there was a discussion or intimation that we are starting to see more inflows into bond funds and stock funds Could you comment a little more on that? Maybe that should be addressed to you, Don, I don't know  What about money market mutual funds?  Thank you  Thank you, Mr Chairman While the expansion appears to be continuing, the question is at what pace, and we all seem to be struggling with this question as to whether we are below, at, or above capacity On the supply side, how much slack is left in the labor and product markets? Even if we had good historical measurements of aggregate capacity and slack, I wonder to what extent we could use these to estimate the future In the area of labor markets, I felt more uncertainty around the table than usual The staff estimate for the current quarter is 63 percent unemployment when the current rate is at 6 percent, and Mike Prell suggested that we were uncomfortably close to being analytically blind at this point I thought he gave a pretty good description of some of the concerns with the labor market information A number of folks are re- estimating the NAIRU, and the announced values that they're coming up with vary all over the lot I think we are experiencing significantly different labor conditions in different parts of the country At least for me, that's one of the explanations as to why there is so much uncertainty This raises questions about labor mobility between regions or perhaps labor mobility just with respect to certain professions We are hearing certainly of spot labor shortages, and a couple areas were mentioned I do think that this re-engineering that we have talked about over the last several months may be changing the equation and causing a bit more churning And just because somebody has a job, they may well be looking for a better job So I think that that is fogging the numbers somewhat  On the price side, the most consistent story, it seems to me, is that while there are pressures in the basic commodities, competition is constraining final goods prices But even this story may not hold up for too long if capacity utilization continues to be strained For me, it's very hard to ignore the sustained price increases in 1994 for many of the basic commodities Certainly, there are ways to deal with price increases in commodities that continue for a short period of time If these increases are sustained for a longer period of time, that's going to be more of a problem On the demand side, we have heard and are seeing evidence of some slowing in  -35-    7/5-6/94  spending, but the question again is whether we will overshoot, achieve, or undershoot that elusive soft landing  I haven't heard quite as much discussion of the financial markets today; maybe everybody was exhausted after the exchange rate discussion I think that the markets have survived significant turmoil beginning with the Fed tightening in February After that tightening, markets have been hit with international uncertainties, foreign exchange crises, and domestic political crises But overall, the market performance, I think, has been quite good We have had no major US casualties; money has moved; we do not have gridlock The market capacity improvements and the safety nets that have been put into place in the last couple of years seem to have worked Bank internal risk management models appear to have worked The contraction of exposure has been fairly orderly as we have gone through significant market moves Bank credit has expanded I think we have weathered that road quite well I didn't want a fair amount of this turmoil to go unnoticed just because we are not seeing headlines about problems in financial markets and institutions The markets seem to be a bit more settled I question the strength of inflows to mutual funds, but at least we are not seeing massive outflows from some of these markets The stock market is certainly down for the year but it has moved sideways for the last three months We may still have some volatility concerns about the bond market, although this is less likely to cause political concerns because the bond markets affect individuals less directly  In sum, this is what Ed Boehne called a transition period and whenever we are at a change in a business cycle, we are likely to get a fair amount of conflicting data and mixed views And since we seem to have more than the usual amount of conflicting data and opinions, I am going to assume that we have found the turning point At best, we have the soft landing and maybe this is as good as it gets as Larry Lindsey mentioned The key at this point is not to make a mistake and end up with too much inflation or in a recession I do think that the tough part is going to be to hold on to the gains that we have made against inflation and, in fact, to make some progress toward achieving price stability Unfortunately, I think that the going will get tougher, with more tightening from this point on We may well be going onto slick pavement as we travel forward  I would leave unchanged the ranges for M2 and M3 for 1994 and 1995 Again, I think that any change would imply more than we know and exaggerate their importance If the aggregates were performing properly, they would already be set appropriately for sustainable growth, so I don't see any case for moving them With respect to debt, I can go along with a change in the range, although I don't feel strongly about it Like Bob Forrestal, I think that if we believe there is a good reason for doing it, we ought to go ahead and change it, and 5 percent seems a better center point for the range  With respect to 1996 forecasts, I agree that more disclosure is better I also think that if we are going to disclose more, we ought to disclose more but better things, and I am not sure that the numbers for 1996 would necessarily provide better information So, I'd prefer more of a description of direction or even goals I know for myself that when I sit down to do those projections and I look 2- 1/2 years out, I just don't think that the numbers for 1996 represent quality disclosure; it's quantity but not quality So, I think we would do better with some description  Well, based on what we know now, I think that we will have to tighten more at some point I really don't see the case now for 1/4 point moves, so when we do move I think it should be 1/2 point I don't think our moves should be prompted by foreign exchange situations, against the yen specifically I can go along with a pause for now, which would be the ""B"" alternative I am becoming increasingly skeptical of asymmetric directives, I guess partially because it seems the definition always changes as to what asymmetry is, depending on the circumstances So, I worry a bit that we are injecting more uncertainty into the market by leaving open the possibility of moves Having said that, I do think it's becoming increasingly clear that we will have to move on the tightening side So, while I prefer symmetry, I probably would not vote against asymmetry I think that a short announcement at this point would be appropriate I would like to get to the final decision on what our  -77-    7/5-6/94  policy is on announcements because I think it is probably appropriate that we adopt this approach of using a few sentences But since we have not established a policy at this point, I'd go with a terse announcement just to get us past this period "
5354,1994-08-16,PHILLIPS," Diversify  With respect to the real economy, I may be in a position similar to Jerry Jordan's It does seem to me that we are moving into cycle maturity In many ways, the economy's performance is about as good as it gets; the economy seems to be hitting on all fours The growth in the last four quarters has been above potential We have had upward revisions for the last two quarters, and this is despite an earthquake, blizzards, and now floods and fire So we have had plenty of natural disasters We are at low unemployment, perhaps at the NAIRU if it really exists If it exists, we are there With respect to inflation, the recent experience clearly has been good If growth is close to potential, then it's feasible for us to stay within a 3 percent CPI  I thought I might talk a little about the financial markets; they haven't been mentioned quite as much today The markets have been buffeted significantly this year The stock market, I'd have to say at this point, is showing a great deal of resilience We clearly are off the January highs, but we are not in the state of fragility that we experienced earlier in the year There has been significant portfolio adjustment, so I think that people are lined up on both sides of the market now We are not seeing everybody lined up on one side of the market, which I think was the situation at the beginning of the year The bond market has withstood considerable volatility, and I think one of the significant things there is that we haven't had any major accidents I think that a number of the players have learned how to operate in some of these changed environments Currency markets also have withstood significant volatility, although I'm not sure that all the players have learned as much as there might be to learn in the currency area Banks are aggressively financing the expansion  There are some signs that the expansion could continue for quite a while In spite of the recent runups in inventories, we are still hearing that businesses went into this last quarter in a planned position, and many are talking about adding to inventories We are seeing continued strength in business investment The order books are showing considerable depth We are finally getting enough confidence in the business sector to see significant additions to payroll Even on the construction side, although we are seeing some slowdown in housing, nonresidential is taking up some of the slack Earnings are holding up significantly and that, of course, is helping to keep the stock market fairly resilient We may even start to see exports contribute a little more to GDP growth On the household side, I do agree that expenditures are likely to level off somewhat Even so, we are seeing credit use up, and with employment up, that is likely to keep consumption levels respectable or at least close to potential  -22-    8/16/94  It seems to me that the risks at this point are on the up side We could be understating the strength in the economy I agree that there are still some downside risks and they certainly exist in some parts of the country, but they appear to be outweighted by the upside risks  The pundits, kibitzers, and Fed watchers seem to suggest that the Fed really doesn't need to worry about inflation because it's mild--3 percent--and it's not increasing, although many of the forecasters are now at least starting to show some increase beyond 1994 But all that means is that the Fed is either at the curve or maybe ahead of the curve There are, I think, some worrisome signs on the inflation front We have heard a lot of stories around the table today about businesses now being able to pass on price increases We have seen strong increases in the producer price index for intermediate materials for the last four quarters The core CPI for the second quarter actually edged up to 31 percent, although the overall CPI has been flat thus far in 1994 So at best, we are stalled out on inflation and we are starting to see oil price increases work their way into the system I continue to suggest that a 3 percent level of inflation, even if you make the adjustments for the errors in CPI measurement, still does constitute a form of tax and something that we should continue to be concerned about I think that one of the reasons that we have been able to see inflation stall out at this point is productivity increases This has been one of the major factors that has kept wage increases from infecting the CPI, but that depends on a continuation of this supposed new trajectory for productivity increases that we have seen in the 1990s So, if the productivity increases are not continued, that will be another pressure that we will start to see on inflation In sum, I think that the economy is doing quite well We have a chance for this to be a continued expansion but it is putting pressure on inflation  I also support the package If we were to delay, I think it would be a roll of the dice, because I don't think there would be any new information that would be coming in over the near term that would make a difference The economy is moving fast enough that I think we are in ""drive,"" not ""neutral,"" right now There is a chance that a 50 basis point move could sideline us for a while and it may in fact be enough I don't think we know I think that your wording does capture that There is a possibility of being sidelined, that our next move may be next spring and may even be an easing move I just don't think we know "
5379,1994-09-27,PHILLIPS," I guess I am left to bat clean-up in an era of a baseball strike, and I'm not quite sure where that leaves me! The economy clearly is going into the fourth year of this upturn and the third year with above-potential GDP growth As Governor Blinder just described, we are seeing a lot of the strength in manufacturing of consumer durables and in business investment, especially equipment spending The labor markets appear very strong Job generation has totaled over 3 million jobs this past year Housing activity clearly has slowed The question is more on the consumer side We appear to be seeing some slowdown there As we have heard around the table, there is some disagreement regarding the extent of the slowdown, where it is and so on Part of this may be that consumers have worked through the bulge in their pent-up demands following the recession and also have worked through the housing bulge when people buy lots of consumer durables following their housing purchases I think most people would suspect that we should be seeing some slowdown I was a little surprised to see the discussions of a potential Christmas spree spending now being reported The international picture should be strengthening and at least not be a drag on the economy I certainly recognize that this is not a large part of the US economy because we have such a large domestic economy Nevertheless, looking at these various pressures, it's a bit hard to escape the conclusion that most of the slack in labor and product markets is used up, and we are starting to see the effects on the price side I think we are beyond the point of a preemptive strike Barron's yesterday was even talking about urging people to dig back into their closets and find their ""Win"" buttons [Laughter]  Then you are well prepared I think some of the numbers that have already been cited here recognize that we are seeing some show-through of price pressures even in the CPI, particularly in the last couple of months We have all been citing producer price pressures in the last few months, and there are lots of good statistics to quote with respect to producer prices and also commodity prices While much of the pressure on commodity prices has not shown through to final consumption prices, it would nevertheless be a danger signal if commodity and other producer prices stayed at elevated levels for a sustained period of time I think it is interesting that the argument on inflation now appears to have shifted  -33-    9/27/94  somewhat There appears to be fairly broad acknowledgement that we are seeing more price increases The question now appears to be whether the increase is permanent or a short-term cyclical blip Maybe because Bob Forrestal went first today, he was the first to surface this argument But I quote Gary Stern's stern warning about the problems of identifying whether it is a blip or whether it is more incipient or creeping price increases, something that's likely to infect the CPI for the long term and in fact move on into the wage sector  Turning to the financial market side, the stock markets, I think, have shown quite amazing resilience in light of the interest rate increases Stock prices are being sustained, I think, by earnings at this point, so we are getting a healthier relationship between prices and earnings Bond markets are certainly nervous, and I think this is well demonstrated by Peter Fisher's art work in his charts, but it's not the wild roller coaster that we saw in the first part of this year, at least for the United States Bank credit markets are showing significant strength So, when all is said and done and perhaps with a mild caveat for mortgage markets, the capital markets are producing a cost of capital that is clearly supportive of investment and expansion  Now, while all of these signs for the economy appear very strong and the recent revisions have been upward as is certainly well documented in the Greenbook, I think there are some clouds on the horizon--the so-called downside risks We have already talked about the spending slowdowns We still have some pressures in the labor markets on account of the whole re-engineering story We have defense and other sources of fiscal restraint and the continuing need to address whether the deficit is going to be coming back into play, particularly for the out years Much of the strength that we have seen, I think, is dependent on productivity gains, and it's questionable as to whether or not we are going to continue on the 1990s trajectory for productivity or whether we will revert to the 1980s trajectory Balance sheet strains could reemerge following the strong credit growth and the merger and acquisition activity that we are seeing Finally, I'd mention the monetary aggregates It's hard to believe that the weakness that we are seeing in the monetary aggregates is not going to have some effect On balance, I think the outlook looks good, but there are downside risks  I think a tightening probably is going to be necessary at some point, but again the question is when I do give credence to this question of credibility, and it seems to me that the evidence is not persuasive that we need to move now I prefer to give the tightening that's in the pipeline a chance; again, I'd cite the monetary aggregates So, I agree with alternative B and being prepared to move On balance, I'm not enamored with asymmetry, but I think the chances of tightening in the intermeeting period are more likely So, I'd support that "
5405,1994-11-15,PHILLIPS," Thank you The momentum of the real economy certainly seems to be stronger in all sectors than was anticipated earlier I think that the revisions we have seen recently in a number of forecasts and, for example, the recent benchmark revision in the employment level, demonstrate that there was more momentum than we earlier thought This may well carry the economy forward at an even stronger pace than we had anticipated It is carrying forward into consumer confidence All of the spending indicators are showing considerable strength, even housing We would have expected more of a downturn than we have seen in the interest-sensitive parts of the economy The outlook in industrial production is for continued strength Autos and light trucks alone probably will sustain us for a while The real economy is showing more strength than we had predicted a couple of meetings ago; essentially, the second-half slowdown that was anticipated never occurred  Turning to the financial markets, I think that they generally are functioning quite well; the currency markets may be a bit hard to read We should look to some of the lessons that the financial markets are trying to suggest to us Even though the lecturing that we are getting is coming from 35-year olds, these 35-year olds still are voting with dollars I think that there is something to be learned there The markets are not as volatile as they were earlier in the year There is more depth There are more varied expectations on market direction and financing needs Some people have expressed disappointment in the stock market, but we may well look back on this  -27-    11/15/94  in coming years as being one of the most orderly corrections that we have seen in quite a while The cost of capital has increased, both for equity and debt financing But it does not appear to be inhibiting investment either by households or in the business sector Banks are now providing capital that earlier was being provided directly by the stock and the bond markets It seems to me that we have had a relatively smooth transition from credit crunch to the direct issue market and to bank financing The financial markets generally are functioning quite well The fact that we haven't had a major accident, I think, is significant  On the inflation side, some people have suggested that we are getting closer to the point where we should see more increases in final consumer prices But in fact, we have seen increased pressure in the CPI for the third quarter We are well above a 3 percent rate at current levels, and I would hope that our goals would be better than 3 percent I'd associate myself with Al Broaddus' comments about starting to look at some kind of monitoring range for inflation, particularly one with a long-term outlook I think that we are not giving as clear signals as we might with respect to what we think inflation should be I guess I'm getting a little tired of seeing all these analysts say that inflation is under control when in fact it is above 3 percent  In sum, I think that some of the previous uncertainties that we saw in the economy appear to have been resolved in favor of economic strength Productivity increases have resumed The markets have been reasonably steady The elections are over except for the State of Maryland We still do have some downside risks Health insurance still is going to be an uncertainty I suspect the solutions are likely to change now, but the problem is still there The new Congress may yet create unimagined new challenges for us I think we are going to have to start factoring in such things as tax cuts and perhaps increases in defense spending What is this going to be doing for the Federal deficit? The monetary aggregates remain surprisingly weak, so I count this as one of the remaining uncertainties I hope that productivity, efficient capacity use or even more capacity will permit higher growth with no inflation, but I think that's fairly wishful thinking Perhaps the NAIRU is lower than we had thought, but again that may well be wishful thinking On balance, the risk seems to be for continued economic momentum at least in the near term I think we'll see inflation pressures increasingly evident  I don't know whether or not 150 basis points is ultimately needed It seems to me that that is fairly large, particularly in view of the monetary aggregates I wouldn't want to prejudge I do support 75 basis points, symmetric It strikes me that 50 is not enough I think the markets would be immediately looking for the next move, and we would be in that treadmill situation A move of 100 basis points would be too much of a jolt I do think we have to be alert to the question that has been raised  -39-    11/15/94  about how much tightening is left in the pipeline and alert to the potential effects of the tightening in the pipeline But we also have to be alert to the possibility that if momentum is greater than we thought, that pipeline may be getting flooded out  I resisted analogies in my original comments, but I couldn't this time around! "
5430,1994-12-20,PHILLIPS," You mentioned that the markets were thinner at the year-end than they usually are Would you expand on that?  Is this causing more discounting of the Orange County paper than you might ordinarily expect if they had been selling that paper at another time of year?  Thank you  Thank you Our discussion has demonstrated the depth and the breadth and the resilience of the economy These are terms that we usually use for market conditions, but we could certainly apply them to this expansion period We are closing in now on four years of economic expansion Growth in three of those years is now indicated to have been above potential in most parts of the country It almost seems that Orange County is the only place that does not appear to be participating A key question is similar to the one that Governor Kelley just posed; that is, when are we going to see stronger signs of a slowdown? So far we are hearing and seeing significant signs of momentum going into 1995 I do think that the monetary stimulus that extended from 1989 through the first part of 1994 is causing a good deal of the momentum, and I don't think we need to put too fine a point on it Within that period we had 15 months of a 3 percent federal funds rate that certainly has had an influence I do think that the so-called head winds died down sometime in 1993 People became more comfortable with their balance sheets, and the monetary policy ease started to show through significantly into the economic system As other people have said, these restructuring head winds are now becoming tail winds We are now reaping the benefits of the earlier balance sheet restructuring which is providing a lot of cash for both businesses and households to spend Whereas we did have a credit crunch in the banking sector, now we are seeing significant willingness by banks to lend to both households and businesses Both business investment and construction spending, which had been a drag  -25-    12/20/94  on the economy, are now starting to contribute significantly to the expansion  Well, at some point it must stop I think that forecasters have plenty of room to be humble as we end 1994 It is at least feasible that consumers could slam on the brakes early next year--when they balance their checkbooks when they really start to assess how much debt they have taken on Maybe it will happen when they get the latest repricing of their ARMs or when the wealth effects start to hit as they get their year-end mutual fund statements I think people are beginning to realize that the paycheck increases are not as great as they have seen in the past We may not have the strong year-end bonuses in some areas that we have seen in past years In short, I think that the party for consumers is going to be over, but it is not clear how far the current momentum is going to carry us forward from here  On the business side, I think that the tail winds actually may be a bit stronger because of the productivity kick that we are getting from re-engineering and technology investment Eventually, monetary policy will start to bite harder as this pipeline effect works its way through the economy We have been given breathing space with respect to final consumer price increases We may have been saved by the bumper grain crop that we have seen this year Energy prices backed off We have had a mild autumn Ironically, the labor market is giving us some mixed signals There has been a lot of discussion around the table today about labor shortages, but also discussion of the fact that we are not seeing big pressures in wage markets Jerry Jordan talked about some of the temporary measures that are being taken to try to deal with these labor shortages that do not affect the permanent wage structure I think that despite the fact that we have a 56 percent unemployment rate, there is still some considerable unrest in the labor markets People have jobs, but they don't necessarily have the jobs that they want or that they like Except in some skilled areas there may be more flexibility in the labor market than we had thought I believe there is a willingness now to move and change careers, and this willingness will be helpful in containing wage pressures as we move forward And certainly on the benefits side, the health cost containment efforts have been helpful  In sum, as we move into 1995 I, too, think we are going to get a slowdown, but the question is when and how much On the fiscal side, I'm not as confident as Larry Lindsey in making predictions It seems to me that everything is on the table in the Congress In this contest of wills that we are about to see, I hope that the loser is not deficit reduction  On the market side, the financial markets really have performed quite well given all of the shocks that we have experienced in 1994, but I think there is more yet to come We have seen quite an orderly correction this year, but there may yet be some fallout Joan Lovett and, of course, Bob Parry talked at length about Orange County I don't think we have seen all of that play out I don't think we have yet seen all of the implications of the Bankers Trust situation play out When people get their year-end mark-to-market statements on their mutual funds, there may well be some surprises I think many of the counties may still be trying to figure out exactly where they stand So there may well be some shocks coming in 1995 The point of  -26-    12/20/94  that, of course, is that there is considerable uncertainty as we go into 1995  I also would support ""B"" asymmetric I think that we have more tightening to go, but I'm willing to wait until early next year As a general matter, I agree with Governor Kelley-- if you are going to do it, earlier is better But I think we have been given some breathing room with the favorable CPI numbers It would be useful to let us get past the end of the year and the year- end marking-to-market That allows the markets a chance to settle out Ultimately, I think that more tightening is going to be necessary With all of the market and monetary restructuring that has taken place, it is probably going to take larger swings in interest rates to achieve monetary goals It is very difficult to generalize from past experience when the pipeline is going to kick in fully I would like to see us give serious consideration to the longer-term inflation targeting approach that a number of people have spoken about; Tom Melzer started off the discussion of it today But for today, I think ""B"" asymmetric will serve us well "
5459,1995-01-13,PHILLIPS, How will you know how far to extend the swap line? 
5484,1995-01-31,PHILLIPS," I agree that it is appropriate to make announcements of policy changes, and when there are no changes to continue to indicate that meetings have ended With respect to the statements, I think that, as a general matter, making them as short as possible is probably the best rule of thumb We always have to leave open the ability to communicate what needs to be communicated, and I think that should be left to the Chairman's discretion If he has a draft statement that he feels matches the gist of the discussion, I think it would be useful for that to be read But I would hate to see that built in as a requirement because I do think that the Chairman needs to have some discretion in terms of wording the final statement  Before we do that, may I ask a question? A lot of times we have briefings where one of us or a member of the staff presents information and we ask questions Is this the kind of thing that you would contemplate not taping?  I was thinking about legislative matters such as what is happening on the Hill, those kinds of discussions?  Okay  We all come at this in slightly different ways I do think it is important for any government entity or quasi- government entity, however we are classified, to communicate its long- term goals--which are not unlike a mission statement that any kind of entity would have Inflation is probably the area where we have the most control in the long run I do not think that we have as much control in the area of employment in the long run, given fiscal policy and other effects It seems important to me for us to state clearly that our long-run goal is to control inflation Now, I certainly recognize, and I think Ed Boehne stated very clearly, that we operate in the real world and we have to take into account certain short-run issues, be they business cycle issues or liquidity issues, whatever But it seems to me that if we make monetary policy decisions in the context of a long-term goal that we are then still being true to our mission  If I look back at the period when we were easing, one of the things that I looked at, and I think a lot of people around the table looked at, was the kind of progress we were making on inflation Even while we were easing, we were still looking at the fundamentals of price movements to see whether or not we would be doing some kind of damage to our ultimate objective of price stability I come down on the importance of expressing clearly that control of inflation is our major goal It is clear that we do not have it as a mandate now So, what do we do in the interim? Even in the existing Humphrey-Hawkins reports, I think we could start to be more explicit about looking at perhaps a range of inflation measures We could look at it as a monitoring goal somewhat like the way we look at the monetary aggregates Obviously, the Congress ultimately is going to have something to say about it, but it seems to me that if we take the initiative to start working in this area, we would be more in the driver's seat than simply reacting to a piece of legislation that comes forward Unless we have a specific proposal before us, it certainly is difficult to say, yes, I would be for this or against that But as a general matter, I think that it would be important for us to communicate that we want to control inflation, with price stability as our long-term goal  Thank you I think that the impressive national growth that we have been talking about around the table today is showing a few tentative signs of abating I would cite spending that is off its highs We talked about the inventory buildup in the fourth quarter and a flattened yield curve--inverted or humped at times But even if growth does abate, I do not think it is likely to do so by much, at least not very soon Business investment is continuing Fourth-quarter profits are strong enough to finance continued investment The returns on investments are still greater than the cost of capital Business has a continued commitment to improve productivity in a competitive economic environment Just as we are seeing some slowdown reported in the housing area, commercial construction is now recovering and helping to take up some of that slack from housing But even housing is stronger than might have been expected With employment at fairly lofty levels, it is likely we will continue to see consumer spending maintained, albeit possibly at a reduced but still quite respectable pace The banking system is quite strong and can certainly support expansion While the financial markets generally have moved sideways in 1994 and thus are not as supportive of direct financing, I think we are past at least some of the uncertainties in financial markets, and that is likely to be less of a risk The uncertainties I am referring to are Orange County and Bankers Trust Mexico certainly is still a factor, but so far that appears to be contained or focused on the foreign exchange markets If Congress actually continues to concentrate on deficit reduction, that too should provide support for the markets In my view all of these factors provide an environment for the continued momentum that we saw coming out of 1994  It seems to me that there may be a different way of stating whether or not we are at the cyclical turning point Since the economy is operating at or above capacity, we have to ask ourselves why we are not seeing increases in producer or CPI prices How long  -96-    1/31-2/1/95  can the economy actually operate above capacity without price increases? There are a lot of explanations for why it seemingly is operating above capacity Maybe we do not have the correct capacity measures The 85 percent capacity that everybody cites may no longer be applicable in view of the re-engineering and the improved computer and information systems In any case, firms are adding to capacity There has been some discussion today about whether we have the NAIRU right at 6 percent or whether it is plus or minus 1/2 percentage point from that level, and whether or not the unemployment rate at 54 percent actually implies that workers are more willing to move I think that there is some evidence to support the notion that there is more flexibility in the labor market than a 54 percent unemployment rate might imply One can look at the number of involuntary part-time workers and the seemingly higher losses in permanent jobs The ECI has shown little wage pressure, implying that people are concerned about their jobs The discontent of the American electorate certainly is being well argued at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue Over the longer term, average real wages have fallen There is continued uncertainty about downsizing I do not think that any of these explanations is particularly satisfying, and all of us could mount a pretty good argument against any one of them But we clearly seem to be at a stage of testing the confidence distributions around the estimates of capacity, both the NAIRU and the production capacity level of 85 percent And while we are in the range of testing these capacity levels, we clearly are in the inflation danger zone  He took your ""who cares"" seriously!  I also support the recommendation I think matters would actually be worse if we delayed in anticipation of a resolution of Mexico's problems In spite of the recent announcements, that situation is likely to be uncertain for quite a while It is quite conceivable that this tightening move may be all that is needed But in view of the strength of the economy, it seems to me that the risk of overshooting is minimal  My question is not meant to reflect on these two propositions because I actually agree with them But what would happen if the Fed did not go along either with the increase to $6 billion or the warehousing? Is the Treasury contemplating covering it and going elsewhere for their warehousing? What would be the mechanics? "
5502,1995-03-10,PHILLIPS," I join Governor Kelley I hate seeing us go in modestly and not be successful I don't think that helps us It seems to me that if we go in modestly and there is a chance that we are going to back it up with monetary policy, then we are at least going in with a chance of some success I don't see us doing that, at least in the next week or so "
5523,1995-03-28,PHILLIPS," Thank you In December I thought a slowdown was likely, or feasible, and the evidence is now becoming a bit more definite that we are seeing that slowdown I think everybody has been pretty consistent in citing housing and retail sales--autos and durables in particular--as the weakening areas I guess consumers are  -33-    3/28/95  finally feeling the stress of higher interest rates as their ARMs were repriced and as they took on increased amounts of consumer debt last year With wage increases flattening out, taking on additional leverage to spend is not as advantageous Like several others around the table, I also would like to argue that in spite of the fact that we are seeing a slowdown, I think it is likely to be quite mild Employment at fairly lofty levels implies that aggregate income will continue to support consumption Also, we don't have any very significant balance sheet strains at the household level  On the business side, I think the climate remains favorable for continued investment at least in the near term We are carrying forward considerable momentum from 1994 With this kind of business investment, we are going to have significant lead times on projects, and that leaves a fair amount of expenditures in the pipeline The cost of capital in the aggregate is still relatively low Business commitments to cost control and increased productivity do imply additional capital expenditures, although I would admit that the impulse of those expenditures is mitigated by the fact that we are seeing falling computer prices Nevertheless, corporate profits and cash flows are stronger than expected and this can support additional investment Balance sheets are stronger on the corporate side Again, this is supporting the opportunity for increased investment  It is possible that the slowdown will ease the strain on resource utilization, but in any case I think most people would agree that the economic slack currently is either significantly diminished or perhaps the economy is operating over capacity I continue to believe that it is difficult to interpret these capacity questions On the labor market side, it could well be that we have more flexibility than 54 percent unemployment implies, and I would cite the increased use of temporaries I think the reengineering process has left people employed but willing to relocate if better opportunities come up For various reasons, perhaps including benefits, people are not moving to seek new employment in the same patterns as in the past On the manufacturing capacity side, there have been several examples around the table today of capacity being added Technology, I think, is making it very difficult to ascertain whether our old levels of capacity are even as relevant anymore Thus, with respect to resource utilization, although both product and labor markets are fairly taut, those data are difficult to assess  On the inflation front, there has been considerable progress both in the numbers and the psychology, but we are continuing to see pressure at the commodity and intermediate materials levels We have forecast a slight uptick in the CPI for 1995 But the difficulty of interpreting capacity and measuring the NAIRU makes it difficult to know how close we are to building more permanent inflationary increases back into the economy Perhaps in the near term, we are not likely to see too much erosion of the progress that we have made against inflation if the expansion does slow a bit and wages stay under control But I think it would be a stretch to see much room for improvement on the inflation front under current circumstances, particularly when we take dollar depreciation into account  Given the evidence on the slowdown, I agree that ""B"" is an appropriate directive--no change I do think that it  -50-    3/28/95  is possible that additional tightening is going to be needed if we are going to resume progress on reducing inflation I have a slight preference for asymmetry toward tightening because I do think that there is some signaling value But I would not vote against symmetry "
5555,1995-05-23,PHILLIPS," In the domestic report, you indicated that a group of traders was ""priced out of the market"" What does ""priced out of the market"" mean, and how do you know they were priced out?  Do you take a survey or--  That's right [Laughter]  Thank you  The predicted slowdown is well under way It seems to be pretty widespread, led by housing and consumer durables Business investment is likely to be off in 1995 relative to 1994, but still strong enough to provide a reasonable cushion during this slowdown period It appears that only the auto manufacturers have been somewhat surprised by the slowdown and that is even more surprising, given the fact that it was probably one of the best forecast slowdowns that we have had in a long time The inventory adjustment, which may be largely an auto phenomenon, may well cause the second-quarter slowdown to be deeper than would qualify us for a perfect soft landing or a perfect ""riding off into the horizon"" at some specified altitude  The market side seems to be consistent with a sustainable growth outlook The dollar has rallied; the yield curve has flattened out rather nicely; and long-term rates have declined, partly I hope due to lowered inflation expectations But there is also a fair amount of attention being paid to the deficit reduction efforts that are under way I think that the short-term rate declines are probably reversing the overshooting that occurred when the general sentiment was that we were going to be tightening policy Stock prices generally are up this year but so are earnings, and price-earnings ratios are not dramatically out of line with historical averages Several people have cited the positive benefits of the wealth effect from both the stock market and perhaps even from the bond market I think these market adjustments, given the shocks that have occurred in the markets in the last couple of years, pretty well demonstrate the resilience of the markets Banks and other lenders appear to be able to support growth as needed, so I don't think we are looking at a bottleneck with respect to the availability of credit  On the price side, cyclical pressures clearly are showing through in the core CPI now, but I don't think we have a firm indication that this is a permanent ratcheting up We have had some easing off with respect to capacity utilization recently, both in labor and product markets It doesn't appear that, at least for the moment, wage pressures are consistently building, but I do think we need to exercise a fair amount of vigilance with respect to inflation Any time we have rising inflation, we have to be wary as to whether we are facing a temporary cyclical situation or whether we are seeing the buildup of a permanently higher inflation rate  In sum, now that the slowdown is under way, it seems to me that the risks to the economy are a bit better balanced than they were earlier There are some wild cards in the outlook, and several people have mentioned a number of them One that I would point to is whether some deficit reduction is going to be enacted into law And if it is, who is going to be affected and by how much? I don't believe we have adequately built that into our projections Nor do I think we have adequately factored in the potential trade war with Japan, whatever that may mean On a not unrelated factor, we have had a shock to the dollar How that is going to play out in the US economy has yet to be seen So I agree with Mike Kelley We seem to be in a wait-and- see posture at this point The Committee is going to have to continue to assess whether some of these wild cards are going to affect the delicate balance that currently seems to be moving us toward a soft landing, notably how this inventory imbalance will play itself out So, we have a period of sharp vigilance ahead  -24-    5/23/95  I agree with ""B"" symmetric It seems to me that this is a time to keep the monetary policy powder dry "
5582,1995-07-05,PHILLIPS," Thank you I think the preparation for this meeting has been for me the most difficult of my tenure, and that is because we are seeing so many conflicting economic signals We seem to be at the classic fork in the road--whether or not this inventory correction will work itself into a downward spiral or will turn out to be an air pocket as we approach a soft landing There has been a fair amount of discussion today about the conflicting real economic data signals We have talked about auto sales, housing, the inventory buildup, and the consumer sector--these are areas where the signals are mixed But if the real data signals are mixed, I would have to point out that the monetary aggregates are giving us even less consistent signals The current frenzy of economic analysis and spinning of the econometric forecasting models probably are more than can be supported by the meager data to date We are all struggling to look inside the models, questioning assumptions, questioning this, and questioning that However, because we are on such a narrow path and the adjustment is likely to be so fine, it is difficult for the models to pick up some of these fine gradations  Well, having been a bit frustrated by that process, like Bob Forrestal I went back to the question of whether some of the fundamental strengths that propelled the economy forward in 1994 were still present They are not as strong they were, but they are still definitely present Business investment, while not growing at a high double-digit rate, is still relatively strong The financial markets are not pointing to an economic downturn The banking system is strong There is no credit crunch in sight In the labor market, even if unemployment does notch up a bit, we are still relatively close to full employment In the manufacturing and financial sectors, the productivity improvements are holding up On the inflation front, the uptick that we have seen this year does appear to be related to cyclical pressures, as Mike Kelley observed Since wage inflation appears to be in check, it is unlikely that the upward adjustment that  -30-    7/5-6/95  we have seen in 1995 is going to be permanent On balance, the fundamental strengths that brought us to where we are now in this cycle remain, but I think the economy is vulnerable to the inventory correction that is under way And as Bill McDonough and others mentioned, there is a potential risk from international weakness or other shocks When the economy is in a weakened situation, any kind of shock can have more of an impact In short, while I think the fundamental strengths remain, I think the downside risks are stronger  I favor alternative II for 1995 and alternative I for 1996 I find myself quite frustrated with this discussion I think part of it has to do with our not really knowing whether the ranges are something we should be shooting for--whether they are long-term objectives, or whether they are in effect short- term monitoring ranges to be explained So, I support the notion of having a more extended discussion of what our goals should be in terms of thinking about restructuring the Humphrey-Hawkins statute and the kinds of things we monitor I don't think this is the time to do it, because I am not sure we know enough now about what range we should monitor, whether it should be M2 or M3 or something else At this point, I certainly agree with the notion that if we change the M2 range now, we are going to draw more attention to it But at some point I think we do need to address the kinds of issues that Al Broaddus has raised and decide whether or not we are going to support legislative changes that would get us off the horns of this dilemma  I also think that the baseline projection is probably the most reasonable, but I would support a 25 basis point move as insurance in the sense of not being 100 percent sure about how our forecast of the inventory correction is going to work out I must say that I vacillate on this question of symmetry or asymmetry I guess I don't have strong views, but I am marginally supportive of symmetry because I don't think that we would move before August without talking in any case But I wouldn't vote against asymmetry because of my lack of conviction as to the use of asymmetric language "
5607,1995-08-22,PHILLIPS," Thank you, Mr Chairman The inventory correction appears to be running its course and the adverse follow-on effects that we talked about at the last meeting do not appear to be about to beset us The economy could well be set to resume its growth path at potential Many of the areas of strength in the economy have been mentioned Both consumer and business spending have resumed The housing market has shown some renewed vigor Employment still is fairly strong, although the unemployment rate did tick up last month and there has been some discussion about the volatility of the participation rates The wealth effects of a stronger stock market may support continued spending The flip side of a strong stock market is that we have a fairly low cost of capital, and that bodes well for continued investment spending Corporate profits have been holding up reasonably well, and there appears to be a continued commitment to improvement in productivity  In view of this rather optimistic scenario, I have been trying to assess the downside risks, the clouds and uncertainties on the horizon Larry has talked extensively about the fiscal impact on the economy of dealing with the deficit, particularly since it appears that there is considerable interest in seriously addressing it this fall It's very hard to know what, if any, effects there will be from a train wreck I think we'll see a lot of national attention focused on Washington as we approach the November showdown  There also has been considerable discussion today about the labor market Although the unemployment rate is historically low, it is difficult to assess the longer-term impacts of the re-engineering binge that has been going on in the private sector and in some parts of the public sector A lot of displaced people are now employed, but they may see their new jobs as temporary On the positive side, this does suggest that there may be more flexibility in the labor market than is implied by the 57 percent unemployment rate This may help explain the dichotomy that we seem to be seeing between labor shortages and the fact that there don't seem to be many upward wage pressures This uncertainty in the labor market or lack of confidence among workers may well contribute to consumer spending vulnerability This vulnerability may be exacerbated by the fact that a lot of consumers have taken on more debt in the last year and a half On the supply side, the auto market may not provide the same kind of growth impetus that it has in the past We have heard some mixed reports around the table today about the auto market Pent-up demand has probably been worked off The ownership holding period for autos appears to be longer Some of that is due to the improved durability of autos, but it also may be simply that people can't afford the higher sticker prices Income constraints may start to hold down auto  -26-    8/22/95  sales in the future and not provide the same kind of impulse that we have had in the past Of course, foreign competition may become more of a factor as the impact of the dollar is felt  On the inflation side, I do think that most of the recent data are supportive of the hypothesis advanced at the last meeting that the uptick in the first half of the year was really due to temporary cyclical pressures It is somewhat discouraging that the outlook for inflation still seems to be in the vicinity of 3 percent, indicating that we have some distance to go  In sum, the economic reports that have come in since the last meeting have been encouraging The inventory correction appears to have been more the proverbial air pocket on the way to the soft landing The financial markets seem reasonably consistent with this outlook The stock market has paused but it didn't tank The slope of the yield curve has steepened, implying that the risk of recession is somewhat less Yield spreads have not widened, implying that there may be some lessening of concerns about asset quality in the markets Credit demand appears reasonably strong So, it seems to me that a growth outlook reasonably close to potential is quite likely and that the risks are more balanced  I also "
5631,1995-09-26,PHILLIPS," Would the kinds of operational changes that you are contemplating, or working on, require legislative authorizations?  Do you think that the kinds of changes that you are looking at would reduce the propensity of banks to develop sweep arrangements, or do you think those are with us anyway and have to be factored in?  I have one other question What is happening in the markets that is affecting the timing of operations? Are things shifting to other markets, to overseas markets?  So it is still domestic    9/26/95  Thank you  Yes I suspect this is going to take some major fleshing out  What were they trading in?  Thank you, Mr Chairman My remarks will be short this morning In view of the revised GDP number that we have received since the last meeting and the somewhat mixed economic signals that we have been getting and certainly have discussed around the table today, I think it's fair to say that the inventory cycle may have flattened out to some extent Inventory adjustments are likely to stretch more into the future Except for this shift in the inventory adjustment process, the situation seems to be working out much the way that was discussed at the last meeting Demand has held up We didn't slip into a downward spiral coming out of the inventory  -29-    9/26/95  adjustment process Specifically, consumer spending and housing have shown improvement And although business investment growth is slowing somewhat, we all recognize that the previous rates of expansion were not sustainable Employment is holding fairly steady People appear to be learning to live in this newly re-engineered world New businesses are starting up and are absorbing some of the displaced workers I think the financial markets since our last meeting have reflected the resolution of the inventory situation They generally have improved--the dollar, the stock market, the bond markets This means a continued availability of relatively low cost capital, which bodes well for the business investment outlook In this environment we have had good news with respect to inflation, which appears to be reasonably well controlled However, I would point out that we have a distance to go on getting the inflation rate down, and it is going to be harder and harder to make progress  I guess I am having a difficult time signing on to the stories that are floating around about significant upside risks, one of Mike Prell's three scenarios With employment remaining a continuing concern, while this is a positive influence for inflation, job uncertainty means that we are unlikely to see significant expansion in consumer spending Continuing inventory adjustments in the face of fairly steady demand are probably going to make businesses a bit leery of expanding significantly We have talked a bit about the pending train wreck and how much of a fiscal drag that is going exert I think that under any circumstances there is going to be some kind of a drag, but the question is what kind and how much I am not sure that we have a good handle at this point on what kind of fiscal drag we will see  In sum, I think the outlook is for slow growth in the near term I do think there are a couple of major unknowns The train wreck scenario is one and we don't fully understand the implications of a potential train wreck On the down side, it could produce a lot of uncertainty in the financial markets, and it's hard to know what kind of uncertainty that might engender in the general economy The second unknown relates to the fact that most people seem to be focusing on an outlook of 2 to 2-1/2 percent growth in real GDP, with 2 percent suggested in the Greenbook for 1997 I would point out that we are going into an election year, and I wonder whether 2 to 2-1/2 percent is going to be deemed politically and socially acceptable I suspect that there might be a lot more pressure building in the upcoming year for a stronger economy Even though economists are saying this is about as good as it gets, I wonder whether folks on Main Street will see it that way  I support ""B"" symmetric We should have some room to ease sometime this fall, but I think we should wait and see how things develop Symmetry seems most appropriate to me, because I think it is clear that we probably would not move in the intermeeting period without a discussion It seems to me that if we were going to adopt an asymmetric directive, we should definitely have a move in mind and should only be thinking about its timing So, I would go with ""B"" symmetric  I generally support the thrust of the bill I think that it is useful to clear out some of the clutter in the current Humphrey-Hawkins Act One of the major positives of the bill is the clear focus on price stability and the purchasing power of our currency But I, too, would like to see a recognition that this focus is not inconsistent with economic growth In fact, this is how monetary policy specifically can contribute to economic growth I like the at least perceived flexibility that is in the bill in terms of calling upon us to develop definitions and to construct the required reports I think a great deal of work would need to be done  -49-    9/26/95  on our part to figure out how we would want to structure these reports Perhaps we should give some thought as to how much clarification we want up front or how loose we want to make it I, like others, am concerned about this question as to how tightly we would be wired to price stability at all costs and whether we would have the flexibility to make adjustments to business cycles and supply shocks I do support the thrust of the bill, but I hope that we can preserve a good deal of flexibility to manage policy depending on the circumstances "
5657,1995-11-15,PHILLIPS," Thank you, Mr Chairman At our last meeting we said that we would know more at this meeting, and now we are all scratching our heads We do know more, but now we are trying to figure out what it means We may well be in another fourth-down situation I agree with Mike Prell that forecasting is a truly humbling profession We have all had the opportunity to reevaluate some things since the last meeting As Mike chronicled for us, a number of the statistics have come in stronger than were anticipated at that meeting GDP, industrial production, and consumer spending The export situation seems to be improving as the economies of our trading partners appear to be on the mend or strengthening At 55  -37-    11/15/95  percent unemployment, the labor market appears to be a bit better than expected Except for today's CPI news, the recent inflation news has been better than expected Evidence appears to be gathering that the NAIRU may be lower than 6 percent Business fixed investment projections look a bit better than we had earlier thought The recent productivity numbers are above trend, unless one has made the mental conversion already to chain weights  What are the implications of this reevaluation? Taken together, all this information may indicate that labor and product market constraints are not quite as tight as historical precedents would suggest Monetary policy may not be as restrictive as we had earlier thought I think that the financial markets are consistent with that observation Stock prices are up; bond prices are up; the yield curve has flattened during the intermeeting period; the dollar has been steadier The cost of capital still favors business spending on investment Credit market demands have flattened a bit in the most recent data, but they are still indicative of a propensity to spend Perhaps the folks who have suggested that the risks are on the up side are right; maybe we have missed the soft landing and are ready for another takeoff Alternatively, it may be time to adjust our thinking to chain-weighted statistics The data seem a bit more consistent, or at least more explainable, using these statistics  In spite of the ""conflictive"" evidence, I continue to believe, similar to Mike Prell, that the best outlook is for moderate growth In coming to this somewhat unexciting conclusion, I continue to look at the labor markets as a key People, except for Federal government people, are working Employment growth has slowed, though, to the point where we are just dealing with demographic increases People are still mobile I think the reengineering that we have gone through continues to create some uncertainty All of this is, I think, showing up in the wage situation We are not seeing increased wage pressures, though perhaps we will Perhaps at some point workers will be able to exert enough influence to move wages and real income to higher levels, but we don't appear to be at that point yet That indicates to me that spending is going to be cautious We also have to consider the fiscal budget situation The longer this debate drags on, I think the more uncertain the effects are going to be Otherwise, and aside from the budget situation, there do not appear to be major imbalances in the real economy or the financial markets  In sum, I am sticking to the story of moderate growth, and I will go even a bit further in view of the strong third-quarter data and the financial market signals It is possible that the probability distribution around a mean of potential growth has narrowed a bit  You are saved!  ""B"" symmetric "
5681,1995-12-19,PHILLIPS," Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy has been considerably stronger than we might have expected, with growth probably exceeding 5 percent for the third quarter and higher than 3 percent, or at least in the vicinity of 3 percent, for the year 1995 The question for us is how much momentum we can expect going forward There are some sources of strength to the economy One area is the labor market At 56 percent unemployment, people are working They may not be working at the jobs they want This implies that they may be willing to move, which suggests in turn more flexibility in the labor force than is implied by a 56 percent unemployment rate I think the proof of this assertion is the fact that wage rates have not consistently been under pressure We have heard a lot of anecdotal stories about labor shortages, but that has not been widespread nor has it crept into the statistics  With respect to consumer spending, we clearly are getting some mixed signals in both the published data and in the anecdotal reports We probably have, as Janet Yellen mentioned, worked through the pent-up demand for durables Consumers appear to be very price conscious and cautious; consumer debt is probably reinforcing this caution It is pretty difficult to assess the fourth-quarter retail situation People are probably waiting until that last store markdown, or perhaps they are hitting the discount stores or the catalogs But as long as people are working, I don't think there is any reason to assume that they will stop spending in any big way I think it is fair to say that growth in consumer spending is likely to approximate the pace of income growth So, the upside surprises in this sector of the economy are unlikely  The housing side has been disappointing recently, but I don't see any reason why it should not pick up a bit, or at least not decline, given the affordability statistics and also the availability of reasonably low mortgage rates On the business investment side, the fundamentals are reasonably strong for continued investment, though probably not at the strong pace that we saw in 1994 and early 1995 Profits and cash flows are holding up and the cost of capital is low The markets, I think, are fairly supportive of moderate economic growth The stock market is strong, generally supported by corporate earnings I guess I am not quite as pessimistic as Bill McDonough about the stock market being massively overvalued In the debt market, we have seen the emergence of a flatter yield curve It  -25-    12/19/95  has not yet turned negative, but it definitely has flattened out At the long-term end, the decline in inflation expectations has some obvious benefits for lowering financing costs and improving refinancing opportunities In the inflation area, we have seen more progress than we probably have a right to have expected In short, there are no obvious bottlenecks or major imbalances in the economy This is not to say that there aren't any risks to the economy, and there may be some adjustments forthcoming The manufacturing sector, as has been reported around the table today, is pretty uneven We may still have to work off some inventories  The international demand side, I think, is a bit more risky Certainly, the United States is in a better competitive situation than has been the case historically But the question is Will the international demand be there? The economic outlook for Europe has weakened; the Mexican economy may be bottoming out, but there are still significant risks; and it is questionable whether Japan has fully faced up to some of its difficulties  With respect to the fiscal negotiations, with a good part of the government still closed down, this remains a concern I would argue, however, that we know more now than we did at our meetings in September and November With respect to the debt ceiling, we clearly have bought some time Rather, I should say that Secretary Rubin has bought some time, and there is a commitment to avoid default Government operations are going to reopen one way or another I think politicians will not be able to resist the political backlash from the inability of the public to get services We also have the specter of public employees getting a paid holiday In a week or so, they will be eligible to file for unemployment benefits There also will be complaints about the unfairness of unpaid layoffs for the holidays Under either a continuing resolution or an agreement, which may not come until next year, there will be some fiscal drag, but not that much in the near term It seems to me that the point for us, with respect to the fiscal situation is that the areas of discussion are narrowing From our perspective, I think there is probably more confidence that a deal eventually will be struck, but there will be some federal drag on the economy  In sum, I think the case continues for moderate growth, but I think there clearly will be some unevenness in that growth  I can support your recommendation for a small easing move, but I don't think that the case is very strong; we could wait The economy is growing; the stock market is strong; the Wall Street Journal says we are off the hook; and the shrimp index is up! But we are behind the yield curve, perhaps by 50 to 75 basis points We are getting mixed reports on demand, which to me reduces the chance of an upside breakout I think the range of potential outcomes on the    12/19/95  fiscal situation has narrowed, and I agree that we should not be holding back until there is a resolution In fact, a move today would clarify that we are in fact taking into account the overall economic situation and not tying ourselves or being tied by a particular budget situation To me the crucial thing is the inflation experience It is much improved I think there is a good chance, that inflation may not pick up, at least in the near term, given the slackening growth in demand, the increases in capacity, the international competitive pressures, and the labor market flexibility that we have talked about Maybe this is the time to seize the opportunity, and I don't see that there is much reason to wait If we go ahead and move today, then I would think that a symmetric directive is appropriate "
5705,1996-01-30,PHILLIPS," I nominate Alan Greenspan  Thank you, Mr Chairman There is more fog than usual in Washington and in the outlook Some of this uncertainty is caused by the data situation From the perspective of a rear-view mirror, the data are less reliable than usual due, of course, to delays and revisions and weather disruptions I suspect that we may not be able to assess fully what has happened in the fourth quarter or even in the first quarter until we are well into the second quarter The federal budget situation may be a bit clearer in the short run, but it is certainly a lot less clear for the longer term In the near term, we probably will have some reduction in federal spending either under continuing resolutions or a series of appropriations bills The range of issues is narrowing, and all sides are focusing on deficit reduction With respect to the longer term, the delay of a budget agreement means that fundamental policy questions such as the appropriate expenditure levels for Medicare and Medicaid are not going to be answered until after the elections This is a problem because elections don't always provide very clear mandates, so I think that creates a bit more fog with respect to federal government expenditures in the future  I think that the best current projection for GDP growth is about 2 percent, or close to potential There are a number of developments that in my view are consistent with a moderate growth outlook and a reasonably stable employment situation By that I mean that people are working, though not necessarily at jobs that they prefer, so that a lot of working people would be willing to change jobs I suspect the 56 percent unemployment rate is more flexible than history would suggest This may be part of the response to Cathy Minehan's question; people are grumpy partly because of job uncertainty That attitude will be reflected in consumer spending There is no reason necessarily to see a major decline in consumer spending, and likewise there is not much room for a significant increase We have worked through the pent-up demand from the early 1990s, but with the increased debt levels that people have assumed,  -26-    1/30-31/96  consumption is likely at best to track income growth As has been mentioned, we have an inventory overhang in some sectors, some of it the result of a disappointing fourth quarter Hopefully, on the other hand, managers are developing better inventory management techniques A slowdown in industrial production has been cited, but in spite of that slowdown, we are still seeing corporate profits and cash flows that are better than anticipated Some of that results from increased investment in machines and equipment to increase capacity and improve productivity The fundamentals favor continued growth in capital investment, though probably not at the 1994 and 1995 levels Nevertheless, this sector should continue to support economic growth The capital markets are not going to be a bottleneck, at least from what we can tell now The stock markets have been strong; they appear to be supported by earnings Declines in long-term interest rates should also contribute to keeping the cost of capital down Credit growth has slowed but credit is still available So, there are no bottlenecks in the capital markets to prevent business investment  Turning to inflation, I think that some arguments can be made for a more optimistic projection than the staff forecast of 3 percent Moderate growth, capacity increases, lower utilization, and international weakness should help to relieve demand pressures on commodity prices Recent consumer and business behavior, I believe, is consistent with a reduced inflation psychology, but I would certainly grant that there are risks One of the risks, to which I think we must be particularly alert, is that wage pressures may be reemerging and we are unlikely to get any more gains on the benefits side  To summarize, a key question for us is the sustainability of moderate growth I see little chance of a breakout on the up side, and that leads me to conclude that there probably are more risks on the down side I can't really see any likely sources for a potential breakout on the up side I suspect that we are going to be getting more pressure for higher growth levels We are starting to see it even in the business press Although people around this table think that 2 percent growth with low inflation and a strong dollar is a good situation, the question is whether that will be socially and politically acceptable The expectations for the US economy are for a boom-and-bust cycle, and I don't know whether people have learned to manage sustainable growth I think expectations differ from economic reality, which may be another part of the answer to Cathy Minehan's question I believe that we will start to see pressure build for faster growth  I will go with Alternative I and associate myself with the comments of President Moskow and Governor Kelley I will say, however, that I am uncomfortable about not having the staff's expected growth of M2 encompassed by the Alternative I range As I recall, the staff forecast in July did at least have monetary growth at the upper end of the ranges for last year If we get to a more normal relationship between GDP and the monetary aggregates, we should take a hard look at changing the ranges But because changing the ranges at this point would signal more knowledge than we actually have, I think it is best to stay with Alternative I for now  I, too, think it's important for us to communicate more about the importance of price stability as a goal, and I must say I am sympathetic to Al's proposal I do have some caveats and concerns about the timing of implementing such a proposal Like President McTeer and others, I am a little concerned that now may be a bit early I would like to have the proposal fleshed out a little more before I have to vote on it Among other things, I think we ought to give more consideration to the appropriate time horizon The 1996-1997 time frame that Al mentioned makes me a little nervous I would prefer a longer horizon President Melzer's suggestion of looking at what inflation might be doing over the next five years would seem to be a useful kind of communication In sum, while I would like to do something involving more communication, I would like to have proposals like Al's fleshed out a little more and also to have the opportunity to consider some different alternatives as to what we should communicate  -45-    1/30-31/96  I support an easing of 25 basis points with a symmetric directive I think it is important to take out some insurance against the downside risks I am a bit more optimistic than the staff forecast that we can continue to see some progress on inflation In addition, based on a fairly flat yield curve, I continue to think we are a bit behind in making downward adjustments So, it would be a good idea in my view to go ahead and ease 25 basis points today "
5729,1996-03-26,PHILLIPS," Thank you, Mr Chairman The fog has lifted somewhat since our January FOMC meeting, and perhaps we are now operating only in patches of fog I continue to believe that it will be well into the second quarter before we have a clear picture of what happened even in the fourth quarter, let alone the first quarter of this year We will continue to hear arguments about whether the government shutdown obscured the sampling periods and so on There will be arguments about the effects of the weather--whether or not firms will make up their losses and whether or not needed inventory adjustments have occurred I also think that the new data calculation methods will continue to challenge us to become comfortable with the notion that 2 percent real GDP growth is in fact what we should be striving for  -17-    3/26/96  Obviously, the past is behind us, but a clear picture of the near past or even what is in the proverbial ""rear view mirror"" can help us understand whether or not the economy is going up, down, or has just rounded a corner This uncertainty about the near past certainly has been reflected in the markets There is sensitivity to almost every piece of economic news that is released, and we seem to be having a considerable reaction, perhaps even overreaction, to unanticipated economic news  I was struck by the sizable swings in the GDP estimates in the Greenbook since the last meeting There is quite a change in the fourth-quarter, the first-quarter, and the second-quarter estimates for GDP Most of it is explained by the inventory correction, which has shifted some of the growth from the fourth quarter to the first quarter That improves the outlook so that the second-quarter estimate is considerably higher The net effect is a forecast that is a bit brighter Going forward, I quite agree that the best estimate is for continued moderate growth The employment report that we got for February probably was on the high side and may well be revised Even so, it is a relatively strong report Industrial production has been stronger Housing may slow a bit due to the backup in interest rates, but the recent data have been surprisingly strong, and the fundamentals for continued activity in housing remain pretty good In addition, my brother just sold his house [Laughter] This is a sign of considerable strength in the housing sector--in the Fifth District, I might add [Laughter]  With respect to business fixed investment, I think it is pretty unlikely that we will see growth continue at the same pace as in 1994 and 1995 By the same token, I don't think there is any major reason for a big pullback The cost of capital is still fairly low, and if we are correct in forecasting that aggregate spending will hold up and that businesses have a continuing commitment to holding costs down, profits and cash flows should be reasonably strong Nevertheless, business firms already have added a good deal of capacity, so we probably will see less growth in spending on industrial production facilities As has already been mentioned, the outlook for spending on computers is not as strong as it has been, and such spending has explained a lot of the growth in business fixed investment So, I think we probably will not experience quite as much strength in business fixed investment as we have seen recently  Again going forward, I don't think that the usual bottlenecks that one might see in a mature expansion are present We seem to have plenty of credit availability The banks and the markets are still reasonably well positioned to support expansion We are not seeing as much in the way of balance sheet adjustments There are some but not enough for us to find ourselves in a windshear situation I think household spending is likely to keep pace with income This is a little less optimistic than the Greenbook, but I think that some of the hypotheses relating to household spending suggested in the Greenbook are very interesting These include job anxiety and perceptions of the shakiness of Medicare/Medicaid Perhaps people are being attracted to high stock prices I hope this is going to mean some improvement in saving, and maybe people are hitting their borrowing limits So, while moderate growth is a probable forecast on balance, I think there are risks to the outlook    3/26/96  One of the big risks that several people around the table have mentioned is on the inflation side While I believe it is possible to make some progress on the inflation front given reduced capacity pressures, labor market uncertainty, and cautious consumers, I do think that some of the inflation risks have increased since the last FOMC meeting The increase in oil prices is an example Another year of bad crops could cause prices to ratchet up Wage increases could finally be heading up Also, prospects for major gains in terms of deficit reduction have diminished considerably even since the last FOMC meeting  In sum, I think the economy is in a more balanced situation than it was in late January and we can look forward to moderate economic growth with a bit less uncertainty than we were feeling in January But I do think that the inflation outlook is less favorable  I agree with your suggestion It seems to me that the need for additional insurance is less pronounced The cost is now simply too high relative to the risk The economy is moving forward, and it does not appear to need our help at this time I can well imagine that our next move could be either up or down "
5751,1996-05-21,PHILLIPS," This is the first time that I have been the first of the governors to comment This is amazing; maybe I'll master the timing of this process eventually!  -19-    5/21/96  I have been staying with the story of moderate growth for a number of meetings, and I am beginning to bore even myself But I do think there is now a bit more certainty to such a forecast than there was earlier A lot of the uncertainties that we saw in the fall have dissipated Until I heard Mr Melzer, I thought we were past the major strike activity problem, but maybe more strikes will be generated in the Midwest By and large, however, some of the major strikes are behind us, and certainly the possibility of a Treasury default that was a prime concern for this group is now behind us The question of government shutdowns and the issue of budget deals appear to be a bit more quiescent now We did not get a long-term balanced budget agreement, but it does appear that progress is being made on a year-by-year basis in terms of holding expenditures down and addressing the near-term budget deficit The winter weather disruptions are behind us and we are free to worry about summer drought, planting conditions, and heat problems  The recent statistics display considerably more strength The labor market is still showing reasonable job growth, and the 54 percent unemployment rate is impressive People are working and they will continue to spend Housing has remained amazingly strong because the fundamentals remain strong Business capital spending has been a major factor in the continuing expansion and seems to be growing further in the context of an apparent commitment to capital expenditures to reduce operating costs Computer expenditures appear to go on and on, and I do not see an end in sight, especially in light of the new opportunities stemming from the Internet But I think the outlook for expenditures on plant expansion is much more questionable  There are some factors favoring the sustainability of this expansion Inventories are in much better balance now than at the end of 1995 The financial markets are continuing to support opportunities for additional investment In spite of the backup in interest rates, the term structure is still reasonably low The stock market is surprisingly strong, perhaps a bit on the rich side now, but it is still providing a cheap source of equity capital Bank credit is still available Balance sheets are healthier As I mentioned, we have made some progress on the federal deficit The question now, I believe, is what kinds of things can throw the economy off this sustainable growth path? In my view, unless we resume concentrating on deficit reduction and start to address some of the longer-term deficit problems--entitlements in particular--this issue is going to come back to haunt us and we will have higher inflation expectations and higher interest rates We always have to question where we are with respect to aggregate demand It has been stronger than we had expected, but there are some signs that suggest we should at least question the continuation of growth at the current rate  On the inflation front--and this is where I want to end my comments--it is possible that the increases in energy and grain prices can be temporary But if they are sustained, they will get built into other price structures and into the wage structure We are getting differing anecdotal stories concerning wage pressures, but we are now seeing indications of some firming of wages in the statistics An increase in the minimum wage, if there is one, would exacerbate the situation I continue to be bothered by our concentration on the CPI as the appropriate measure of cost-of-living increases I appreciated the inclusion of the GDP chain-weighted price index in the Greenbook,  -20-    5/21/96  but it also has problems Manufacturers report that they can't make price increases stick, and yet we are seeing some price increases Weighing all of these differing reports and anecdotal stories, I think the inflation risk has increased and we need to be focusing on that  ""B,"" symmetric Although I believe that the risks have moved toward higher inflation, I do think that long-term rates are exerting some restraint I would go with symmetry because if we were to make a change, it would be a change in direction, and I think a phone call would be appropriate  I agree with President Minehan I think it will be useful to have the discussion I generally prefer an open- ended, longer horizon for a goal, but starting the discussion is what is important We need to have some kind of discussion about what price stability means and what time horizon we are talking about, and if what gets us started is thinking about 1998, that's okay with me My preference would be to base the discussion on a longer-term horizon than 1998, but I think getting started is more important "
5777,1996-07-02,PHILLIPS," Peter, I just wanted to ask what the source of these options data was that you use for your calculations and charts  So, they are basically over-the-counter Do you think they are comparable going back as far as you do?  Well, okay  Thank you, Mr Chairman The moderate growth story that we have been talking about certainly seems to be playing out The second-quarter information looks generally strong, and indeed most of the members around the table have ratcheted up their growth projections The difficult question before us is to what extent the slowdown that is projected in the Greenbook will materialize A turn in direction is the most difficult thing to project, and I suspect that may be why we are getting some differences around the table in our forecasts There clearly are some good arguments for a slowdown Higher bond rates certainly should affect interest-sensitive sectors of the economy Housing is showing some signs of a pause The slowdown in business fixed investment seems to depend on people's expectations of slower growth in final sales, including the notion that we have run through pent-up demand Consumer spending has been a consistent source of strength, one that has been financed by increased consumer debt as Governor Lindsey has just documented for us So, I think that consumer spending will at best only track increases in income, which again supports the argument of a slowdown The notion that job insecurity stemming from downsizings and improvements in technology continues to generate substantial uncertainty is another factor that should help to slow the growth in consumer spending  I do have to say that a slowdown in the second half is not a sure thing We have been saying, for example, that business fixed investment would slow in 1996, but so far we have clocked in a double- digit rate of increase Although interest rates are up from their lows, the overall cost of capital is fairly reasonable The cost of equity capital is really quite favorable The term structure of interest rates is fairly healthy in terms of both the overall level and the slope of the yield curve Various types of risk management tools and new financial instruments are allowing businesses and  -35-    7/2-3/96  households to time-adjust their expenditures and their commitment patterns I think that this is adding to the difficulty of projecting a slowdown Another reason why a slowdown is not necessarily a sure thing is that wealth effects may encourage consumers and businesses to continue to spend and invest As long as we have unemployment in the 54 to 56 percent range, people are working and they are likely to continue to spend So, it is hard to argue that there will be a big pullback in consumption The industrial sector is showing some strength We do not have major economic imbalances to work through in terms of inventories, which are relatively well aligned with sales Business balance sheets have been improved in many cases Capital and banking markets are well positioned to support increased growth There has certainly been progress on the Federal deficit, at least in the short run  Turning for a moment to inflation, as measured by the CPI it clearly has accelerated in early 1996, but if we take a longer look at some of the broader statistics, we are getting very mixed signals I was particularly impressed by one of the tables in the Greenbook showing changes from 12 months earlier for a whole series of indicators for the period ended in May Comparing the year ended May 1995 to the year ended May 1996, there actually have been improvements in the CPI, core CPI, core PPI, intermediate PPI, core intermediate PPI, and core crude materials The only major indexes that did not improve are the PPI and its crude materials component, and the reasons there are the oil and food stories But crude materials excluding food and energy are down 12-1/2 percent for the year to date, and other commodity price measures also are down I would not have expected to see an improvement in inflation given the fact that we have seen a fairly strong economic performance this year  Looking forward as opposed to looking back at the last 12 months, the inflation risk from the energy sector that we cited in May seems to have abated and energy prices appear to be coming down But while the risk from energy appears to have lessened, the risk from rising food prices remains We have come far enough along in the planting season that the chances of a disastrous harvest have diminished, but we still are at some risk in the food area Wages are another area at risk, given the outlook for a hike in the minimum wage, reports of scattered labor shortages, and the ECI surge that we saw for the first quarter of this year The federal deficit situation remains a problem for the long term, and we need to make some progress on that So, the risk of rising inflation is definitely present Even so, I think there is some room for optimism There has been some discussion around the table about productivity Are we measuring productivity in services correctly? Are we measuring the productivity gains from technology accurately? We also have had an expansion in capacity over the last few years that should help in terms of moderating cost pressures In addition, I believe that inflation psychology has lessened somewhat So, there is some room for optimism on the inflation side, but there is certainly continued risk  In sum, I think the economy is doing quite well, and the strength is all the more impressive because we have seen improvement in inflation But the risk to the expansion does seem to me to have shifted to the up side To the extent that we have a second-half slowdown, it may well be fairly shallow  -36-    7/2-3/96  I think I've lost my train of thought here! [Laughter]  I am going to be very brief I agree with Ed Boehne that it would be useful to state our goal in terms of maximum sustainable growth and the notion of trying to achieve price stability It seems to me that while we can set 2 percent or maybe something else as an inflation goal, I am a little skeptical that any one measure of inflation is the right one At any point in time, I can imagine that there will be problems with a particular measure, as there are now with the CPI Intuitively, I am attracted to the notion of the GDP deflator, but I will admit that it too may have problems at times There may be unusual circumstances affecting the various measures, so I am hesitant to pin down a particular number I am a little more comfortable with the notion of a range, but I think it might be useful to continue to state our goal in words as opposed to numbers and then give examples of what we see as price stability at a particular point in time  You did not hear the word taxes coming from me, Larry  It would eventually work its way into GDP at some point  But focusing on GDP, you are still going to be addressing the question of an external oil shock  It is certainly premature to restore M2 and M3 to their full status as policy indicators, but I do think that we should recognize that they are performing a bit better in terms of  -76-    7/2-3/96  velocity and GDP growth I thought David Lindsey's chart presentation was extremely useful, and I particularly liked the first chart that shows the upward migration in M2 velocity I thought that was very helpful But it also points out that we do not yet have a lot of dots along that green line for the period since the start of 1994, while there are a lot of dots around the black line for the period from 1960 to 1989 I thought that chart put the recent history into perspective But I do think that money remains an important monitor for monetary policy, and I believe it would be useful in our Humphrey- Hawkins report to discuss the fact that M2 growth deviated from its historical pattern for a period of time but that it now appears to be coming back Like Governor Meyer, I am uncomfortable with the current ranges, but I do not want to use them as a monetary policy signal So, I agree with your proposal not to change the ranges at this time, but I think we should beef up our discussion of the monetary aggregates in the Humphrey-Hawkins report  Thank you, Mr Chairman Based on the increased upside risks, I think that a tightening of policy is going to be needed in the next several months, but I am a bit more optimistic than the Greenbook on inflation I am not convinced that a large increase--or a series of increases--in the federal funds rate is necessary In that vein, a tightening move could be delayed I am generally ambivalent on asymmetric directives, but based on the upside potential for the economy and the attendant inflation risks, it does seem to me that the case for tightening has strengthened Asymmetry would allow for an intermeeting move It seems to me that measures of price inflation and the ECI are particularly important information In that regard, I would still urge a phone call  -90-    7/2-3/96  Thank you, Mr Chairman I have to admit my general skepticism regarding the effectiveness of intervention as a means of permanently affecting the value of the dollar I do think that there are times when other smaller countries may be able to use intervention policies appropriately to affect their currencies So, it seems to me that the usefulness of swap lines for the United States may be questionable But I recognize that we live in a global environment, and we may need to be able to respond to the needs of other countries We also are not the only government institution making this policy To the extent that the Treasury, for example, decides that it is appropriate to intervene, we need to be there and we need to have the appropriate capabilities I am not sure that swap lines are the most efficient means of effecting these kinds of transactions I am not even sure that repos or reverse repos are the only other kinds of financial instruments that we could use I suspect that in today's marketplace, there may be a wider range of instruments that could be used, and before we come to a final conclusion, we need to be thinking about where we want to go as opposed to eliminating one procedure and having nothing to replace it Whatever adjustments are made, I hope that we would not be seen as  -104-    7/2-3/96 -105-  withdrawing from the international arena I think the Fed should be an active participant in the formulation of US policy We should have a place at the table I do think that the Fed provides continuity in the international financial arena on behalf of the United States "
5802,1996-08-20,PHILLIPS," Thank you, Mr Chairman At the last meeting I thought we would have more information by now We certainly have more data, but it is not clear to me that we have much more real information We are into the sixth year of this expansion and, depending on how we measure them, we have had either two or three soft landings We are now coming off a strong second quarter People around the table have discussed whether we are either in for another soft landing or a continuation of relatively strong growth I must say that I am quite impressed by the unanimity around the table in terms of the outlook, which seems to be settling on the notion of moderating growth Clearly, the factors pointing to further growth that we have been citing over the last couple of meetings are still in place In fact, I think some of those factors have solidified Financial markets generally continue to support growth With the decline in long-term rates, the yield curve has come into a flatter and more normal alignment We have had some excitement in the equity markets during the intermeeting period, but much of the correction, particularly in the blue chips, has reversed itself and there has been substantial recovery If we were to have additional correction or a sideways movement, that probably would be a healthy development in that it would allow earnings to catch up So, I think the equity markets remain a quite reasonable source of capital Banks generally appear to be providing ample credit and they seem to be adjusting their credit terms to changing circumstances Inventories are in reasonably good shape Growth in business investment is down from 1994 and 1995, but this sector of the economy is still a contributor to the expansion As long as people are working, I do not think that we will see a big pullback in consumption expenditures  On the inflation front, a lot of people have commented on the surprisingly good inflation numbers, and I think that performance is particularly notable in view of the length of the current expansion We have had an uptick in some of the indexes, although it can be said that food and energy largely explain the increases in the CPI, the PPI, and the prices of crude materials The core indexes all show improvement in the last twelve months over the previous twelve months We do not get as many readings on the deflators, which are broader- based indexes, but they also show improvement over the last twelve months  Where do we go from here with respect to inflation? The outlook for energy prices is considerably improved I think that food prices remain a risk Labor cost pressures are firming and are likely to remain a risk With regard to the recent ECI data, it is hard for me to believe that aggregate compensation costs can be held down forever by improvements on the benefits side I hope the members of President McDonough's board of directors are right and that we are on an ever downward trending slope in the benefits area, but I have to tell you that I am skeptical I can certainly understand why some of the benefit costs may go down State unemployment insurance costs surely could go down, but improvements in other components seem unlikely to be sustainable Assuming that at some point we do not get further improvement in benefit costs, total ECI is going to be exerting more pressure than we currently are seeing The question will be whether business is going to absorb these cost pressures either through the traditional squeeze on profit margins or through improved productivity I am sure that I do not want to wade into the productivity measurement morass The recent performance of inflation  -31-    8/20/96  leads me to believe that the economics profession does not have a good handle on productivity measurement I am sensitive to the comments by manufacturers that we must be doing better than the estimated 1 percent trend in productivity improvement But in case the statistics are right, we still have the profit-margins safety valve As much as business managers do not want to report declining profits to their boards of directors, they have had to do so on occasion So profit margins remain a safety valve  In sum, we have had additional confirmation of an economy that is on a sustainable growth path or even better There has not been any significantly bad inflation news since our last meeting, but I have to say that the risks remain on the up side  Mr Chairman, I also support ""B"" asymmetric My suspicion is that at some point we are going to need to tighten, but to me the timing is not clear If the expansion continues at an above-trend pace, the inflationary pressures are bound to prevail On the other hand, if productivity is better than the historical levels, the move could be deferred So it seems to me for now that ""B"" asymmetric is the right move "
5826,1996-09-24,PHILLIPS," Thank you, Mr Chairman After reviewing my comments from the last meeting, I conclude that there has not been all that much change We are still expecting moderate second-half growth, which would be a slowdown, of course, from the first half The evidence on inflation that came in during the intermeeting period generally has been fairly benign, and I would point to the core indexes and to commodity prices in particular I asked myself what, if anything, we know that is new since the last meeting At best, it seems to me that the news is fairly marginal On balance, the signs of the second-half slowdown appear to be a bit more solid, but not all that much Consumer spending has slowed, but now we are seeing signs that it may be turning back up Housing has been a bit difficult to read, given that the starts number for August was strong We continue to think that we are poised for a slowdown in housing demand because of the backup in long-term interest rates, but housing has held up surprisingly well Consumer credit seems to be slowing a bit, to a pace more in line with income growth, perhaps as consumers take  -17-    9/24/96  cognizance of increasing repayment requirements associated with higher debt levels Nonresidential construction is showing mixed signs Net exports appear to be a bit of a drag on the economy  The areas of strength that we have talked about in the economy are still in evidence The labor market is very strong; unemployment is low; consumer confidence is up, perhaps fed by the strength in employment The manufacturing outlook seems stronger Business fixed investment also is poised for substantial growth, perhaps not at a double-digit rate, but it remains a solid contributor to real growth One bit of news relates to corporate profits At our last session, there was a fair amount of discussion about whether they would hold up They do appear to be holding up better than might have been anticipated if one were assuming that increases in wages would result in a profit squeeze unless firms were able to pass on the increases through higher prices  So, while it appears that the signs of a slowdown are becoming a bit more evident in consumer spending and construction, there is still growth--just slower growth The areas of strength that are prevalent in the economy should also prevent that slowdown from careening into negative growth  A bit more monetary restraint is being provided by the markets since the last meeting, as evidenced by higher long-term rates, including mortgage rates The stock market has actually recovered That means that the cost of capital is down, and that argues for continued business investment Banks are continuing to support growth with credit availability, and I might mention that banks are doing quite well They are making money!  On the inflation front, the laws of gravity appear to be holding greater sway than the principles of economics At some point, we have to expect that labor costs are going to feed through to prices If they do not, either profits are being squeezed, which does not appear to be the case, or productivity must be improving, which may be the case However, statistical analyses and data are not yet showing the improvement There is considerable analysis of and comment on this inconsistency in academic papers and also in the press The explanations tend to concentrate on the continued efforts to downsize business firms, lower health insurance costs--some of that improvement may be permanent--additions to industrial capacity and other fixed investments, the inability to pass on price increases, and perhaps a breakdown in inflation psychology Consumers appear to be quite price conscious If all this is true, there may even be some room for optimism on inflation, but it seems to me that this is pure conjecture and we really cannot dismiss the tightness in labor markets Clearly, there is room for additional economic analysis of productivity In sum, I think we are about where we were last month We know more but the new information is marginal We still appear to be on a sustainable growth path as we look for further confirmation of a slowdown The inflation news has been better, but if economic history repeats itself, the risks are on the up side So, we must continue to be alert to inflation pressures  I support your recommendation of ""B"" asymmetric  I agree with the recommendation of trying to increase the liquidity of the System portfolio I am not sure that I know what the right percentage is, but I take your point I also appreciate your efforts, Peter, to try to identify and analyze the previous portfolio objectives I take it that what you plan to do following this discussion is to go back and try to come up with some kind of statement of procedures or policy I thought the principles that you noted on page 5 of your memo were sound They all seemed important to me, but they were not prioritized or weighted So, when you go back to redo them, I think it would be helpful if you were to put them into some kind of operating context  You do have it as the first item in your list, but then I can't quite tell where else it fits in "
5850,1996-11-13,PHILLIPS," My question actually was the same as Cathy's It was about the GDP estimate  Well, actually I was going to put it slightly differently How confident are you about the 19 percent growth rate?  Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy currently seems to be in a fairly wide holding pattern The anticipated second-half slowdown is under way, although we do not know its extent As always when we are trying to look forward, it is hard to know whether we are going to circle for a while longer, come in for another soft landing, crash land, or resume higher altitudes At least for the near term, it seems to me that the holding pattern is the most likely scenario The slowdown in the third quarter now appears to have been more pronounced than was earlier thought, given the recent inventory numbers But low inventory levels should make the fourth quarter of 1996 and early 1997 look a bit stronger, leaving the outlook on balance for the second half of this year at the proverbial sustainable level Although we are beginning to hear some arguments about weaker demand, I think the arguments that the economy may be slipping into a recession are fairly weak They depend on continued weakness in consumer demand and housing, and associated slowing in the manufacturing or industrial sector It seems to me that most of the recent economic indicators are pointing to a bit more strength, or at least to a soft landing, and there may be some tail winds for higher altitudes  With respect to the spending situation, there will be some propensity for consumers to spend as long as we continue to have a strong labor market and people are making money That view is supported by some of the recent consumer confidence numbers that may in turn be fueled by the wealth effects of the strong stock market The retail surveys are pointing to a reasonably strong holiday season It is even feasible that we could see some tail wind action from lower interest rates; the housing market feasibly could get a modest boost Business fixed investment, including nonresidential construction, has been holding up better than most forecasts Financing is generally available At least for now, we are seeing continued internal financing available as business profits have held up Maybe, as Governor Lindsey says, that will not continue Even so, if profits start to get pressured, the cost of external capital is low as a result of low interest rates and the rise in stock prices Banks are continuing to provide financing Foreign investment is another source  -26-    11/13/96  of strength There is evidence that businesses are issuing new debt and equity and utilizing increased bank financing Maybe they are putting all of it under a mattress, but productive activity is more likely  On the inflation front, we may also be in a holding pattern We are in the middle of a period of gathering the most current data, and what we have, I think, is relatively encouraging--the core PPI data that came out this morning, lower commodity prices, better-than- expected crops, and a fairly benign third-quarter GDP deflator and other PCE deflators The recent ECI numbers were surprisingly benign  There are some uncertainties in this scenario Will consumer debt, in fact, damp spending or will some of the labor market uncertainties in the era of downsizing damp consumer enthusiasm? If there is a stock market correction, it is hard to know how that is going to play out It depends obviously on how deep a correction we have  Fiscal policy has been a bit on the back burner at our last couple of meetings But with the elections over and Congress coming back, we are starting to hear discussions of another budget deal Depending on how it is structured or how contentious the budget negotiations get, this issue may throw some uncertainty into the financial markets or cause some uncertainty among consumers  Turning to productivity, the numbers do not provide much support for increased or continued progress on inflation Given current wage pressures and low unemployment, we should either be seeing lower profits or price increases or improved productivity We are not seeing any of those So, I continue to be skeptical of the productivity numbers, but we really do not know the full story  In sum, I think that the picture that we painted at the September meeting is playing out much as expected The slowdown is confirmed And while there are risks, I think that on balance the best guess going forward is continued growth  MrChairman, I support your recommendation of ""B"" asymmetric We should not be changing course now, particularly when we are in the middle of getting more current inflation data "
5876,1996-12-17,PHILLIPS," Thank you, Mr Chairman The economic expansion still seems to be holding in a sustainable zone We have further confirmation of the slowdown in the third quarter that we were anticipating The fourth-quarter results have been mixed but seem to point to a marginally stronger economy as we reach the year-end The question for us now is how much momentum the economy will carry into 1997 I have been impressed by the mixture of the reports around the table today There are some areas of strength in the economy a strong labor market, low unemployment, shortages of certain types of workers, fewer layoffs this year than in recent years, increased wages and income, and reasonably strong consumer confidence that is perhaps related to the strength in the labor markets and to some wealth effects from the stock market gains, at least until a few weeks ago Housing markets could be getting a boost from lower mortgage rates, and we have some evidence of that in the data for November that we received this morning There could even be some increased consumer spending capacity if a mini mortgage refinancing wave gets going On the business side, commercial construction has strengthened as the current business cycle has lengthened and put pressure on capacity We are even getting reports that available commercial rental space is now becoming scarce in some areas I never thought that I would be hearing such reports at this juncture Industrial production bounced back strongly in November  In support of this increased activity, the external financing cost of capital has been relatively low Profit levels and cash flow also have permitted internal funding In this financing environment, business fixed investment has consistently outpaced the Greenbook projections Inventories seem to be reasonably balanced as we go forward, so we should not face a workout from an inventory overhang nor a slowdown because of shortages  Even in this environment, I think there are some potential problems for the economy One I would point to is consumer spending While such spending is unlikely to fade given the strong labor market and high confidence levels, it is not likely to grow much faster than the rate of increase in incomes Consumer debt levels continue to be a constraint We have worked through all of the pent-up demand There is also the whole question of labor market uncertainty During my first two years on this Committee, I talked a lot about this subject I got tired of talking about it so it dropped off my list of things to mention, but the issue does remain  Another potential uncertainty is the stock market situation, which was highlighted by Mike Prell in the Greenbook It may well be that the cold shower that was given to the markets by the Chairman may have done the trick In any case, market participants are taking a second serious look at their valuations In fact, somebody that I talk to fairly regularly tells me that traders continue to be obsessed by the Chairman's remarks  I will turn to another problem that I place in the potential risk category I hope that Governor Rivlin is right in her optimism regarding the federal budget outlook But if some kind of budget deal is not worked out, I think the markets will likely extract a premium via higher interest rates, and that could have a retarding effect on the economy  -26-    12/17/96  Another risk that has been mentioned today is inflation It seems that ""benign"" and ""tamed"" are the more recent adjectives of choice That certainly seems fair for the major core indexes, the deflators, and commodities including gold But energy and food are still experiencing price increases If, as expected, those increases tail off or decline as supply pressures ease, we could see some marginal progress on inflation But if not, inflation remains a risk to the economy, particularly to the fairly fragile consumer spending situation Wages are another potential pressure point for inflation and the economy Maybe we are experiencing enough productivity improvement in enough industries to keep the pressure off prices, and there still is the safety valve of profits But either prices or profits are going to have to change in the future if labor markets remain tight  In sum, I think that the outlook for sustainable growth looks even better from the December vantage point than it did in September or November, perhaps with a bit more strength going into 1997 than we had earlier thought  I also support ""B"" asymmetric in view of the renewed strength of the economy in the current quarter It seems to me that the balance of risks has shifted to the up side, implying the necessity of vigilance on inflation developments "
5901,1997-02-04,PHILLIPS," Thank you On chart 3, in the middle section that shows inflation  and price-earnings ratios, I had not seen the information presented quite like that before I am  wondering whether there are enough observations in each of these buckets to get a meaningful  average In addition, I assume that the less-than-3-1/2 percent bucket includes a lot of the earlier  years in the period  So this is done on a quarterly basis?  The tabulation was impressive, and I guess I was surprised that the  relationship is as consistent as is implied by this table  Thank you  Thank you, Mr Chairman As almost everybody has mentioned, the  economy ended 1996 on a strong note The question now is whether this is just a single burst of  energy and the economy is about to settle down to the proverbial sustainable path, or does this  burst of energy portend a stronger growth path that will strain resources and lead to inflationary  pressures I think there is a corollary question relating to the high level of economic activity at  year-end, namely that even if the economy does return to a sustainable growth path, will we be    2/4-5/97  seeing pressures because the economy is operating at such a high level, thus straining resources  During the current expansion, which is now in its sixth year, we have had several of these strong  growth episodes and it is probably fair to say that monetary policy has had a lot to do with these  above-trend bursts, particularly through at least the first half of 1996 So, it is up to us to make  some kind of assessment of the current uptick in economic growth  The arguments for a return to the sustainable path that are presented in the Greenbook  analysis are reasonable Exports, which accounted for much of the fourth-quarter growth, are  unlikely to provide a sustainable boost There were a number of unusual factors in the  fourth-quarter trade results, and going forward the strength of the dollar makes US goods more  expensive Turning to spending, although consumer spending was strong in the fourth quarter,  consumer debt may provide something of a constraint in the future This expansion is a bit too  ""long in the tooth"" to look to pent-up demand and in particular to leveraged consumer spending  on large items On a related front, housing activity seems to have slowed recently, but I believe  that the fundamentals are strong enough at least to allow housing to contribute to sustainable  economic growth Most forecasters have been looking to a slackening of business investment  Many businesses probably also recently expanded capacity and replaced equipment So, it is  questionable as to how long we are going to see large increases in business investment I  suppose that computers and communications equipment are the exception They seem to involve  a bottomless spending pit Again, spending in this area should at least be adequate to keep us on  a sustainable growth path On the other hand, fiscal policy is likely to be a bit of a constraint  Having bought into the arguments for a slackening of growth going forward, let me  hasten to point out that there do remain some significant areas of strength in the economy and  there may be some room for surprises First of all, the labor market continues strong Even if    2/4-5/97  we do not get to that 5 percent unemployment rate forecast in the Greenbook, it is still a strong  market Although some households may be constrained by their personal debt levels, it seems  reasonable to expect consumption to continue at a level at least in step with income growth In  view of the strength of income of late, consumer spending could feasibly create unanticipated  demands I think confidence measures support this scenario  In another area, business investment has been a consistent surprise during this  expansion and consistently underestimated The same fundamentals that brought these surprises  could still be present These include strong profits and cash flows, the low cost of capital, a  ready availability of credit, falling computer and communications equipment prices, and the  emphasis on efficiency and productivity that has inspired a number of firms to continue to invest  The stock market is another area where we always have to say that there is room for  surprises Either we have an irrationally exuberant market or it is fundamentally driven No  matter what the verdict, either could provide continued sources of investment funding for firms  and the wealth effect should continue to support consumer spending  Where does all of this leave us with respect to inflation? Although recently it has  been benign, it is hard to believe that we can continue to enjoy this Goldilocks, just-right  economy forever without feeling inflation pressures Wage pressures already are being reported  anecdotally and are showing up in wage and compensation statistics Benefit cost constraints  may have run their course Maybe employers can make up the increased costs through  productivity, but it is hard to count on this very broadly in view of the recently disappointing  statistical history of productivity The staff is now suggesting that they are being optimistic in  estimating the new trend growth line at 9 percent Energy costs--and several people have    2/4-5/97  mentioned this--also have the potential for sustained pressures if crude prices do not fall back as  forecast I think the jury is still out there  In sum, I think the arguments for a return to a sustainable trend level of GDP growth  are fairly persuasive, but there are reasons to believe that the probabilities of stronger growth  accompanied by building price pressures are increasing  Thank you, Mr Chairman I agree with the proposal to retain  alternative I I do think, in terms of full Humphrey-Hawkins disclosure, that we should expand  the discussion in the Humphrey-Hawkins report and indicate that we think M2 and M3 growth  may well be near the upper ends of our 1997 growth ranges but that we are not confident that  there has been a return to a normal relationship between GDP and money growth So, I think we  should keep that discussion open  The other thing I wanted to mention is that I also, like you, find the  discussions of District developments at these meetings very useful, though others may feel that  they are a rehash of the Beigebook I do think that we could relate what we see in each of our  individual corners of the world to inflation and various measures of inflation either as a separate  discussion or as part of our initial economic go-around And I would like to see a broader  discussion of the various measures of inflation and how we think some of them are progressing  We have had a lot of changes--going to chain weights, for example In addition, there are the  arguments to be considered about the reliability of the CPI and how it should be measured A lot  of shifting is occurring now in these various measures of inflation, and I think it would be useful  for us to get back to a fundamental discussion of that As for commodity prices, I understand  that the world does not depend on corn prices, but for some people that is quite important I  think an analysis of some of those basic relationships and how they feed through from the initial  commodity prices, or gold for that matter, to final prices would be useful In sum, it would be  good for us to get back to basics  Thank you I support ""B"" asymmetric It seems to me that the  situation is fairly similar to where we were last summer My guess is that we will need to tighten  this year I have the impression that employers have run out of room in terms of their ability to  pass on price increases So, I think the inflation dragon is getting closer But I do believe that  we have time to assess whether the fourth-quarter strength will necessarily result in strained    2/4-5/97  resource utilization We should take advantage of the Humphrey-Hawkins report to prepare the  markets and also to explain our goal of price stability "
5924,1997-03-25,PHILLIPS," My goodness Well, I guess I am batting cleanup here Last  month we were trying to determine whether the returns for the fourth quarter of 1996 and  early 1997 constituted a temporary burst of energy and the economy was about to settle down  to the proverbial sustainable growth trend or whether those developments marked the  beginning of a stronger growth path It does appear that we have a bit more confirmation in  the direction of the latter than last time In addition, as Governor Meyer mentioned, we have  come out of 1996 with an economy that is operating at a higher level So, additional growth  could put significant strain on our product and labor markets  The areas of economic strength that have been confirmed since our last meeting  include consumer spending, which is supported by increases in income from a strong labor  market and perhaps even by stock market wealth effects Housing activity appeared to slow  in the fourth quarter, but it is now showing signs of reviving or at least continuing to operate  at a relatively high level In the business sector, we have persisting strength in profits and  cash flows, restructured balance sheets, and reasonably priced capital I see no reason to  expect a slowdown in expenditures for equipment or structures With demand holding up  and space shortages developing, we may continue to see strength in construction  expenditures with follow-along equipment purchases If anything, inventories are lean, so  the goods-producing industrial sector should be able to maintain its momentum This rosy  scenario does not mean that the business cycle is dead, just that it is a long cycle  Some of the stories that we see concerning the industrial sector are in a sense  showing a little more creativity I would point to the Business Week article this week that  indicated the technology industry is about to ""tank"" I must say that I have a hard time  swallowing that story Granted the technology industry is competitive and some fallout is    3/25/97  likely to occur among producers, the fundamentals for continued demand for information and  communications technology are not going to disappear  The monetary aggregates, although we have not been talking much about them  recently, are confirming the economic strength I believe that the industrial sector is aware  that it is about time for us to remove the punch bowl  The only area of weakness in the economy that has been confirmed since the last  meeting is net exports Although this sector is somewhat of a drag on US growth, strength  in the domestic economy significantly mitigates the effect Another area, which Governor  Rivlin mentioned, is the fiscal situation In a sense, stronger economic growth is improving  the chances of a successful budget deal  Turning to inflation, although ostensibly it appears fairly benign, I would argue  that there are growing signs of latent or pipeline pressures I would point to average hourly  earnings of non-supervisory production workers The anecdotal stories of labor shortages  and wage pressures are increasing, and employers certainly are getting more creative I hope  that productivity improvements will contain labor cost pressures, but it seems to me that  there are some limits to this process Governor Kelley referred to that issue There are some  commodity price pressures showing up President Moskow mentioned hogs, certainly a  prime commodity to which attention should be paid; other commodity price pressures may be  seen in metals, lumber, and coffee There also seems to be a lot of testing of the  sustainability of price increases With energy prices easing off, it is hard to know exactly  how quickly any of these pipeline pressures will show through to the CPI, but it seems to me  that we have moved further into the inflation alert zone    3/25/97  I support your recommendation to tighten 25 basis points I am  not sure how much tightening ultimately is going to be needed, but caution seems appropriate  when we change the direction of policy I support a 25 basis point move At 5-1/2 percent,  we may not be that far out of alignment, so symmetry seems like the right message to me "
5946,1997-05-20,PHILLIPS," Thank you, Mr Chairman It has been almost two months since  our last meeting, but in many ways the economic situation seems like more of the same  strong growth in both demand and production, continued expectations of a slowdown, and  inflationary pressures that generally seem to be contained I don't see any need to review all  the underlying factors, but I would like to comment on a few that seem particularly important    5/20/97  with respect to their contribution to the potential strength and length of the current expansion  The first factor I would point to is one that was mentioned by Gary Stem,  business fixed investment This is an area the strength of which generally has been  underestimated in this expansion, although the current Greenbook forecast does have a  higher increase in such spending Both construction and equipment expenditures have been  adding to capacity Not only is this investment allowing business firms to meet rising  demand without having to increase prices, but it may also be generating some productivity  increases This productivity hypothesis is supported by continued strength in profits I agree  with Governor Rivlin that we do not really know how this is happening, but we can see the  bottom line, which indicates that despite increases in unit labor costs--and those costs are  rising at a faster rate than general price increases--businesses have been able to maintain their  profits without raising prices  All of this business fixed investment has been supported by a very favorable  financial environment Not only has the financial environment supported growth, but it also  has allowed firms in the nonfinancial sector to strengthen their balance sheets Internal  financing has been available The bond market has been deep and liquid and has provided  significant debt financing opportunities I would note that the spreads on speculative-grade  debt are particularly low, so that even higher risk companies have had access to the debt  market at favorable rates Bank credit has remained available Commercial delinquencies  have been relatively low, so the outlook is good there Securitizations of commercial credits  have made this source of credit even more reliable On the equity side, we have seen IPO  issuance decline a bit from last year, but equity via IPOs is still available at a reasonable    5/20/97  price, particularly for firms with strong earnings outlooks In short, the availability of  financing will not be the culprit if business investment falls off  In the US economy, a forecast of the macroeconomy cannot ignore consumer  spending, but I'm not sure that the prospects for such spending have changed much I  continue to believe that the most likely outlook is for sustained growth in consumer  expenditures at a rate that about matches income growth, the so-called Goldilocks outlook It  is not too hot in that consumers are too leveraged to finance purchases with much more debt,  and pent-up demand is an unlikely factor at this late stage in the business cycle On the other  hand, it is not too cold in the sense that unemployment is low, sentiment is good, and the  wealth effects from the stock market should continue to provide some strength So, I do not  think that there is any reason to anticipate a slump in consumer spending  The federal deficit situation is one of the factors that could throw the economy off  this path to yet another soft landing, but as Governor Rivlin mentioned, the outlook for the  deficit is actually a little better The budget deal is good news, although we do have to  recognize that there are some structural budget problems that still have to be addressed We  certainly are a lot farther down that trail than we were several years ago  There can always be an external shock, and Mike Prell mentioned the possibility  of Mideast oil disruptions On the international side, net exports have been a drag on the  economy, but at least for now the domestic economy is strong enough to offset weakness  from the external sector In addition, the strong dollar has been providing some salutary  effects in the inflation area  It does seem to me that with this fairly strong outlook, the risk does remain on the  upside with respect to inflation It is hard to judge how long employers can continue to    5/20/97  absorb wage increases without raising prices I will say that I was comforted by the recent  inflation reports, and like President McTeer, I was particularly comforted by the decline in  the total PPI thus far this year and the rise of only 1 percent in the core PPI I would point  out, however, that after declining earlier the core CPI has now been flat for two years, so the  progress that we had been making in terms of this key inflation measure seems to have  stopped  To wind up, I do think that there are tentative signs of a slowdown in the  expansion and, as support, I would point to IP and to auto and retail sales in April I think  the risks to the economy are concentrated on inflation, but the news in that area indicates that  the near-term threat appears to have abated a bit recently  I could support ""B"" symmetric or asymmetric I do not have  strong feelings on the symmetry question because if we were to move in the intermeeting  period, I think there would be some kind of consultation I do think that tightening is  eventually going to be needed, but since inflation has been rather benign recently, it seems to  me that there is room to wait a bit longer As I said last time, I am not sure that a federal  funds rate of 5-1/2 percent is that far out of alignment, particularly if we get a slowdown in  the expansion or if productivity has moved us to a higher growth potential It does seem to  me that we have some time to let things play out a bit more, and I think it would be best to  conserve our monetary tools for now "
5967,1997-07-01,PHILLIPS," Mr Chairman, have wood mites attacked it? [Laughter]  Thank you, Mr Chairman A lot of the suspicions that we discussed  last time seem to be a bit more confirmed We have had some slowdown in consumption, at  least for March through May Inflation appears to have remained well behaved It seems to me  that the questions now before us cluster into two areas The first is whether we really are  experiencing a slowdown in the expansion If so, how much? Is this soft landing more of a  touchdown to be followed by a takeoff in the next few months? The second area of questions  clusters around inflation How is it possible that the inflation record has been so favorable?  How much longer can we reap the benefits of this benign inflationary environment? I have  structured my comments around these two sets of questions  First, with respect to the factors contributing to the length and perhaps to the  upcoming strengthening of this expansion, there is certainly the behavior of the labor market, as  has already been discussed around the table today People appear to be coming out of the    7/1-2/97  woodwork to join the labor force The consistent and now widespread reports of labor shortages,  hiring bonuses, and retention bonuses are impressive During the intermeeting period, I made  several trips to the Midwest and the West, and I met with several groups here at the Board I  have been particularly impressed by the labor shortage stories I never thought that I would be  hearing in-migration suggested and accepted as the answer to Iowa's economic challenges  [Laughter] Business people are now talking about and recognizing that they not only have to  locate and transport new workers, but they also have to train unskilled workers to meet their  production needs Clearly, this indicates that the labor market is going to be strong for a while I  am not sure that I can quite buy into the Greenbook forecast of a 46 percent unemployment rate  through 1998, but even if the rate drifts up a bit, it is clear that the US job machine is alive and  well Strong labor markets mean that people have the wherewithal to spend, and we certainly are  seeing the evidence of that in the aggregate numbers for retail sales and housing  The second area that has been contributing to the strength of this expansion is business  fixed investment I think the fundamentals remain for growth in that area The overall cost of  capital is low for short-term and long-term debt financing and for both internal and external  equity financing There is no capital shortage and certainly no credit crunch Profit levels have  been holding up, and that puts management in the mood to expand or at least to buy more  equipment to improve productivity The low inflation environment, I believe, is especially  conducive to capital investment In fact, declining prices for computers and information  technology make these investments particularly viable in the presence of tight labor markets  The gains in the productivity of capital seem to be encouraging additional investment The  technology story has been well documented, and I think firms are learning to manage inventories    7/1-2/97  more closely These two factors seem to feed on each other business investment creates job  opportunities, and a strong labor market allows continued growth in consumption and  aggregate demand I guess we have located or we are at least getting close to a zone of  sustainability  The second set of questions that I identified relates to inflation Why is it that we have  had such a favorable inflationary performance recently? That performance probably can be  attributed to a number of factors The strong dollar accompanied by low-inflation imports has  helped to control domestic inflation Increased business fixed investment has added to capacity  and improved productivity The macroeconomic weakness of the economies of some of our  foreign trade partners has alleviated commodity price pressures There have been no recent  energy or food shocks, and the farm outlook for 1997 is quite favorable also Now, lest we get  too cocky, we should remember that the BLS has made some improvements to CPI  measurement, shaving several tenths from the index President Moskow drew our attention to  this While this is quite a rosy outlook, I do see considerable risks The economy could turn out  to be stronger than we anticipate Consumers could reemerge and go on a spending spree As  the international sector strengthens, we should expect it to be less of a drag on GDP growth, but  concomitantly that may bring back some inflationary pressures With respect to inflation, at  some point wage pressures will start to bite Productivity improvements can only absorb so  much I believe a key area for us to watch is profit margins If we were to see significant profit  declines, investment activity would slow and that could trigger a sizable stock market correction  The possibility of such a development was certainly highlighted in the Greenbook    7/1-2/97  In sum, while we have seen a bit of a slowdown in the expansion, it may already have  come and gone or it may be on the way out It does seem to me a bit too soon to tell, but the risk  is that growth may be more than has been anticipated  Thank you I already mentioned to Dave Stockton that I thought this  memo was extremely well done I think it advances our knowledge and understanding of the  strengths and weaknesses of the various indices It helps to focus our attention on some of the    7/1-2/97  questions we should be looking at, including some that you raised, Mr Chairman I also thought  the memo made a good point in suggesting that perhaps we should be thinking about price  stability as opposed to arguing and thinking about various inflation indexes  One of the things I wanted to mention is my hope that some of the conclusions in the  memo and some of our discussion here will find their way into the Humphrey-Hawkins report I  say that because I think we need to give some thought to conditioning people to recognize that  we are thinking about a broad range of issues and trends as opposed to concentrating on just one  interest rate It is my impression that we are seen as focusing only on the fed funds rate when in  fact we are looking at some longer-term issues and what monetary policy can contribute to  sustainable economic growth In my view, some airing of the issues that we are looking at  would be a useful thing to include in the Humphrey-Hawkins report  I understand  I am thinking in terms of some of the conclusions of the paper,  including how some of the price indices may move together and what their biases may be I  believe publishing some of that would be very useful  Maybe not, but if we are never perceived as asking the questions, I  think we will not be seen as a very--  Tom, could you expand a bit on Exhibit 1, which shows growth in  federal debt turning up?  Does that take the current budget negotiations into account?  Okay  I am delighted to see that M2 is doing better I thought that the more  detailed memo that we received was very helpful and moved the ball a little farther down the  field I agree with your proposal, Mr Chairman; I do not think we should change the ranges at  this time But I would align myself with Jerry Jordan's comments because I think it would be  useful to start to talk about the way we see M2 changing  I am a bit more comfortable with the proposed first sentence because,  as Larry Meyer said, that is what we do That is what we have been focusing on, and I think we  should update that directive sentence I must say with respect to the symmetry sentence that I  worry about substituting one archaic expression for another I also feel that every time we vote  for a given symmetry, it is for a different reason When we vote for a particular symmetry at one  meeting, it does not mean the same thing as it does another time So, I am not sure that whatever  change we make in the wording of that sentence is going to help much  I agree with ""B"" asymmetric Since inflation and pipeline inflation  look pretty benign, it seems to me that there is time to see whether the economy will slow to a  more sustainable growth rate With regard to symmetry, since there is more likelihood that we  are going to tighten than to ease and since we adopted an asymmetric directive at the last  meeting, I think the asymmetry should be continued Should we tighten in August or early fall,  we would look rather foolish if we had just removed the bias I continue to believe that we will  have to tighten in view of the strong labor and equity markets, but it does seem to me that there  is time to let the situation develop a bit At 5-1/2 percent, the federal funds rate may not be that  far out of alignment, particularly as long rates have come down So, I think we should conserve  our monetary tools for now "
5993,1997-08-19,PHILLIPS," The Board of Trade is reviewing the feasibility of such contracts  Thank you, Mr Chairman We did get our second-quarter slowdown,  but the signs are now consistent with the continuation of the slower growth or the resumption of  somewhat above-trend growth So, it seems to me that the challenge for the Committee is to assess  the strength of the economy's momentum and the related prospects for inflation The press and  other more professional forecasters phrase our current dilemma as a dichotomy between a  lengthened or protracted business cycle and the so-called new age, new era, or new paradigm  economy characterized by enhanced but unmeasured productivity improvement, deepened capital  capacity, and less proclivity for inflation The truth is probably somewhere in the middle That is,  while there probably are technology-driven productivity improvements at least in some sectors, it is  hard to believe that business cycles have been exterminated  At this point, there is considerable strength in the economy The labor market not only  looks strong but it may have more flexibility than is implied by the current low unemployment rate  That is, employed people seem to be quite willing to change jobs Business is getting very creative  in finding ways to attract and train new workers and to stretch already taut labor markets Wage  pressures are probably uneven across different types of jobs and skill levels This may help to    8/19/97  explain the anecdotal stories we are getting about the lack of statistical evidence of widespread  wage pressures Whatever the outcome of this analysis, the low unemployment rate suggests a  continuation of consumption growth Housing and auto sales are holding up quite well for this  stage of the expansion  Another source of strength is business fixed investment, and I see no particular reason to  believe that this sector will fade Profits continue to be surprisingly strong The capital market is  supportive of further spending As long as aggregate demand holds up, business investment and  reinvestment are justified It does seem to me, however, that there is a confluence of events or  factors that have helped to hold inflation down in this favorable economic environment First, of  course, as has already been noted, is the strong dollar Relative economic weakness in foreign  competitor nations is alleviating supply pressures Various supply factors in the oil market have  kept world oil prices down, and this is a particular vulnerability for the United States economy  There has been good enough weather to prevent major problems in grain crops, thereby allowing  some replenishment of reserves and avoiding run-ups in food prices The recent pattern of  consumers taking a breather after a spending spree has helped to temper spiraling demand  Progress on the deficit has been made somewhat easier by a strong economy and a favorable  interest rate environment  If any of these factors change, the balance could be tipped in the other direction and  reverse the recent benign inflation situation World demand could heat up, creating supply  problems OPEC could get itself together and push oil prices higher The stock market could take  a dive off its recent roller coaster ride The El Nino and global warming could converge to wreak  havoc on agriculture Labor unions, or employees generally, could become more successful in  pushing wages up to a level that could not be absorbed by productivity improvements or profit hits,    8/19/97  resulting in final price increases Consumers could get so self-confident that they forget to take that  quarterly pause that has refreshed our economy  These are clearly upside risks for inflation, but none of them appears imminent In the  other direction, we could get a more ordinary inventory cycle, as Mike Prell has suggested, but  none of this is certain So, I believe that for now we are left to debate how long a sustainable  economic growth trend is sustainable  What is the purpose of differentiating between ""somewhat"" and  ""slightly?""  We have not worked that out  ""Somewhat"" is stronger than ""slightly?""  Well, this has not been clear to me in the past! [Laughter]  I am going to write that down so I won't forget it next time  Agree "
6016,1997-09-30,PHILLIPS," Thank you, Mr Chairman The second-quarter slowdown was so  shallow that we could easily have missed it Consumer spending did slow to less than 1 percent,  but we had an increase in inventory investment Even with that increase, inventories are still not  out of alignment Growth so far in the third quarter seems to be quite robust I am particularly  impressed by the uniform breadth of the pickup Resource utilization has to be getting rather taut,  especially for an expansion that has lasted so long This makes the recent inflation experience all  the more impressive  Going forward, there seems to be considerable strength in the economy Business fixed  investment is incredibly impressive, with support from falling computer prices In addition, there  are favorable returns for fixed investment in a wide variety of areas, not just computers This  strong investment performance also is supported by strong profits and cash flow, providing internal  financing The external financing market also has been quite favorable, with strong equity and  long-term debt markets Bank financing has also been available The balance sheets for both  financial and nonfinancial corporations seem to be in quite good shape With aggregate demand  appearing to hold up, I do not think there is any reason to assume that the nonfinancial sector of the  economy is going to fade unless labor becomes the dominant constraint to expansion    9/30/97  Turning to the labor market, I have argued for a number of months that there is probably  more flexibility in that market than is implied by the current unemployment rate But at some  point, it seems to me that flexibility has to run out The staff's projection of 4-1/2 percent  unemployment in 1998 strained even my optimism But I have been impressed to hear how many  people around the table have bought into that projection So, perhaps I will have to reassess that  skepticism  Businesses are still finding ways to economize on their workforce and attract new  workers through training programs, transportation gimmicks, and other approaches such as new  ways of looking at and trying to implement welfare-to-work initiatives But it does seem to me that  US demographics will not support job increases of 200,000 per month forever The wage  pressures that we now see in the high-tech and skilled areas eventually will be more widespread In  any case, the strong labor market and the business investment outlook augur well for continued  growth in consumption This leads me to concerns about resource and supply constraints Price  inflation has been held down by several favorable factors including the strong dollar and weakness  in the economies of international competitors that have been keeping pressure off commodity and  other supply prices We have not had any major supply shocks for several years in oil or  agriculture or wars and so on Even the much discussed El Nino does not seem to be having much  effect yet on prices Progress on the deficit has helped to ease long-term interest rates, thereby  lowering financing costs Inflation psychology appears to have been considerably reduced  Businesses and consumers seem to be unwilling to accept price increases  In sum, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the risk is on the upside for inflation But  I also think we have little recent historical experience to judge the impacts of some of the factors  underlying the ""new paradigm"" economy I would also throw in as significant in this argument the    9/30/97  lower federal deficits and a US economy that is now engaged in worldwide expansion Other  factors are global market integration and few worldwide supply shocks I cannot fully buy into the  new paradigm, but I agree that its proponents raise questions for which we do not have complete  answers It may well be that we are experiencing what is simply an elongated cycle and that more  traditional strains will soon be showing up  I also agree with ""B"" asymmetric The strength of the economy makes  the asymmetric directive appropriate In view of the recent inflation experience, I think there is  some time to let things develop before removing the punch bowl "
6039,1997-11-12,PHILLIPS," Thank you, Mr Chairman For the United States, October turned out  to be an Octoberfest of sorts There was plenty of activity, or froth, but it is still hard to tell if all  that market activity is only foam or if there is something of more substance underneath Like the  fall event in 1987, we may be witnessing another departure of Wall Street from Main Street, but  some stock market events do have real effects At this point, I think the jury is still out We are  all struggling to assess the depth and extent of the Asian flu, but practically speaking, the  forecast errors are extremely high The outcome is going to depend on how the various players  conduct their business going forward I think that to say much else would only add to the  speculation While it may be too early to diagnose the severity of the Asian flu affecting Wall  Street, we can make some comments about the health of Main Street  In short, the economy is doing extremely well in all sectors Business fixed  investment has been strong Inventory even appears low enough relative to sales that producers    11/12/97 81  should remain busy at least for the near term The labor market has remained strong  Consumers returned in the third quarter after the second-quarter pause  While the Main Street economy looks good, I cannot believe that the current rate of  economic growth is sustainable As I said at the last meeting, US demographics will not  accommodate forever the filling of 200,000 or more new jobs per month Strains are starting to  show up ECI wages and salaries have been increasing somewhat Reports of supply  bottlenecks are becoming a bit more frequent, for example, in transportation, at Boeing, and for  specialty skill workers Increased stock market volatility may be a sign of a fundamental  reassessment of the outlook for earnings by market participants If we get a 20 percent stock  market correction, economic growth will be slowed by reduced consumer spending from wealth  effects and by reduced business fixed investment as the cost of equity capital increases In  addition, profit pressures more generally may slow business fixed investment Moreover, the  Asian problems that we know about are likely to increase the drag that the external sector has on  US GDP growth  So far, the pressures on resources from strong economic growth have not shown  through to price inflation Recent statistics have been quite impressive, especially the deflators  reported in connection with the third-quarter GDP statistics Improved productivity undoubtedly  has contributed to this performance We also have to recognize that some of the credit for the  improving inflationary environment could be attributable to such temporary factors as the strong  dollar, the international competitive situation, and the lack of supply pressures The balance of  these factors may be shifting in light of an international situation that remains quite tenuous  Although arguments can be made that point to differing outcomes, I tend to think that, on    11/12/97 82  balance, inflationary pressures could be held at bay a while longer by the Asian turmoil To be  sure, inflationary pressures are still there, perhaps just below the surface  It is interesting to see discussions of deflation appearing more and more in press  analyses, and it is not just a few extremists who are putting forward arguments of worldwide  deflation I have a hard time buying into these arguments on a wholesale basis since so much of  the US economy is domestically driven and involves the services sector, which is less subject to  the effects of worldwide excess capacity I do, however, think that the people pressing the  deflation thesis raise some interesting points For example, how do we adapt to an environment  with upward price pressures in some sectors but falling prices in others? Also, what are the  effects of excess capacity in countries not dominated by market forces and thus less subject to  competitive cost and price pressures? I suspect that these may be topics for future discussion  In sum, however, the risks have shifted somewhat since the last meeting The real  economy is doing well and there is significant momentum in the short run, but some slowdown  must be coming Financial markets are unsettled The question, of course, remains whether this  is a temporary financial market event or whether there will be real effects not now anticipated  I also concur for the reasons that Mr Guynn just expressed "
6063,1997-12-16,PHILLIPS," Thank you, Mr Chairman What a difference a month makes! The  stock market has recovered from its 500 point decline The economy seems to be marching  ahead We have an incredible labor market and generally benign aggregate inflation, although  there is quite a split between inflation rates in the goods and the services sectors Services  inflation, largely affected by wages, more than offsets price stability or deflation in the  commodity and goods sectors I think that managing in this dichotomous situation is going to be  a challenge for monetary policy So far, demand and growth are holding up quite well this  quarter We even hear debates about how to spend the federal surplus  Under normal conditions, we would expect the current momentum to carry the  economy forward at a rather high level of activity well into 1998 However, the depth of the  Asian problems is still unknown What is certain is that no one can say that the Asian turmoil  has bottomed out or that the situation in that part of the world is under control I expect that the  upcoming debates about funding the IMF and the use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund will  not shore up confidence in contemplated solutions In the near term, the apparent inability or  unwillingness to make changes, particularly in Korea and Japan, makes the prognosis somewhere  between uncertain and grim The terms ""denial,"" ""haven't got a clue,"" and ""no political will""  seem to crop up continually in assessments of the Asian economies The high Asian saving  rates, the culture or Asian way of doing business, and their economic growth history appear to be  dulling corrective response actions  In the United States, we see only the beginnings of an awareness of the potential  problem and its effects on US economic activity Firms are now starting to assess sales  forecasts, profit outlooks, and related investment plans In any case, a widening of the US trade    12/16/97 48  and current account deficits is certain More generally, we have been expecting slower growth to  occur in the United States We may be seeing some very tentative signs of developments that  could lead eventually to a slowdown As mentioned, net exports clearly will be diminished by  the Asian flu and by the strength of the dollar Labor shortages may directly curtail expansion  plans in some cases In other cases, firms that are unable to raise prices to pass on higher labor  costs may find that expansion or investment plans simply will not pencil out Profits seem to be  coming under pressure Classic bottlenecks also are showing up, for example, in transportation  In short, the staff forecast of a reduced rate of business fixed investment makes sense Although  the fundamentals remain reasonably strong in terms of current cash flows and sales as well as the  cost of capital, the risk to investment has risen considerably The flattening of the yield curve is  another indicator that some slowdown is likely Inflationary expectations appear to have abated  Looking at the stock market volatility, I am hoping that it is reflecting a fundamental  reassessment of prospects by investors  Turning to inflation and productivity, despite press debate on the subject, the  productivity picture appears to be getting a bit clearer We have seen some improved statistics  recently There is some recognition of improvement by economists More attention is now  being directed to trying to understand what is going on in different sectors of the economy  Capacity increases help to explain the performance of inflation to some extent We may now be  witnessing some of the benefits of a low inflation or stable price environment persisting  economic growth, strong balance sheets, and sufficient confidence in forecasts to carry low  inventories and make capital investments    12/16/97  In sum, international uncertainty has heightened, but the US economy is doing quite  well for the moment It is better to be facing this higher-risk international situation with a US  economy that is not fragile  I support your recommendation of ""B"" symmetric There is no  pressure to act now It seems to me that there is time to see how things play out Given the  shape of the yield curve, the recent inflation experience, and the inflation outlook, I have to  question the direction and timing of the next move This seems to me to be an argument for  removing the asymmetry from the directive "
6090,1998-02-03,PHILLIPS," I nominate Alan Greenspan  Thank you, Mr Chairman The year 1997 turned out to be a  very good year, no matter how we look at it Output expanded The US jobs machine  was alive and well Salaries and wages recorded real growth A balanced federal budget  came into in sight Overall inflation was relatively well contained; goods inflation  appeared to be about nonexistent, but inflation in the service industries did persist at  about 3 percent I don't think the 1997 growth rate is sustainable and strains are starting  to show Some of the reports around the table today have provided examples of labor  shortages that now appear to be hampering some kinds of investment activity Increases  in labor costs show signs of edging higher at least in some areas Although increases in  compensation costs have been offset by increases in productivity, it is questionable as to  how long that process can continue Since the US economy is service-oriented and costs  are under pressure in that sector, it is hard to believe that aggregate inflation will be held    2/3-4/98  at bay forever, but the indicators are better at least for the near term, particularly on the  goods front  While the US economy is strong, Asia remains the big unknown Had the Asian  situation not occurred, effectively reducing the outlook for expansion in the United States  and indeed perhaps world growth, I think something else would have happened to slow  things down We could have had a stock market correction Inflation could have heated  up Demand, particularly in the labor markets, could have outstripped supply, and we  could have seen more of an increase in salaries and wages More likely, preemptive  monetary policy would have been necessary It seems to me that the Asian crisis is  simply the trigger for the emergence of a slowdown that was bound to happen  That leads to the next question, how much of a slowdown will we get? I find  myself more optimistic than the staff in that I anticipate a more sustainable growth rate of  2-1/4 to 2-/2 percent for 1998 The fundamentals that made 1997 so strong have not gone  away a strong labor market and a good climate for continued investment--adequate cash  flow, profits that seem to be holding up at least for now, reasonably low-cost capital, and  strong balance sheets Consumer spending should also hold up as long as employment is  sustained, and if the mortgage refinancing boom continues, consumer spending should  support economic growth in 1998, or at least there shouldn't be much of a slowdown in  the growth of consumer spending I admit that Asia is likely to be a decelerating factor,  but even Asia creates some crosscurrents for US economic growth  In sum, there clearly are risks and they may have increased But unless the stock  market declines more than the staff assumes or unless the Asian situation produces more  unanticipated surprises, the expansion should slow to a more moderate growth path in    2/3-4/98  1998 with inflation contained in the near term If and when conditions stabilize in Asia,  inflationary pressures are likely to resume for all of the traditional reasons, but it does  seem to me that the timing is pushed out for now  I also prefer alternative I It is interesting to observe that M2  growth is coming into closer alignment with the Committee's goal of price stability I  could at some point live with alternative III for many of the reasons that Governor Meyer  stated At this point, no change would be needed in the M2 and M3 ranges and the lower  range for debt in this alternative would give us a consistent interpretation of the three  ranges My memory of how we got to alternative I is not quite the one that has been  suggested I don't think we were thinking in terms of inconsistency when the current  ranges were set As I recall, it was more that monetary growth was falling considerably  I have agreed with keeping the M2 and M3 ranges consistent with price stability during  the intervening years, and I think that retaining alternative I is appropriate for now But at  some point we will want to contemplate moving toward alternative III  I support your recommendation of ""B"" symmetric "
6115,1998-03-31,PHILLIPS," Thank you, Mr Chairman The expansion is now entering its eighth  year The situation is starting to feel a bit surreal, perhaps even unbelievable Every facet of the  US economy is surprisingly strong GDP output continues to expand briskly Housing activity  is up The labor market remains extremely tight, yet employers have managed to contain costs  by productivity improvements, capital investments, and creative labor-management approaches  Throughout this process, capacity actually has expanded To date inflation generally has been  contained, although I would note that the spread between core commodities inflation and  services inflation does remain The oil price downturn is bad for some, but for others and in the  aggregate it is helping to control costs  Financial markets have been supportive of expansion Stock markets, bond markets,  and all forms of short-term financing including bank financing generally are available The  stock market may be too good to be true, and I must say that this is the first time that I have felt  really uncomfortable about the market The monetary aggregates also are indicating strong  growth I recognize that some of the growth in the aggregates may be the result of temporary  factors and more generally may just be reflective of contemporaneous economic growth Even  so, the monetary aggregates are pointing to significant strength  So far, the Asian crisis has on balance been more positive for the United States than  negative Indeed, the rest of the world seems to be relying on the United States as the engine to  get their economies going  I keep thinking that something has to give The rate of economic growth in 1997 and  the apparent rate of growth that we are experiencing in the first quarter are not sustainable But  where is the slowdown going to come from? If we started to see a deterioration in profits, that  probably would be an indication that firms are no longer able to offset their increasing labor    3/31/98  costs That in turn would surely trigger a stock market downturn, and we would start to see a  diminishing wealth effect Inflation could heat up, although I think that is a bit more unlikely in  view of the absence of much pressure worldwide on commodity prices But inflation could still  heat up and that would cause a deterioration in aggregate demand Again, as I said, I think that is  fairly unlikely  The Asian crisis could turn more negative Indeed, although conditions seem to have  stabilized in Thailand and Korea, it is hard to know whether or not some of the long-term  changes that need to be put into place in those countries actually are going to occur Unless  conditions in those countries become more transparent, and I mean transparent Western style,  reduced foreign capital for investment will limit their economic growth Absent bank  supervisory reforms and a shoring up of domestic bank balance sheets, the proverbial credit  crunch will slow their recoveries We say that there are cultural differences when we try to  understand what is going on in Asia, but it is difficult to determine how these cultural differences  are going to play out in a crisis environment and whether some of these countries are going to  make the long-term changes that are needed to stabilize their economies So, even though it  appears that conditions have stabilized, at least in two of these countries, the jury may in fact still  be out with regard to the long-term economic performance of those countries Certainly, we  cannot say that conditions have stabilized in Indonesia, and they have not yet started to improve  for Japan For the United States, the latter is a bigger risk  For now, I think the balance of the risks seems to have shifted toward stronger growth  The slowdown from Asia is starting to show up, but it has not exerted much restraint thus far,  and in fact it is hard to know how much of a restraining effect it will have Inflation, which has  been helped by weaker oil prices, has been quite well contained, but unless the expansion slows,    3/31/98  the traditional pressures from scarce resources, in labor markets in particular, will have to be  passed on via higher prices  Thank you I think we can hold off for now I do not see any  immediate pressure to act But unless the economy cools off, I believe we will have to tighten  With respect to symmetry or asymmetry, I think that if we were to act in the  intermeeting period, we would have a telephone conference anyway, so I'm not sure that the type  of symmetry we adopt means too much In that vein, I would not vote against asymmetry I  think a policy speech probably is better for now, but I agree with President Boehne that we  should be prepared to act shortly after that speech I also agree that it is the sustainability of  economic growth that is the issue, and that is what should be emphasized in our speeches I  believe that it probably would be useful to have a discussion to consider the possible release of  the directive after each meeting I have not at this point thought through the pros and the cons,  but such a discussion might clear up the question of whether symmetry or asymmetry means  anything So, I look forward to that discussion "
6141,1998-05-19,PHILLIPS," Yes, and I thought about that as I was reading Greenbooks over the  weekend [Laughter]  Thank you  Thank you, Mr Chairman As has already been mentioned, the US  economy is extremely strong, and the strength is all the more impressive in view of the drag that is  being exerted by developments in Asia and by the weakness in the agricultural sector that Gary  Stern just mentioned Central to this assessment, of course, is the labor market People are  working, spending money, buying houses and stocks, and baby boomers are planning for  retirement I'm going to focus my comments today on inflation and the stock market    5/19/98  First of all, by almost any measure inflation appears to be well contained, even  falling To be fair, some of the improvement in the CPI is accounted for by the statistical and  sampling changes, and much of the improvement in the broad indexes is accounted for by energy  Although that could turn around quickly, it does not appear that energy pricing is necessarily one of  those temporary serendipitous factors bringing about disinflation or even deflation More  importantly, in the current low inflation environment, businesses and households have available  very clear cost and price impulses reflective of pure supply and demand pressures That is,  inflation is not distorting market supply and demand pricing messages For example, weak demand  from Asia means that there is little pressure in international commodity markets Domestic service  and other labor intensive markets that are not directly affected by international competition are  seeing some price increases Although there are exceptions, even wage pressures seem mostly  confined to the high labor demand areas like those for computer specialists, stockbrokers, and other  capital market or risk management people Some of that pressure is showing through in the  averages but not nearly as much as might be expected with a 43 percent unemployment rate  These clear market pricing signals have given employers the wherewithal to focus on their costs  and the final product price that the market will bear If the costs of production, investment, or  expansion cannot be recovered in the market, plans are changed Inventories can be more tightly  controlled with available technology Gone are the days of padding planning estimates of  production and budgets with the knowledge that inflation would provide room to cover production,  inventory, or other forecasting errors The result, of course, is significantly enhanced productivity  in today's economy This leads me to a few comments on the stock market  No matter what model is used, valuation comes down to a function of earnings and  interest rates It may be that market participants are forecasting improved productivity, which    5/19/98  implies higher earnings, or they may be expecting lower inflation, which implies lower interest  rates Either would support P/E multiples in the current range Or perhaps the bubble economy  article in The Economist a few weeks ago is right and the market is wrong Where does that leave  us? I for one think it would be a mistake to focus monetary policy on one segment of financial  asset prices, namely the stock market First of all, monetary policy is a broad-gauged tool that is  not sufficiently fine-tuned to single out one set of asset prices, particularly one a few equations  away from short-term interest rates The Economist and others have suggested that the bubble  could be pricked with a small rate hike But with the baby boomers focused on investing for  retirement, the market might bounce right back It probably would take a sizable interest rate  increase to move the market--one that would invert the yield curve--and such an increase probably  is not justified by the rest of the economy The move might have to be reversed shortly after it is  made in any event The better strategy, it seems to me, is to focus on the real economy and let  market participants do the stock market pricing  In summing where we are with the current economy, Asia remains a source of  uncertainty and for now US inflation is well contained But unless growth slows considerably  either from reduced final demand or inventory adjustments, our virtuous cycle could burn itself out  as inflation heats up Thank you  Thank you I think this is as close a call as I have had to make since  coming to the Fed  Yes, maybe that's right! I am going to end up concurring on ""B""  asymmetric The reason is mostly because inflation appears to be quite well contained Growth is  extraordinarily strong, but in view of the inflation situation, I think there is time to see how Asia  plays out That will take time, so I will be watching you guys! [Laughter] "
