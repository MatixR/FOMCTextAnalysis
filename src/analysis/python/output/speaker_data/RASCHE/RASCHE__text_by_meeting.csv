8572,2008-10-07,RASCHE,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  President Bullard has a prior commitment and   was unable to participate in the discussion  He’s asked me to present some comments to reflect his   views, and with your permission, I’d like to proceed     It is not desirable to implement a reduction in the intended funds rate at this   time  First, intermeeting actions should be reserved for those few instances in which significant   unforeseen developments with predictable consequences for the economy occur  The current   situation is highly volatile and unsettled  Clearly financial markets are experiencing great turmoil    However, we have established new risk facilities to address liquidity issues, including new facilities   in the past two days     The outlook for economic activity in the second half of 2008 has deteriorated  It is likely   that this period eventually will be labeled a recession  Probably the extent of the weakness is not   apparent at this time  The revised forecast from the Board’s staff as of last Friday is for real GDP to   be essentially flat for the current and final quarter of 2008  The Macro Advisers forecast from last   weekend has flat GDP for the third quarter and a 2 percent annual rate of decline in the fourth   quarter followed by weak but positive real growth in the first half of 2009  While the uncertainty   surrounding these forecasts may be greater than in a typical environment and while a good case can   be made that the risk to the forecast is weighted to the downside, there’s still a significant   probability that any recession will be quite mild  We have acted preemptively, aggressively, and   unilaterally since the beginning of the year against the risk of an economic slowdown  We can   afford to be patient until we have more information and can better assess the impact of recent   financial market events on the real economy   October 7, 2008 25 of 30    Second, a rate cut at this time carries downside reputational risk  After the decline in equity   prices over the past ten days, an action today could be perceived as an effort to shore up those   markets  Whether we like it or believe it, a significant population is convinced that we set policy to   provide a “Greenspan put” for the markets  A rate action under current conditions could reinforce   that perception  If there is a dramatic market rally before the next scheduled meeting, would we   entertain a reversal of any actions taken today?  Worse, if equity markets continue to slump between   now and the end of the month, would we entertain additional rate cuts solely for that reason?  At this   point it’s too soon to realize any impact of the TARP  The idea of a “Wall Street bailout” is not   universally popular, and commentators and pundits are already questioning whether it will succeed    A rate action today carries the risk that the Committee will be perceived as questioning whether the   TARP can achieve the desired results   Finally, an action today could be interpreted as a lack of confidence on the part of the   Committee in the efficacy of various liquidity facilities that have been announced or enhanced in the   recent past  Thank you  "
