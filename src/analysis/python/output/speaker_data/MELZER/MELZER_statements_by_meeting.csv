38,1987-08-18," Mike, I wanted to ask about short- and intermediate-term business demand How do you conceptualize the slowdown that is occurring there? How would you explain that?   Yes   I wanted to pass on just one piece of anecdotal information that bears to some extent on what Jerry and Bob Heller were saying one businessman in our District in the shoe business mentioned to me that they're running at essentially 100 percent of capacity now I sense that's close to true in textiles, and, at least in some respects, in the steel area So I mention that I guess what concerns me, when you think about this external adjustment process that Jerry talked about, is that we shut down capacity so quickly over this period of years that I think we are bumping up against capacity constraints in those industries a lot sooner than anybody could have anticipated I asked a logical follow-up question to this executive ""Well, are you going to expand capacity?"" In that case, they have closed facilities that they could probably reopen without a major capital investment But, basically, the message was that chief executive officers and financial officers, having been through this period of shutting capacity down for so long, are going to be very slow to make the investment to reopen As a result, even in these industries that have been depressed, I think the pressures on the labor markets are apt to build a lot faster, because the investment is not going to follow as quickly as it might have in a more orderly  -22-    8/18/87  period, if you will I wanted to pass that on; I thought that was interesting "
39,1987-08-18," I read that, at one point, to mean the opposite of what it is intended to mean I think it could be interpreted that way If you were worried about the slow growth, you might actually encourage--   I definitely would put the priorities on the side of worrying about inflation as opposed to the recovery I would favor ""B"" with a tilt toward tightening I could certainly accept a $600 borrowing target, although I'm not voting, so I don't need to accept it I'd feel particularly strongly about moving if I felt that we were sort of maintaining a 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent funds rate against a very strong demand for reserves Now, as you pointed out before, Mr Chairman, on the velocity argument, maybe we won't see that We're certainly not maintaining a lower funds rate than would otherwise prevail through rapid reserve injection here; but that's where I come out I would be inclined to leave language in there about the dollar I think if we lost control of the dollar on the downside, we could kick off that whole cycle that we dealt with just a couple of months ago; and I'd be very sensitive to weakness in the dollar in the language "
93,1987-09-22," Peter, you reported on the first 11 days; there is apt to be a pretty large borrowing spike Wednesday How would you expect that to be interpreted in this environment? This is a period that has had some technical problems with the tax date, so I guess you are not going to be able to conclude much from that either "
94,1987-09-22," Mike, if this linkage between dollar weakness and inflationary expectations isn't broken, and you weren't able, for example, to achieve over the forecast period the 10 percent annual of decline in the dollar--let's just say that that becomes impossible-- how would that affect the forecast in a broad sense? In other words,  -11-    9/22/87  if you couldn't achieve some of the external adjustment through the foreign exchange price mechanism--   What I'm saying is that the box we are in right now is that, as a practical matter, if we tolerate that dollar decline, it kicks off inflationary expectations So, let's say that you just assumed that the dollar was stable How would that affect the forecast?   First of all, I would say that over the last year or so, performance in our District has been somewhat stronger than the national average Employment has been about in line, retail sales somewhat stronger, and I guess the most notable area of strength has been construction, both residential and nonresidential Over the last couple of months, I would say things have slowed a bit, relatively speaking We haven't kept pace with the employment gains nationally either in non-ag employment or manufacturing employment Retail sales have held up well, relatively speaking Residential construction is in line with the national averages and nonresidential is still somewhat stronger but growing at a much slower pace than it was Anecdotally, we've picked up some evidence of the same thing that has been mentioned around the table today in terms of labor shortages There was a company with about 90 semi-skilled employees that was shut down, and another big employer in St Louis in town  -24-    9/22/87  expected to pick up, I don't know, somewhere on the order of a third to a half of them It ended up getting only five of them, because there were so many other people bidding You hear that in other areas as well One other thing I've heard in that regard is that companies that have generally been stable in terms of employment, or maybe even reducing employment here, recently have added employees There are some noises about trying to negotiate some of the give-backs that were obtained over the last couple of years I've heard just one example of that; it's not widespread  On the broader outlook, while I have been, and continue to be, in agreement with putting the priority on price stability versus growth, the projections that come out of our Bank, which are based on money-driven models, have been showing for some time--and I thought I would mention it this month--the risk of a sharp slowdown in the economy in 1988 and even the possibility of a recession Given the behavior of velocity and so forth, I think it is hard to evaluate this exactly, but one of the things that people continue to feel reasonably strongly about is the effect of a sharp slowing in money in relation to trend, if it is sustained for two or more quarters And, it's really on that basis that we come up with this forecast So, that's a very different view than previously expressed I think it's difficult to evaluate because you can't know the effect of all the liquidity that was put in over the last couple of years, and whether that might continue to have a stimulative effect looking forward  One last point on the interest rate question I suspect it's a combination of an increase in inflationary expectations and some increase in the real rate The only other thing I would mention that hasn't already been mentioned is that we are at, or have passed through, a major inflection point in terms of the interest rate outlook that's internalized in, say, the minds of traders and so forth; and people I would say, as we do, just follow markets quite closely, very quickly But, in terms of broad-based behavior, I think that really gets built into prices over a surprisingly long period of time I think one of the things we are seeing here is people continuing to adjust portfolios to a different interest rate outlook, and probably thinner participation in the market, at least on the buying side, by final investors So, I think there's a certain element of uncertainty associated with this adjustment phenomenon "
95,1987-09-22," I would align myself with Bob Forrestal's position ""B"", with a $500 million borrowings target and asymmetric language The main thing that is influencing me is a longer-term view and, I guess, trying not to get out of position And I think Bob Black said it any way you look at this--whether you look at rates, at the provision of reserves, or at the behavior of the aggregates--over the course of this year, we have taken some significant steps And I am not quite sure, as I expressed earlier, what the impact of that is going to be But, being an old market participant, when everybody thinks the same there's a chance that it won't work out that way Sometimes you get a little afraid of a consensus that is apparently that strong Having said all that, I could certainly accept ""B"", with a $600 million borrowing target and symmetric language But I have a slight preference for the position Bob Forrestal mentioned   Although there will be a perception for a while that we did, I think, as the $600 million shows through-- "
150,1987-11-03," Peter, on your assumption of excess reserves of $12 billion, how long do you think that will be in place? "
151,1987-11-03," Echoing what Gary Stern said on the retail front, I talked to national retailer in our area and he said they looked at the week-by-week comparison of sales at their outlets throughout the country in the two full weeks since October 19, and only one store showed a decline in that first week That was the World Trade Center store and sales picked up in the second week He is really quite optimistic; his attitude is that this is not going to have an impact Now, you  -20-    11/3/87  have to believe that the loss of wealth, long-term, will have some impact But I guess my own feeling, based on this isolated comment and other comments I have heard, is that it's a little too early to try to sort it all out and to decide how to respond in a long-term sense  The other comment that I wanted to make is that the area that shows particular strength in our District is manufacturing employment Implicit in what Jerry Corrigan was saying about the risks of a lower dollar, it seems to me, would be the inflationary risk at a micro level I think what we have been seeing in terms of pressures on capacity and wage rates has really been on the manufacturing side When I say that, I base it on anecdotal evidence; I don't mean that it has been reflected in the data And to the extent that a rapidly declining dollar causes a more rapid external adjustment in [the manufacturing] area, it seems to me that we could get greater price pressures in those industries that are producing for export or are import competitive--the shoe industry, the apparel industry, and some other industries where even before the most recent developments, we were already hearing reports of some pressure So I think on the inflation front, that is something to be mindful of on the micro level "
152,1987-11-03," I favor alternative ""B"" I have one question I want to raise If you look at the directive in the policy record that comes out Friday and then you look at this language here, it's really not clear what ""existing"" means Nowhere in the policy record is it memorialized that there was an adjustment in the borrowing target; we don't put borrowing targets in there I think it was generally perceived, but it is not recorded there in any fashion That may be something to think about In any case, I would like to express a little concern along the lines of what Jerry said about balance here There has been a major shift in policy; and the broad perception of policy, I think, was that we were headed toward further degrees of tightening at the last meeting That has been washed out and there has been some easing Now, on the balance side my argument would be this I guess I never felt that we could defend a particular level of the dollar--that's going to be set by market forces So, maybe now the fact that the dollar has moved down and there haven't been major  -34-    11/3/87  adverse effects to that is okay In the short run I think we can influence how that transition to the different levels takes place and whether it's orderly or not But it seems to me that any changes in monetary policy that we make now add to the perception that all that is happening is that the dollar is adjusting to reasonable market levels What I'm trying to say is, if it's perceived beyond that that monetary policy is being conducted in a fashion that we really think we have the latitude to run out of sync with the rest of the world, that would be very damaging to that future psychology that you've described In other words, I think we have lost the flexibility to ignore what goes on in the rest of the world here Policy coordination is important and I hate to see us take a policy stance in the short run that might fuel that perception that we somehow backed off the need to do that for all the reasons we have discussed on the financial and the real side today So, in any case, I favor ""B"" and symmetrical language I think Variant I is fine but I come out where Bob Black is in a sense there are too many statements in there dealing with the extraordinary circumstances; it might convey more of a sense of uncertainty about current conditions than we want to convey I think I'd stick with what Bob suggested on that first statement--   Well, I think what he was saying was stay with the desire to ensure the provision of adequate liquidity But the statements about flexibility in open market operations in lines 90 and 91 and then around line 105 or so in the part about the frequent consultations would be thoughts I would be inclined to take out I think our actions are more important than our words, and I think the perception of our actions in the financial markets is a positive one I think the perception is we are doing the right thing   It will be?   Right; so in the verbiage that leads up to this directive we are indicating--   I think that's fine   If we are adopting the existing degree of reserve restraint now, that somehow implies that a change, in a policy sense, occurred prior to this action   But let me ask you this, Don If there had been a telephone call at which that was specifically put to a vote would it then have been reported as an addendum?   You know, that's a small subtlety   When you say ""apart from such considerations,"" it seems that it's not necessary down below to have ""conditions in the financial markets"" in there again  -44-    11/3/87   You need a comma after ""would,"" too "
203,1988-03-29," I favor the normal operating procedures, pre- October, without the additional flexibility The reason I say that is that, in my mind, we've gone as far on this spectrum as we can go toward funds rate targeting And for a lot of reasons, all of which have been said--political, the relationship of the funds rate to our economic goals, and so forth--I would rather look at our business as being defined in terms of reserves, not interest rates And frankly, even though it might be perceived by us as a subtle shift, if we begin giving Peter directions in terms of the funds rate, eventually that's going to become known And I think there's a point of intellectual honesty in terms of communicating that to the public I don't think we can do that and expect that it will not become known Then there will be an issue of why this change in procedures wasn't communicated  The final point I would make--it can be made even with what we're doing now, but even more so if we went to a funds rate target-- is that to be consistent with what has been done in the past, we certainly would have to go to a proviso on some aggregate In other words, you would have to have that balance in there Just as we now talk about a degree of reserve restraint, subject to fluctuation in the funds rate, if you went to a funds rate, it would have to be subject to some constraint on a narrow aggregate, in my judgment That's all I have "
204,1988-03-29," I want to comment on a particular area of activity commercial construction We had a group in recently and a couple of things came out of the discussion that really surprised me, in terms of psychology St Louis and the District in general have lagged the national economy in this area We have not had the overbuilding that occurred elsewhere, so I don't know if these observations are broadly applicable We kicked off the discussion by talking about the external adjustment process and what the implications of that were for savings and investments--to see whether these real estate people were seeing any pressures on the financing side And what we heard is that they are literally awash with money-- foreign money, insurance company money, [unintelligible] October 19 Nobody mentioned that there was a flow of monies into real estate because of inflationary expectations The other thing that we did not pick up in this discussion, which surprised me, was any sense of caution about the ability to build space, lease it up, and so forth Well, I shouldn't say that--there was one person who was somewhat cautious But the general mood was ostensible optimism Finally, I was surprised at what I heard on the inflationary front people on the building side said that they could still build things for what it cost them four years ago I asked specifically about steel Two people said that the one area where they picked up some sense of price pressure was on the operating side--that it was difficult to make the kind of margins they would like to make So, I relate that discussion  I also have some observations about what is going on with the takeover and LBO activity and so on Last night we met with an investment manager who was saying that junk bond spreads to Treasuries are as narrow as they have ever been historically, and the GIC market is very tight just because there isn't enough high yield product out there to satisfy the demand And I think to myself, here we are three, four months or so after October 19 and there is all this leveraging and speculative activity going on at a time when, frankly, I would like to see a little more caution  I think we are all comforted that consumer confidence has held up But at the moment there is a lot of liquidity out there I'm not saying that we provided it; I don't mean to suggest that we have been pumping in a lot of reserves But, if you look at the construction industry on the inflation front, it's kind of a tinder box waiting to go off If the inflationary psychology tips there, and that gets factored into interest rates, people will try to move very quickly to lock in financing and begin building before the inflation    3/29/88  hits I think it could create a surge in spending I am somewhat concerned about that aspect, and as I say, just in general about the speculative activity--the highly leveraged type of activity--that resumed so quickly after October 19 "
235,1988-05-17," I've followed the moves that have been taken, but my sense is that, in effect, they are rather small following moves I think at some point we're going to have to step out in front of this situation if everything we've heard today is correct And that's going to take something more on the order of alternative C The timing issue has been talked about I would guess--and again, Mr Chairman, I think you did the right thing by moving within your latitude--that if you had the benefit of all this discussion you might have moved it a full 50 basis points, and we wouldn't get into two increments of 25 basis points Because of this view that I think we have to get in front and make a strong statement, I would favor ""C""; but I could certainly accept a ""B"" with asymmetrical language--$100 million now and $100 million later   [Unintelligible] because I think it tends to support [the view] that there is a desirability of having such a constraint Now, one argument you can make is one that was in the follow-up memo I sent around, and I think we've just witnessed it in our discussion And that is the difficulty of coming to grips with, in effect, targeting interest rates; it is difficult to deal with that process without some tool that enables you to take a longer-term view,  -18-    5/17/88  which I think the constraint does Don, having complimented you on your memo, let me just say--I'm not going to criticize--but I can't really say any better than it was said in that memo why I think this type of constraint would be desirable This is on page 10 ""Generally, periods of rapid growth in the base in recent years have been followed, with a lag, by a tightening of monetary policy In some cases (1983, 1986) these have been periods in which the Federal Reserve had been easing Greater attention to the base might have tempered the degree to which policy was previously eased, reducing the need for subsequent tightening, and damping the cyclical variations in interest rates, albeit at the expense of somewhat greater short-term interest rate volatility"" I think that in a nut shell makes the case right there Again, I'd say that just the short experience I've had here on the Committee would tend to support that  With respect to the question of targets versus a constraint, I personally would be much less inclined to adopt a base target Now, I think you could say that the base might have an advantage in that it is more directly controllable than any of the other aggregates that we presently target Its relationship to our ultimate goals of policy is not better And I guess I fear, and it's implied in Don's memo, that if we just decide here today, let's say, to set target ranges for the base instead of M1, we're actually going to hurt ourselves in the process If it is treated as the other aggregates have been--in effect, that we set the target but then we're willing to violate it--I think that could do more harm than good, frankly, to the credibility of this process So, I'm not saying there aren't any circumstances under which I would ever favor a base target, but I don't think this is the right time I don't think the econometric analysis could support that being the desirable thing to do  With respect to the constraint itself, there's a suggestion of a four-quarter moving average, which troubles me in this sense I think it basically defeats the purpose of what the constraint does, which is to put some real limits on how fast or slowly the base can grow in any one quarter Technically, with the 5 to 9 percent that has been used for demonstration purposes, if you will, with a four- quarter moving average you could have base growth rates of 20 percent, 20 percent, -2 percent, -2 percent, and back to 20 percent In effect, you could have the same kind of volatility and still meet the constraint and, I think, suffer the adverse economic consequences that that kind of volatility in base growth occasions Also, I think this four-quarter moving average would have some of the same potential problems as an annual target--namely, that if the base grew very slowly for two or three quarters, or very rapidly for two or three quarters, and you were approaching the end of the four-quarter moving average period, you'd be faced with a decision of whether to adjust the growth abruptly in the base to stay within this constraint, or to ignore it I think our experience has shown us that, typically, that's a hard decision to make And I think that, too, could undermine the credibility of this [procedure]  I guess there are two points I'd like to make in connection with this When I suggest this 5 to 9 percent range, or whatever, I'm not saying that it should never be ignored I think, in practice, it probably would be observed most of the time But there could be situations where we choose to ignore it and, as has been pointed out, those situations very likely would be associated with the behavior of  -19-    5/17/88  currency But that's something we can observe Our analysis on currency has indicated that where there have been aberrations in the growth rate, they have tended to be reversed within a quarter or two But if we had a situation like that, I think it would be related to broad economic circumstances that we would generally understand and could explain; and we could very easily justify violating the constraint But, in general, I don't think it would be violated The final point I would like to make is that I agree with the work that Don and the others did in terms of the nonborrowed base--that from the controllability point of view it would have an advantage I guess what I'm not so sure about is whether we lose something in a conceptual sense, because the base is something people are familiar with Do we lose something in the conceptual sense to go to a more esoteric concept like a nonborrowed base? I could live with either one, but I prefer the base and not the nonborrowed base; I'd live with the short-term controllability problem as, over time, I think it can be controlled I think that's all I would care to say right now, Mr Chairman   Frank, to some extent, though, there would have been reaction to the very slow growth of the base that took place all the way through 1981 and a good deal of 1982   Well, I know; but you can't just pick up on some--   That's all I'm saying   Frank, do you know what reserves would have grown at in 1986 to meet the constraint on a quarterly basis? The answer is 9 percent, 14 percent, 13-1/2 percent, and 12 percent And that would have brought us inside the constraint To me, that is very healthy reserve growth, taking into account what currency did And it may well have necessitated much less of a reaction in the other direction in 1987   It was 16 percent for 1986 91 percent in the first quarter; 166 percent; 193 percent; and 194 percent   Again, Frank, one thing I would point out is this difference between a constraint and a target If you were targeting the base, I don't know that you'd be setting a 4 or, as Don even mentioned, a 5 percentage point range And in my mind, there is a big difference If you widen that range out and you're only trying to pick up the excesses at the peak, that's a lot different than relying on a target The second thing I would--   That's correct Well--or you wouldn't allow it to get above it   Well, the only problem I have with that is that it just puts it in a category of things that don't really impact our policy decisions at all I don't think the targets have a heck of a lot of credibility either within this room or outside this room And I think what is proposed has the ability really to influence policy actions, at the extremes, in a very constructive way And I don't know that you get that with what you're suggesting It would be easier to explain; there's no doubt about it   Wayne, those numbers are simply for the sake of example What I've laid out is a framework I think it would be up to the Committee to set the bands, so that's quite--   Jerry, on those situations you commented on, I would just observe that those clearly would be situations, under the way this has been articulated, where the Committee could decide to violate it, and simply be obligated to explain it And I think in both cases--   I think there could be, Wayne But I think we're talking about a fairly extraordinary period--only two situations in eight years that might require that  -26-    5/17/88   Well, in a sense, I think that's good It would cause the Committee to think very carefully about whether or not we ought to be violating it If we do, consciously, then we explain it Right now when we violate a monetary growth range, we get into explanations of velocity I just don't think that that is something that is bought by the public on a broad basis It just sounds like you are talking your way around the issue with technical phrases and so forth   One thing I'd say, Manley, is that there's no way around it our business is money--whether we like it or not and no matter how difficult it is And I think people would generally agree that inflation is a monetary phenomenon   And, finally, I think in our discussion at the last meeting, people who have had a lot of experience around this table kind of spelled out the difficulties we have if we view our business as being one of interest rates and don't have some kind of a counterbalance based in money and reserves To do that just because of the inherent opportunities--   And that hurts again   Where are you looking?   What the proposal envisions is the average growth rate for the next quarter from the prior quarter's average Are you looking at growth rates, Mike?   Okay So, first of all, what would the first month in one of those quarters you were talking about imply in terms of level for the average of the quarter?   Well, let me put it in the context of where we are right now   Well, first of all, I think the staff would have some ability to project what they expected to happen in terms of the growth [vis-a-vis] what we were trying to hit as an average for the quarter There could be a circumstance where it would require some response reasonably early in the quarter If you look at where we are right now in this quarter, we are probably right at, or preciously close to, the level that would be permitted by a 9 percent upward bound   Okay But you just can't look at the monthly growth rates; I think you have to look at the level And, if I looked at these correctly--I'm looking at the St Louis base--we are roughly at where I think a 9 percent constraint would be, or a little below it So, you would have to be asking yourself at a meeting like this Should I be taking a step now to slow that thing down?  -31-    5/17/88   Yes   Right   I guess to the extent I thought about that part of it, I've just been looking at the average for one quarter in relation to the average for the next I would think you could do it well   Yes   Sure I would think that would be quite possible, wouldn't you Don? Not to make decisions--  -32-    5/17/88   I think there's an advantage to having something in that type of equation that relates to what we do day-to-day in carrying out monetary policy "
279,1988-08-16," Mike, I wondered on the personal consumption expenditures, does the greater amount of floating rate debt--home equity loans as well as ARMs--in this cycle have a significant impact there?   Anecdotal information that I've picked up in some recent calls would tend to confirm what's in the Greenbook For example, I would describe retailers as guardedly optimistic August got off to a good start in the first week and then was somewhat slow in the second week, but I think that was felt to be largely weather- related In general, I think retailers feel that they've got their inventories in pretty good shape They don't feel terribly exposed and they are guardedly optimistic about the prospects here  On the manufacturing side, you pick up the sense of strength still in capital goods orders--backlogs, and so forth The commentary    8/16/88  on the raw material price increases over the last year or so is that there's still some evidence of difficulty in passing all of that along In the District itself, our numbers for the most recent quarter, which would be the second quarter, reflect what Bob Forrestal has described Some employment declines show up in construction, textiles and apparel, food processing, and the like But in general, we have paralleled the rest of the country I don't attribute too much to this weakness I think it has to do, as Bob said a while ago, with the fact that there's strength elsewhere as opposed to signs of imminent weakness in our District "
280,1988-08-16," I may be a little confused, but I think this is the third time we are discussing this, and it has already been resolved twice So perhaps it's already--   On the merits, I'll simply say I really feel strongly that it's in our interest to define our business as being in the business of reserves and not rates I understand the linkage between the borrowings target and the funds rate, but the funds market has automatically been extended to other markets And as soon as the public and politicians attribute to us having control over interest rates, I think we are on dangerous ground They do enough of that anyway So I think it's important how we define our business  Secondly, I'd say when policy is on the move there's going to be volatility in rates There's more uncertainty, and that's going to be the case I don't think it's a bad thing And finally, even when the market gets ahead of us, it's not necessary to validate what gets built in Now, I think it has made sense to do it where we've done it; and I've been in favor of that But, for example, as we sit here today with a statement having been made with the discount rate, I think we have the flexibility not to validate what might be getting  -36-    8/16/88  built in now and not give up any ground at all in terms of where we think we need to get Those are the thoughts I have   I agree with what you outlined, Mr Chairman, the $600 million and asymmetric language I feel strongly also that we are going to have to move again I'm particularly concerned about the very rapid growth in the last couple of months of the narrower aggregates And picking up on what Bob Black said earlier, I think that the nature of our implementation of policy is such that if the demands are there in the market for reserves we'll fill that demand at the given borrowings level So I think we can't be complacent that we've done enough, certainly But I also agree with what you said I think it's important to let the prior move get digested And I don't feel strongly that the ordering in the language has to be changed "
331,1988-09-20," I want to make a couple of comments on projections based on a money-driven model and just what that looks like Essentially, I'd say the projections are very similar to those of the Board's staff There are some differences between the second half of this year and next year, but I would characterize the pattern as one in which inflationary pressures are contained, but not significantly reduced, over that 18-month period The projections I'm talking about are based on an assumption of 4 to 6 percent M1 growth And I guess the conclusion that I reached from looking at that--and obviously, this is the model output and then, just as the Board staff does, some subjective judgments are made--was that I'd be much more concerned about, say, money growth in June and July of 9 percent, than  -19-    9/20/88  I would be about August of less than 1 percent I think the general pattern is such that the same conclusion comes out in this sort of model--that the risks are more on the upside than the downside As far as the District goes, the report is essentially the same as last month We're still showing weakness relative to the rest of the economy and in some areas, particularly in industries like textiles and apparel, there are employment declines "
332,1988-09-20, I'm in agreement with that proposal 
391,1988-11-01," I would favor it as well I don't have anything to add to the comments that have been made   I had a question that I guess would follow what Gary Stern was saying Some of the work done prior to the early 1980's would have indicated greater explanatory powers in some of the narrower aggregates I gather they are not candidates for this type of approach because of the instability in their velocity over time Is that the assumption?   Yes   Sam, I wanted to try to get an idea You mentioned the negative sentiment Is that backed up at this point by large speculation or not? In other words, I would think if there is this expectation out there that you've described about trying to hold things stable until the election that shorts would be covered rather quickly and we could be in the situation where despite the decline we've had, or maybe because of it, that there is not a big short bid in the market Do you have any sense of that?   So there's a good deal of short-term vulnerablity?   Yes "
392,1988-11-01," In our District, I've been reporting the last couple of times on a relative gap in employment growth vis-a-vis the national averages which has been somewhat surprising because our District is tracking [the national economy] pretty well In fact, in the second quarter we had the largest gap ever in the 30 years that this number has been looked at That trend seems to be perhaps reversing itself now, and we did have modest manufacturing employment growth and relatively flat nonag employment in the recent period In manufacturing, the areas where growth was noted are electrical equipment, nonelectric machinery, and chemicals In any case, in looking at this peculiar behavior, because as Bob Forrestal has been reporting and I have as well our activity really doesn't seem to be as strong as the national averages, we tried to figure out what was going on and some of it may be explained by a greater concentration in manufacturing in the District than nationally and services have been growing more rapidly nationally And secondly, there may be some seasonal adjustment problems But basically we haven't been able to explain or understand this fully  Reflecting some of the comments that others have made, the agricultural picture is a lot rosier than might have been anticipated at one time Corn crops came in better than expected; soybeans were higher than last year; the cotton crop was a 25-year record; the rice crop was good; the tobacco crop was the best in 4 years, so I'd say that generally the picture there is pretty rosy in the District Finally, in terms of credit demand bank lending has been relatively sluggish although we've noted a pickup in the third quarter Growth in commercial lending both in the most recent three-month period and over the year as a whole has been about 11 percent, and that's quite a shift on the commercial lending side over the last year "
393,1988-11-01," I'm in agreement with what you suggested, although I wanted to register a mild note of concern I have been surprised at the extent to which money and credit have flattened out since July and August I think it's a coincidence largely that it happened to be around the time of the discount rate increase; but then again, because of all the fragilities out there, perhaps the increase had quite an expectational impact I'm sure it also reflects some of the lags of what we've been doing; but if you look over the most recent three months or so, the thrust of policy as reflected by the monetary base, that growth has been relatively slow, and reserves have actually been shrinking I don't think it's time right now to do anything about that, particularly with the dollar under pressure, but it does concern me because I don't think by any stretch of the imagination that we have whipped the inflationary pressures that we've seen If we get way out of position, if you will, in the short run in policy--and subsequently we're forced to reverse policy very sharply for short-term reasons, it's going to make the long-term battle a lot more difficult to win So, that's just a note of concern I would support what you said  -46-    11/1/88 "
452,1989-03-28," Mike, I wanted to ask if you had any insight into what's going on with short-term business credit--that there's some strength apart from the LBO situation   Thank you   It's not a problem; we even had a foot of snow three weeks ago I think Roger might have something to say about that In terms of the District numbers, the most recent reported activity is very strong both relative to what we've been seeing lately and also compared to the national numbers In general, the more recent anecdotal information would tend to confirm that The general sense I get is that orders are growing, albeit at a slower pace, and that there is some weakness in the consumer area but the commercial area is still quite strong In particular, we're seeing strong manufacturing employment growth and the industries that you see there are transportation, textiles, food products, and chemicals On the transportation side--just picking up on what Bob Parry said--a fellow from mentioned to us the other day that they have a five-year order backlog in commercial aircraft and I think half of  -27-    3/28/89  their workforce has about an average of one year's experience on those particular assembly lines He did go on to say that the order backlog includes options--I think they call them reservations--so that some of that could fall away On the textile side, where we've seen some strength as well, a textile manufacturer who had just returned from the Far East mentioned that, looking at Korea for example, between what's happened to their currency and wage rates domestically in Korea they're looking at cost increases of 25 percent in manufacturing there And to a lesser extent that's happening in Hong Kong and Taiwan So, in particular types of products the United States is much more competitive  In terms of other insights of an anecdotal nature, the general sense I get is that people--whether they are in a commercial business or even in a consumer business--really feel that they are under a great deal of margin pressure Raw material prices are up a lot, as somebody said, over the last year I think the increases have slowed down recently There is some sense of potentially growing wage pressures And certainly in businesses where they're selling to original equipment manufacturers there is still a great deal of difficulty passing along price increases But they will try to work both ends of the costs savings, passing along increases where they can  In terms of growth in orders, clearly the sense I got is that [the rate of] growth has slowed down in the last couple of months but orders are still growing I've heard of no cancellations as yet, but reading between the lines I sense a little anxiety about the possibility of cancellations In a similar vein on receivables, one consumer products company mentioned that they are really taking a very close look at their receivables, which have been growing; and they noted that now 20 percent of the companies they sell to have been involved in LBOs So, they view the quality of their receivables as really quite low and they are looking at that carefully  On the national front, my observation would be--just going back a month ago--that our forecast in terms of the result was very close to the Board staff's but it presumed roughly 4 percent M1 growth over the forecast period Clearly, to the extent that we have very low money growth, people who prepare [our forecast] have become increasingly concerned about whether or not things are going to work that way In a sense that leads me to a bit of concern, to the extent that in our discussions here we tend to focus on current inputs and whether or not we see weakness and how we try to trade that off against price pressures In a sense I think there's a trap in that process in that it doesn't really take into account some of the inherent lags in policy By the time we see the weakness it could be too late; and when we do see the weakness we probably will continue to see price pressure What do we do then? If you look back to the discount rate increase, to some extent the market in effect demanded that, in my view I'm not saying we wouldn't have done it anyway, but in a sense I don't think we had a choice because the perceptions out there were basically that we were going to respond to these short-term inputs So, I think at some point we have to introduce into the dialogue something else to look at that can be a guide In general, I would just urge that we not ignore what's going on with the aggregates We all know we set a target on M2 and we know where that stands it's a little below the lower end of the cone I'm sure you  -28-    3/28/89  all recall my proposal for a [monetary] base growth constraint In the fourth quarter that grew at less than 5 percent, which is what I suggested as a lower bound; this quarter it's probably right around 5 percent I took a look at reserves and I was interested in what I found there If you go back to '79 we've only had two quarters over that entire period of negative reserve growth one was the fourth quarter of '88; the other was the third quarter of '87 And as you know from the Bluebook, we're putting together a second back-to-back quarter of negative reserve growth of fairly substantial proportions In any case, I just think that as we contemplate policy actions we have to consider not only what's going on in the economy currently but also some gauge of the thrust of our actions and the lagged impacts they are going to have "
453,1989-03-28," My preference would be for ""B,"" symmetric I can certainly live with what you suggested, Mr Chairman The other point I would make, consistent with what I was saying earlier, is that I'd be a little concerned if we reacted to a single number in the intermeeting period It may be that the markets force our hand and we have to do that But I think there's going to come a time when--and I don't know how this will be achieved--there will have to be something else on the table so that when we decide it's right to start moving, the markets aren't sitting there saying, well, where's the Fed With respect to the M2 ranges, I don't know whether we have confidence over a long period of time that if we stick with the lower end of the ranges that that's going to contain inflationary pressures I just think at some point we've got to get out of this mode of the expectation that if a bad number comes out, boom, the Fed ought to be there doing something right then And if we are not, all the markets [unintelligible] That's a very difficult thing to deal with but it does trouble me And, in my judgment, just not moving in response to a number won't solve that But I think we're getting to a point that we ought to be worried about trying to break that "
516,1989-05-16," In the District we continue to see some relative strength in the most recent three-month period that we have numbers for, both in nonagricultural employment and particularly in manufacturing employment But a lot of that strength was in the early part of the period and some weakness has started to show through in the last couple of months In autos, which is a big industry in Missouri, both GM and Chrysler have announced four- or five-week shutdowns when they do their retooling in the June-July period as opposed to a normal week or two Also, a consumer durables manufacturer, an appliance manufacturer, apparently eliminated a third shift some time back and now there is talk of going to a four-day workweek because of softness in that market Residential construction has been flat, a bit better than nationally We've had particular weakness in nonresidential construction There was recently a strike of operating engineers in connection with which 20,000 of 30,000 construction workers in the St Louis area went out That strike was settled in about two weeks with total compensation increases of about 2 to 3 percent in salary and benefits  In terms of our broader view, our forecast for the year is very similar to the Board staff's in terms of the outcome, although it is based on 4 percent money growth We've become increasingly concerned that, with virtually no M1 growth since July of last year, the risks of recession either later this year or early next year are becoming considerably greater Also, I have the same impression that Manley described before many of the private forecasters who use interest rate-driven models really have an interest rate scenario of rates coming off in the latter part of this year to achieve the soft landing that's in the Board staff's forecast "
517,1989-05-16," Don, two questions One If you look over the last year or so how good have we been at projecting future M2 growth?   My second question is As people rebuild their balances, what implications do you think that will have for the real side?   This is tough one I looked back before I came to the meeting; since December, I think, I've been expressing my concern about the aggregates What I am struck by at this meeting is this sudden shift in the outlook and perceived risks and so forth that even 6 or 8 weeks ago didn't seem to be very apparent And what I worry about is that if we wait to see signs of recession, given the lags in the impact of monetary policy, it's basically going to be too late In terms of money, we've talked a lot about the short-term aberrations; but we're really looking at a pattern of monetary restraint that has been very tight for a long period of time Certainly, the technical aberrations may add to that somewhat; but I don't suspect that's the whole issue To sit here hoping for a bounceback--I don't know That to me sort of smacks of looking at current indicators and making the judgment; and I think ultimately we're going to get trapped  Now, I continue to think that the major problem we face is inflation But I don't think it's going to be any easier to deal with if we destabilize the economy through a monetary policy that's too tight In fact, I think the response will be such in terms of monetary growth that it will make the long-term problem even tougher I don't believe in strictly targeting monetary aggregates but I do think in the extreme we've got to observe them, in some sense And I think we're at an extreme at this time So, where I come out is that I would favor slightly less pressure on reserve positions In other words, I wouldn't move all the way to ""A"" but I'd be willing to let, say, 25 basis points show through here I think that's really quite consistent with the approach we've taken to policy We haven't been taking a big risk approach such as ""We're going to wait until we're  -45-    5/16/89  sure that we're at an inflection point and, boom, move it 100 basis points, or whatever"" We have been gradually adjusting I think the risks of recession as they relate to the inflation problem are really quite significant; and I think we ought to be moving earlier to try to get those aggregates growing again In terms of market expectations, there's no question that there are risks involved if we move slightly in one direction and then have to reverse That could create some confusion But I think we ought to put some weight on the long-term monetary targeting procedure that we go through each year; we could point out that we're falling below the range and we're taking some action to try to get in the lower end, but we intend to run money for a long period of time near the lower end to contain inflationary pressures So, I think it's doable I wouldn't view a move like this as an irreversible move that somehow says ""That's it; we've thrown in the towel on inflation"" I personally think we could deal with that "
573,1989-08-22," does that just largely give them reserves? I guess it gives them the appearance of more fire power?   Peter, when does this need to drain reserves end? In other words, how soon would you expect that? Generally, funds have been trading a little below 9 percent When would you expect them to trade at 9 percent or above? And what have market participants discounted? Normally, they expect the funds rate to be soft when you have that need to drain "
574,1989-08-22," I just wanted to ask about durable goods orders Did they come out this morning?   Let me start off with the District The picture there is still a tad weak We have had nonagricultural employment declines in the most recent quarter of about 1-1/2 percent That also spreads to manufacturing, which relatively isn't as weak; but still, there was a decline of almost 1 percent There was particular weakness in the construction employment area and, on the manufacturing side, in textiles and apparel I just want to pass on a couple of anecdotal comments One thing that has surprised me with the general weakness in the District and nationally is that when I talk to business people I have not yet, until recently, run into anybody who is terribly alarmed Yes, things are slower; but generally they are not terribly concerned about recession and that sort of thing  a major manufacturer of consumer durables and for the first time about a week and a half ago he laid out a somewhat different scenario Of course, demand there has been quite weak for some time He said the initial response of people was to try to sell their way out of it, in effect, and maybe cut back hours a little Basically, he doesn't really see that working and he thinks that we're now going to get into a phase of perhaps more layoffs, curtailment of capital expenditures, and so forth, as the difficulties of selling one's way out of it begin to sink in The other observation he made, which really runs to some extent to this real estate discussion Jerry was describing, is that they have two major [sales] channels homebuilders, which have really been soft for a while, and then retailers They are noting particular weakness in both; and in the retailing area, considerably more credit problems are surfacing And that, of course, will spill back into the shopping centers, which I think is one commercial area that has been notably overbuilt Another piece of anecdotal information on the homebuilding side the reports we get would tend to indicate that some of the pickup that's evident in the broader numbers is being seen in the trenches in our area as well The second quarter was better than the first and July is showing continuing improvement  On the national picture, I would align myself with those who generally are pleased with what's going on in the short run In that connection, I would not be inclined to overreact to one month's data of somewhat stronger real numbers I still think, as Jerry pointed out, that we have one heck of a challenge in front of us in terms of bringing inflation down; I don't know exactly how that's going to happen but I do think it's going to take some time To pick up on another thing that you were saying, Jerry--your observation that you are skeptical as to whether this forecast through 1990 will actually work out--it just seems to me that this slow growth will, in time, begin to wring out some of the excesses that you described In other  -34-    8/22/89  words, the pressure is there but it's building up much more slowly than people expect What I hear from people I talk to is an expectation that we've reached an inflection point, that policy is going to ease, and that somehow the floor is going to be pulled out from under rates and people are going to be looking at rates 100 basis points or more lower than where they are now I just don't think that's going to happen; and I don't think people have adjusted to that These pressures are going to build up over time And I think the challenge we're going to face is one of not overreacting to the process of wringing out some of these excesses, which are going to be reflected in bad credits and the like because of the longer-run inflationary challenge that we still face "
575,1989-08-22," I favor ""B"" with symmetric language And I interpret ""B"" to mean 9 to 9-1/8 percent on the [funds rate] Is that correct? "
637,1989-10-03," I have some of the same concerns and I have raised them, in the fundamental sense, as we had these votes But I think the Fed is in the fire and this is not the time when you fight the philosophical battle It almost has to be resolved when you are not in the middle of the program I guess the way I look at it is that if we were to get our backs up and refuse to participate at this point in time we'd, in effect, be embarrassing the United States in international policy circles And I can't think of a dumber thing to do in a political sense Even if we could defend it on price stability grounds, or try to, I think we would be painted with a different brush [It would raise the question] as to why we have this arm of the US government that has this kind of independence to pull that sort of thing I think that's quite possible Beyond that, in terms of market perceptions, I don't share your concern, Manley, about this intervention somehow really undercutting our credibility in a price stability sense I think it would be far more damaging if the Fed refused to participate here and that became a cause [celebre] Then market participants would be very concerned because of the split between the Fed and the Treasury and what that might imply in terms of US economic policy   Well, we have this study going on, but there comes a point where--purely from a financial point of view--looking at our balance sheet, we have more holdings of foreign currencies than is really justifiable in a financial sense I guess that would define a limit But I have some hope that if this proves not to work--and given the path the Chairman is taking--that the Treasury will change course I have some hope that rather than through brinkmanship--   As I say, I think there could come a time; but I don't think this is the time "
638,1989-10-03," The pattern in our District is the same as I've been reporting We have had sluggish employment growth all year both in nonagricultural payrolls and in manufacturing, and that pattern continued in the most recent period The only manufacturing sector that showed any growth was chemicals There was particular weakness in electrical equipment Whirlpool laid off 850 in Portsmith, Arkansas; GE has announced layoffs of about 800 coming up in Louisville; [unintelligible] Having said all that, though, I think we also have had very slow labor force growth Unemployment rates are still relatively low; St Louis just published an unemployment rate of 5 percent, its lowest in a number of years And there has been a pickup recently in nonresidential and residential construction contracts Even at GE, for example, the feeling is that this process isn't cumulative; they see a bottoming out here I think they feel that with these announced layoffs their production will be in line with demand They see next year as being relatively flat but they don't see a continuing deterioration One final thought--which I mentioned last time and it continues to be the case--is that I've been traveling around the District a little and it's very hard to find businessmen who are worried about the economic situation Nobody grabs you by the lapels and says ""This thing is going south and you better do something about it"" "
639,1989-10-03," I favor ""B"" Symmetrical language would be my preference but I could live with asymmetrical toward ease I would just comment that several months back I was concerned about the degree of the restraint I'm not sure what to make of M2 But in terms of some of the narrow aggregate and reserve measures, I take some heart in the fact that they had a pickup in September and are projected to pick up [further] through the end of the year So, I think that the shift that Governor Angell was concerned about to some extent has taken place, at least based on those [data] "
692,1989-11-14," Sam, when did we last have short-term interest differentials as narrow as we have now?   So move "
693,1989-11-14," [Conditions are] somewhat better than I have reported earlier Although things generally haven't changed much, this is the first time in three FOMC meetings that we've had an increase in nonagricultural employment in the most recent three-month period We still have some weakness in manufacturing employment-- somewhat less than I've talked about the prior two times--but the weak areas are food processing, electrical equipment, and transportation equipment The electrical sector we've talked about; I think that's largely appliances The auto area has been mentioned We've had some shutdowns a week at the medium and heavy truck plant in Louisville and about a month at one of the two Ford plants there Chrysler has in [unintelligible] and they have announced that that plant will be closed indefinitely after the first of the year--or actually, one of the shifts will be laid off after the first of the year It involves somewhere between 1600 and 1900 workers Interestingly enough, at their other plant, which manufactures minivans, they would like to add a third shift They made a proposal to the unions for three 10-hour a week shifts and the unions turned it down So, they could be putting some of those idle workers back to work if they can't get it done One other comment, which I think confirms what Mike said in the Greenbook in terms of other consumer expenditures ex-autos We recently had a luncheon with chief financial officers, and two individuals--one with a very large national retailer and another with a smaller retailer--confirmed that they view this environment as ideal for their business Things are going well and they are quite comfortable with how things are going; that was a bit surprising to me That's really all I have "
694,1989-11-14," Don, this is unrelated to the presentation that you just made, but I wanted to ask you what you thought the frictional level of borrowing was If it were necessary to inject more reserves, would you view it as a problem if the funds rate actually dropped below the discount rate?   I would favor ""B"" symmetric as well I could live with ""B"" asymmetric, as you suggested I have thoughts that I think are quite similar to those Wayne expressed First of all--and I mentioned this on the ""Call""--we've got to be careful in the short run about not overreacting to the current data We've been on the move for some months now with policy And if we made a mistake with policy I don't think we're making it now; we probably made it last winter or early spring But we certainly have taken the steps over the last five or six months, as I view it, to put policy back on an appropriate longer-term course The second point I would make relates to this longer-term view of what we've achieved over not quite a three-year period If you go back to early '87, we were looking at 12 quarters of trend growth of money that was almost 12 percent and we brought that down over this period of time to a little less than 5 percent That's reflected in the P* model It's very consistent with our longer-term goals and I would just hate to see us trade all that progress away by overreacting  My final point is that, to some extent, I think we have to be careful about how we characterize what we are doing Even though we all believe in it and understand the benefits of zero inflation, however defined, I'm not so sure how broadly supported that would be I've heard comments--not today, but around this table--about businessmen thinking the environment we have been in is just fine and why not just continue that, with inflation running 4 to 5 percent So I think it's important [to recognize] as we look at what's going on here that there are some forces operating that are much bigger than we are in this sense Now, it's not totally unrelated to monetary policy, but we've got this external imbalance situation that we're living with and that's imposing certain things on the economy If we don't run the type of policy we've been running, which is consistent with that, there will be a much more drastic adjustment imposed on the economy I suppose people could come up with a longer list, but to cite another example we also have an adjustment going on to the unsustainable credit growth that we have observed, really, throughout this recovery There are a lot of situations where people have geared their plans toward an economy growing much more rapidly than potential To the extent that we can lay out a broader set of issues --that it's not just the Fed single-mindedly pursuing this price stability objective and ignoring all else--I think it would be to our benefit I'm not sure how to do that But I think that's a risk of where we are right now "
756,1990-03-27," I don't have a colleague from Missouri   Before I make some comments, I had a question for you, Jerry Could you explain what you meant by the Treasury co- opting monetary policy if we weren't involved? How would that work?   I see it as an uncertainty risk, but we still have all the cards, I think But they're--   No, I understand   Yes, I think that's a good point   [Unintelligible] for us to ease or tighten if we don't want to in the short run, but the uncertainty would be damaging Let me just make my point I don't disagree with the general idea that we ought to be involved in this and we can bring a constructive influence to the table But I think we have to recognize that we have a finite institution here in terms of the resources and that there is a responsibility for these resources in a sense that goes beyond this room in terms of [Reserve Bank] boards of directors and--I don't want  -62-    3/27/90  to make this a government [unintelligible]--but there's a basic institutional question in terms of how we commit our assets and what the risks are associated with those assets Clearly, I hope we never get to the point where we have to draw that line in the sand But there is, I think, a line in terms of what is reasonable with respect to an ultimate commitment of the Federal Reserve and its resources to foreign assets  Now, I think there's another area where we ought to have a better understanding of some of the rationale for this and that is What is a prudent war chest to have on hand if we need some foreign currencies on hand? But that's a much smaller issue, in my mind And finally, I don't know what the implications would be if the Treasury went elsewhere to finance [their currency holdings] and how it would be handled in a government accounting sense But I'm a little troubled about the issue that some other people have mentioned--that if there is a large exchange loss and all of a sudden Congress and other people wake up to it then they will look to see how it happened And if it happened not only because we intervened for our own account but--under this somewhat questionable authority on the theory that it's an open market purchase--we also warehoused roughly an equal amount for the Treasury in what could be painted as sort of a secret transaction, I think there's a--   No, I understand that, but--   If somebody wanted to do a job on the Fed they would say that we really, through some sort of a subterfuge, financed this behind the back of the Congress and the taxpayers  SPEAKER(?) Absolutely   And that puts us in a position now where the American people [could] have this huge exchange loss   Could I just get in one final thought, which is simply that I don't view it as either we're in or we're out at this point I don't think it's reasonable to say ""That's it; we're not going to warehouse anymore"" But I think we really have to try to draw some ultimate line in the sand and then work very hard to get a different understanding with the Treasury I know you've been trying to do that but I think with that ultimate [unintelligible] power that Manley and Wayne were referring to To me it's not a theological issue We're charged with running this institution prudently I know volumes in the foreign exchange markets have gone up But the fact of the matter is there are not enough resources in this central bank or all of them combined to stand in the way of those markets for very long, whether you think [intervention] works or doesn't work And we have to understand what those limits are In my opinion that's a very defensible position and one we have to take In order to leave ourselves enough room and time to get it done, [we need] to get a better understanding with the Treasury on how this can be used and how it can't be used because I could very easily, on the course we've been on, see this going to $60 billion, $80 billion Who knows?   Could I just ask another question? What does the Treasury think we're doing at this meeting? Do they think we withdrew for technical reasons or do they know at this stage how fundamental these concerns are?   In view of that and of the fact that these are fairly substantial increases in the limits, it might help us--and I don't know whether you'd be prepared to do this or not--if you were to indicate that though we never say never this is pretty much an outside limit at this stage and that to go beyond this really would require some very careful consideration   My point--   Well, I didn't mean it to come across as a threat But on the other hand, they may well view this as just that we had these limits and an FOMC meeting was coming up, so as a technical matter we approved new limits   Yes And I'm not saying that you should say that's an outside limit But to the extent you were comfortable with it, you could say something to the effect that you're really not sure what kind of a reaction you would get going back to [the Committee for more] That's--   That might be helpful   It might be very helpful in influencing their behavior if they thought in terms of having this much left and of operating within that limit Having managed traders, I know how that works   How are warehoused currencies treated? Is that a Treasury obligation or is it a foreign currency?   Well, in answering that question on the $25 billion did you presume that it jumped to $15 billion as well or is that--? "
757,1990-03-27," The picture in the Eighth District is one of continuing improvement In January, for example, we had very strong employment in comparison to December Even if you take away strong growth in construction and in retail and wholesale trade sectors, which I think benefitted from the mild weather, other sectors grew at least modestly In manufacturing, for example, employment was up 52 percent and that included declines of almost 10,000 jobs in the automobile industry So, virtually all major industries had moderate to strong employment growth In both residential and nonresidential construction we continued to have strong growth in the most recent three-month period ending in January In the area of anecdotal evidence, we recently had a group of chief financial officers of major corporations in the St Louis area to lunch and the things that came through from that discussion were (1) scarcity of qualified labor; (2) a sense of growing pressure on wages; (3) a margin squeeze--the feeling that any easy productivity gains have long since been realized; and (4) the feeling that the recent increases in the dollar have not really presented a problem in terms of export activity Finally, and this is somewhat in contrast to what Bob [Forrestal] mentioned but I don't think either one of the views would be conclusive, I didn't pick up any sense of dissatisfaction with policy In fact, some people expressed a preference for a diligently slow, stable situation in economic growth So, nobody really is squealing about monetary policy being on an inappropriate course I think it's right to question, though, whether people really would support the price of bringing down the rate of inflation significantly from current levels  A final thought in terms of the general picture nationally I have felt that policy has been erring on the side of ease for some time and that we are in the process of giving up some ground in terms of our progress toward long-term price stability, however defined  -28-    3/27/90  So, I would agree with what the Greenbook says in terms of the need for some additional tightening I'm somewhat ambivalent about whether that needs to be right away I take some heart from the Bluebook forecast of a slowing in M2 growth I have some questions about what the impact is going to be in terms of the profit margin squeeze, the general pressures of leverage on the economy, and the credit crunch we've heard about, and how that all may [affect] consumer confidence So, while I think we need to move, I could be persuaded that it doesn't need to be right now "

813,1990-05-15," I would say that in terms of our broad view, we wouldn't be as concerned as the Board staff about monetary policy being somehow badly out of position here Our outlook is for modest growth, containment of pressures in the short run, and gradual long- term progress But we wouldn't envision the kind of tightening that's implied; in fact, I think it's much too early to tell If you look at page 5 of the Bluebook and what has been happening to money, credit, and reserve aggregates over the last couple of months, you have to wonder whether there's a significant tightening going on already with the funds rate at a constant level Again, having said that, I think a month or two is much too short a period of time to react to In general I think we've been well served this year by not letting very volatile expectations whip us around I think our ""steady-as-it-goes"" policy has been quite good  On a District basis, I would say we're growing modestly better than the national economy Even without auto workers coming back, we've had growth in manufacturing jobs On the agricultural front, the flooding in Arkansas has created some problems, although I don't expect them to have national implications I think some wheat crops will be plowed under and some cotton, rice, and corn crops will be late getting in But basically at this stage, there hasn't been a major impact On the price front, I haven't picked up much commentary about the minimum wage [increase] I did pick up some comments in Arkansas where firms have below minimum wage employees; they are complaining about the compaction effect on their salary scales and the fact that it has a much broader implication in terms of their costs than just on the people below minimum wage A couple of people said the way they are dealing with it is with gradual, phased-in price increases over the first six months of this year, so they aren't faced with a step increase in their prices around midyear One final comment Our large reporting banks in the three-month period ended in April have actually had a decline in loans outstanding It's in other categories There is still growth in real estate and C&I loans, but a decline in personal loans and big declines in some other categories "
814,1990-05-15," I wanted to go last so I didn't feel the pressure of others wanting to speak after me ""B"" "
856,1990-08-21," For the District, the most recent numbers, which are second-quarter numbers, show a decided shift Generally in recent months I have been reporting that we have been out-performing the national economy; in the latest period both absolutely and relatively there is weakness in employment and weakness in non-residential and residential construction In talking to our directors and others around the District, I have not picked up any sense that they have noticed anything dramatically different What's interesting is that, despite reporting that things are pretty much as I have described them in recent months, there is a lot more anxiety Last week I had our staff do a survey of business contacts throughout the District, which was rather interesting In general, it supported an outlook for continued, albeit somewhat slower, expansion for the balance of 1990 One surprising part of it to me was a good deal of optimism in terms of retail sales, which either met or exceeded expectations And those sales were obtained without unusual price cutting; their inventories were in good shape Basically, 7 out of 9 retailers contacted reported that their outlook was good or optimistic for the balance of the year   Just last week Now, we have relatively sluggish job growth and some layoffs coming in the aerospace industry --in St Louis in particular--and in the defense industry So, whether or not that optimism by retailers holds up in the face of slowing or maybe even declining employment growth and lower incomes  -23-    8/21/90  remains to be seen Based on this survey and the views of our people, in general we would expect weakness in autos and construction and some strength in services, agri-business, and mining That pretty much sums up the results of that survey  On a national basis, I would be in general agreement with what the staff has forecasted What's very tricky, if we come to grips with monetary policy, is that there's an assumption in that forecast of an essentially unchanged monetary policy in terms of the funds rate And, of course, given our operating procedure, an unchanged funds rate in a slowing economy could in fact create a tightening--from the perspective of monetary stimulus And I think that's something we have to watch pretty carefully Now, I've personally been encouraged by the pickup in money growth recently and what's projected for August and so forth, but we have to watch that carefully The other general comment I would make is that I think the July experience sort of showed us that we're not in an environment, given the concerns about inflation, in which we can try to lead the market lower I think we're in a position where we have to follow behind market expectations in terms of policy actions "
857,1990-08-21," I would agree with what you recommended here I'd make three points First, in this kind of environment, while I don't think we can rely exclusively on it, I really do think as Don Kohn suggested that we need to watch what money is doing because I don't think we can assume that an unchanged funds rate is an unchanged policy Secondly--I've said this before as well and I think Don suggested this too in his remarks--I don't think that we can pretend to lead markets in this kind of environment; we really have to follow Now, we don't always have to buy what markets are doing in a volatile period, but I'm suggesting that unless there were expectations of ease evidenced in financial markets, it would be very difficult for us to ease and get away with it given the concern about inflation that's out  -41-    8/21/90  there And the final point I would make is that if a recession is imminent--if we're going to go into recession in the fourth quarter--I don't think we can do much about it right now Even in the face of weak incoming data, if we feel that we're on a monetary policy course that is consistent in the long run with sustainable growth and progress toward price stability, that's about all we should do I worry about overreacting--not on your part but just in general--to incoming weak data on the thought that somehow we could pull this economy out of recession in the short run I don't think we can "
916,1990-10-02, Right They'd be looking for [something] 
917,1990-10-02," As for the District, I would say activity in terms of what we can measure is still slowing; I would guess we're probably bouncing along around zero right now in the District One relatively bright spot, at least through June 30th, is the banking area For the first six months of the year, we're showing at small banks in the District return on assets of 1 percent, return on equity of 12 to 12-1/2 percent, and really no significant buildup in nonperforming loans Now, I don't think that's going to hold up necessarily through the balance of the year, but that sector so far looks pretty decent In terms of the numbers on the large reporting banks, there's not a lot of credit being extended but my sense is that that's somewhat of a mutual thing I think there's just a sort of paralysis Dick, you mentioned this too I'm not sure borrowers, even if the credit is available, are all that anxious to borrow in this environment  I had a dramatic example of something we have heard about from a number of people this morning I was in a couple of areas in our District last week where geographically the economy is really doing quite well, not only statistically but also if you talk to people they say business is going well But their attitude is much more negative than the reality of what they're dealing with I think that pervades people's actions in the conduct of day-to-day business  The other feeling I get is that there's not a lot of sense that monetary policy is somehow at fault In other words, I'm not getting accosted by people saying ""You guys have really screwed up; you really ought to be doing something differently"" I'm just not picking that up Perhaps the corollary to that is that there is a general malaise out there, a lot of uncertainty, paralysis--however you want to describe it I'm not sure we have it in our power to snap the economy out of it And maybe yesterday's stock market reaction-- and I realize this is just temporary--gives us some insight into the influence the Middle East situation has on expectations and this malaise that has set in the slightest whiff of some resolution there really had a very positive, temporary, impact on attitudes  Turning to the national situation, I personally would not be surprised to see one or two negative quarters, and I wouldn't really have any quibble with what Mike has projected We look at monetary policy from perhaps a somewhat different perspective than Mike, but I think we're saying essentially the same thing Our assessment is that the current course of policy is unlikely to exacerbate whatever recessionary pressures exist I think there is some sense--and I mentioned this a meeting or two ago--that some people might criticize the Fed for being too tight And yet if you look at the latest three months--whether you look at reserves, the base, narrow money, or broad money--compared to the prior 12 months, there really has been no tightening of monetary policy on that basis In fact, some of the measures suggest somewhat of an easing Anyway, my view is that we have built a tremendous [foundation], or whatever you want to call it We have wrung out a tremendous amount of excess liquidity over the last three years that had been built up from monetary stimulus or  -24-    10/2/90  whatever in the mid-1980s And if we can just come through this next period here with a reasonably good monetary policy still intact-- probably a combination of good luck and good policy--the prospects for making significant progress on inflation down the road are really pretty good, I think "
918,1990-10-02," How is the long end behaving today?   May I ask a question on the luncheon discussion? If you decide to do that, how do you think that will play? Will that be perceived as some sort of an easing in policy or will it be perceived as a technical matter?   Yes   What will it do to the growth rate? Can you calculate an effective growth rate of reserves?   My preference would probably be alternative B, asymmetric toward ease If I were voting I wouldn't dissent against the 25 basis point move downward In any case, I'd be very sensitive to growth of the aggregates--sensitive to their heralding a possible slowdown and a decline in market rates, and thus pegging the funds rate at too high a level So, I can identify with the general sensitivity that you have I'd like to make three other comments very quickly One, I agree with what Bob Black was saying I'd much rather see the rationale here being made in the context of what's happening in the economy--expectations with respect to how that may affect our performance against monetary aggregates and so forth as opposed to [the budget issue] I'm just thinking back to how the unintended credit tightening rationale played in July; and if we can put [our action] in a broader context of the economy and our broader goals, I think we'd be better off Secondly, I'm very goosey about tying too much to budget deals, particularly if there are two steps in that My assumption has always been that that is a political position more than an economic position I understand why we're there and I don't--   No, I understand But, again, in an economic context I might have some questions as to the extent of the response that would be necessary My only point is this If we make one adjustment that's perceived to be in connection with that, that might be quite enough If we make another one, the perception might be that we're following right along I don't think people will necessarily distinguish between the budget deal and fiscal restraint, and there's a lot more fiscal restraint promised down the road And I'd hate to see us get into a linkage where we sort of condition people to think that there is always going to be a monetary policy offset   Okay Well, I just wanted to express that concern And then finally, I really don't know about the adjustment in reserve requirements, but I'm sure you are weighing it in the context of everything else you have in mind As you know, people have been taught to think in terms of the three tools of monetary policy And I'm not sure how that would play, particularly in conjunction with the two contemplated easings   That's fine; that's a concern I have that I don't know how to accommodate "
980,1990-11-13," Peter, again this is a hypothetical question If you had been able to meet the demand for reserves that would have achieved the target funds rate, would that have substantially affected the growth rate of reserves over this period? I'm not sure you can answer that   I'd favor dropping it I would just observe, in thinking back to that memo Ann-Marie Meulendyke did 3 or 4 years ago, that it's interesting that we have had different operating regimes, but if oriented toward the funds rate there used to be a constraint associated with reserves or aggregates--I don't remember specifically Of course, the irony of this one is that, in effect, we have an operating regime that practically targets the funds rate and our constraint is the funds rate And a point that falls down the road is that if we're going to have an operating regime and a constraint, the constraint really ought to be oriented toward reserves or something behaving drastically differently from what we expected That would be a sensible restraint in the current operating regime   Yes I would just eliminate the sentence   They're going to be suspicious that we have something else in the works "
981,1990-11-13," In our District for the most recent three-month period the economy is still growing, albeit at a slowing rate Right now if you could measure it, we're probably just bumping along holding our own But that performance is somewhat better than the national average Payroll employment in that period was up about 1 percent; the gains are in government services; employment in wholesale and retail trade and manufacturing is down about 1 percent The area that I hear the most about in manufacturing is the consumer durables area; both Whirlpool and GE have had layoffs that are very much tied into the housing industry One interesting note in Missouri itself--and Missouri is the second largest state in terms of automobile and auto- related employment--we had some layoffs by the Big-Three and also at McDonnell Douglas, but District-wide auto employment in the most recent quarter is flat Basically, what has happened is that the Japanese transplants in Kentucky and Tennessee and their suppliers have really picked up that slack Finally, construction activity, while it's declining, is not nearly as depressed in our District as nationally In the first nine months of the year residential construction was down only 1 percent compared to 7 percent nationally, and nonresidential construction was down not quite 4 percent One bit of anecdotal information, which I've heard on a couple of different occasions, is the sense that inventories are being managed more closely I picked that up from in the trucking industry the pattern they're seeing there is one of much more frequent shipments of smaller amounts His general interpretation of that is that firms really are trying to manage their inventories very closely  I still have the feeling that the sentiment is probably worse than the reality, although I agree with Mike that there is more evidence of a downturn In that connection, I think probably the most important factor bearing on sentiment is the Middle East situation I just wonder--and this may be politically naive--whether or not from an economic point of view a stalemate situation couldn't be construed as somewhat stable and we could see some drop in oil prices that could turn that sentiment somewhat  On the national situation, generally I haven't been terribly concerned about some of the forecasts in terms of a slowdown in economic activity or a recession That has been based primarily on my general feeling that the thrust of monetary policy has been about right as measured by the behavior of the monetary aggregates If that's the way you look at things, when you see a month like October you have to be a bit concerned I'd simply say that at this point I would not be inclined to overreact based on one-month's data I'm not sure that we really have the ability--though I know how much effort goes into it--to project with all that much confidence what the aggregates are going to do down the road And, of course, the most recent easing really isn't reflected in the aggregates at all  -30-    11/13/90  The final point I would make is that I don't think there is a lot we can do about the availability of credit We can make sure that we provide adequate reserves and that money grows at an appropriate rate, but I think the behavior of credit really is largely out of our control I would simply observe that in the months of August and September--we don't have complete data on October yet--short- and intermediate-term business credit was growing at a fairly decent rate 77 percent in August and 101 percent in September I think there's some evidence that the commercial paper market and finance companies and so forth are picking up some of the slack from the banking system "
982,1990-11-13," My preference would be ""B,"" although I could support this One of the things I worry about a little is all this prior unfortunate dialogue and how through comments the Administration has made and so forth we sort of have been linked into this budget process I'd really prefer to do something after more time has passed because I think all that runs fundamentally to our credibility I guess the reason I'm worried about it is the point Jerry and others were making about the dollar I think we really have to guard our credibility because when it comes to defending the dollar we're really the only act in town So, that gives me some concern; but I can live with [your proposal]   No, I understand that I just worry that this might be interpreted as a second installment, and I don't like that linkage "
1040,1990-12-18," Starting off with the District, in terms of the statistics we are still slowing But even though manufacturing employment is going down, we're still getting modest employment growth overall I'd say the employment picture generally in the District is somewhat stronger than in the nation In terms of nonresidential construction, over the last year we're down about as much as the rest of the country Housing has not been hit nearly as hard, but it is down As far as anecdotal information goes, and I mentioned this on our recent telephone conference call, the sense I'm getting from directors and others--and it was reinforced in some further discussions last week--is that things have not gotten materially worse in the last 30 days As far as holiday sales go, I think retailers in the District are expecting modest, or maybe somewhat larger, real declines in retail sales But that generally was anticipated and I think inventory levels in general are in pretty good shape One very bright spot is bank performance in the District We have third- quarter numbers in now Returns on assets are still about 1 percent; returns on equity are greater than 12 percent; and nonperforming loans are unchanged from the prior quarter and the prior year   Probably the fourth quarter won't look as good; I'd expect some deterioration But again, it's a much better picture than I think we see elsewhere In terms of expansion of credit, that generally has been sluggish over the last year in the District  On the national front, the one comment I would make is that we've had some concerns over the last couple of months--really since September, October, and November--about the slowdown in the monetary aggregates I guess the way that one would conceptualize what is going on is that as demand for reserves has fallen our operating procedures of pegging the funds rate has really caused us to drag out reserves to maintain whatever the targeted funds rate was I think there was evidence in, say, the early part of this 2-1/2 month period that we weren't really keeping pace with declines in other short-term market rates I don't know to what extent we can rely on these spreads, but it's something that I think is worth looking at The main point I wanted to make in this connection is that with the steps that were taken in November, we really have not only caught up with the declines in market rates but actually have moved the funds rate ahead of them Just to cite a couple of examples From the end of September to the end of October, the funds rate had only come down 9  -15-    12/18/90  basis points, whereas short rates had come down on the order of 20 to 30 basis points depending on what instrument we looked at; but for the period as whole, from the end of September through the middle of December roughly, the funds rate was down 100 basis points and these very short-term rates were down roughly 30 to 60 basis points So, if one worried about our being out of position and not providing adequate reserve growth, to the extent that these interest rate spreads are some indicator we certainly have caught up with the market movement and gone beyond that Perhaps that gives a somewhat more optimistic perspective in terms of what reserves and money might do down the road "
1041,1990-12-18," Don, I noticed in the money projections in the Bluebook that there's a very dramatic difference when you get out to February and March between alternatives A and B, much more so than I think we normally see Do you want to comment on that?   I just can't recall 2 and 3 percentage point differences in the growth rates between these various alternatives It just struck me   I can accept your recommendation on the funds rate, Alan I think it's probably appropriate I have a sense--as I expressed earlier and to use a phrase I heard elsewhere--that we're getting ahead of the curve a little I think we have brought the funds rate down faster than market rates, and I presume that that is going to show through to the aggregates But this is responsive to the concern of the slow growth I agree with you that we're likely to overdo it Unfortunately, I don't have the same confidence that we'll undo it I say that simply because I sat here as recently as 1986 and 1987 as we looked at quarterly growth rates in M2 in excess of 10 percent and I have to tell you there are lot of asymmetric monetarists That's Lee's phrase, but I think it's very true There were many people not at all worried about that [M2 growth] at that time I hope I'm wrong, but I'm not--   Oh, I understand what position we're in, and that's why--   Yes   In any case, I would like to try to avoid the overshooting not only for that reason but also because I think a volatile monetary policy has other consequences that flow from that On the discount rate, if it were up to me I would let the 1/4 point  -39-    12/18/90  show through in open market operations tomorrow and I'd be inclined to cut the discount rate on Friday And at that point I'd make it very clear that it's simply a technical adjustment to move the discount rate in line with other rates I think the communication in this other scheme could get a little confusing I think we could establish a 7 percent funds rate by Friday and then just have a technical adjustment [in the discount rate] and use the appropriate language for that I'm not concerned about Wayne's concern here We could be left in the same position if the Board decided not to move the rate on Wednesday and then we would have a situation where, with the authority we are proposing to delegate to the Chairman, we would still have the funds rate coming down close to or possibly below the discount rate So, I'm not troubled with that I'd go ahead with the open market operations "
1099,1991-03-26," I would agree with what Bob Forrestal said about getting too technical here; I think it could be a problem Where I would come out, because I have sympathy for what Lee said on the legal side, is that if a discount rate action causes a change in the instructions that the FOMC has given to the Desk, in a very simple- minded fashion it's hard for me in a very technical sense to let that happen without consultation As a practical matter we are on a fed funds targeting regime now We have chosen not to say that to the world I think it's bad public relations, basically, to say that that is what we are doing, and I think it's right not to; but internally we all recognize that that's what we are doing Those circumstances call for greater consultation, not less So, I have some of the problems that were expressed earlier by Bob Black and Roger Guffey about exactly what this language means because it seems to define very little I really don't think we could define a specific rule; but in    3/26/91  the circumstances we're operating in right now it argues for erring on the side of more consultation, not less, when in effect we're changing the instructions to the Desk  The other observation I would make, Don, is that I don't know how to interpret the historical evidence but, as I look back at a couple of situations that I happen to remember quite well, generally all we've done is to relate discount rate changes to fed funds changes; no one has ever looked at whether or not consultation took place But I can remember in a strict borrowings regime--for example, in July and August of '86--there were discount rate changes that showed through to the funds rate and there was consultation with the FOMC The FOMC basically acted at its meeting to ease policy and recognized that that might be effected through a discount rate change I'm not saying it's possible to get it nor that it would necessarily clarify things all that much, but the evidence that we have is in some sense not the right evidence   One thought I meant to mention is that there's a lot of potential value added in terms of conveying any technicalities of interest to one group versus another I think there is a potential for a higher quality decision, even though it may be more difficult to get, just through the consultative process   I'm going to overlap a little with Ed and agree with David When we started off a couple of years ago, in the beginning the idea of that foreign exchange study was to see whether we could develop some rationale It turned out to be very effective because I think the weight of that effort slowed down in a broad sense the propensity of the Treasury to intervene, but we never answered the threshold question I'm not sure there is any answer in a number sense but conceptually there's probably an answer And I think we have to be prepared with that because there's the potential for some heat here and with good reason   Longer term, I think we need to pursue that; there are some international financial considerations that the people who are going to be taking the shots at the profit and loss statement don't really appreciate So, I think we can do an educational job and we have to be ready to do that well Longer term, I suspect the problem is that most of us feel that sterilized intervention doesn't really do any good and yet we're caught in a sort of international alliance in which some of our counterparts do So, in order to play in that game, we do something that we don't fundamentally believe in We're not going to answer that today but I don't know what the dynamics are that perhaps ultimately will lead to more sensible combined behavior in that regard internationally As a practical matter I agree that we have to play the game We can't just say that we think this is stupid, that it doesn't work, and we're not going to do it Maybe over time there are efforts we can make to lead the world to perhaps a more sensible approach on this Maybe that's idealistic; I don't know   I was just going to ask how you would characterize the conversations with the Treasury on reducing the warehousing so far Have we been pushing hard on them and have they been reluctantly going along or are they going to sit there and say ""Why didn't you tell us to sell this stuff?"" How have those communications gone?   And have we had to push them hard to peel off what has been sold already?   Wished to do what, Wayne? I didn't understand "
1100,1991-03-26," In our District I would agree with something Ed has said So far there is little that one can really put a finger on statistically; it's more of an attitude change that I've noticed I had the same experience that Ed and Bob described with our directors about a week ago; there was a very noticeable shift in sentiment Statistically, I guess the one thing we can hang our hat on is employment growth It had gotten very sluggish; it never had turned negative in the District on a year-to-year basis, but there is some evidence that it has bottomed out and started moving up And that's a combination of both less weakness in the manufacturing area than nationally and considerably more strength in the non-manufacturing area The other piece of evidence we have is not so much in terms of the current economy but we have year-end numbers on banking; bank performance has continued to hold up with [delinquencies] of about 09 percent and not a significant increase in either loan losses or nonperforming loans We're perhaps a little behind the rest of the nation in potential real estate problems, but I don't think those are going to get significantly bad; we never had the boom, really  Nationally, the only comment I would make is that I'm pleased to see that we can now look back and say that we have had some sustained growth in reserves and money And at least for my part, I'm not too concerned about reacting to that at this stage There would  -31-    3/26/91  come a point in time when maybe I would, but things are tenuous enough now that I'm just pleased to see it and leave it at that "
1101,1991-03-26," Oh, I do get to go before Ed! Maybe I can be briefer Yes "
1148,1991-05-14," I haven't heard much change in the kind of anecdotal information we've been hearing for the last couple of  -15-    5/14/91  months, though there is a somewhat more positive tone to it, with strength in the obvious places but no evidence in those comments of new areas of strength and no new areas of concern One other comment on the anecdotal side I would make is that Jerry mentioned the sour comments from manufacturers and I wonder--and it's too early to tell now because I suspect their orders are still pretty lousy--whether they're going to be expecting too much out of this recovery They may be thinking of more traditional recoveries My guess is that it's still going to be a very difficult environment in which to do business On this point I was amused that when Alan was in St Louis a month ago we heard one manufacturer who heads up a very well-managed company fussing about the margin pressures He said he hadn't seen anything this bad since '74-'75 But subsequently, having seen their first-quarter earnings, there was another increase--maybe a record So, there are some people who like to tell us how tough it is  As for the numbers themselves, as was noted before, the positive information we're receiving is mostly anecdotal and it isn't there in the numbers In our District it's starting to show up in the numbers through the first quarter We actually had nonagricultural employment growth at about--not quite--a 15 percent annual rate Manufacturing is still weak; that's primarily in transportation, autos and aircraft And in nonmanufacturing and services, there was strength across the board with most of the contribution being from wholesale and retail trade and services We also had growth in the construction sector The previous four quarters all had declines, so this was the first positive quarter in nonresidential construction contracts in over a year  On a broader basis, one comment I want to make is on this inflation question I'm somewhat troubled the more I hear comments about and see in the press good reported inflation numbers When I say in the press, I mean comments from market observers--I don't associate this with what Jerry was saying before about better reported price numbers in the short run--that somehow that gives policy room to move I have two reactions to that One is that I think the numbers we're seeing now are the result of actions taken many months ago, if not years ago And in that sense I don't think they justify any action on our part in the short run if policy is in the proper position The second aspect of that, and the more important, is that these are declines from unacceptably high levels to somewhat lower but I think in a longer-term context still unacceptably high levels What I'm saying is that if the policies we've put in place over a long period of time are working, we're going to go through a fairly long period where we're going to see better price numbers, but that in and of itself shouldn't be a justification for easing There is this rather simple-minded concept sometimes in the financial markets that somehow that gives the Fed room to ease and I just don't buy it "
1149,1991-05-14," I just want to explore the stock market issue We talked to some investment managers a week or so ago and my sense is that some are expecting some sort of a correction   Oh, we did? How much?   Well, I'm not sure that's what they had in mind! [Laughter]   Maybe this is a peculiar circumstance at this time, but I think it's a little tricky to tie monetary policy into a stock market predictor I just don't know what the linkages are   Well, for the record, I would be in favor of what you proposed as the policy prescription "
1198,1991-08-20," In terms of the first three alternatives in Dave's memo, allowing more fluctuation in the funds rate really doesn't appeal to me very much I don't think ambiguity would serve us very well The point about pressure on us to divulge more about our targets if there's ambiguity about what policy is I think is a point well taken In terms of automatism, if you will, it doesn't appeal to me to tie anything to M2; in other words, those fourth and fifth alternatives don't appeal to me at all I guess I still have some affinity for looking at reserves or the base I don't think we should write off Ml for all time There's a possibility that in a more stable environment in terms of inflation and inflationary expectations M1 perhaps is going to be more meaningful So, I would support Al's and Bob's suggestion that we do more work on that But I don't think we're anywhere near being able to go to an operating regime that targets reserves Something that might be possible in the short run--and this was in your summary memo, Don, not in Dave's-- would be this idea of continuing to do what we do but having some broad constraint based on some short-run aggregate that may modify behavior as we approach the limits of that constraint I really think of that as a trade-off We've talked about this concept before in the context of the directive; when we had monetary targeting we had that caveat in terms of funds rate fluctuations Now we have funds rate targeting and I think it would be quite appropriate to have some kind of constraint in terms of aggregate behavior But I don't think we can look at a period as short as an intermeeting period; we've got to look at much longer-term behavior of some reserve or monetary aggregate   The more I listen to this discussion, the more I think that maybe we ought to do away with this listing That's partly because the table presented in Governor Kelley's memo reminded me that I've seen that table in certain research where people try to figure out what the Fed is doing That sort of scares me because, as Jerry pointed out, sometimes we consciously change [the items in the list] and sometimes we don't think about them at all And it seems to me the purpose of that language is really guidance to you, Mr Chairman, and to the Desk in the intermeeting period I personally have confidence in your having listened to the discussion in the meeting and in your interpretation of that, and I'm not sure you need that guidance And I'm not sure that guidance adds any value to public [understanding], really These are sort of boiler plate things that any central bank is going to take into account in setting policy So, I'd be in favor of doing away with that recitation myself   Dave, wouldn't you think the policy record would reveal that, though? Wouldn't it reveal our particular concern without restating that in the operational paragraph of the directive? That was my main point   Yes "
1199,1991-08-20," The numbers for our District show a little different pattern These would be for the three-month period ended in June, so they're somewhat dated But this is the first time we've shown overall employment declines in recent months Manufacturing hasn't really changed much; it has been declining slightly What has happened is that we haven't had the offsets on the non-manufacturing side There is particular weakness in mining and construction In mining it has to do with the Clean Air Act and the high sulfur coal deposits in Illinois and Kentucky; in construction, it's a reflection of [the nationwide slump that] we're all familiar with I will say, though, that contracts in both residential and nonresidential construction show growth, so I think there's some improvement in store down the road there Just one piece of anecdotal information on this inventory story a large cotton grower, and he mentioned that the consumption of cotton in the textile industry is at the highest rate in 15 years Mills are running flat out 7 days a weeks and it's basically--   Right But the other comment he made is that the inventories have been run down to a [low] level His instinct, anyway, is that we'll be seeing a turnaround in the inventory situation in that particular industry  On a more general note, having listened to all the commentary, I think we have to caution ourselves at this point not to get whipsawed too much by the incoming data We're all familiar with the lags in policy, and this is going to be a time when expectations are going to be very volatile And at least in terms of how I look at policy, I don't think M2 is a very good indicator of the thrust of policy; I think we have to look at something narrower On that basis the thrust of policy has continued to increase throughout this year We just have to bear in mind, for example, that the growth rate of M1 over the course of 1991 has accelerated I certainly can't pretend to tell you whether a 7-1/2 percent growth rate in Ml is too much stimulus I'm just saying if we look at that as an indicator of the thrust of policy, we've been pumping more and more in And at some point we have to have the confidence that the actions we've taken are going to have the desired effect and not [let ourselves] get whipsawed by incoming data on the real economy To me that's a very dangerous guide for what monetary policy ought to be "
1200,1991-08-20," I prefer ""B"" symmetric, but were I voting I could certainly live with what you suggested With respect to the language, let me just raise a question It's possible that M2's behavior has nothing to do with what the real economy may be doing, and I question how we would be reacting to it Let's say that we're sitting here a month from now and M2 is still not performing and we're much more comfortable about what we see unfolding anecdotally on the real side; I think that language could trap us I'd be much more comfortable if, when we refer to the monetary aggregates, we were referring to them very broadly--in other words, including Ml I think we're getting ourselves into a trap in terms of too much focus on M2 and M3, which we can't directly control We would have much more opportunity to keep ourselves out of a corner that we may be painting ourselves into if we thought about M1 a bit I'm not saying we should target Ml; but if we thought about it a little more, it might help keep us from getting painted into that corner So, for that reason and because I presume we're not really looking at Ml, I'd favor version I in the language; I don't want to be painted into that corner   Like Wayne did [Laughter] "
1250,1991-10-01," Jerry, as this begins to sort itself out--I don't know what the potential is but obviously we're dealing with confidence here--it seems to me that an important part of this, if it were at all possible, is not having whatever decision is reached jumped on by key politicians right and left I don't know what that--   Right    10/1/91   I just want to make one follow-up comment Thinking about what John [LaWare] was saying--and again not prejudging where this ought to come out--it seems to me that one can draw a distinction between violations in the auction process, which the Treasury oversees, and our decision with respect to primary dealers, which is whom we choose to deal with to execute our transactions It just seems to me, getting back to John's point, that in effect as a punishment--and maybe it's perceived by some as an appropriate punishment--that implicitly the statement the Fed is making is that we're not comfortable dealing with these people I can just imagine what the reaction will be It will be ""The Fed must know something about this that we don't know,"" if they say they're not comfortable dealing [with that firm] That's a pretty serious statement, it seems to me And if somehow a distinction could be made between those two issues--the Treasury bidding process and our role in executing transactions--which is a distinction you've made before, I think it's an important one   Yes, we can suspend them from the auction process without pulling their primary dealership; that's what I'm saying    10/1/91   Sure "
1251,1991-10-01," I don't have any comments on that particular subject In terms of the District in general, I would say the numbers, which are necessarily somewhat stale at this point, would indicate that maybe we're at the beginning of a turnaround I have been reporting overall employment declines We have had pretty healthy growth in manufacturing employment in the most recent three- month period and a seeming cessation in the decline in nonmanufacturing employment, and both residential and nonresidential construction contracts are growing at pretty healthy rates Anecdotally, I picked up a somewhat different tone What I've been hearing, particularly from our board of directors, over a long period of time is that things are just moving along at a slow pace without any significant declines  We were in a couple of different parts of the District last week, and particularly in Evansville I picked up some very positive comments They all seem to go back to roughly midyear; they talked about a very lousy first half of the year One fellow who supplies automobile parts is running [his production facilities] seven days a week and has record shipments Another in electronic components has increasing orders There is some talk of capital expenditures in the industrial area there A lot of people are looking all of a sudden to relocate It's not new construction; it will be relocated manufacturing facilities But the observation was that people don't even look if they're not somewhat constructive, and there's a lot going on there In general, I would say this is mostly manufacturing- driven, just given the people we had in the room from that general area  In another area where the economy isn't performing so well, Mt Vernon, Illinois, there was a lot of talk about credit availability But in general I think there was a recognition that a rebuilding of balance sheets needed to take place One thing that surprised me is that no one really attacked [the Federal Reserve] in terms of interest rates In other words, no one said ""You've got to do something about interest rates"" Now, I think if you're in areas such as Boston and the West Coast, where maybe there's a lot of real estate hung up, that interest rate pressure is still there But in these areas there's just a general feeling that rates are not the issue And I would say, picking up on John LaWare's point about the credit crunch, that our aggregate banking data for the District continue through midyear to show no increase in nonperforming loans; we're at roughly the same level we were at the end of last year, with less than 2 percent in nonperforming loans and yet no loan growth So, this should be a group of bankers that isn't as shell-shocked as some others; and loans aren't growing  -22-    10/1/91  On the national situation, I'm comfortable with the Board staff's forecast I would make at least four observations First of all, I personally don't think monetary policy is inconsistent with recovery and expansion; I think it has been consistent with that for some time Secondly, I'm very skeptical about our ability to fine- tune the real side So, the concept that we can somehow buy more insurance bothers me I just don't think we'd be good enough to cash in that insurance, or however you want to describe it, when we need to And in that connection, I think there's a good deal of monetary stimulus in train, as Wayne pointed out--whether you look at what has happened to interest rates and in particular short-term real interest rates or whether you look, as we would be more inclined to do, at the behavior of narrow money or reserves over a period of time There's a good deal of stimulus in the pipeline and I don't think it has all shown through In fact, and this would be my final point, our view is that if we were to continue this rate of narrow money growth for a sustained period of time, we're probably already risking a somewhat higher inflation rate than the 3 to 4 percent that we're talking about achieving in the forecast period down the road "
1252,1991-10-01," Which way, Ed? [Laughter]   ""B"" symmetric "
1301,1991-11-05," I was just going to ask Peter If, say, we did it tomorrow, how effectively could you transmit it? I don't know what mode open market operations are in right now   I'm a little rusty on this I was just going to ask What is the dollar price effect of 10 basis points on the 10- year?   That's impossible   I didn't want my comments to be misinterpreted I'd support going ahead and announcing it It think it's unfortunate but I support that "
1302,1991-11-05," I have two questions, Mike One has to do with layoffs and quarterly earnings announcements I don't know whether you ever look at that, but often those two actions might be linked Is there a possibility that this spate of bad news we have gotten on the job front in terms of certain layoffs is simply a seasonal thing associated with the announcement of the third-quarter earnings?   My second question relates to the statement you made about real interest rates Just as a general matter I'm somewhat skeptical about our ability really to set those over time In any case, I was surprised to hear you say that you felt there was considerable scope for further reduction I'm curious as to how you're measuring that A look that we took would indicate that on an ex ante basis using, say, [unintelligible] the CPI and a 3-month Treasury bill rate, we're beginning to get to levels that, if sustained, were associated in the '60s and '70s with periods of rising inflation I just wanted you to expand on that if you could   In terms of our District, I would say it is still expanding but the expansion is sluggish We have employment growth in both manufacturing and non-manufacturing; it's somewhat stronger in manufacturing Residential construction over the most recent three-month period is up over last year; commercial construction is still down, but down considerably less than nationally, particularly year-over-year  On a broader prospective, my view is that certainly some of the numbers that have come out on the national economy recently are disappointing in relation to what we expected But they really are not all that bad, as others have observed Clearly, confidence is very sour I guess I'm influenced by what Mike said earlier and this was confirmed by people on our staff that confidence really has not proven to be a very good forecasting tool  I get a sense that we're very much caught up with a very short-term orientation toward policy right now There's considerable ease in train, whether you look at money or whether you look at interest rates Clearly, there has not been enough time for all the effects of that to be felt And, following up on my question to Mike Prell, I just don't see--whether you look at money or at interest rates--that there's all that much more scope for further easing Now, certainly we can try to force interest rates down further But I don't see why it is that we think we can step into the same trap that we have stepped into in virtually every postwar recovery and then be good enough and strong enough and smart enough to turn that around and not end up in the same position we've been in before I think we have been approaching this whole period of the last four years considerably  -17-    11/5/91  differently than in the past and I hope we can continue to do that In my view, that argues for considerable caution at this juncture, in line with what Bob Black said "
1303,1991-11-05," I'm in favor of standing pat right now I'd go with alternative ""B"" We just moved [Unintelligible] It's not an  -32-    11/5/91  original idea; Wayne alluded to it and others have mentioned it But I'm not so sure that a lot of activity isn't frozen on the expectation that rates are going to go lower A lot of people are just waiting to see So, I'd just stay where we are and watch for a while Also, I wouldn't be so quick to say that there isn't any inflationary risk right now I continue to think long rates are a reflection of long- term inflationary expectations I wouldn't be a bit surprised, if we made a move, that long rates would come down somewhat But I don't think that's the measure; it's a measure over a longer period of time of what those rates are doing I think we have to be careful if we disturb them "
1359,1991-12-17," Alan, I'll start on the theory that if I say something positive maybe we'll get three or four more [doing so] after    12/17/91  me; that's the usual pattern Lately, we've been starting too much on a negative note, so I'm going to go first  In terms of the latest numbers we have on the District, we have had reasonably strong payroll employment growth over the period, about a percentage point higher than nationally Most of that is coming from manufacturing, although there's some growth in the nonmanufacturing segment Residential construction is particularly strong over the three-month period Contracts are up 10 percent; that's not at an annual rate; that's a percentage increase over the prior three-month period Nonresidential is still weak  Our banking sector really continues to look very good If we look at the numbers through the third quarter in the Eighth District overall, we're looking at 1 percent ROAs; 12-1/2 percent ROEs; nonperforming loans that are really up imperceptibly over the last year and are at less than 2 percent; and reserves that are about 10 basis points shy of fully covering nonperforming loans In fact, in the month of November at the large reporting banks we have seen for the first time some meaningful loan growth, mostly in the C&I sector That sector in that month was up 2 percent--not an annual rate but 2 percent absolutely  The anecdotal information is hard to read, but what I keep picking up is that [business conditions] are basically pretty much the same, though I wouldn't be surprised to see a little deterioration in employment showing through in the last couple of months of the year The national sentiment that we all read about in the press is quite a bit different than the numbers we're seeing in the Eighth District  As for the economy overall, the only comment I'd be inclined to make is that I think there are dangers inherent in trying to apply what the economy is doing right now to what policy ought to be doing I worry increasingly about that Obviously, that doesn't take account of the lags, and there is no gauge of the thrust of policy in there That's all I have I hope we get some positive comments to follow [Laughter] "
1360,1991-12-17," Jerry, if you think what you said sounded preposterous, wait until you hear this! To say I'm not worried about the real side would be silly; I think one has to be But at the same time, I have the feeling that there's a limit to what monetary policy can do on the real side and that whatever it can do is only temporary The permanent effect of our actions is really only on inflation And I'd have to say that policy has become very stimulative in the last six months To gauge that, I look at reserves and I look at narrow money I do that because those are things we really affect through our actions And both of those are growing at double-digit rates One can argue about what that means, Alan But in terms of being surprised about what happened to inflation, one of the things that we look at is a three-year moving average of Ml When you came on, in 1987, that was over 11 percent; and in the next three years the three- year moving average of Ml came down to about 3-1/2 percent or a little less To us that indicated that the thrust of policy was very much on a disinflationary course and we've seen that flow through Now, what worries me is that, given the actions in the last six months, that trend growth rate has moved up a full percentage point My guess is that if we did nothing further, it probably would move up another full percentage point in the first half of next year And I worry about the long run I'm not sure we've stepped into the trap yet, but I think we're getting very close to making the same mistake monetary policy typically makes at this point in the cycle in that we could be sowing the seeds of the next inflation Now, I don't disagree [about the near term] I think we're going to see very good inflation numbers in '92 and we're probably going to see very good numbers in '93 What we're doing right now isn't really going to affect those years in terms of prices I think the effects are further out It gets back to what Mike was saying before I worry about setting up a stop-and-go policy and putting us in a position where several years down the road we're going to have to tighten dramatically I think the only chance of bringing inflation down in a permanent sense is through stable policy applied over a long period of time So, that's my longer-run concern  -32-    12/17/91  In the shorter run, what I worry about is the risk in foreign exchange markets I was struck by Gretchen's describing that earlier We have a fiscal policy that's in pretty tough shape; we're going to be looking at deficits next year of 6 to 7 percent of GDP; and we're going to be hearing a lot of political discussion about other measures that might be taken on the fiscal side We could continue to have a weak economy with that background music and we could find the dollar under extreme pressure If at that time we are sitting here with a monetary policy that is way out of position--and I'm arguing that I think we're getting there fast--we could have a real problem next year So, where I come out is that I would not be inclined to change policy now Obviously, that's not going to fly; I understand that from our discussion, but that would be my preference What I would argue for, assuming that we do make a change, is that we begin to communicate in some fashion that monetary policy has done about all it can because, if we don't start getting that message out there, expectations and pressures and so forth are going to continue to try to stampede us David, you talked a bit about this I probably wouldn't favor doing it with as aggressive a step as you would, but we need to get that message out And we need to do that relatively soon or we're going to continue to get run over by these pressures   I don't think I said that, Bob  -34-    12/17/91   That we shouldn't   You don't want to hear that one again, do you Alan? I'm ""B"" symmetric   Well, I'm relieved "
1412,1992-03-31," Just a quick question   Fundamentally and technically    3/31/92   Peter, let's say we did tilt toward doing more operations in longer coupons I don't know what your reaction would be, but it seems to me that a cynical market observer could question what that implies in terms of the System's long-term commitment toward price stability I don't want to carry this too far, but to the extent we are seen trying to jawbone long rates down or conducting operations that substantively are not going to have a lot of impact, if someone looked at that cynically they could view that as window- dressing to try to hold long rates down while perhaps we were trying to pursue basic policies that weren't consistent with price stability Do you see the opportunities for that kind of cynical interpretation?   My point, Alan, was that there's probably no problem doing what [Peter is] suggesting, but it's probably better for us if it's just done quietly than if for some reason what we do attracts publicity That's my point   No, I know "
1413,1992-03-31," In our District the statistics continue to be generally positive We have modest nonagricultural employment growth; manufacturing employment is down modestly compared to the prior three- month period but that's more than offset by gains in nonmanufacturing I would say that manufacturing has been bouncing around a little; I think I reported a modest increase last time Both residential and nonresidential construction contracts are quite strong, up about 15 percent in each category against the prior three-month period And the banking numbers that I report on periodically have continued strong through the fourth quarter Basically, the question always is Will those numbers hold up through year-end reserving and so forth? And in our case they did ROAs are still around 1 percent; ROEs are around 12 percent; nonperforming loans are flat and also are fully reserved  On the anecdotal side, I've had three or four contacts with branch boards or our board and other groups since our conference call, and I would say that the pattern I've heard there supports the more positive tone that seemed to emerge on that call I continue to be struck by people reporting plant relocations, plant expansions, labor callbacks, and so forth So, I get the sense that this [better tone] is gradually working its way back into the manufacturing sector We had a group of CFOs in from major St Louis companies, and I would say that in general the picture I got from them was not as positive as some of this other information They still view this as a very difficult business environment with not a lot of flexibility on the price side They are basically either maintaining or increasing earnings through a lot of focus on the cost side So, that pattern goes on  Nationally, the only comment I would have is that our forecast generally is in line with the Board staff's in terms of real growth looking out to 1993 On the price side, we're not quite as optimistic and generally are getting increasingly concerned about the stance of policy vis-a-vis what might be shaping up on the real side "
1414,1992-03-31," I'd prefer ""B"" symmetric but I can live with what you proposed One of the concerns I have in that regard is the public relations aspect of it I know [our directive] doesn't get [published] for a long time but if we were releasing it today after the meeting I think a lot of people would react by saying ""Oh my god, what are they worried about?""   Well, I'm not suggesting that it should be   Well, I guess unfortunately, I always operate on the theory--and I'm not commenting on the FOMC in particular but in general--that if I make a decision, no matter how hard I try, it's likely to become known So, I frankly worry about that And I think  -33-    3/31/92  symmetric language gives us every bit of flexibility that asymmetric does to respond  Let me just comment about what I touched on earlier when I said I was becoming increasingly concerned about the posture of policy I think M2 over long periods of time is a reasonable indicator of economic activity I think it's helpful in that regard, but it doesn't tell us anything about the thrust of policy And I do think we have to pay some attention to the narrower aggregates whether it's reserves, the base, or Ml I'd be ready to admit, as a lot of other people would point out, that some technical factors very likely are influencing the growth of Ml right now But what I worry about, and I've said these things before, is this In an interest rate targeting regime like we have, if we have that rate pegged at the wrong level in relation to where policy ought to be given what the economy is doing, the only way we're going to keep it there if it's pegged too low is by pumping in more and more reserves Now, we've seen short-term market rates in this period move up 20 to 25 basis points I'm willing to say in that connection that that probably just reflects wringing out expectations that were built into the yield curve that short rates were going to continue to fall--that policy would continued to be eased--and I think those have been washed out For at least some period of time here, I think the market is discounting an unchanged policy But I would begin to get more and more concerned if short-term market rates worked their way up even further and we continued to hold the funds rate at 4 percent because in effect that would be indicating to us that we're having to pursue a more and more stimulative policy to hold it there So, that's my concern But at this meeting, I think there's enough uncertainty in terms of what is going on with Ml on the technical side to come out for an unchanged policy and watch for a while But what I'm worried about is that we may conceivably be getting out of position in a longer-term sense "
1470,1992-05-19," I'd like to make two general comments; the first relates to M2 and how to interpret that One comment that I don't think has been made in the comments we've heard today is that some work we've done would indicate in our view that the relationship of M2 to nominal GDP is stationary only over very long periods of time I think we're talking five or more years It follows from that that the ability to predict velocity shifts in the short run is not at all good Therefore, the idea that--and I'm not suggesting anybody has advocated this--M2 can be used as a short-term targeting tool for  -21-    5/19/92  monetary policy, as far as I'm concerned, just doesn't fly To some extent, I think the emphasis that we have placed on that target has perhaps in a public relations sense painted us into a corner somewhat, and there are probably ways to deal with that by citing some other factors But the fact is, when push comes to shove in the short run, I would have a hard time justifying a policy action aimed at trying to get M2 into the target range or to some point in the target range for these very reasons I've cited Obviously, it's better to be in the target range, but if we have questions about whether M2 is [outside the range because of] technical or fundamental factors--and we're pretty confident there are some important technical factors--I would be inclined to explain those and take the heat for missing it That's the first point I wanted to make  The other point, which relates generally to the economy, is that we're a year into the recovery now and my sense is, both in terms of the statistics that we see and what I hear anecdotally, that the pace is picking up Obviously, the recovery is not in line with other post World War II recoveries, but I think it's well in place and picking up And I'd say that in general other forecasters are probably looking for the best inflation performance in 1992 with some pickup in '93 Now, we all know what the Board staff's forecast is; but even there Mike has seen fit, based on some recent information, to ratchet the forecast up And I think we've seen from time-to-time, not at the present moment, in the bond market and perhaps to some extent in the foreign exchange markets some questions about the Fed's resolve with respect to long-run price stability and so forth versus short-run fine-tuning of the real economy The point I would make with respect to that is that I don't think one can get terribly alarmed by anything we've seen in those areas as yet, but once it's clear in those indicators that we've lost credibility it's very hard and very expensive to buy it back So, in my view we want to stay ahead of that All of this is to suggest that I think the time really has come for us to focus not on when we're going to ease next but on when it is we are going to tighten And my final point on credibility is that while words can help, this is one of those times when people are going to watch what we do, not what we say  Just very quickly on our District, the picture is the same as I presented last month We are continuing to have moderate growth On the employment side, [growth] is coming primarily in the services area Manufacturing is still sluggish In particular, strength on the nonmanufacturing side is coming in construction; we have residential and nonresidential contracts up 20 to 30 percent from the prior three-month period My sense is that in the nonresidential sector it's primarily in the industrial area I don't have any sense of [much] going on with transactions in office buildings and so forth at this time Finally, just the tone of the comments I pick up is improving The anecdotal information seems to confirm this picture we've been looking at for some time in terms of improving economic activity in our District   Jerry, I might interject for those who worry about money that from the third quarter of 1987 to the first quarter of 1992, M2 grew at a 42 percent annual rate even with all the weakness we've had recently   Yes   No, I don't "
1471,1992-05-19," I'd favor ""B"" asymmetric toward tightening I think we've had a stimulative policy in place, no matter how you look at it, for a long period of time And, at a minimum, that's consistent with recovery and expansion Consistent with what Jerry was saying, I also think there's a risk as this expansion progresses that our policy, in terms of interest rates, is likely to be inconsistent with progress toward price stability We ought to be mindful of that I was quite comfortable with what you said in responding to Governor Lindsey, Alan Your earlier comments about perhaps seeing an opportunity to coax long rates lower worried me a little That may be possible at points in time, but I think it's very risky business at the level of short-term real rates we have right now and could well backfire, for what that's worth Finally, I could live with your prescription of ""B"" symmetrical but I'd prefer ""B"" asymmetrical toward tightening "
1523,1992-08-18," In our District I would say that the same shift that Bob McTeer described has occurred statistically We are looking now at June numbers and I would describe the situation as one where we've had modest employment growth, manufacturing more or less flat or maybe slightly negative, and nonmanufacturing offsetting that For the most recent three-month period, we actually have nonmanufacturing [activity] flattening out and modest employment declines I would say that one of the areas in nonmanufacturing that is particularly weak from an employment point of view is construction and that's reflected in contracts--residential as well as nonresidential--although compared to a year ago we're still up very significantly in the residential area Anecdotally, it's hard to place in time when some of this was detectable; it may have been a couple months ago But basically I don't detect any major shift in sentiment toward the negative I spoke with a handful of CFOs of some of our major companies, and in the retailing area the description I got was the same as what was mentioned earlier--I forget by whom, maybe Si--that the first couple of weeks of July were very strong and then sales slowed and [the slowdown] seemed to continue into August The retailer who passed that along said to me that they're not sure but they think the Olympic coverage may have had something to do with that; he likened it to the CNN effect to some extent Another retailer described things as generally volatile Every time they think things may be coming together they have a downturn From a profitability point of view, the largest of the retailers I've talked to had just reported a very strong quarter and they got it basically by controlling costs On the manufacturing side, a major electrical equipment manufacturer described their consumer-driven business as very strong They, too, reported very strong earnings, largely again a contribution of cost controls and so forth I did talk to a chemical manufacturer as well; a lot of their chemical business is driven by the auto business and housing and that has been generally sluggish, with no particular signs of strength there The capital goods side is described as sluggish, basically Order backlogs are holding up but not growing very rapidly So, the general picture I get from business people is that the environment hasn't changed dramatically  With respect to monetary policy--just picking up on some of the comments that have been made, particularly Ed Boehne's in terms of what the role is for monetary policy in this sort of environment--I agree that monetary policy can't solve some of the structural problems that we're dealing with And at least in my view, whether you look at interest rates or reserves, we're pursuing a very easy monetary policy right now Short-term real rates are negative and reserves over the last two quarters have grown at almost a 17 percent annual rate compared to a four-year trend of about 4-1/2 percent I know it's a very difficult period in which to get a handle on the thrust of monetary policy, but I think there's a lot of danger in focusing just on the real economy as our guide for what we ought to be doing--and that seems to be what is happening--and not trying to look at policy from some other perspectives I think we've had some warnings in the  -25-    8/18/92  foreign exchange markets and in long-term credit markets from time-to- time depending on what statements are made--albeit those rates have come down--that we may be testing the limits of our credibility And we could well find ourselves in a situation here given the season--and I gather some people are looking at the same facts and coming out a different door--where we're going to want all the credibility we can get If we don't have any, since we're the only game in town in that respect, we could have some very serious problems "
1524,1992-08-18," I would not favor ""D"" I had some sentiment for ""C,"" but I am a little concerned about the precision that second sentence might imply I don't have any problem with the concept of doing ""C"" and then saying we don't think we're going to make the ranges for the year I don't have a suggested change, but I think the words here may imply more certainty about these relationships than we have; I think Wayne was saying the same thing I could live with ""B""   I favor ""B"" symmetric, Alan I won't go into a lot of reasons; it's essentially for the same reasons that I cited at the last meeting but I feel even more strongly about them I think credibility is more of an issue now Also, we just eased and, if you think about it in percentage terms, it was a 15 percent cut in the level of nominal rates; that's not insignificant Finally, I think this view captures a number of people who want to ease right away, and  -42-    8/18/92  I just feel so strongly that that's the wrong thing to do that I guess it's hard for me to put myself in that group "
1569,1992-10-06," Joan, I know this most recent reserve period started off with continued pressure on the funds rate I don't know if that has continued into this week or not Were you surprised by that? I know the quarter-end has passed and we may still have Treasury balance problems and so forth How do you evaluate that?   At whose expense, right?   Move it    10/6/92 "
1570,1992-10-06," Ted, maybe I read too much into your comments, but you seem to take some comfort in the fact that the dollar is up on a trade-weighted exchange basis something like 1-1/2 percent over the intermeeting period and maybe 4-1/2 percent from the lows I must say I don't share that [view] The reason is that when one looks at how we've done against the other two principal reserve currencies, the DM and the yen, [the dollar is] down significantly and at historical lows I'm concerned that in a period of international turmoil we're really not providing much of an option in terms of a safe haven, and I think we ought to take note of that I don't know what your reaction to that is I would have expected that we would have provided more of an option and that in fact maybe we were part of the problem rather than the solution So, I just don't take that much comfort in looking at the broad trade-weighted exchange rate   At the last meeting I reported that our picture, which had been generally positive on the employment front, had weakened a bit That would be the case in the most recent period as well We have modest declines in employment, more in manufacturing than nonmanufacturing Earlier on, gains in nonmanufacturing were really offsetting the weakness in manufacturing Notwithstanding those numbers, I have not detected any significant change in attitudes among directors and other people I talk with Last week I was in two areas of our District that probably have never seen a recession, as a matter of fact Many businessmen I talked to--these tend to be small and medium-sized businessmen--are reporting record years and yet they just feel lousy Their complaints run to things like regulation, clean air, ABA, and things like that and the impact those things are having on them There's a great deal of uncertainty or lack of confidence--I don't know how to describe it It's just a not good feeling about where we're going or a lack of knowledge or confidence about where we're going And that, I think, is really affecting people I picked up the same thing we've heard from Ed and Gary Very seldom does anybody say that additional interest rate cuts are going to help; in fact they say quite the opposite  On the banking side in the Eighth District, as I've commented from time-to-time, our numbers still are looking very good We are outperforming our peers We tend to look at banks of less than $15 billion and I guess the most significant point is that nonperforming loans are lower--about 1-1/2 percent versus almost 3 percent in the peer group--and charge-offs are half that of the peer group, maybe 1/2 of 1 percent versus 1 percent I think that's the principal thing affecting results So, all during this period I've perceived our banks to be in a position to extend credit and I've felt that demand has been the problem, not supply We've seen modest growth in loan    10/6/92  demand over the last year and that has continued in the most recent period The most significant point is that it's across the board this time around We've all read articles recently about the increase in [banks'] securities portfolios Over the last year those have grown about 18 percent in our District but in the most recent quarter only 2 percent So, I sense that what is going on--and I don't know whether it is a harbinger of things to come more broadly--is that with a healthy banking sector we are beginning to see a little more loan demand, which is being reflected not only in the loan growth but in much slower growth in holdings of investment securities Probably, in terms of the aggregates, as demand picks up that will get reflected in M2 As you all know, the non-M1 components are really very weak-- negative--and all the growth we're getting in M2 is from very rapid Ml growth  Commenting nationally, the one concern I have about Mike's forecast is the longer-run inflation outlook I hope he's right I have no quibbles with what inflation is likely to be next year and maybe well into 1994, but the lags here are very long And one of the things I've commented on from time-to-time is this trend growth in Ml, which is a 3-year moving average I don't think we can make short- term policy decisions based on the short-term behavior of Ml; but over longer periods of time it gives us some information on what the thrust of policy has been From, say, late '86 or early '87 we had brought that trend growth down from 11 percent to roughly 3 percent In early 1990 it moved up in a relatively short period of time to over 7 percent and, of course, M1 is growing at about 15 percent now Again, I don't know that it has any relevance for decisions we'll be making today but longer term I worry about whether or not we're trading away some of that basis for lower inflation that we had created several years ago and that we're reaping the benefits of now  Just a couple of other comments, quickly One has to do with market expectations and whether we should gratify them or not because they're there or whether that gives us room to move I think we have to recognize that when this party comes to an end, whenever that is, it's going to be disruptive In other words, we've had a long period of declining interest rates and human nature, being what it is, is going to anticipate more That's just the way behavior in markets tends to work over time So, whenever the time comes for us to say ""that's it,"" it's going to be difficult I don't think that will ever be easy The other general observation I would make is that I'm more sensitive about the risks in foreign exchange markets, [along the lines of] Governor Angell's comments, than what I've heard in general around the table I just feel that that's a process; we learned this in the mid '80s Monetary policy was very stimulative for a long period of time and the chickens really didn't come home to roost in the foreign exchange markets until '87 as a result of actions that were taken in '85 and '86 I think we all know from that experience that once they do, it's awfully hard to get them under control again While it's easy to say that another 25 basis points may not engender any kind of crisis, if it ever did we would have one big problem on our hands   Alan, if it were up to me, I'd prefer to take action here at this meeting Having said that, I would vote ""no"" [Laughter] I basically view the hard asymmetric you've described as a decision to move It's almost a certainty And for the reasons I've articulated at other meetings, I just can't support that I think we're expecting far too much out of monetary policy as a short-run, fine-tuning tool for the real economy Frankly, I think there probably would be some benefits in terms of stability and so forth in communicating to markets The easing is over; now let's adjust to this level of rates and work from here I think there's ample stimulus in train To cite a quote from you ""My mild state of delusion continues"" [Laughter] "
1631,1992-11-17," One of the things we ought to focus on also is this issue of accountability and the assertion that individually we're not accountable I don't agree with that I'm not an expert on the Supreme Court by any means, but there may be a helpful precedent there in terms of the concept of a majority opinion and then minority opinions I'm not sure, for example, what discussions and negotiations go on in the Supreme Court to get the majority to sign off on a majority opinion But I suspect that such discussions don't take place in the Sunshine And I think the same principle probably applies here An important starting point for this is asserting that we are accountable and--this may sound strange coming from me--that this is a consensus oriented body When one ultimately signs off on the policy record, one has implicitly bought into the view that is stated [in that document] or if one has dissented, the record states why Through that vehicle, for starters I think everybody is accountable I can appreciate what a benefit a more detailed record might be to historians and others later, but the problem I have is that it comes at considerable administrative cost Let's say we did the memoranda of discussion; I suspect that participants would come in to the meeting and say ""I have my written statement that I'm going to come in and read"" There would be more of that rather than people reacting to the discussion at hand or a combination of each of us presenting [views] that we had in mind coming into the meeting and reacting to the discussion that goes on We'd have to get advice from the lawyers on this, but I worry about going down that path If in effect we say we're willing to do this--to create a memorandum of discussion if Congress gives us this protection--it would be very easy to lose whatever protection we need under FOI, yet we'd be stuck in terms of saying it would acceptable to us to do this I think the end result would be, first of all, that we'd have a much more cumbersome process and secondly, that we'd very likely end up releasing the memoranda a lot sooner than we'd like to  -53-    11/17/92  The final point I would make is this I've been intrigued with this idea of whether we can cut the legs out from under some of this argument by releasing more promptly something very simple after each meeting regarding the decision that was made Did the Committee decide to tighten, ease, or maintain the same degree of reserve restraint? But to the extent that we go down that path--a number of people have mentioned this--we really have to think about that very carefully in that it starts to raise questions of whether we include the asymmetry of the [directive] language in [what we release] Think about what the markets would have done after the last meeting if we had released the directive with asymmetry toward ease and then never acted And what do we do about decisions in between meetings? Are those disclosed on a real-time basis or are those disclosed at the next meeting? I suspect that we could get trapped into what more and more would become a very complicated web It's seductive in a way because I think all of us probably believe that the information on our actions is in the market right away; generally speaking, the problem is not that the markets do not know where the Fed is at a point in time But there's this perception of secrecy So, it's very seductive to think we can cut the legs out from under that But if we go down that path, we really have to think through all the ramifications   Right   When I go full circle on this issue, where I come out is that if it's defensible, what we're doing right now is probably about right, subject to thinking about something along the lines that you just described   I'm not sure we'd want to disclose it so soon   We can just disclose actions taken  -60-    11/17/92   Yes   Just a very quick comment on earlier release of the policy record A couple of people said they weren't sure that we could defend what we're doing now I would just say that it would be normal in a body like this in effect to review the minutes of the [previous] meeting when the body gets together again, because there's always the possibility that somebody who reads that last revision has a problem with it and we're all together and can resolve that and close out that issue Whereas if we're reviewing the minutes in effect through a series of independent calls, we would never have that opportunity And I think we could defend it on that basis "
1632,1992-11-17," On a District basis I don't have anything new to report The statistics or anecdotal information we have suggest that the Eighth District is growing modestly more rapidly than the rest of the country, but there are no really dramatic changes  On the national front, I would have two brief comments One is--and I think Mike Prell allowed for this in commenting on the forecast--that I personally wouldn't be nearly as sanguine about the long-run inflation outlook as the forecast is with an assumption of an unchanged funds rate I'm talking about looking out a couple of years I have trouble with that working out that way Secondly--and this is by no means a criticism of the staff's efforts to forecast because I think the staff is among the best in terms of that job, but it's a very difficult job--the third quarter served as a reminder to me of the questionability, if you will, of short-run fine-tuning monetary policy based on economic forecasts As good as that process may be, it's a very, very difficult thing to do We essentially are looking at a rate of growth in GDP that is probably twice what we thought a couple of FOMC meetings ago If you look back over time, I think that pattern repeats itself So, I was reminded of that and thought I'd share that  -13-    11/17/92 "
1633,1992-11-17," I would favor reducing the ranges now and I think a range of 2 to 6 percent is probably right I could live with 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent A case can be made for either one With respect to the timing, I feel the case is there now and we ought to go ahead and get it done As a lot of people said, we don't know in what climate we would be trying to do this some months down the road I would go somewhat beyond making the argument just a technical one because I think we're trying in some sense to consolidate the progress we've already made toward price stability In terms of impacting expectations, that could be a part of it without implying that we're rattling the saber; it would have to be done artfully The other thing to think about, which you mentioned, is the communications problem I guess there really isn't an opportunity to arrange some sort of forum Congress is not going to be in session for the balance of the year, is that right?   You might want to consider ways to take the initiative here--in a speech or something--so that you could get the message out with your spin on it rather than responding to, say, Mr Gonzalez, or somebody in the press teeing off on it If we were going to do it now, we'd have to think about ways to communicate it to the public on our terms, not in response to somebody else's  With respect to short-term policy, I strongly favor ""B"" symmetric There's a possibility I might even be leaning toward a nonexistent ""C"" The way I feel about this is that we've had a relatively smooth adjustment in financial markets to a significant change in perceptions about the thrust of monetary policy I don't believe for one minute that what we've seen in intermediate-term rates is a response to what our economy needs I think it reflects a lot of other factors with respect to expectations about inflation and the real economy So, if we were to ease now, I don't think those rates would retrace their runup; I don't know to what extent they'd even come down I realize every cycle is different, but in general I think this is the time when the Fed typically makes mistakes because we sit here and we're uncertain about the speed of the recovery We all probably know, or I at least feel, that we're pegging short-term rates at a level that is not sustainable in an economy with any kind of upward momentum I think we have to be very sensitive to a situation where short-term market rates move up as we peg the funds rate to fixed levels This is obviously not a new concept; we've talked about it before But the net result is that to keep that administered rate where it is we have to provide reserves at a very rapid rate, and we're doing that There are certainly some technical factors one can point to in that regard, but I suspect there may be more to it than that So, I think we have to be very sensitive to not overstaying [ease] Finally, I think a symmetrical directive gives us plenty of flexibility to respond in either direction   I don't mean to interrupt, but if we're not going to do anything now--if there's a sense of the meeting not to do anything--do we really have to vote on it?   If we're just leaving the ranges the same-- "
1687,1992-12-22," I'd like to make three comments on the national economy First, just as a lesson for the future, I'd like to remind us all that as recently as two meetings ago we couldn't see the strength that was unfolding in the second half That isn't a criticism of the Greenbook forecast It wasn't in our forecast; it wasn't in other forecasts; and it wasn't in the anecdotal reports We were standing right on top of it and we couldn't see it That's just an important lesson to remember going forward It's not a question in my mind of whether we made mistakes in the forecast It just points out how difficult it is to do that and really use it as a basis for making policy decisions Secondly, I realize that Mike has to make an assumption with respect to what policy is going to be, but it's just inconceivable to me that we'll get through 1993 without an increase in the funds rate The real issue may be that we are probably lucky to be getting out of 1992 without making one; I think it's something we're going to have to be thinking about a lot sooner than [the staff's] assumptions might imply  The final point I'd like to make, and it relates to the second one, is that it troubles me greatly when I read pieces in the paper--I don't hear it around this table--about how we need to have more economic stimulus, whether it's fiscal stimulus or monetary stimulus, to increase the rate of employment growth In my mind, the reason that we're seeing sluggish employment growth is that we're getting good productivity gains, and that's what one would expect at this stage of the cycle Those gains are going to provide the basis for increased output and income and eventually employment down the road To jeopardize this basic setting we have of declining inflation or to jeopardize the progress that we're making toward price stability in order to try to increase employment gains would be a mistake The final observation I'd make on that particular issue is that just because of demographics and slower labor force growth, we won't be seeing the kind of employment gains that we've seen in other recoveries That's an important factor in that  With respect to the District, my comment would be that in employment basically we're seeing a pickup in momentum For a good deal of the months during the middle part of this year, I wouldn't say we were lagging but the pace had slowed to that in the rest of the country I'm seeing increased momentum in the most recent three-month period in relation to the last year and significantly higher gains both in the last three months and over the last year than for the nation as a whole So, we have another one of those situations where there are very significant regional differences that are somewhat masked in the overall numbers "
1688,1992-12-22," I'm wondering how I can outdo Wayne here! I would favor ""B"" biased toward tightening, but I could accept ""B"" symmetric And just for the video cameras, I once dissented in favor of an easier policy in 1989!  Alan, just to pick up on what you were saying, if you're right about this productivity phenomenon--and I know you weren't asserting this but just laid it out as an explanation--and we in effect have greater potential than we realize but temporarily we also have associated debt and more unemployment, this goes back to what I was saying before I really don't think it's the job of monetary policy to hurry the adjustment [process] along, and I don't think you were suggesting that The economy is going to have to absorb that, and we've got to focus on price stability As I think Don said at the end of his statement, we can't use a pickup in inflation as our signal that we need to begin to tighten policy I've heard that suggested, but if we wait until then I think all of us know that we're going to be way too late--probably by not just a matter of months but by years  The other thing I would say is that [when we were easing policy] we said that we would very likely overshoot in terms of trying to stimulate the economy and get the funds rate too low, but that once things turned around--and I know this turnaround has been long in coming and there is still uncertainty about it--we would have to be prepared to pull that rope back fairly quickly I think we're approaching that point That's what I have to say "
1741,1993-03-23," I was just going to make a comment This draft that you're seeing is the first draft that we've seen on the subcommittee too In concept it sounded like it made some sense When I looked at it and compared it against the policy record, it seemed to me almost impossible to do it without adding meaning Now, I think it's a good summary for somebody who's not going to bother to read the policy record But I think the people who will read these, the press and the Fed watchers, can read more meaning into it For example--I don't want to beat this to death--where it talks about the Committee's commitment to maximum sustainable economic expansion the word ""noninflationary"" was added here and it wasn't in the policy record Or where it talks about the uncertainty with respect to velocity, in the policy record that led us in effect to say that we were willing to miss the ranges; in the summary it says that it led us to conclude that we have to evaluate monetary developments in a broader context, which is said later in the policy record I'm just saying that all the people who read this are going to add meaning that we may not have intended by how we say this, what we say, and what we don't say So, I have some problems with trying, in effect, to restate the policy record "
1742,1993-03-23," I have several comments to make on the District economy First of all, on the employment side we're seeing much stronger growth statistically We look at this on a 3-month moving average basis, so it's more than just the most recent month One of the two big shifts there is that we're seeing reasonably strong  -24-    3/23/93  manufacturing employment growth, which we hadn't seen up to this point That had been slightly weak and we were offsetting that with nonmanufacturing employment Nonmanufacturing employment is strong as well So, at least for the most recent period we have a much stronger picture there On the other hand, in terms of anecdotal information I've picked up the same things some others have mentioned Since the announcement of the economic program, expectations have been dented a little The uncertainty associated with that I think has undermined confidence a bit In terms of credit demand, we are still not seeing a significant pickup at the larger banks but we are at smaller banks We had a group of bankers in last week and [their reports were] a mixture; it was interesting to watch the bigger bankers listen to the little community oriented bankers who deal with small businesses talking about their increased credit demand So, I think that's going on One interesting comment that was made in that regard is that this demand is associated both with capital spending and in one case in particular with some inventory building The banker associated it with concerns about building price pressures It may be overstating to call it speculative inventory building, but I haven't heard comments like that for a long time  The final comment I would make about the District economy relates to the issue of price pressures I have heard a number of comments recently about building price pressures Just three months ago if you even brought up the idea of inflation, people looked at you as if you'd lost your mind It's very interesting how quickly this has shifted Some of it is in the obvious areas Scrap steel is up in the first two months of the year by close to 20 percent, I think, and we've all heard the stories about lumber costs Also impacting residential building, at least in the St Louis area, are finished lot costs The inventories are being run down; they're not being replaced and there are probably only a handful I heard one person mention that maybe three developers could get financing to develop lots in this environment That's not a credit crunch comment totally I just think the nature of that business has changed Probably some people have been washed out of that business who maybe shouldn't have been in it for the long haul anyway In any event, I'm hearing more comments about price pressures, not just in places where one would expect but more broadly--comments by people just hearing about this [from various contacts]  On the national front, I'd associate myself with what Al Broaddus said and what Dave Mullins just said in that I don't think this is the time to take action, but I think we are in a difficult position in a sense We don't have monetary indicators that we have a lot of confidence in and we're in a very difficult political environment But I think the day is probably fast approaching when these straws in the wind that we're seeing now may really take hold-- and maybe it's more than straws in the wind--and we will have to move I was struck by what Mike Prell said in his presentation--I think this is what you said, Mike--that it wouldn't take much of an overshoot in nominal GDP to see greater price pressures   Okay In any case, we're going to have our work cut out for us in the not too distant future  -25-    3/23/93 "
1743,1993-03-23," I could accept your proposal, Alan As I think about the symmetry issue, we might as well take the heat when we make a move, not through some words We've been to that movie recently and it's probably not worth it There are two things that influence my thinking right now I'd probably be more concerned if we hadn't seen the slowdown in M1, reserves, the base, and so forth over the last couple of months As you know, I don't think those are an appropriate target for policy, but I do think they have some value as an indicator of the thrust, and they have slowed down The other thing is that we're looking at higher inflation numbers, although David makes the point very well that we're still probably not looking at enough numbers yet to be sure It's dangerous to overreact to high frequency data But I agree with what Al Broaddus said, that if we wait until  -43-    3/23/93  we're absolutely sure we're looking at inflation and expectations have become imbedded, it's very hard to catch up, as you said too   Yes "
1795,1993-05-18," Gretchen, in the [written] report there was a comment about the [market's] vulnerability to the dismantling of these longer-term investment positions--and you just mentioned it in your remarks--in Europe in particular Do we have any sense of the magnitude of that, what dynamics might drive a liquidation, what the impact of that could be, and so forth?   I'm talking about investment positions in US dollars "
1796,1993-05-18," First of all in terms of the District, the unemployment numbers I'm going to report are really the best numbers I've seen in a good while We had payroll employment growth in the most recent three-month period, which would be through March, up 38 percent in the District Another notable change [is that] we've been getting marginal growth in employment And certainly the St Louis District in general has done better than the nation through the recession Another shift has been that we're getting more of the growth through manufacturing That was actually up 48 percent, with particular strength in electrical equipment and transportation equipment; it was up somewhat less in nonmanufacturing, 3-1/2 percent And there is considerable strength in construction It's somewhat stronger in residential in terms of contracts and significantly stronger in nonresidential for that most recent three-month period Notwithstanding that, as I talk to people around the District, I don't get the sense--in terms of the tone of comments--that people think  -26-    5/18/93  we're in any kind of a boom And I'm hearing the same concerns others have expressed regarding uncertainty about fiscal policy and other government policies  With respect to the national picture, in thinking back to the second half of last year when real growth came in at around 4 percent, I'm struck by the fact--just thinking about where we are now and where we thought we were then--that the economy is fundamentally in a lot better shape now than it was then We are getting some job growth now which we weren't getting then There were considerable uncertainties at that time and, indeed, there are uncertainties now But in some ways they were even greater at that time The whole financial restructuring process has proceeded further I think one has to assume that we're in better shape in that sense And the anecdotal reports we've heard around the table today in general are better As Mike Prell acknowledges in the Greenbook, there is a possibility of the first-quarter GDP being revised up But I think it's a little dangerous to put too much stock in one quarter's GDP numbers We could actually be surprised in retrospect in terms of how well things are going now  As some others have mentioned, notably Al Broaddus and Gary Stern, my principal concern is on the inflation side I, too, am skeptical as to whether or not we will resume the disinflationary trend we seemed to be on And I think the experience of the first four months of this year has definitely had an impact in terms of expectations In terms of why that could be, it seems to me there is an explanation relating to money and credit, though not one we in this room generally put a lot of stock in We had M1 growth over the last two years through the first quarter at double-digit rates I guess I'm not prepared to try to translate that into what it may mean exactly in terms of real growth and prices, but I view that as a very substantial monetary impetus As that growth slowed very dramatically in the first quarter it gave me some comfort that perhaps the general thrust of policy had shifted somewhat But what I'm seeing as far as M1 projections looking forward [concerns me] Again, this is only a month or two, but for May we're talking about a possible 25 percent annual growth rate in M1 It may be that what I perceived as a significant sea change in the thrust of the growth in that aggregate in the first quarter of this year was really only a temporary pause and that we're still on a very strong upward trend in terms of monetary thrust We're probably not compelled to act now, but if these inflation expectations become embedded and the first-quarter [inflation rate] turns out stronger than people perhaps think it is now and if real growth is stronger, it's just going to be harder to catch up later So, my principal concern relates to developments we've seen in the wage and price climate "
1797,1993-05-18," I didn't put my hand up, but I have to speak anyway! I was very much influenced by this meeting I came in sitting on the fence, frankly And based on hearing the discussion my preference would be--if I had to do one or the other--probably to move rates up a little right now But it's clear to me that there's not a consensus to do that This is a very important move and I think there has to be a stronger consensus than exists right now Therefore, I could accept deferring action I think there's a risk in deferral and David put his finger on it There's a risk that we might have to do more later if things break the wrong way In a sense, even if they break the right way and we follow [developments] in this intermeeting period, we may decide we really don't have to act We can discuss it again at the next meeting and maybe decide that we don't have to act then either, but it won't remove the fact that the funds rate probably  -52-    5/18/93  is not pegged at a sustainable level The question is What is that [delay] building in, in terms of lagged effects that ultimately are going to come home to roost later? And then there's the credibility question that Al Broaddus raised in terms of where we all expected inflation to come in this year and where it is likely to come in and what that means if we take that sitting down It's a tough issue, but that's where I come out "
1848,1993-08-17," As far as the District goes, we generally have been outperforming the nation during this expansion although in the latest three-month period employment growth has been a little worse than sluggish; we've had slight declines I don't think there's much flood effect in that, however What I might do is just make a few comments on the flood; St Louis has really been the center of that And as Si said, for those who are directly affected it's very devastating But what is striking is the small percentage of the population that is actually affected; it's about 1 to 2 percent In the Bank we have 800 employees and 6 or 8 families that are affected in some way, and I'd say that's quite representative I think the assessment that the broad economic impact is going to be relatively narrow is on target Clearly, there have been some crop losses and some disruption of jobs, but really very little One of the main ongoing effects is going to be the impact on transportation We've had roads washed out and it will be a long time before the barge traffic can move on the river Basically what I hear from our directors and others is that [transportation problems] are adding to costs somewhat and it's a bit of a nuisance, but goods are basically getting moved I think that will be with us for a while  Like Gary Stern, we did a survey of banks We basically picked the counties on either side of the river--the Mississippi, Missouri, and Illinois rivers--and talked to about 200 banks They constitute about 10 percent of District banking assets; and 80 percent of those banks are less than $100 million, so they are principally small banking operations What struck me through the whole thing--and Gary touched on this--was how little disruption to operations occurred We picked this up on the survey although it would not have been obvious from our own activities Thirty-one banks had some disruption in operations--either carriers having difficulty getting in  -16-    8/17/93  or out or actually having to make other arrangements, such as having their deliveries made to other processing centers or otherwise moving their processing And 19 facilities, either head offices or branches, were evacuated because of flooding We hear concerns about liquidity --no pun intended--but there has been only one discount window loan, an adjustment credit loan, that was at all associated with flood- related problems that I'm aware of up to this point in time The big uncertainty looking down the road really is on credit quality But, again, I don't think that's going to be a significant factor even from a District perspective I would say most of the banks are looking for less than a 10 percent impact in terms of their loan portfolios And of the 200 we talked to there are roughly 25 that think the impact will be greater than 10 percent There will be a few banks--and these would be basically ag banks in small towns where both the agricultural loans and the business loans in the community would be affected--that could have problems But they are relatively small In fact, all of those 25 banking organizations have $50 million in total assets or less We will stay in touch with this In a sense, while the crisis has passed, I think we're dealing with the worst part of it right now in terms of the cleanup and rebuilding And that will take some time  On the national front, just a couple of comments Similar to what Al said, I've been very pleased with how expectations with respect to policy have shifted without really trashing the markets It wasn't too long ago when the expectation was that we were on a one- way street for lower rates [and we've moved] to a period now, I guess, where expectations are fairly balanced But the Chairman made it pretty clear in his testimony that there is the possibility that they will be moving up, and that has been very well received, I would say Done differently, one could imagine a good deal of short-term turmoil in the markets, which we really haven't had with that shift in expectations Who knows how to sort it out, but there may be some beneficial impact, as Al observed, in the longer end of the market The other thing that is extraordinary, particularly given the perception the last time around, is that the pressures on monetary policy emanating from a deficit reduction package have really been muted and well contained And I think that's quite an accomplishment from the politicians and the press  One of the things I have a little concern about is the fact that to some extent we are a bit at sea internally in terms of what we ought to be looking at We've had problems with M2; we went through the Feinman/Porter [study]; we talked about an M2+; the Chairman mentioned real interest rates And I think one of the things that we need to be careful not to do is to convey a lot of confusion in the central bank about what we ought to be doing This is, and always has been, basically a judgmental matter; and I think the judgments have been very good during this period To the extent that we roll out too many different possibilities in rapid succession, in terms of what we ought to be looking at, it's possible we could convey a sense of confusion about what we ought to be doing when in fact I think there's a lot of credibility associated with the Fed's actions In particular--and I suspect to some extent, Alan, what you said was misinterpreted in this regard--the real interest rate [issue] caught a lot of attention There was a sense that people would question if we can't really control it in the long run and all we can really observe is a proxy and we can't really observe real interest rates and we  -17-    8/17/93  don't know what at any point in time the right natural rate is, it's very hard to view that as a target I don't think that is what you were suggesting I think you were suggesting that there is information there and that we ought to use it, and I agree with that But as we go through this period of thinking about what we ought to be looking at, we ought not get too far from the basics We ought to focus on the tools of policy and what it is we affect--reserves, the base, and all the aggregates related to that I won't say any more about it today, but I'm struck by that chart in the weekly Board briefings that relates the opportunity costs of M1 to its velocity and how that has tracked--how certain periods stand out, at least to the eye, where there have been inflection points in policy There may be more information in M1 than we're willing to give it credit for "
1849,1993-08-17," Just on that point about the behavior of traders It seems to me that if they actually see the Fed moving, they could conclude from prior experience that the Fed may be late and that it implies the potential of higher actual inflation and maybe an economy that's stronger than they perceived and, therefore, higher real rates than they thought the market was discounting   Right  -37-    8/17/93   Yes   So where do you come out? [Laughter]   Alan, I agree with your analysis in terms of going back I think the directive ought to be symmetric And I think, as Wayne Angell said, that we ought not kid ourselves that debating the language is really making policy I don't think we used it inappropriately Because things didn't unfold to give us the opportunity to move in that direction, it's appropriate to go back But we probably ought not overuse the tool because to some extent we see the down side right now in terms of possible misinterpretation in markets And I agree with Bill McDonough that a statement could be helpful at some point to clarify exactly what we mean by it because I do think the press and others put much more weight on it than we may intend "
1897,1993-09-21," In our District the situation is pretty much like the one Al described I don't detect any major changes in activity We're still seeing modest growth I would say that retail sales are reasonably strong That's not getting fully reflected in employment, though, where we've been pretty sluggish We're relatively stronger than the rest of the country in manufacturing and quite weak in services right now Some of that may be flood-related because of the impact on construction in particular, which has been a weak sector employment-wise We do hear reports from our directors and others about modest expansion in manufacturing areas--firms adding several hundred jobs here and there So, generally, I'd say that's picking up Housing has been quite strong over the last year What we heard earlier was that the wet weather in the spring was going to push activity later into the summer and I think we're seeing that now in terms of a pickup in activity With respect to the flood and its effects in general, there wasn't that much disruption of employment activity and many of those who were disrupted are back to work now Cleanup efforts are under way There will probably be some positive impact on construction activity in due course, although I don't think it will be that noticeable on a national basis Barge traffic is moving on the river and so forth, so in many senses the crisis of the flood is behind us  In terms of banking, it was interesting to note an increase in loan activity across the board in the second quarter; actually loan growth was relatively healthy in Eighth District banks, up not quite 6 percent Consumer, real estate, and business categories were all growing My final point--maybe this is somewhat related to the flood, but [it's difficult] nationally to sort out the flood, drought, and other effects--is that the crop estimates aren't dramatically down that much But it's interesting that in Missouri the corn crop is estimated to be down about 40 percent, which is a fairly dramatic hit, but in Illinois [the effects are] very little, maybe about 15 percent in terms of the corn crop  Nationally, I keep asking myself why I don't feel better about the relatively sanguine outlook that we have This ought to be ideal from a central banker's point of view I know we're paid to worry, but real growth around potential and reasonably well behaved  -22-    9/23/93  prices is something I guess we ought to feel good about But there are two things that bother me somewhat One has to do with the fact that I just don't think we can gauge the current thrust of monetary policy very well, and I'm very uneasy about the fact that we may well be in a very stimulative posture and those chickens will come home to roost The other thing--and I think it has been appropriate to show some flexibility on this front--ultimately would be the question in my mind of moving the inflation rate down closer to what would be some representation of price stability Others have commented on this at other meetings I think to some extent we've taken comfort in the fact that prices haven't been moving up But at some point we may have to think about trying to move inflation a little lower "
1898,1993-09-21, Count me in! 
1957,1993-11-16," Virgil, you and Don both mentioned Congressional subpoena Could you describe that process in more detail and how it might relate to tapes and transcripts that are prepared in connection with doing a Memorandum of Discussion even if we had a procedure whereby once that MOD was approved the tapes and transcripts could then be disposed of pursuant to authority from the Archivist? Further, if there were legislation that specifically protected us under FOIA with respect to public release with some appropriate lag, would that have any bearing on Congressional subpoena power?   So, in theory, it would be possible, say, in extreme circumstances, or under any circumstances, [for Congress] to subpoena tapes and transcripts on a real time basis?   Okay   I wanted to come back to the MOD and its relationship to FOIA I guess this would be a question for Virgil Even if the Justice Department agreed with the procedures we intended to pursue and therefore presumably would defend us in the future against a denied FOIA request, assuming policy or personnel didn't change, isn't it likely that we would in fact have a lawsuit? In other words, if we decided to do an MOD going forward, it seems to me that at some point--sooner or later, and probably sooner--someone would test that in the courts, whether the lag with respect to its release was three years or five years We'd have the litigation and ultimately be subjected to some judgment in the courts That's part of the question The other part of my question is As the FOMC has considered this in the past, is the only way that we could really be sure we would be adequately protected is if we had specific legislation on that?   One other question, Virgil If we adopted the MOD procedure going forward, do you think the likelihood of litigation is fairly high?   I have three general points I'd like to make and then I'll cover my thoughts on what we ought to do The first point is that past practice can and should be separated from what we do in the future Don made that point and I agree with it First of all, I think the existence of transcripts which have not been used in general for any purposes of the FOMC beyond preparation of the policy record or minutes, depending on what we called them at a point in time, should not require that we continue to tape and transcribe Secondly, I think the President's new policy with respect to FOIA should cause us to review our future practices In other words, that is a significant change; and regardless of what may be going on in terms of a general legislative debate about FOMC disclosure, that should cause us to review what we're doing It's unclear to me what the outcome of litigation would be with respect to an MOD Even if we were taping and transcribing, there is the possibility of a FOIA request for tapes and transcripts, which would in effect freeze that process Now, I appreciate what Virgil said about the position we have, but we just really don't know where litigation is going to come out And we would have that overhanging our deliberative process for some considerable  -24-    11/16/93  time as we fought it out through the courts So, really, the only way to protect tapes, transcripts, and so forth going forward is through legislation That's the only way we can be sure that the deliberative process is protected  My second general point is that I think we need to resolve today what we want to do with respect to the release of information about past meetings We just have to do that Because of the importance of decisions with respect to future meetings we may want to consider what we do further and decide later, albeit promptly--in my mind certainly no later than the December meeting  My third point is that as a general matter I think it would be desirable from a public information point of view to consider doing something in the future which provides greater disclosure without adversely affecting the deliberative process I'll get to that briefly at the end  With respect to past meetings, Alan, I favor what you recommended lightly edited transcripts with a five-year lag And I would be inclined to release those for 1988 as early in 1994 as we could and then establish some schedule for release of the earlier ones, which would really be determined by the availability of staff to prepare them And I'd just make those available according to some predetermined schedule As people have said, I think they would be more open than an MOD looking back would be and I think the cost is considerably more reasonable I'd favor review by the Secretariat staff only in the interest of getting this information out on a timely basis And one final point with respect to releasing them with a five-year lag The precedent of what we did with the old MODs is what we ought to look to in terms of setting that timeframe; five years would be consistent [with our past practice]  With respect to future meetings, I would favor our current approach to keeping minutes Don, I don't know which alternative this is of yours; I guess it would be your alternative one, the current minutes with no taping or transcript and with any notes of the Secretariat staff made in connection with preparing the minutes disposed of on approval of those minutes That would be, in my view, normal practice for that sort of function My general view is that the FOMC ought to be held accountable for its decisions, not the details of its deliberations And in my view the minutes are more than adequate in that regard and include details of how individuals voted Secondly, our procedure of taping and transcribing is not required in any way In effect, it has only been for the convenience of the Secretariat staff And that raises questions that have been touched on before with respect to retention of these records--tapes and transcripts--under the Federal Records Act Third, I think tapes and transcripts, as I've said before, would be subject to FOIA litigation and [would result in] considerable uncertainty overhanging the Committee for some period of time Finally, as has been pointed out, tapes and transcripts would be subject to immediate Congressional subpoena, which would be a form of oversight that goes well beyond the semiannual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony and could raise questions in financial markets of the Fed's independence Another point on this approach, which I think has considerable advantages, is that no legislation would be required in order to make sure that our deliberative process was protected going forward  -25-    11/16/93  My final point would be, and I touched on this at the beginning, that I do think in a public information sense we need to take steps to be more open and should consider such things as either enhanced minutes or prompt release of the directive in connection with the approach that I laid out   Lightly edited is my first choice; my second choice is raw with annotation   Five and ten   Enhanced minutes first; current minutes second   It's prompt release like [the current minutes]   It's the same as what we do now   How do enhanced and current minutes taken together come out?   And current?   So it's four   Well, you could have the opportunity to--   No legislation would be necessary   Thanks, Alan Well, I would just make two points One is to reiterate what I said earlier This is very important with respect to the future functioning of the Committee I think the most important decision we need to make today is the one with respect to going back I think it would be helpful to make one going forward but if we can't do it with the sense that there is total comfort in the decision, maybe we shouldn't Maybe we should think about it more and decide--  -54-    11/16/93   The other point I wanted to make--and reasonable people can differ on this--is that I don't feel we have as much flexibility to change going forward as you do [If we were to decide] to go to an MOD now, we would be announcing that publicly I think the perception would be that we've moved toward further disclosure because we think it's appropriate; some in Congress certainly feel it's appropriate Then, if within a short period of time--months or even years--we decided that we didn't think that was appropriate any more, I doubt that [a change] would be accepted very well [The perception would be that] we made a move toward further openness and then all of a sudden, presumably as soon as the heat was turned up and we got a Congressional subpoena for tapes and transcripts, we immediately changed our procedures I think changing our procedures at that time would be even more difficult than changing them now   I think it would be appropriate in that case for the Chairman to say that this is an issue that the Committee has to focus on and the Committee will respond through the Chairman when it has completed its deliberations "
1958,1993-11-16," The Eighth District economy has been buffeted by floods, strikes, defense cutbacks, and corporate restructuring over the last year Cutbacks in defense spending and auto production have adversely affected the Missouri economy These cutbacks were  -77-    11/16/93  especially noticeable in the St Louis area Flooding along the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers and persistent rainfall reduced the District's production of both corn and soybeans while foreign demand for District agricultural products remains soft District employment gains have been offset somewhat in southern Illinois and Indiana by a coal strike that is now more than six months old This strike has reduced US coal exports by 25 percent and depressed barge traffic along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers Lacking domestic supply some utilities in coastal areas are now reported to have stepped up their coal imports from South America and Asia  Despite these factors, Eighth District economic activity improved this year and the prospects for next year are encouraging This has been confirmed by the tone of comments I have been hearing for the last couple of months Payroll employment is above year-ago levels and while highly variable it should grow on average by approximately 2 percent in 1994, near its long-term average growth The Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi economies all continue to expand and diversify with numerous reports of new industries, robust loan demand, and higher bank earnings In September unemployment rates in the District's four principal states, Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee, were at or below the national average Some areas report shortages of qualified workers Small businesses throughout the District report generally strengthening demand Sales of existing homes and residential construction remain strong, and bank lending continues to grow The District is the country's largest rice-producing area Strong Japanese demand for California rice has caused rice prices generally to double in the last month and may bolster the District's rice production next year  With respect to the national economy, our outlook is similar to that for the Eighth District Nationally the unemployment rate has fallen by more than a full percentage point from its cyclical peak and all indications are that it will continue its downward trend Despite growing at a rate significantly below potential during the first half of the year, output grew at 28 percent in the third quarter and 27 percent during the past two years Moreover, in my view the prospects for a strong fourth quarter are excellent and we anticipate that much of this strength will carry over into 1994 Indeed, the economy now appears poised for a significant period of average growth at or above potential "
1959,1993-11-16," Alan, I'm going to spend a little longer on this I favor alternative ""B"" with a bias toward a greater degree of reserve restraint The economy is gaining momentum, which is reflected in faster GDP growth and faster albeit still sluggish growth in the broad monetary aggregates Nominal interest rates have also risen If this rise in interest rates is sustained--along the lines of what David was saying before--monetary policy will automatically shift toward a more inflationary stance under a federal funds rate operating regime Accordingly, the funds rate must at a minimum be allowed to move up with market interest rates over time Moreover, the thrust of monetary policy as measured by the growth in M1 and reserves has been quite stimulative throughout the current expansion M1 has grown at an 118 percent annual rate from the second quarter of 1991 to the second quarter of 1993 and reserves have grown at an 116 percent annual rate Even after allowing for technical factors, which have temporarily increased the demand for M1 and reserves at times,  -88-    11/16/93  the growth rates have been very high The effects of this stimulative policy on inflation will be felt only with considerable lags, probably not for another 6 to 12 months or more Accordingly, one can not take much comfort in current rates of inflation though they appear reasonably stable In addition, the 3 percent annual increase in the CPI, which many forecasters believe is the lowest rate we will achieve in this cycle, can hardly be viewed as representing price stability "
2024,1993-12-21," First of all, I think we need to go ahead and do this but let me just ask a couple of questions I understand the logical basis for making a distinction between this conversation and monetary policy deliberations Is there a legal basis?   So there is a legal basis   Okay I just would be inclined in whatever letter you send back to spell out the precedent issue very clearly In other words, say that we don't view this as precedent-setting with respect to providing tapes and transcripts I think that would be a helpful part of the letter  Another legal question As I recall that call, Virgil, you started it off by giving us legal advice with respect to the new Freedom of Information Act interpretations I suppose, in effect, by releasing this we're waiving attorney/client privilege in some sense Can that be done on a case-by-case basis without setting any precedent with respect to any future legal advice the Committee might get?   Okay Then just one final observation I personally think we need to do this I do agree with what Susan was saying before--that this will be the basis for singling out individuals and criticizing them and it won't be the end of it I think we have to try it but, just following Tom's suggestion, we need to be prepared to defend statements that are going to be taken out of context in connection with this  -49-    12/21/93 "
2025,1993-12-21," Thank you, Alan The economic outlook for the Eighth District economy continues to be favorable Retail and auto sales are very strong and most of the other firms we surveyed report increases in sales, orders, and employment Loan demand continues to strengthen in some parts of the commercial and retail markets for District banks On the other hand, there are some sectors of weakness such as nonresidential construction and agriculture Only Missouri experienced gains in nonresidential construction contracts during the last half of the year Moreover, preliminary estimates suggest that net farm income will likely decline in most District states this year The recent firming of crop prices does not appear to be large enough to offset the reduction in farm output due to bad weather and flooding Generally speaking, however, the Eighth District expansion appears to be broad-based and sustainable  With respect to the national economy, I would say the outlook appears to be converging with that of the Eighth District Both retail and final sales have been strong, especially relative to inventory levels Trends in employment, industrial production, investment in durable equipment, and the index of leading economic indicators point to a continuation and strengthening of cyclical expansion Indeed, the improvement in the economy now appears to have spilled over into consumer confidence All indications are that output growth would be at or above potential next year  With respect to prices, I'd say it's a testimony to past policy that the CPI increased at only a 2-1/2 percent rate during the first nine months of this year Encouraging as this is, first of all, our goal of price stability has not been achieved Secondly, some of the reported improvement in the CPI is due to the volatile food and energy components When these are dropped the CPI increased at a 3 percent rate during the first nine months of the year and at a more troubling 36 percent rate during the past two months Third, the CRB futures index has risen sharply since September and is up about 10 percent from this time last year despite the sharp reduction in oil prices Finally, such numbers tell us nothing about the inflationary thrust of current policy, which is quite stimulative when measured by the behavior of things that we directly influence like the growth of reserves and M1 If we wait until the effects of recent policy show through to inflation before we act, we will have waited too long "
2026,1993-12-21," I favor increasing the degree of pressure on reserve positions now I think the economy's momentum has intensified to the point that the capacity to maintain moderate inflation, not to mention declining inflation, appears to have run out As I mentioned before, the growth of the narrow money and reserve aggregates has been quite stimulative during the nearly seven quarters of this current cyclical expansion Last year alone the monetary base was allowed to increase by about $35 billion in order to maintain the federal funds rate at the target level Joan mentioned the mirror image of that was the additions to the portfolio of the same magnitude At a minimum I think the funds rate ought to be allowed to move up in line with market interest rates At least this will prevent monetary policy from automatically shifting toward a more inflationary stance as nominal interest rates rise with the expanding economy In addition, the credibility gained by increasing the degree of pressure in reserve markets now may help us restrain the inflationary expectations that are almost certain to intensify with the improving level of economic activity "
2090,1994-03-22," Alan, I wanted to make a couple of comments First of all, I favor announcing our actions promptly whether they are taken at meetings or between meetings My preference would be to make this change when we act on the other disclosure issues that Larry Lindsey talked about, although I can accept separating them I do think that there is the possibility that announcing our actions promptly can have some adverse impact on the deliberative process But in the current climate I think the benefit of providing more information to the public outweighs whatever that cost is Obviously, that's a difficult measurement issue  With respectto what should be released, and maybe I misunderstood a little what we discussed in the subcommittee, I personally would favor releasing only a statement with respect to an increased or decreased degree of pressure on reserve positions I think any statement with respect to the impact on short-term market rates, in effect, is something that will be decoded In other words, we will be using different adjectives to describe what we think the effect on money market interest rates is going to be and then we'll be de facto announcing our targets ""Small"" will mean 25 basis points; ""moderate"" will mean 50 basis points I don't know what more than 50 would mean; that doesn't seem very likely!   Yes   Okay I'm just expressing some views at this point The other point I would make is that I'm not sure I agree with what Larry Lindsey was saying We are doing something here that, if it's done well and announced properly, will have a very positive public effect Our practice is going to lock us into that because my sense is we won't get back to these other disclosure issues for some months, and there may be other actions to announce in the meantime So, our provisional behavior is in effect going to set the precedent  -56-    3/22/94  and lock us into a policy, and it will be anti-climatic when we announce it Personally, I think we can get much more mileage out of announcing the fact that this decision has been made and just get it done In effect, we are trading it away anyway, so why not announce it and try to get some public relations benefit out of it The other thing I would say in such an announcement is that we continue to have our disclosure practices under review, because I think there are some other disclosure issues that in due course need to be reviewed   I don't have a strong objection, Alan How would Joe Coyne respond to inquiries of ""What does this mean?"" There are bound to be some requests; what's the answer?  -59-    3/22/94 -60-   It is still considering disclosure issues? "
2091,1994-03-22," The national economy, as we all know, has been expanding rapidly and that's a phenomenon we would expect to see continue on a path above that shown in the Greenbook For example, industrial production over the last three months ending in February grew at an 84 percent annual rate; payroll employment grew at a 16 percent rate from November to February which was in line with the growth over the previous nine months; and the unemployment rate, adjusted for changes in measurement, seems to have declined in an amount about equal to 1 percentage point over the last year  In the Eighth District, we would expect economic performance in the first quarter to be affected somewhat adversely by unusual winter storms, especially in the southern and eastern parts of the District But, nonetheless, District activity and employment have grown faster than in the nation as a whole over the past year and especially in the most recent three-month period for which we have data--ending in January So, obviously, the full effects of those storms wouldn't be reflected in that data yet Employment reports recently have been dominated by expansion in industries as diverse as appliances, finance, poultry processing, trucking, bicycles, and autos Particularly noteworthy are double-digit annual rates of growth in employment during the most recent three months; this would be in the electrical and transportation equipment industries and in construction Recent announcements that Chrysler will reopen an old plant in the St Louis area and that Ford will expand its production line also in St Louis, along with the previously announced 1995 plant reopening by GM, indicate a dramatic resurgence in investment and employment in the transportation sector over the next few years  -30-    3/22/94  The continuing strong performance of the District and of the national economy as well reinforce my concerns about the inflation outlook Over the past five months both consumer and producer prices have accelerated from their pace over the previous five months Producer prices for finished goods, for example, increased at a 16 percent annual rate since September 1993 following a 27 percent rate of decrease over the previous five months Consumer prices accelerated from a 18 percent to a 27 percent rate over the same period In addition, and that's why I mentioned industrial production and employment trends earlier, I think the potential for bottlenecks and price pressures is growing Capacity utilization has reached the level recorded at the previous cyclical peak in July 1990, and labor market conditions adjusted for recent changes in survey methods are rapidly approaching the degree of tightness that existed at that time as well  Not surprisingly, I think inflationary expectations have also increased, as reflected in the 25 basis point upward shift in the yield curve following our last meeting This was on top of a 50 basis point steepening that had already occurred between October, when long rates touched their lows, and our February meeting One final note on this score would be the question Is a significant increase in inflationary expectations plausible when price levels were declining as recently as last year? And my answer would be, ""you bet"" If you look at the postwar period, there essentially have been nine periods of declining inflation And in the four quarters following those nine periods, the average increase in inflation rates over those four- quarter periods was 22 percentage points So it's not at all implausible, given what's going on now, that there are significantly higher expectations with respect to inflation "
2092,1994-03-22," As I've expressed before, my view is that monetary policy has been in a very stimulative posture over the last three years and, like Al Broaddus, I think the quicker we get to neutrality, the better off everyone is going to be I think the cumulative effects of that policy stance are being reflected already in rising prices and certainly in rising inflationary expectations My own judgment is that we reacted too cautiously to these developments at our last meeting, and that contributed to uncertainty in financial markets and has resulted in higher long-term interest rates than we otherwise might have seen I'm not saying that they would have gone down, but I'm not so sure they would have gone up as  -51-    3/22/94  much, and I think 25 basis points at this stage runs the risk of the same sort of reaction Accordingly, I favor moving more aggressively at this meeting to an increased degree of reserve restraint through a 50 basis point increase in the funds rate And were it up to me, I might even be inclined to underscore that with a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate and basically underline our resolve to contain inflationary pressures and eventually resume progress toward price stability "
2144,1994-05-17," Thanks, Alan The national economy continues to expand rapidly and its momentum appears, at least to me, to be building Industrial production, for example, grew at a 54 percent annual rate for the four months ending in April, faster than the 46 percent rise in 1993 Payroll employment rose at a 27 percent rate in the four months ending in April, following a 19 percent rate of increase in 1993 The unemployment rate fell about a full percentage point over the past year when comparable methods are used to measure it Despite efforts by businesses to build inventory in the first quarter of this year, the inventory-to-sales ratio fell sharply as sales boomed  In the Eighth District, economic activity has also expanded rapidly in recent months Many firms report expansions, additions to payrolls, and increases in sales The District continues to grow faster than the nation as a whole, as best we can determine For example, during the past quarter nonagricultural employment increased in all District states by a significantly larger percentage than the national average, namely by 7-1/2 percent at an annual rate versus 21 percent nationally Increases in employment are occurring in nearly every major manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sector District reports reveal that the Eighth District's expansion is spreading to parts of the District such as southern Illinois that had until recently been sluggish Particularly noteworthy developments are occurring in the transportation sector Increases in auto production, which Tom Hoenig and Si Keehn have mentioned, are expected to boost auto employment in St Louis to the highest level since 1989 Commercial aircraft orders also are rising considerably The District's real estate sector remains strong as evidenced by double- digit increases in building permits and continuing anecdotal reports that homes available for sale are in short supply Relatively strong loan demand, especially by businesses, is also indicative of the strength of the Eighth District's economy  The momentum of the economic expansion, as I mentioned before, seems to me to be building I am not comfortable with the Greenbook outlook that nominal and real GDP are poised to slow down in the second half of this year Such a slowing appears to be based on a cutback in interest-sensitive sectors, especially housing Housing affordability, even with today's mortgage rates, in my view is very favorable And reports at last week's Business Roundtable meeting expressed strong doubts that interest rate increases are retarding spending to any degree at all or are likely to do so in the near future  The continuing strong performance of the District and national economies reinforces my concerns about the inflation outlook In the Eighth District the prospects for increased cost and price pressures have been boosted by low-levels of farm inventories and new houses for sale, and more broadly by substantial job growth and relatively low unemployment rates Nationally, both consumer and producer price increases have accelerated over the past seven months from their pace over the previous five months In addition,  -24-    5/17/94  inflationary expectations have increased as well, which is reflected in declines in both bond prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar since our last meeting "
2145,1994-05-17," Don, I just wanted to ask about the April tax payments and whether you think there is any peculiar behavior occurring that may be depressing M1 in the short run A year ago we had a similar experience but you didn't mention that in terms of--   Alan, I would endorse what you recommended I'd like to briefly state my reasons First of all, as you know I've viewed the stance of monetary policy as having been very accommodative for some time, which I think will lay the basis for an acceleration in inflation Over the last three years, for example, our net open market purchases of government securities have totaled over $100 billion, which is a staggering number This expansion in base money has fostered a tremendous increase in liquidity, with the narrow money stock, M1, increasing by one third over this period Secondly, I don't think we've gained credibility in financial and foreign exchange markets with respect to our resolve to contain inflationary pressures, let alone achieving or moving further toward price stability With respect to the risk of overdoing it, I would agree with what you said One of the things I looked at in that connection is the prevailing forward rate structure, which is cited in the Greenbook; it anticipates about 150 basis points of increase in short-term rates before the end of the year So, as I say, I don't think this move is overdoing it In fact, if we don't keep up with sustained increases in market interest rates, I think we run the risk of a policy that continues to be accommodative and will simply increase the inflationary pressures down the road  With respect to the statement that you read, I would be concerned about anything that was interpreted as our having reached neutrality, because I don't think we really know I'm a little concerned that maybe those words--I don't have an alternative suggestion--too strongly suggest that we've reached a neutral stance I just don't know what that is   One suggestion, I'm sorry to butt in, but maybe the phrase ""significantly reduces"" rather than ""substantially removes"" I don't know whether that-- "
2195,1994-08-16," With respect to the national economy, I think the view that GDP might slow to a sustainable pace without further timely Fed action has been resolved in the negative Employment growth continues to be strong, retail sales held up well in the second quarter, and inventories remain low relative to sales At the same time, there is increasing evidence of inflation not only in the narrow areas that Ed mentioned, but I think in the broader measures of wages and prices as well For example, the implicit GDP deflator rose by about 28 percent at an annual rate in the first half of 1994 compared to 12 percent in the last half of 1993, which is a marked increase indeed Looking ahead, for what it's worth, the Greenbook expects the CPI to rise at a 4 percent rate in the third quarter and the employment cost index at a 4-1/2 percent rate, albeit there are some special factors affecting the latter index Such increases, should they materialize, will not go unnoticed in the current environment where there are increasing concerns about price pressures Accordingly, as I have felt for some time, the risks are clearly on the side of rising inflation I would also note that the recent increases in bank credit are striking, with business and consumer loans up at annual rates in July of 17 and 23 percent respectively, and that is a trend that has been building for some time Growth of the broad aggregates has picked up as well, suggesting money and credit conditions that are quite consistent with rising demand and inflation  -14-    8/16/94  With respect to the District, activity continues to expand at a solid pace, albeit more slowly than nationally in contrast to earlier in the expansion when we were outpacing the nation A significant sector evidencing weakness recently has been transportation equipment However, following their annual two-week shutdowns during July, the District's major auto plants have resumed production at or above June levels While production is slated to slow again later in the year, this is attributed to model changeovers or plant refurbishings and modernizations Recent declines in sales, according to industry sources, result from exceedingly low inventories in certain models, not from slowing demand It seems to me that the pricing behavior of auto companies confirms this view Housing activity remains at relatively high levels in the District, with many areas reporting shortages of housing for sale and rising prices Commercial real estate activity continues to improve In Memphis, for example, the office vacancy rate is at a 6-year low, and industrial construction is headed toward a 10-year peak Crops are generally in good condition throughout the District, with record or near-record cotton and rice crops in some District states Thank you "
2196,1994-08-16," Alan, I came in favoring alternative D coupled with at least an increase of 50 basis points in the discount rate So I, too, support what you have recommended Just a couple of comments on how aggressively to move, though there seems to be support for your recommendation I think that both to contain emerging inflationary pressures and to demonstrate our resolve with respect to price stability in the long run, we have to move aggressively now I share your concerns about the potential of ""the other shoe dropping"" syndrome with respect to doing only 25 basis points I think, as people have said earlier, temporizing now just makes our job tougher later With respect to credibility, I think there is evidence in financial markets that we have a ways to go before we really do have credibility with respect to our longer-run inflation intentions  With respect to the statement, the only concern I would raise and hope you take into account in drafting it is to make sure you incorporate what you said about not tying our hands We really can't know today what could transpire, and we have to have flexibility to evaluate incoming data and move further if necessary If financial markets really concluded that we basically were ""out to lunch"" for the rest of the year, we could set in motion speculative forces that actually accelerate the need to move again So it's got to be done carefully; I trust your judgment on how to do that, but it is tricky   I just had a comment on the language; I don't know if this is the right time to make it Have you gotten everybody's view? I shouldn't come back in unless you've gotten everyone   I think the ""at least for a time"" does it in terms of the flexibility, Alan If I heard it right, you said ""consistent at least for a time with the Committee's goals of""--what was that--noninflationary?      8/16/94   The only question I have is whether it is possible that somebody could then conclude that the roughly 3 percent inflation we are seeing now is consistent in the mind of the Committee with zero inflation?   Okay   I understand "
2250,1994-09-27," Thanks, Alan Peter, are there practical constraints in terms of how much we can do? In other words, if we put all of our reserves into the repo market, I think we would probably be    9/27/94  in excess of 20 percent of the market What would represent a practical limit there? Secondly, what are the practices in terms of collateralizing a repo initially and what sort of mark-to-the-market provisions do they have? Is it comparable to our repo market here?   So you could pretty much specify what you wanted in that regard?   Thank you "
2251,1994-09-27," Thanks, Alan Despite hopes to the contrary, the fact is that inflation has turned up Projected strength in demand, which is a view we would certainly associate ourselves with, may well add further to inflationary strains In the past three months, both retail sales growth and industrial production have accelerated Payroll employment growth continues to be strong Correspondingly, as has been mentioned, capacity utilization has risen well above its 1967 through 1993 average of about 82 percent A rebound in auto production in August and recent announcements of auto sales and production schedules point to improving growth in industrial output through the end of this year  In the Eighth District, auto production has been booming in the third quarter, and producers recently have boosted production plans for the fourth quarter Production at Ford and Chrysler plants in St Louis is planned to rise by about 11 percent from the third quarter and by more than 2 percent from year-ago boom levels Auto industry officials continue to see sales constrained by supply as producers reduce output in some areas to retool and make capacity improvements Overall in the Eighth District, there has been some leveling in economic activity but at a very high level inasmuch as we had recovered to near capacity far faster than the nation as a whole Nonetheless, employment in the District remains robust as the unemployment rate hovers near its lowest level since August 1974 Reports of labor shortages in certain trades and geographic areas are increasing in my judgment For example, in the construction trades, there are now reports of shortages throughout the District In certain areas that had been very successful in attracting new business--areas like Bowling Green, Kentucky and Jackson, Tennessee-- regional development efforts are being altered to reassure new and expanding businesses about the continuing availability of labor Jackson, for example, recently has announced a six-month hiatus in recruiting large business prospects In some areas, there are shortages even of unskilled labor, although these are being offset in certain cases by hiring immigrant laborers from Mexico, for example in northwest Arkansas Turnover rates are very high Firms report having to hire two to three apparently qualified workers--and that implies screening a lot more--at this unskilled labor level for every one that pans out While reports of wage pressures have been isolated so far, broader-based pressures seem incipient given these developments in labor markets  Business executives in the District are also seeing evidence of price pressures from rising costs of steel, paper products, and a variety of raw materials from both foreign and domestic sources Despite continued competition in product markets that limits their ability to pass on costs, it would not take much, in my judgment, to crystallize price increases in such an environment In fact, an interesting aside, somewhat contrary to the report of the view of the National Association of Manufacturers, is the view I am getting from manufacturers in our District They perceive that the marketplace they are operating in is so competitive that to enable them to stay competitive, they would like us to take action to contain what they see as emerging price and wage pressures  -27-    9/27/94  One final area I wanted to comment on is inventories Of course, many economists have been concerned that the second-quarter buildup foreshadows slower demand growth ahead However, again based on conversations I have had with business executives in the Eighth District, my general sense is that the buildup was intended Let me give you just one example Last week we had a meeting outside of St Louis, and a manufacturer of steel for industrial and commercial buildings with operations not only in our District but the upper Midwest and the West told me that his lead times from suppliers are now two to three times above what he would normally expect and that he in turn has pushed out his delivery schedules for his customers to probably twice what they normally would be As a result, to prevent further delays in meeting his customers' demands, he has begun to order raw materials in anticipation of orders that really have not materialized I will say, however, that when I asked him whether he was willing to build speculative inventories based on the prospect of further increases in prices of materials, he said no By the way, he has seen two steel price increases so far this year totaling 10 to 12 percent and another increase has been announced and seems very likely for the beginning of the year, So far, all that is going on, at least in this sample of one, is the building of additional inventories against expected final orders   Steel products for industrial and commercial buildings--warehouses, light industrial buildings, strip shopping centers, that sort of product  To conclude, I'm very concerned about inflation no matter what measure one looks at In July and August, consumer prices accelerated to an annual rate of 41 percent and producer prices to an annual rate of more than 6 percent Inflation is certainly headed in the wrong direction if price stability is our goal "
2252,1994-09-27," Alan, I'd favor ""D"" combined with a discount rate increase; I'd do the 50 basis points now I think it's necessary to contain the emerging inflationary pressures, and I also think it's necessary to make longer-term progress toward price stability I think, as you and others have observed, that waiting simply makes our job more difficult and raises questions about credibility I guess I interpret financial market developments much as Al Broaddus did With the bond rate at the highest level since the recession and more sensitivity in foreign exchange markets, I think credibility is an issue To the extent we lose it, it makes this process much more expensive for everybody It's not just a matter of the credibility of the institution; what really matters is how it impacts the real world  -43-    9/27/94  I think to the extent we maintain our credibility, longer rates will be lower than they otherwise would be  With respect to the language, I personally think there have been significant developments, and I think there is a danger in that sort of language One can make the argument that the existence of that language actually has undermined some of our credibility because of concerns about whether in fact we would act on a timely basis The information in terms of the real economy, prices, and financial markets frankly has been quite strong in this intermeeting period, as far as I'm concerned  Let me make one final comment about the monetary aggregates I, too, would normally be quite concerned about the very slow growth of the narrower aggregates in 1994--as you know I tend to focus more closely on the narrower aggregates that we can actually influence-- but I think their growth has to be viewed in the context of a tremendous monetary impulse in 1991 through 1993 You have heard me say it before, but the base grew $100 billion over that 3-year period I think in a sense there is a liquidity overhang and that needs to get worked off I might also observe--   Yes, that would be in the base But in any event, I view that as a very stimulative impulse, the effects of which may still be playing through In the mid-1980s--actually I think it was mid-1988 to mid-1989--we also had very slow growth in the base and reserves for about a 1-year period That was on top of two prior years of very sluggish growth in the narrower aggregates So my feeling would be that, yes, growth of the narrow aggregates has been slow, but in the scheme of things it hasn't been all that slow for that long I might also observe that there are, as you well know, some very significant technical factors that are impacting Ml, including in particular the mortgage refinancing phenomenon Our guess is that that took 7 percentage points of growth out of M1 in August, and our best guess would be, abstracting from that, that M1 probably is growing somewhere in the area of 4 to 5 percent But we'll see I don't think on a short-run basis these aggregates are particularly helpful to us in any event I think they have to be looked at over long periods of time "
2310,1994-11-15," Alan, just getting back to what you said earlier, my worst fear about what I just heard was that it may work the first time [Laughter] and give some people confidence that that can be a substitute for getting the fundamentals right I'd just pick up on something you said earlier Maybe the secret is to keep some variety in here I'd hate to see us get into a mode where there was some perception that it would be appropriate just because it worked once The markets are so much bigger than we and all the other central banks put together are Once it becomes known as a mode of operation and the surprise element is gone, I don't think it could work on a sustained basis "
2311,1994-11-15," National economic activity is much stronger than earlier forecasts anticipated Employment grew twice as fast as the labor force from January to October There was a large rise in hours worked in both September and October, including an extraordinary amount of overtime Wage pressures are building Average hourly earnings surged in October; for the past four months, this measure of wages has risen at a 44 percent annual rate, up sharply from only 13 percent in the first five months of 1994 Such reflections of tight labor market conditions are signs of prospective inflationary pressures  Strong credit demands also reveal the strength of economic activity and nominal spending Growth in business loans at commercial banks nationwide and in the Eighth District has been rapid throughout this year Since spring, banks have reduced their holdings of securities and have bid aggressively for time deposits to accommodate loan demand Nonfinancial firms have also increased issuance of commercial paper since September, corroborating the increased demand for credit by businesses The large inventory accumulation in the second quarter was followed by a larger accumulation in the third quarter Those forecasters who had expected a substantial slowing in real growth following a large buildup in inventories in the second quarter seem to have guessed wrong Nevertheless, inventory-to-sales ratios remain very low by historical comparisons, so low in fact that many firms are concerned about both deteriorating vendor performance and the prospect of continued acceleration in sensitive materials prices  My contacts in the Eighth District indicate that increases in inventories have largely been planned in anticipation of strong sales,    11/15/94  including retailers who ended the last Christmas shopping season with largely empty shelves Overall, employment in the Eighth District remains robust and the District unemployment rate hovers near its lowest levels since August 1974 This September, the District unemployment rate was 47 percent compared with the 58 percent rate for the nation in October In recent contacts with business executives and directors in the Eighth District, the consensus was that wage pressures are building, especially for unskilled workers and construction workers I have been hearing these reports and have mentioned them here for some time, but I'm hearing more and more reports of actual increases in wages Furthermore, contacts report price pressures from rising costs of raw materials from both domestic and foreign sources Prices of imported goods, which had been an important factor in holding down inflation until recently, rose at a 69 percent annual rate in the past two quarters after falling over the previous two quarters  Finally, looking ahead, I am troubled by the Greenbook forecast, which shows that among G-7 countries only Italy and the United Kingdom have a higher inflation outlook for 1996 than the United States Thus, it is not surprising that we seem to lack credibility with respect to price stability, and this is indeed costly in current circumstances Picking up on what Al Broaddus said, I feel that it may be time for us to consider setting a specific inflation target that looks out into the future I think, and this point was made as well, that it could make our job considerably easier in circumstances like the present--with upward cyclical inflationary pressures--if people were willing to look out to a longer-range target and that added to credibility "
2312,1994-11-15," I support your recommendation also, Alan, based on what I have heard about emerging inflationary pressures and also the importance of credibility and the fact that if we have credibility, it will reduce the long-term cost of keeping inflation and inflation expectations under control  Just a couple of comments on things that came up after my earlier comments One is on the slow money growth That's something  -38-    11/15/94  that would ordinarily trouble me I think I mentioned last time or the meeting before that in view of the very large monetary stimulus from 1991 through 1993, I am not as concerned as I would otherwise be It is very difficult to evaluate when the effects of that stimulus will all be played out I applaud Alan Blinder for trying to put numbers on it I think we all know that if it were that easy to put numbers on the effects of monetary policy actions, we probably could be much more precise in setting policy But it still is helpful in a directional sense to try to understand those things  With respect to stop/go monetary policies and the risk of putting things over the edge here, unfortunately we don't have, in my view, a lot of inflation credibility The time to correct this stop/go phenomenon and try to look through current developments is when we are in a ""go"" phase In other words, I think it is much easier to correct by not driving the funds rate too low or stimulating the aggregates too much when trying to foster a recovery If we try to fix it at this stage, because of presumptions about an inflationary bias of Fed actions, it really becomes very difficult to do that and maintain credibility I agree with what you said before At some point, we are going to reach a very difficult juncture, and we will have to make some tough judgments But I think we are far from that point right now "
2363,1994-12-20," In the third quarter, nominal GDP was up 67 percent from a year earlier, the largest year-over-year rise in five years More recently, nominal retail sales rose at a 151 percent annual rate from July to November, the fastest four-month pace since the spring of 1987 There are few signs yet that our monetary policy  -20-    12/20/94  actions have slowed the pace of spending Since March, for example, business loan growth has accelerated to an 111 percent rate, after falling in 1993 Nevertheless, in my view monetary policy has shifted toward restraint All monetary aggregates have shown relatively weak growth since spring Inventory investment has been very strong this year In my view rapid inventory accumulation has been desired and is likely to continue for a time Despite rapid inventory accumulation so far this year, the inventory-to-sales ratio has remained near the lowest level since the early 1950s According to a recent survey by our staff, attempts in the Eighth District to build inventory, especially of finished goods, have been unsuccessful simply because of continuing strong sales growth One major motor vehicle manufacturer in the Eighth District reported that it held larger stocks than its two domestic competitors simply because, in contrast to its rivals, it had the capacity to keep production closer to the pace of sales Even so, this firm has had difficulty in keeping its strongest selling models in stock Such observations matched the concern with respect to the nation as a whole expressed in the National Association of Purchasing Managers surveys in October and November  In November, employment gains exceeded the robust average monthly increases from January to October and were more than twice as large as the average monthly rise in the civilian labor force Eighth District unemployment fell to 47 percent in October, its lowest level since August 1974 That's a level at which we have been hovering for some time On a comparably measured basis, the nation's unemployment rate has fallen to its March 1989 level, which in turn was the lowest since December 1973  Notwithstanding this evidence of strength on the real side, the positive reaction of the bond and other financial markets in recent weeks is heartening I hope this means that the markets now believe that the long-term inflation rate will not accelerate from its current level Whether the nearly universal expectation that inflation over the near term, or the long term for that matter, will be 3 percent or more is acceptable is another question, as is whether we act today in terms of any short-term actions I am not at all averse to strong cyclical real growth if the thrust of our policy is consistent with long-run price stability and we have credibility "
2364,1994-12-20," Thanks, Alan I favor ""B"" asymmetric toward tightening As I mentioned before, the response of the financial markets to our last move together with the slow growth of the aggregates convinces me that we can afford to do nothing now and observe the effects of our prior actions for a time I must say, though, that I'm not at all convinced that we have fully met the current challenge especially if our goal, as I think it should be, is price stability Therefore, I think it is important that we give serious consideration at the February meeting as to how we might convey our long-term intentions in this regard The question that we had from Senator Riegle last July was indicative, I think, of the fact that perhaps on the outside there was some confusion as to exactly what we intended   Yes With regard to that issue, perhaps one thing we ought to think about would be to provide some longer-run inflation forecasts, say beyond 1995 or 1996, because, as an initial step in considering legislation, I think one could say that monetary policy is going to have its principal long-term impact on inflation Eventually, I would be inclined to establish long-run inflation or price level objectives as some other central banks have done Now clearly this is going to require a lot of further work, and I'm encouraged by the fact that the staff is looking into that issue I would hope that we might have something, at least to start on, that we could talk about at the February meeting   Jerry, just to clarify, I favor your objective as well, but recognizing the practicalities of getting from where we are to that in a relatively short period of time and the possibility of a legislative mandate, I was suggesting that a long-term forecast may be an intermediate step we could take on our own right away But I agree with you   Yes, I'm looking even further out as a possibility "
2415,1995-03-28," Thanks, Alan My view is that the US economy continues to show strength even though there are now a few signs that the pace of economic activity may be slowing Real GDP grew at a 46 percent rate in the fourth quarter according to the most recent estimate Inventories were a net drag on output growth and domestic demand was strong This combination, which was not apparent in the original advanced GDP report, is a plus for the first quarter since there should be less risk of a quick slowdown due to a quick inventory correction Inventory-based stories of a slowdown have been problematic in any event over the last several quarters, and the inventory-to-sales ratio remains near a historic low  The Eighth District economy remains strong, and at 45 percent, unemployment in major District states remains well below the national average Parts of the District continue to report very tight labor market conditions A recent survey of businesses in the District shows that about as many plan to add employees in the next three months as did at this time a year ago Auto production in the District for the second quarter is projected to be much stronger than in either the fourth quarter or the current quarter Taking these facts together, I view the overall picture on the real side as one of a healthy economy  It is not nearly so easy to be sanguine about the inflation outlook In January and February core inflation averaged about 42 percent, up substantially from the 28 percent rate we saw in 1994 Virtually all major forecasters expect inflation to rise in 1995 The Blue Chip consensus, for example, puts the increase in the CPI at 34 percent in 1995 and 36 percent in 1996 as compared with 26 percent in 1994 Longer-term forecasts of inflation are worrisome from the perspective of this Committee because they indicate that market participants expect inflation at or above its current level at horizons as long as five years A recent University of Michigan survey put inflation expectations at just over 4 percent for 5 to 10 years from now I might add that this troubling figure is actually down from 5 percent late last year This indicates that we are moving in the right direction, but it is clear that few in the marketplace believe our commitment to long-term price stability In this environment, it is particularly important that we ask ourselves what our objectives are Even if we have put a cap on inflation in the 3 to 4 percent range--and I am not sure that that is necessarily clear at this point--we are a long way from our goal of stable prices and the low long-term interest rates that would accompany such an achievement The US government borrowed long term at 4 percent in the late 1950s and the early 1960s when inflation was held to the 0 to 2 percent range in this country The Japanese government can now borrow long term at 4 percent when its inflation rate is comparably low We clearly have a long way to go to establish that kind of credibility again "
2416,1995-03-28," Alan, in evaluating the current policy stance, as I think you all know, I tend to look at reserve measures and monetary aggregates I think the current policy stance has a chance of capping the recent rise in inflation, albeit probably at a somewhat higher level than we are seeing right now The decline in long-term bond yields gives me some confidence that we can afford to wait and watch for a while As you notice, I said ""chance"" I am not convinced; I would count myself among the agnostics Certainly, looking longer term, I am not at all sure that we have done enough to reduce the trend rate of inflation, and I clearly feel that this 3 to 4 percent inflation range that we may be able to settle for here is much too high  With respect to the outlook for the economy, I personally would not put too much stock in the forecast of an imminent rapid slowdown I think that we could well be surprised by the underlying strength I would associate myself with what Bill McDonough said before in that it seems to me that financial market participants have all rushed to one side of the boat here, and I don't know to what extent comments by Fed officials have led to that My feeling is that market participants are looking at a broad range of indicators and there is much more to their assessment than just Fed statements that have been made In any event, it seems they have all rushed to one side of the boat I think our focus in this Committee ought to be on long-term price stability, not short-run fine-tuning of the real economy That is really what we ought to be thinking about--whether we are on a course that is really going to achieve price stability  The other thing I would say, and there has been surprisingly little mention of it today at least in the context of the policy discussions, is that we have to continue to recognize the constraints put on policy by the weak dollar in foreign exchange markets To the extent that market participants perceive that our actions are not consistent with long-term price stability, then we are courting the possibility of, I think, very severe financial repercussions I have  -45-    3/28/95  never believed that we ought to use policy to try to target a specific exchange rate for the dollar, but I do think we have to recognize at times like this that it can be a very significant constraint not only on what we say but particularly on what we do As I say, I think our focus ought to be on long-term price stability  With respect to the symmetry/asymmetry question, I don't have any strong views about that If the message were that this is asymmetric toward tightening because we think it is more likely we are going to have to tighten more to achieve long-term price stability, I would clearly favor that I could accept a symmetrical directive "
2469,1995-05-23," Thank you, Alan The pace of Eighth District economic activity, while decelerating modestly in some areas, exhibits few signs of a pending slump Unemployment in the major District states remained at 4-1/2 percent in March, well below the national average Parts of the District continue to report tight labor market conditions for both entry-level and skilled workers Many businesses in the District report slowing economic activity, but they generally do not view this as a precursor to a sustained downturn in the near future--very similar to other reports we have heard today Instead, the consensus is for further growth in sales and employment, although at a slower pace than recently experienced New residential construction in the District is below last year's level, but 1994 was a record year in many areas Anecdotal reports support the potential for a revival in housing activity with the recent decline in long-term rates Commercial construction continues to increase at a steady pace as vacancy rates decline and rental rates increase The office vacancy rate in the St Louis area, for instance, has fallen to about  -20-    5/23/95  13 percent, its lowest level in ten years Total commercial and industrial loans outstanding at the largest District banks rose 61 percent between mid-February and mid-April Planned auto production at District plants is contrary to the recent national trends Scheduled second-quarter production of more than 280,000 units represents an increase of more than 3 percent above the number of units scheduled at the time of the last FOMC meeting and is also 3 percent above the number of units produced in the second quarter of 1994 I would associate this with the fact that some popular vehicles, like the Ford Explorer, some minivans, and other models, dominate a lot of the production in our District  Nationally, the economy seems to be slowing further, though there are reasons for optimism over the remainder of 1995 as a number of people pointed out But the central concern of this Committee should be inflation, and the pace of price increases is picking up The annualized growth rate of the CPI was 49 percent in April This index has risen at a 36 percent annual rate since December, up from a 27 percent rate of increase over the last half of 1994 In contrast to the Greenbook, which has CPI inflation peaking in the current quarter, many private forecasters expect inflation to rise throughout 1995 Most worrisome from the perspective of this Committee are longer-term inflation forecasts that indicate that market participants expect inflation at or above its current level for horizons as long as five or ten years So-called low inflation of 3 percent or more is endemic in the present US economy and is being built into exchange rates, long-term interest rates, budget planning, contract negotiations, and economic forecasts We are far from convincing markets of the prospect of moving toward our stated goal of stable prices "
2470,1995-05-23," I favor ""B"" symmetric as well, Alan I think our focus has to be on pursuing a policy that contains current inflationary pressures and is aimed at making progress toward longer- term price stability I am not, as you know, a great fan of short-run fine-tuning I think we are seeing a slowdown from a nonsustainable rate of growth, and we should not be trying to fine-tune in those circumstances We may have a moderately tight monetary policy, but that is appropriate in view of the tremendous stimulus that took place in 1991 through 1993 The other comment I would make, and we heard some commentary on this issue today, is that any reaction to fiscal policy restraint, certainly any reaction to the prospect of it, is very dangerous Even if we do get some fiscal restraint, I would argue that the best thing monetary policy can do is to provide a stable price backdrop against which the real adjustments that need to take place in that event can occur most effectively "
2520,1995-08-22," Thanks, Alan As in the nation as a whole, the Eighth District has experienced some slowing relative to 1994 That was expected because the District economy had been growing faster than could be sustained The District unemployment rate was 47 percent in June, holding at about a percentage point below the national figure Recent reports show growth in personal incomes in District states  -17-    8/22/95  centered in the 4 to 5 percent range Job growth has continued, though at a slower pace Conversations with our directors and other District business leaders indicate that the District is generally operating at a high level In fact, forecasts of reduced auto production at the national level are not reflected in the Eighth District The models produced in our District are popular, and the auto companies are expanding capacity Third-quarter motor vehicle production is expected to be 36 percent above the level in the second quarter and 138 percent above the level in the third quarter of last year Loan demand continues to be strong, and District banks have increased loan portfolios by about 15 percent over the last year There has been an increase in the issuance of building permits, suggesting that the District is sharing in the nationwide rebound in the demand for housing Many of the business people I have met have reported pockets of labor shortages, especially for entry-level workers but for some skilled workers as well Nonetheless, as others have mentioned, the labor market information has been mixed On the one hand, there have been some suggestions that wage pressures are continuing to build On the other, there has been a moderate reduction of both overtime and employment of temporary workers  I remain concerned about the outlook for inflation and our inflation credibility When I look at the pattern of inflation expectations--for example, there is a table on CPI inflation expectations in part II of the Greenbook that I think is quite interesting--I see that expectations for future inflation continue to exceed current inflation Even the Administration's mid-session review of the 1996 budget assumes that consumer price inflation will continue in excess of 3 percent through the year 2005 This month the Blue Chip consensus reported expectations that the CPI would rise 33 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, 34 percent in the fourth quarter, and 34 percent in 1996, fourth quarter over fourth quarter It is clear that the prevalent view is that inflation will continue in the 3 to 4 percent range, which is less optimistic than the view expressed by the staff Even the lower bound of a 3 to 4 percent inflation range is certainly not price stability as I see it  I am also worried that we, as well as the financial press and others, are focusing too much on news reports about real economic activity By continually focusing on labor market reports, factory orders, consumer sentiment surveys, and other real series, we undermine our position that the best policy to promote long-term growth and full employment is to achieve and maintain price stability Our words lose their force when we act on uncertain news about real activity in the presence of expectations for inflation as high as they are The decline in bond prices since July 6, which Al mentioned a minute ago, indicates that not everyone expects that the modest acceleration in inflation that has occurred this past year will be capped and that inflation will turn down All said, I am concerned about actual inflation and the high level of inflation expectations that are embedded in forecasts and in longer-term interest rates "
2521,1995-08-22," Don, first of all I wanted to comment that I really appreciated the remarks you made with respect to the Bluebook I must say that I read the discussion of real rates in the Bluebook and got a headache! I think what really both red me about it is that I view real rates, like any other real variables, as something we can't influence in the long run as well as something that we can't observe So we are describing policy actions in terms of something we can't affect and something we can't see That's why I got the headache Now, there is an easy solution to that get inflation down to zero, keep it there, and we won't have to worry about it We have just cut short rates 25 basis points and have seen long-term nominal rates go up 35 to 40 basis points In that light I was going to note, particularly with regard to a policy option such as alternative A, that it is incomprehensible to me that we somehow could cut short rates again based on our forecast of inflation, which the market doesn't know about, and keep real interest rates in general from rising, let alone foster lower real rates This is very similar to the example you were giving in response to Larry's question The Greenbook inflation forecast is not supported by most other forecasts  -32-    8/22/95  and many surveys of longer-term expectations Real rates, as you suggested in your remarks, are a helpful thing to look at over longer periods of time, but I don't know what to make of the analysis of a short-run policy option based on what would happen to real rates, particularly to real rates across the yield curve   I thought it particularly difficult in the context of our most recent experience to make that argument Let me just leave it there   It's not true in the longer run I get troubled when we start extending that out the yield curve and making judgments as to how it affects the long end of the curve   In terms of the funds rate, yes What troubles me is going out the yield curve and making a general application   Sure   I support it, Alan "
2579,1995-09-26," Alan, in the ten years that I have been directly involved in this process, this has to be the most significant potential institutional development that I have seen come forward Needless to say, from what I have said in the past this bill is something that I would strongly support I think price stability is the appropriate focus for the FOMC and the Federal Reserve more generally It is the one thing we can deliver in the long run That is where we ought to be focused, and if we do it successfully, it is going to enhance the performance of the real economy, and it is going to result in lower longer-term rates  I like the way this bill is structured in terms of articulating the general focus and leaving the details to the central bank Clearly, a lot of work and thinking would have to be done to implement this bill, and it would not be easy, but the structure is quite appropriate in terms of having a direction set by legislation and giving us the opportunity to focus on the details of how to get that done I think a numerical definition of price stability is very important from a credibility point of view  There probably are some things in the language of the bill where we want to consider certain technical modifications In some places, the bill talks about the Board and in other places it talks    9/26/95  about the Board and the FOMC One would have to ask in the context of monetary policy whether some reference to the Reserve Banks needs to be in there as well because of the role of the Reserve Bank boards of directors in setting the discount rate In any event, I think the bill needs consistency in terms of how that sort of thing is described Don Kohn mentioned in his briefing that there was some ambiguity in the bill's language with respect to our taking into account the tradeoff between output and inflation The way I read the language, it implied a tradeoff during the initial transition period That is not an unimportant issue in terms of credibility If that wording is read in effect as giving us latitude to engage in short- term fine-tuning on an ongoing basis, I think that is going to undercut our credibility and will remove some of the value that is inherent in an approach like this  I have just two final thoughts As I said, a lot of work is necessary prior to implementing this legislation I don't disagree with what Bob Parry said about removing the obligation to report on monetary targets, but I think we ought to recognize that if our long- term objective has to do with prices, there is no way around the fact that inflation is a monetary phenomenon We have to focus on what is happening with our balance sheet, how that influences money, and how money relates to inflation There may be implications of a very fundamental nature in terms of how we think about what we do or at least in terms of what we look at in doing it Finally, I agree with what Al Broaddus said with respect to not tying ourselves strictly to this bill We need to think about how we can continue to reap benefits from the course that we have been on and what steps we can take to enhance our credibility further One idea that has been kicked around in this room has to do with longer-run forecasts of inflation There are things like that that I think would be very helpful in communicating our longer-term intentions even in the absence of a bill like this The reason I think this is so important, frankly, is that it is very hard to quibble in a general sense with the performance of monetary policy in the 1980s and the 1990s, but in my opinion that has had everything to do with the people around the table and particularly the kind of leadership we have had It has very little to do with the sort of direction we are given in the institutional structure I guess I view the latter as a very dangerous situation in terms of the potential for the future We could revisit the 1960s and the 1970s very easily with a different perspective in terms of leadership and membership "
2580,1995-09-26," Thanks, Alan The Eighth District economy continues to grow at a pace largely unchanged from recent reports In general, negative news appears to have been mostly offset by plant expansions, new hiring, and sales gains Reported layoffs from downsizing and plant closings are scattered throughout the District, and such layoffs are somewhat more concentrated in durable goods producers than in other industries But sales at firms in many industries--this is based on anecdotal reports--for instance, prefabricated metal buildings, electric motors, brick manufacturing, and scrap metal, are up on average between 7 and 15 percent so far this year District payroll employment is up about 1-1/2 percent year-to-date, about the same rate of increase as in the nation as a whole The transportation equipment sector is the District's strongest, having grown consistently for nearly two years District automobile production is expected to jump considerably in the months ahead; planned fourth-quarter production is estimated at about 338,000 units, up nearly 29 percent from the second-quarter level That has to do with some new lines that are opening up, particularly for the production of light trucks  A survey of 225 small businesses in the District found that most expect little change in business conditions over the last half of 1995 About 20 percent of the responding firms said they expect to raise prices over the next three months, while less than 3 percent are planning to reduce prices These District price trends mirror the national outlook Private forecasters predict that inflation in 1995, a year of trend growth in real output, will be higher than inflation in 1994, a year of rapid growth in real output Over the next 18 months the most optimistic forecasts, including our own Greenbook, place CPI inflation at its current level, while the more pessimistic forecasts see CPI inflation rising to 4 percent The central concern of this Committee should be progress toward price stability, and there seems to be little prospect that substantial gains will be made anytime in the foreseeable future Inflation forecasts with horizons of five years or more indicate that market participants do not expect inflation to decrease from current levels  On the national level, the economy is recovering from the slowdown in the second quarter Payroll employment jobs have increased at a fair, if uneven, pace over the summer and seem poised to resume a more stable growth path through the autumn One concern in the national outlook is the stance of fiscal policy I would like to associate myself with what Al Broaddus said before and reiterate my view that monetary policy should focus on price stability and not try to offset temporary effects of deficit reduction on aggregate demand The suggestion that the Committee can effectively do more than that is in my view overselling our abilities, given uncertainties about the magnitude and timing of the effects of deficit reduction as well as of our own policy actions  Let me conclude with a few comments on financial indicators Total bank loan growth has been rapid over the last two years and, along with solid growth in M2 since the beginning of 1995, seems to indicate continued strength in the national economy In the Eighth District, total bank loans have been growing at double-digit rates since mid-1994 At the same time in the nation as a whole, total checkable deposits and total reserves, which grew at rapid rates throughout 1992 and 1993, have been subject to a marked runoff since  -23-    9/26/95  the beginning of 1994 In my view, which I think you all know, narrow monetary aggregates such as total reserves and the monetary base adjusted for changes in reserve requirements are important indicators of the stance of monetary policy over longer periods of time However, the adoption by depository institutions of sweep accounts suggests the need to interpret these indicators flexibly in the near term Estimates by the St Louis staff, which are consistent with what is in the Bluebook, suggest that sweep programs could be adopted by depositories holding as much as 3/4 of required reserves and 80 percent of aggregate reserve balances I think it is essential that we continue to monitor these programs because even with all the controversy in interpreting the various monetary aggregates, the provision of an appropriate supply of reserves relative to demand is the core of the implementation of monetary policy "
2581,1995-09-26," Don, I would like to ask about these sweep accounts--a couple of different aspects One stems from an inquiry that we had just this week from a bank in our District My sense is that knowledge of this is spreading like wildfire through the banking industry, and I think banks are looking to the Fed to take some position on this; they are asking whether the practice is legal and so forth I presume somebody is out there peddling the idea, or the software that supports it, or whatever So, one question would be what can be said about these arrangements and maybe this discussion should be continued later at lunch if that is more appropriate My other question is whether we have the capability to publish data that, without violating any confidences in terms of individual institution data, would give the public a better handle on what is going on Clearly, some people are misinterpreting the stance of monetary policy because they don't have this information   Could it be a phenomenon that's big enough that we need to collect additional data to be able to interpret it correctly?   Alan, I favor ""B"" symmetric as well I view policy as being somewhat restrictive, and I think that is quite appropriate First of all, I think it is a hedge against the possibility that we have not in fact capped inflation in this cycle; I hope we have, but I don't think we know that Secondly and perhaps more importantly, I would like to see the trend rate of inflation move down and certainly more quickly than is evidenced in any of the forecasts that I have seen Perhaps when we see evidence that longer- term inflation expectations in fact are moving down, rather than the flat picture we are looking at now, it might be appropriate to consider an easing, but for credibility reasons I would be very careful not to ease before we saw some evidence along those lines "
2641,1995-11-15," Peter, I would just like to say that I endorse the position you just expressed I think there are a lot of risks associated with that We have to evaluate things as they develop, but I wholeheartedly support what you are saying Ultimately, I think it runs to even broader issues like the independence of the central bank and our commitment to long-term price stability and those sorts of things "
2642,1995-11-15," Thanks, Alan The good news is that this year's CPI inflation likely will be less than the members of the FOMC forecast in July The acceleration that was widely expected at the beginning of the year has not materialized Although the staff analysis cites temporary decreases in energy prices and a deceleration in medical care costs, it says little about the contribution of monetary factors Last year's slow growth of the narrow and broad monetary aggregates likely moderated this year's inflation On the other hand, I don't consider the current stance of monetary policy as being unduly restrictive Growth of both the broad monetary aggregates and bank credit has accelerated this year If we adjust for sweep accounts, there has been some growth in M1 as well In addition, firms have turned to the capital markets for financing as long-term market yields have fallen and stock prices have risen  The bad news is that neither the staff nor the public apparently sees any deceleration of inflation in sight Respondents to the Philadelphia Fed survey expect CPI inflation to accelerate to 3-1/2 percent in the first half of 1996, roughly comparable to the staff's projection of 33 percent Households in the Michigan survey on average expect inflation to accelerate to about a 4 percent pace next year We should be concerned, I think, when the public expects inflation to accelerate and not to fall further after it has been held below 3 percent for several years in a row It is true that expectations have inched down a bit; we can see that in long rates and in some of the surveys But no one expects inflation to fall to 2 percent or below anytime soon We simply do not have the credibility that at least I think we would like It is important to protect recent gains and to make further progress toward price stability At some point, a statement in that regard with respect to our intentions would help It is a topic we have talked about before  The Eighth District economy, like the nation's, continues to operate at a high level, as growth slows to a sustainable rate Transportation equipment has been exceptionally strong Orders for both military and civilian aircraft have increased District auto production was up 34 percent year-over-year during the third quarter, and it is expected to be up 45 percent during the fourth quarter The exceptional strength in St Louis auto production, as I have mentioned  -33-    11/15/95  before, is due to the particular models built there, mainly light trucks and sports utility vehicles In Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky, the poultry industry continues to expand aggressively Throughout the District, residential construction is picking up and office vacancy rates continue to decline There are some signs of cyclical weakness, however District unemployment rates, although still low by historical standards and below national averages, have risen about 1/2 percentage point on average over the last year Layoffs at large corporations, such as General Electric, are attributed to weak domestic demand for appliances On the other hand, announcements of plant closings by Brown Shoe and Fruit of the Loom, for example, more likely represent structural adjustments than signs of an impending downturn In the banking area, ""unchanged"" is the key word in an Eighth District survey of senior loan officers Loan demand has leveled off after rising sharply all year In fact, at large reporting banks, loans have risen about 11 percent over the last year Although there has been some increase in the consumer loan delinquency rate, it remains well below the level attained before the last recession The poor weather conditions this year have reduced crops and have led to low agricultural stocks, a comment that Mike in particular made, which may well result in markedly higher food prices next year  Nationally, the economy continues to operate at a high level, with growth slowing to its 10-year average rate It is important not to repeat the mistakes of the past It now seems likely that we will get through this business cycle with a peak of inflation well below the 6 percent rate that occurred in 1990 But, frankly, that is a pretty low standard to set for ourselves The mistake made in previous business cycles was to inflate the money supply in a misguided attempt to stimulate growth In every case, fighting the subsequent inflation contributed to recession The outlook for the real economy is optimistic today because inflation has not accelerated The worst thing we could do is to repeat the mistakes of history, most recently in 1986 That is, we should not allow an acceleration of inflation that would require a sharp reversal in policy later on What we should be doing is looking to move the inflation trend lower "
2643,1995-11-15," Thanks, Alan I favor alternative B I believe it maintains a stance of policy that is somewhat restrictive It is very difficult to define exactly how restrictive, but I think that's quite appropriate given the inflation outlook I would say that looking forward we need to be particularly vigilant with respect to the possibility of rising inflation expectations and inflation For that reason, I strongly prefer a symmetric directive As Al Broaddus and some others have mentioned, asymmetry at this point would signal that we are quite happy with 3 percent inflation and we implicitly define that as our view of price stability I also agree with what Gary Stern said about the importance of how we make decisions going forward and having that discussion with respect to whether we want to reduce inflation systematically or simply act opportunistically  Finally, I think that trying to coordinate our actions with different possibilities on the fiscal front based on how an action might be perceived later is the wrong way to think about the issue We have to make the best call we can today based on the fundamentals as we see them If the fundamentals argue that we should act later, we should worry about managing perceptions at that time I don't hear anybody making that case, but we have to be very careful that we don't justify an action that is not supported by the fundamentals and is based instead on the view that the perception of what we did was better than if we did act on the fundamentals "
2692,1995-12-19," Alan, I have a general question about whether we are going to look at these swap arrangements in any broad and organized fashion I know you have mentioned before and others have said here that, in the foreign exchange markets in which we operate today, these arrangements are of questionable usefulness and ought to be reexamined I don't think we can single out this one with Mexico I think we need to look at all of them together My question is Are there any plans to do that?   Okay Will that involve discussions with counterparties in general about foreign exchange intervention and the support facilities?   The other issue that I think is difficult is that swap lines to developing countries can be troublesome I know that we have North American trade considerations However, as we learned in this case, what was intended for one purpose in effect drags us directly or indirectly into what I would characterize as intermediate- to long-term financing to support debt restructuring I don't think that's our role As I have mentioned before, I think it potentially raises questions about the independence of a central bank   Peter, you mentioned that the bond market was selling off further this morning What is it doing now? "
2693,1995-12-19," Thanks, Alan I have four general points to make today The first is that the Eighth District economy continues to grow at a moderate pace District retailers expect this holiday season to be somewhat better than last year's About half of District auto dealers report autumn sales levels above those of last year, and to the extent sales have been damped, one often-cited factor has been shortages of popular trucks and mini vans Industry contacts continue to report slow, steady growth, although contractions continue in the apparel, shoe manufacturing, and coal mining industries The pace of residential construction has slowed slightly, but multifamily construction is picking up the slack in some areas Nonresidential construction continues to be a bright spot in many parts of the District Overall loan demand remains healthy with some signs of softening, and District banks continue to post record profits I might mention that a couple of bankers on our board expect a possible mini mortgage refinancing boom to get started early next year There is some evidence of that starting now An informal survey of District contacts reveals that labor problems of various kinds, such as shortages, unqualified applicants, and retention are affecting many businesses Reports of tight labor markets, defined as a shortage of available qualified workers, are concentrated in areas in the southern parts of the District, especially northwest and central Arkansas, northern Mississippi, and western Tennessee Some contacts believe the shortage is so acute now that it is discouraging firms from expanding operations or setting up new operations in the affected areas An added number of firms have begun to import foreign labor to fill positions  My second major point is that the long-term inflation outlook is inconsistent with the Committee's price stability goals The central concern of the FOMC should be progress toward price stability and there seems to be little public confidence that substantial gains on this front will be made anytime in the foreseeable future Some long-term inflation forecasts with horizons of five years or more have indeed been adjusted downward over the last year But generally these forecasts still show that market participants expect inflation at current levels well into the next century One such forecast was released in October by the Blue Chip group Their consensus forecast is for consumer price inflation to average about 32 percent annually through the year 2006 The Livingston Survey of Economists released yesterday predicts a similar 3 percent rate over the same period, while the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers has the same 3 percent figure, according to preliminary December data  -16-    12/19/95  In addition, wage pressures may not remain quiescent over the next year, which is something that I think we all have been puzzled about to some extent given the reported tightness in labor markets for some time The recent settlement with workers at Boeing was, in the view of some of our directors, surprisingly rich As Bob Parry mentioned, it included a lump sum payment of 10 percent in the first year, a 4-1/2 percent lump sum payment in the second year, general wage increases of 3 percent in years three and four, and, I haven't been able to nail this down, but one individual mentioned to me that these general wage increases appeared to be on top of cost-of-living increases I will have to try to nail that down Finally, there was a major reversal on company plans to shift more medical costs to employees They have gone from trying to shift costs on insured health care to the employee to actually paying a substantial bonus if employees opt for HMOs, and they have not shifted any costs to workers on the traditional plans I am afraid that this settlement could be a harbinger of things to come Stubbornly high inflation expectations and possible future wage increases have led me to view the current situation as a window of opportunity Ed Boehne mentioned fluid expectations I think that had to do with the real side I would also say that expectations could be quite fluid with respect to inflation Moves now to place downward pressure on inflation expectations might pay handsome dividends in the future The FOMC, and I agree with what Al Broaddus said a minute ago, should develop a plan to move further toward price stability and offer markets some convincing evidence that we intend to achieve such a goal in a reasonable timeframe I think some specific objective would go a long way in that direction  My third major point is that the national economy seems to be growing near the post-war average Most private forecasters predict stable and sustainable growth in real output through 1997 The Blue Chip group, for example, foresees growth of about 2-1/2 percent through the end of 1996, and a majority of respondents expect growth to continue into 1997 The unemployment rate is low and belies predictions of imminent weakness The index of leading indicators, of course, has been falling through most of 1995, but almost all of this decline is dominated by the changes in the prices of sensitive materials The rate of increase in these materials prices, I think, has merely been tapering off from the very rapid pace set in 1994 and in fact could be interpreted as a positive factor for the economy, not a negative The rally in longer-term bonds is mostly good news for 1996 growth prospects It should help the housing industry as well as business investment and may lead, as I mentioned before, to a new wave of mortgage refinancing  My final point is that recent trends in financial markets seem consistent with continued expansion, which I think is a point Mike made earlier in his briefing Aggregate credit remains readily available even though growth in total bank loans has slowed recently as firms have turned to longer-term capital markets In addition, the growth in M2 since the beginning of 1995 seems consistent with an economy growing at potential The marked runoff in total reserves over the last two years, albeit distorted by the spread of sweep accounts, is a cause for concern On balance, however, growth in the monetary aggregates supports an expectation of continued moderate expansion in nominal GDP Thank you  -17-    12/19/95 "
2694,1995-12-19," Thanks, Alan Not surprisingly I would prefer alternative B because I think we have the opportunity to move inflation and inflation expectations lower in the context of an economy that is continuing to expand generally in line with the 10- year moving average I also feel very strongly that 3 percent inflation expectations are too high On the other hand, I can accept some easing of restraint My quibble is really with its timing and not so much with the direction in which we are moving I think the stance of policy will still be somewhat restrictive with a 25 basis point reduction, and such a reduction could well be consistent with lower inflation I think the risk, and you put your finger on this,  -42-    12/19/95  has to do with how our actions are perceived People could well ask whether we are committed to long-term price stability or preoccupied with short-term considerations relating to the real economy The statement you read that would accompany this action is very significant in terms of not mentioning the real economy In fact, I had a comment on the minutes for the November meeting that I passed on to Don and Norm; we had almost two pages of draft text with respect to the policy decision last time before inflation was mentioned So, no matter what we say in that statement, for a lot of reasons the perception is out there and will be out there that we are moving in part in response to concerns about the real economy I would strongly object to any move greater than 25 basis points now or one that involved a cut in the discount rate for the reasons you cited I agree that an advantage of moving now, though not a reason, is to emphasize the absence of any short-run linkage between monetary policy and fiscal policy negotiations "
2738,1996-03-26," Thanks, Alan The Eighth District economy continues to expand A few contacts noted some softening at the beginning of the year, but many expect a pickup as we move into the second quarter Unemployment rates in District states tended to jump early in the year for weather-related reasons, but Missouri was a notable exception; the state enjoyed a very low unemployment rate of 34 percent in January About 3,400 District workers were laid off because of recent strike activity against General Motors, and unofficially about 800 workers in related industries were affected But looking forward, District auto production at Ford and Chrysler plants is expected to rise 47 percent in the second quarter Loan demand, especially for commercial loans, is still strong in most parts of the District Unseasonably cold weather produced significant damage to winter wheat in southern Illinois and catfish in the Mississippi portion of the District in February [Laughter] It's a big industry!  -14-    3/26/96  Nationally, the economy is displaying some underlying strength The February employment report was more than a simple rebound from a weak January The pace of net job creation was averaging somewhat better than 100,000 per month over the last nine months of 1995 It seems plausible that the January data were depressed by about 300,000 Even if we count 300,000 of the February total as a rebound and add 100,000 for trend growth, the 705,000 February number still looks like a significant upside surprise of about 300,000 jobs Maybe some of that increase will be revised away Retail sales, factory orders, and housing starts also indicate underlying strength  For those who look at the latest developments in the real economy as a trigger for monetary policy actions, I think it is clear that we moved last time without much new data; and when the data came in, they were contrary to what was expected Some here referred to our lowering the federal funds target as buying insurance, but this was not a hedge in any usual sense In fact, we were making a speculative bet on the nature of the incoming data It is a bet that we likely lost now that the economy looks a lot more resilient and also a lot more inflation prone  The press release accompanying the last move compounded the problem in my view by suggesting that the FOMC is complacent about longer-term inflation objectives It read a bit like a victory statement saying in part, ""with price and cost trends already subdued"" when in fact we are still a long way from price stability and Q4/Q4 CPI is projected to rise in 1996 Furthermore, as others have mentioned, some recent data are worrisome, including the employment cost index for total compensation of private industry workers as well as benefits costs, which were discussed at some length in the Greenbook The long-bond yield, as others have mentioned, also has increased more than 50 basis points since the last meeting An important component of that yield, namely, longer-term inflation expectations, is a matter of concern for this Committee As I have stressed before, despite FOMC pronouncements of a commitment to stable prices, market participants and professional economic forecasters do not expect lower inflation in the foreseeable future These expectations are a large part of what is standing in the way of further progress toward price stability The way to influence those expectations is for this Committee to announce a target path for inflation over the next several years that contemplates a reduction from the current 3 percent level In addition, of course, we must take actions consistent with that path An opportunistic approach will buy us no credibility whatsoever nor market behavior that reinforces our efforts to achieve our objectives Thank you "
2739,1996-03-26," The premium isn't fixed in this case; that is the difference   Alan, I agree with your recommendation I have some concerns, obviously, based on what I have said before It is difficult to evaluate the stance of policy, but I am concerned that it may not even be neutral at this stage--just based on what is happening, for example, with monetary growth rates and some of the factors that Don mentioned I think the current policy stance is inappropriate given the 3 percent inflation expectations In my view, we ought to be in a somewhat restrictive policy stance and be working the rate of inflation down in some orderly fashion But having said that, I don't think it is appropriate for policy to go in one direction at one meeting and in the other direction at the next,  -25-    3/26/96  certainly under the circumstances we have described today We are where we are, and we should stay there for a while and watch But we need to be vigilant so that--I am going to stick with this insurance analogy a little longer--the premium on last meeting's insurance policy in terms of higher inflation expectations does not become onerous That is what I meant before when I said that, in effect, the premium is not fixed There is a cost to it  One other point I wanted to make quickly refers to Don's briefing Don, you made a statement, if I heard it correctly, about the Committee's opportunistic inflation strategy, which implied that the Committee had actually adopted that By default, that may be where we are, but I don't think we ever consciously made a decision about what our inflation strategy ought to be, whether it is deliberate, opportunistic, or whatever I just wanted to make that comment "
2787,1996-05-21," Thanks, Alan I was amused when Don brought this topic up because I was going to suggest something like this, as I and others have done in the past It is a good suggestion in that it represents a starting point for a dialogue about an issue that we need to talk about as a Committee I would view it just as a starting point Ultimately, I think we ought to aim for a longer-run goal with respect to inflation, maybe five years out or something like that, and we ought to communicate that goal to the public I would not expect us to get to that point in this first discussion, but I regard it as very constructive to begin the discussion Jerry Jordan touched on the reasons why it is so important In my opinion, one of the most significant aspects is that, in circumstances like the present, we have inflation expectations that are quite volatile It seems to me that if people were interpreting incoming data against the backdrop of a central bank that had established some longer-term goal for bringing inflation under control, inflation expectations might be less sensitive to the incoming data If ultimately we got to the point of communicating a reasonable goal with respect to inflation over the long term--I don't mean necessarily as a result of the discussion we might have at the July meeting--I think that would increase our credibility, assuming we acted in the appropriate fashion to deliver on that goal In my view we are to some extent paying the price right now for not having such a goal The opportunistic approach we are taking in the fight against inflation to achieve our ultimate objective of price stability is having an adverse effect on our credibility That is reflected in expectations of higher inflation and interest rates People are not certain where we are headed, and they are worried right now that the next change could be more inflation, not less In any event, I applaud Don for putting the idea on the table I would support his proposal "
2788,1996-05-21," Thanks, Alan The pace of economic activity in the Eighth District appears to have increased modestly since our last meeting For the three months ended in March, District labor markets remained tight The average unemployment rate is below 5 percent, and it has been that low for a large part of the last year and a half Strike activity, which had been quiescent, is again a factor that may impact costs at several large District manufacturing firms On Sunday, a machinists' union at one of St Louis's largest employers authorized a strike that will affect about 7,000 workers directly The contract bargaining strategy in the auto industry is yet to be determined, but negotiations will be getting under way later this year The two largest automotive producers in the District plan to boost second-quarter production by nearly 5 percent above their first- quarter levels Second-quarter production is about 1 percentage point more than had been planned at the time of our March meeting  Residential construction activity in the first quarter was at a relatively high level By contrast, construction contracts point to some prospective weakness in the nonresidential sector, a pattern that despite strong overall capital spending is also observed in the national statistics Loan growth at 11 large District banks has been off somewhat in recent months from the torrid pace of a year earlier This year such loan growth has been dominated by real estate loans Lenders are still very actively seeking borrowers in every category, including consumer borrowers despite some concerns about their creditworthiness According to the senior loan officer survey, consumer loan delinquencies have picked up somewhat more than had been expected over the last six months Nonetheless, the rate spread between securities backed by credit cards and comparable maturity Treasuries has remained very low  The national economic outlook has changed dramatically since January, as we all know, with a rebound in real output growth and inflation Imports also have increased substantially, a possible sign of excess growth in domestic demand One can't dismiss the increase in inflation simply because it reflects mainly higher prices for food and energy I think the Greenbook and comments from Mike Prell support that assessment as well Low levels of agricultural stocks and rising demand for petroleum do not suggest an early reversal of such price pressures Furthermore, the broad monetary aggregates have been growing above target rates and sweep-adjusted Ml growth has been strong By pegging the funds rate at 5-1/4 percent in the face of rising market interest rates--here we are back in the same debate, I guess--we may effectively be validating these price increases The danger is that if price increases are validated by monetary policy, they can become embedded in expectations, particularly in a tight labor market situation On that front, the Greenbook reports that  -18-    5/21/96  wages and salaries shot up at a 46 percent annual rate in the first quarter, the largest increase in 5 years The increase in 1995 was 28 percent Furthermore, according to the Michigan survey--and Mike mentioned this as well--households have raised their inflation expectations for the next 12 months from 4 percent in December to 4-1/2 percent in April to 5 percent in May Looking over the next 5 to 10 years, average expected inflation in this survey is up from 41 percent in April to 48 percent in May These forecasts can be wrong, but in any event the public perceives that inflation risks have increased about a full percentage point this year That matches the increase in long rates since January Thank you "
2789,1996-05-21," Thanks, Alan I was not very successful when I talked about this insurance policy concept before, but I am going to venture into that territory one more time and then probably leave it at that In my view, we in effect took out an insurance policy in January In retrospect we did not need it, and I think now is the time to cancel and avoid the premium In my view, inflation and inflation expectations have increased I think the stance of policy is neutral at best and, more likely, somewhat stimulative  -31-    5/21/96  Accordingly, with such a policy stance, I think it is unlikely that we can contain inflation at the level where it has been over the last several years In other words, we are likely to lose ground We certainly are very unlikely to make any progress toward price stability The risk of waiting is that the premium on this insurance policy is not a fixed premium It will go up If it turns out that monetary policy is perceived by markets to be out of position in the face of what is happening in the economy and particularly with respect to inflation, it is going to cost a lot more to reverse it later rather than sooner  My preference would be somewhere between ""B"" and ""C"" I would increase the funds rate by 25 basis points and probably accompany that with an increase in the discount rate, although that is a separate matter, obviously "
2840,1996-08-20," Thanks, Alan Tight labor markets continue to be the rule in the Eighth District The District unemployment rate was less than 5 percent in both the first and second quarters, the lowest since the 1970s The strike of 6,700 McDonnell Douglas machinists that began June 5 remains unsettled The company has maintained output so far with replacement workers Anecdotal evidence in a survey of more than 200 District enterprises indicates quite persistent wage pressures About one-fifth of the firms surveyed are planning to increase prices in the third quarter and few are planning cuts District automotive output is expected to jump appreciably in the fourth quarter, although much of this increase reflects the boost that is normally associated with the introduction of new models Because of strong demand for models produced in the Eighth District and increased capacity this year, the number of cars and light trucks built in the District by Ford and Chrysler is expected to be 22 percent higher this year than last year  Although the District economy is operating at a high level, a variety of indicators suggests that growth is moderating, which is a picture that we have heard described by a number of people around the table For example, year-to-date growth in District payroll employment lags behind last year's pace An exception is residential construction where employment continues to grow at a vigorous rate and permits are well above year-earlier levels Loan growth at District banks has decelerated from the high rates observed last year, matching the national pattern The most recent Senior Loan Officer Survey suggests that the slowdown may be partly due to a tightening of lending standards On the ag side, crops are in fairly good condition across the District The rice crop is down from a year earlier because land has been diverted to other crops Overall, harvests are expected to be larger than last year, though down from the records of two years ago Nonetheless, District farm income should increase substantially this year because low inventories are holding up prices and federal outlays for farm income and price support programs will be higher over the next few years under the new farm bill  -21-    8/20/96  At the beginning of the year, the Committee took out an insurance policy against the risk of a slowing economy As events have unfolded, the outlook is much better today than it was then Most forecasters see real growth holding close to the long-term trend through 1997 In July, the Committee's central tendency forecast for real GDP was a full half-percentage point above the estimates that we presented in January Because real growth in the second quarter was above trend, forecasters naturally expect some slowing Earlier figures on retail sales and factory orders for July confirm that view There also was a decline in job growth in July and a decline in the index of hours worked It is worth noting, however, that 193,000 new jobs in July, though down from the figures for earlier months, are still well above the growth of the working age population of about 110,000 to 120,000 a month All said, the real economy seems to be in good shape entering the sixth year of the expansion  Whatever the outlook may be for the real economy, we must be concerned about the rising inflation trend This rising trend can be seen in the staff's projections CPI inflation touched its low for the current expansion in 1994, accelerated a little in 1995, and according to the Greenbook, will accelerate a little more in 1996 and yet a little more in 1997 CPI inflation was 3-1/2 percent at an annual rate in the first seven months of 1996, up from 2-1/2 percent over the 12 months of 1995 Last year, we could see signs of falling inflation in August that showed up in the data in the second half This year all of the signs--tight labor markets, the prospect for further increases in food prices, the pending labor negotiations, inflation-jittery financial markets, fairly rapid growth in M2 and in sweep adjusted Ml, and high levels of long-term interest rates relative to current inflation--suggest that inflation pressures are building We have taken a risk this year by failing to respond to the unexpected growth in both output and prices We should not want increasing inflationary pressures to get built into expectations as happened in the late 1970s and again in the late 1980s Absent the kind of inflation credibility that announcement of a firm commitment to price stability would give us, we need a strong response to signs of incipient inflation pressures As I read the Greenbook, these signs are becoming increasingly clear Thank you "
2841,1996-08-20," Thanks, Alan With respect to the stance of policy, I would say with some conviction that I do not think it is restrictive and quite likely it is accommodative, whether we look at the growth rates of monetary aggregates or a funds rate that has not moved in the face of rising market interest rates I think the risk is that inflation will move higher and perhaps more importantly, it will move higher from a level that I think is already unacceptable We ought to be moving closer to price stability, not moving away from it As a result, I would favor an increase in the funds rate today and, for reasons that have been stated by others, an increase of 50 basis points  Let me just make a couple of other comments quickly I think we are suffering from the fact that we do not have a nominal anchor for monetary policy We do not seem to have a way to make a judgment about what the stance of policy is and relate that to a longer-run inflation outlook As a result, I think we have become excessively  -43-    8/20/96  focused on what is happening with respect to growth as opposed to looking at inflation I think our actions have in fact been asymmetric We have tended to show in our actions in recent months more concern about the prospect of slowing growth than we have about rising inflation, let alone getting inflation lower I think we have gotten away with it so far because a good bit of credibility has been built up over the last 5 or 10 years, and for good reason But if our indicator of the time to move is seeing the whites of inflation's eyes--I have not heard anybody explicitly say that, but I worry about that sometimes--when we get to that point, we will have lost a good bit of credibility and will probably be looking at a very ugly end to this expansion just to contain inflation, as others have said "
2891,1996-09-24," Thanks, Alan I want to pursue an issue that Ed Boehne brought up Peter, I understood what you said about how we account for this, but regardless of the accounting, there is an economic exposure Could you give us some idea of our exposure right now with the 12-month maturity limit, given how we typically invest our currency holdings under that limit, versus what the exposure would be if we went to a 10-month duration limit? What would be the actual increased economic exposure if we had, for example, an upward movement in German interest rates of 100 basis points? What would we stand to lose under this new scheme economically, assuming we had to liquidate our holdings right away, versus what we would have lost based on how we historically have invested our currency holdings, at least in recent times?   Yes, that is the question I am asking   The interest earnings offset the capital losses?   Okay   Thanks, Alan I have one question for Peter After looking at this, I would agree with what has been said I think liquidity is the most important objective, and as you said, what we earn on our portfolio does not really matter It is not like the foreign portfolio where there is some tradeoff between liquidity and earnings   That's right The question I have, Peter, relates to the loans of Treasury securities by the Desk to dealers in government obligations if there is a delivery squeeze involving particular issues If we went all the way and at some point got to a ""bills only"" portfolio, would your inability then to lend securities create any significant problems for the functioning of the government securities market?   Okay   Maybe you can get rid of it in the context of this portfolio issue "
2892,1996-09-24," Thanks, Alan Labor markets are tight in the Eighth District according to most contacts The average unemployment rate for Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee was 48 percent in July compared with the national rate of 54 percent for that month and 51 percent in August A major hotel chain that is planning to hire about 2,000 workers in the St Louis area in the coming year has held numerous job fairs and has established a toll free phone number to search for and aid applicants District payroll employment growth, however, has slowed in recent months, but given other developments this may reflect a shortage of workers available to fill positions rather than a decline in labor demand Michael Moskow mentioned something along these lines as well McDonnell Douglas ended the strike with their machinists union during the intermeeting period In the agreement, union workers will receive a 4 percent lump sum bonus this year on top of their normal cost of living increase plus a 2-1/2 percent wage increase next May In addition, retirement benefits were increased more than 24 percent, from $33 to $41 dollars for each year of credited service All told, this settlement represents a substantial increase in worker compensation District retailers that we surveyed reported summer sales increases of up to about 5 percent over the same period last year Auto sales, in contrast, were flat, but District automotive production is expected to enjoy a normal seasonal upswing in the third and fourth quarters and is projected to be up more than 22 percent for the year as a whole Sales of new and existing homes are up in most parts of the District  The national economy is coming off one of its best quarters in recent memory The growth rate of GDP was so fast that it is easy to predict slower growth in the second half of the year With nearly 1/2 million nonfarm payroll jobs created in the first two months of the current quarter, employment growth is more than double the trend pace of labor force growth, and that means further tightening of already tight labor markets Many private-sector forecasts of a slowdown in real output growth in the second half of this year have been incorporating expectations of Fed action--action that has not yet materialized Even if the economy does slow to a trend pace of growth over the remainder of the year, 1996 is going to be a big improvement over 1995 and in my view the downside risks for the real economy are quite low The risks of more inflation, on the other hand, are all on the up side The Board staff predicts faster increases in worker compensation It is forecasting a rise in the employment cost index from 26 percent last year to 33 percent this year and 36 percent in 1997 In 1994 and 1995, CPI inflation was 26 and 27 percent, respectively On a basis consistent with those figures, the Board staff now forecasts 34 percent CPI inflation for both the current year and 1997 Such developments are against the backdrop of money growth near the top end of the Committee's ranges, readily available credit, and a booming equity market  In the absence of any reaction by this Committee in these circumstances, market participants may easily conclude that the ""acceptable"" rate of inflation has moved up This would reinforce inflationary expectations and make our job tougher in the long run We simply cannot afford not to react to the scenario laid out in our inflation forecast  -15-    9/24/96 "
2893,1996-09-24," Thanks, Alan I think there is considerable risk in waiting The economy has enjoyed great benefits from this period of low and stable inflation, particularly given how expectations have been affected I agree with what Don Kohn said earlier--namely, that we should not lose sight of the fact that the credibility of the central bank may have a very significant impact on price behavior right now I have been here a good while, as have many people around this table, and I know how hard it was to earn that credibility It took a long time, even beginning in the mid-1980s when significant progress had already been made in bringing inflation down I really believe that it is a lot harder to gain and keep credibility than it is to give it away It is not an issue as to whether the central bank is credible or not; it is not an ego issue It is an issue with respect to the economy If we are wrong with respect to our judgments on the risks of inflation, the costs to the economy are going to be higher down the road when we try to catch up with a moving train If the central bank takes out insurance against anything, it ought to be against the risk of rising inflation, and I think this is the time to take out an insurance policy So, I would favor an increase in the degree of reserve restraint "
2945,1996-11-13," Thanks, Alan Eighth District economic conditions continue to be very good Sales increases, employment gains, and plant expansions are reported far more often than declines and closures Firms recently announcing plans for new facilities include some in the poultry processing, paper products, and package delivery businesses Most firms report inventories at or slightly below desired levels Construction permits for new homes were up recently in more than half of the District's 12 metropolitan areas Two District auto manufacturers, Chrysler and Ford, plan to produce 334,000 cars and light trucks in the fourth quarter, an increase of 152 percent from third-quarter levels Current plans call for first- quarter 1997 production to exceed first-quarter 1996 production by about 27 percent Also, farm income is strong because of generally high prices and good yields  With respect to labor markets, unemployment in several Eighth District states remains near 20-year lows In Missouri, for example, the September unemployment rate was 39 percent, well below the national average and the state's unemployment rate one year ago District payroll employment growth on the other hand was 1-1/2 percent at an annual rate from June through September, somewhat below the national average of 2-1/2 percent Given other developments, this may reflect a shortage of qualified workers to fill positions rather than weak labor demand relative to the nation District labor markets are tight  The national jobs picture is similar For 1996, the average gain in nonfarm payroll employment has been about 209,000 per month or 21 percent at an annual rate, well above the Board staff's longer-run  -15-    11/13/96  trend in labor force growth of about 130,000 workers per month The national unemployment rate, as we all know, was 52 percent for October All in all, labor markets remain robust There has been some moderate wage pressure associated with these tight labor markets The Greenbook notes that the employment cost index increased at 29 percent in the third quarter, up from 26 percent in the third quarter of 1995 Unit labor costs increased at a 4 percent annual rate in the third quarter, about double the rate in the first half of the year  Financial markets have concluded that the slowdown in real GDP growth has reduced the urgency for immediate action by this Committee That may be correct, but the facts are that in each of the last three years, we have managed to achieve fourth-quarter-to-fourth- quarter CPI inflation rates a few tenths under 3 percent This year, on the other hand, CPI inflation will move higher to an estimated 32 percent And forecasts for next year on a consistent basis are higher still, as was mentioned earlier  In short, we are in the process of violating an implicit upper bound on acceptable inflation, which may cause some to conclude that the Committee's tolerance for inflation is rising Furthermore, the current inflation rate is too high in my opinion to allow for maximum efficiency in the US economy But because markets believe we are focused solely on short-run developments in the real economy, there is apparently no rationale for tightening unless inflation moves up markedly, which of course we all know is too late once it occurs In my view, the Committee should develop a plan to move inflation lower and publicize that plan through an announcement of multi-year inflation targets Lack of transparency in policymaking is preventing the Committee from gaining full credibility and is causing market participants to demand compensation for possible inflation surprises in the future While current long-term interest rates on US Treasury debt seem low, they could be lower still if market participants were less worried about inflation making a comeback A clear statement of our objectives and actions consistent with those objectives could help in this regard "
2946,1996-11-13," Thanks, Alan I do not want to talk about symmetry, so I am going to advocate a modest increase in the funds rate I would be where Al Broaddus came out, a 25 basis point increase My view is basically that CPI inflation has been trending up, that 3 percent inflation is too high, and that the risks are in the direction of higher inflation, at least if it is measured on a consistent basis We should lean against this, and we should do so in the context of making clear our long-term intentions I also think that we should not lull ourselves into thinking that we can in fact predict short-term developments in the real economy and count on these developments to do our job for us, at least on a temporary basis I also agree with what Al Broaddus said about some of the risks down the road Another risk is one that Governor Lindsey pointed to; it relates to evidence of some speculative excesses in financial markets By moving now we might be able to avoid a bigger accident in those markets later "
2998,1996-12-17," In that vein and before multiple interventions on the same day become commonplace, I think it would be helpful to the Committee to see some analysis of that I have not thought about it a lot, but one of the things that worries me a little is the presumption among market participants that we are going to be there, and that creates a disincentive for them to maintain proper operating balances   Overall, I think what you are doing is responsive to developments in the marketplace, and I applaud the steps you are taking So, I am supportive of that One other suggestion I would make, Peter, is that when you talk to the dealers about moving to an earlier time for Desk operations, you might want to telegraph that when our statistical system will support it, you are going to want to go to a still earlier time That will give them an idea of where you ultimately want to get in terms of the timing of the first intervention in the day Thank you "
2999,1996-12-17," Thanks, Alan The Eighth District economy continues to grow at a steady pace District retailers report that September and October sales were up about 4 percent from a year earlier, and most are expecting a strong holiday season Sales the weekend after Thanksgiving were especially robust Despite a somewhat lackluster autumn, most Eighth District contacts were optimistic about December auto sales District auto and light truck manufacturers have increased their planned production slightly for the fourth quarter of 1996 and the first quarter of 1997, so District production is running above year-earlier levels in autos Payroll employment in the Eighth District rose at an annualized rate of 19 percent from July to October The average unemployment rate remains low at 47 percent The local employment effects resulting from Monsanto's division into two companies are highly uncertain Monsanto plans to eliminate 1,500 to 2,500 of its 28,000 jobs worldwide About 4,600 of its employees  -20-    12/17/96  work at company headquarters in St Louis The employment effects resulting from the Boeing merger with McDonnell Douglas, which is the largest employer in St Louis, are also uncertain Labor markets remain tight around the District Hiring and keeping qualified workers, as a number of others have mentioned, is still a big concern for District companies Materials prices are generally stable to slightly higher Real estate markets are strong in the District, with year-to-date permits levels above 1995 levels Loan demand, particularly for business loans, remains robust, and District banks continue to record high profits with only a slight increase in nonperforming loans Farmers have had an excellent year, with yields generally above average and crop prices comparatively high  At the national level, relatively low inflation in recent years has been good for investment and growth Tight labor markets are reflected in unemployment rates that remain low by historical standards Although real growth has slowed from the rapid second- quarter pace, it remains near our estimate of the sustainable trend-- in the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range This pattern is observed in the labor market as well The average net increase in payroll employment, which was 240,000 per month over the first eight months of the year, slowed to 113,000 over the three months through November That average increase is close to the sustainable growth in the labor force  On a fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter basis, CPI inflation is forecast to be 32 percent in 1996 compared with 27 percent in the prior year Although the 1997 staff forecast has a return to the 27 percent level, more than half of that improvement is due to technical changes in the way the BLS computes the CPI Furthermore, rising average hourly earnings, weak productivity growth, and firm energy prices suggest that there are upside risks to this forecast In any event, the fact of a 1/2-point rise in 1996 inflation may harm our credibility in ways that cannot be repaired by the staff's confidential forecast of a 1997 inflation decline  Our policy report to Congress last February suggested that we would resist pressures that might push inflation above recent trends Economic forecasters have often interpreted our policy as a 3 percent cap on CPI inflation Events in 1996 put us at considerable risk of losing credibility for even that modest goal In my view, we should reaffirm our commitment to resist inflation above 3 percent At the same time, we should continue to emphasize that all we influence in the long run is inflation I personally believe we should go further and announce targets for bringing inflation down over time, but an announcement in February of an intended cap at 3 percent for inflation would be a good start Thank you "
3000,1996-12-17," Thanks, Alan This is for Ed Boehne and others I do not want them to get too nervous about Al Broaddus and me both ""selling out"" on an earlier view CPI inflation is up 1/2 percentage point this year over last year, and I think the risks are that it could rise further Personally, as I view the incoming information and listen to the comments today, I see the risks of rising inflation as somewhat greater now than they were at the time of the last meeting, not less So, I would favor a modest increase in the degree of reserve restraint  Now, such an increase clearly would catch markets off guard and if we acted, which of course is not going to happen today, we would have to put that action in the context of a long-run inflation objective At this stage I would put it in the context of trying to cap inflation at 3 percent In some sense we should not have to explain that I think markets should have a better idea of what our objectives are The fact that we have not been more explicit about our objectives, I think, is probably the most significant risk to our independence in comparison to other things we worry about I think we are perceived to have much more influence than we really do, and we could deflect that perception if we explained that what we are really focused on is the inflation rate in the long run and that is all we influence  So, I would support what Al has said here with respect to a discussion in February We really need to zero in on this issue and be more explicit about our long-term intentions with respect to inflation Personally, as I think you all know, I would be in favor of laying out a path like Al described, but whatever we can get in terms of being more explicit would be better than the situation that we are in now I do not think we can wait for legislative results that might clarify that I think we have a job to do to educate the public about what our intentions are, and a good starting point is by being more explicit about our objectives Setting our inflation objectives is something we would have to ease into, but I think that it is very important I would like to encourage a discussion in February and maybe some staff work that would lay out some possibilities with respect to things we might do that would take us in that direction "
3048,1997-03-25," Thanks, Alan The Eighth District economy continues to operate  at a high level Contacts report little or no change in the growth rate of economic activity in  the past few months and continue to be optimistic about the near term With unemployment    3/25/97  rates well below the national level, labor markets remain tight in much of the District,  especially for construction workers Payroll employment increased at a 23 percent annual  rate for the three months ended in January, a rate not seen since October 1995 and well above  the 1-1/2 percent average rate posted in 1996 Second-quarter District auto production is  expected to be up more than 10 percent from the first-quarter level Early 1997 sales tax  receipts are up substantially in the District from their year-ago levels, suggesting strong  economic activity, particularly at the retail level Residential and commercial construction  activity has stayed relatively strong, although January residential permits dropped from their  year-ago levels in most District metropolitan areas About 120 counties in Arkansas,  Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee have been declared federal disaster areas as a result of the  tornadoes, heavy rains, and flooding that occurred in early March Although reliable  estimates of damage are not yet available, federal disaster assistance is expected to lead to  new home construction by displaced residents That was the experience after the major 1993  floods in the Midwest  At the national level, forecasters see continuing expansion A burst of  consumption growth is expected in the current quarter, which will be the highest quarterly  increase in consumption since the end of 1992 if the staff forecast of 5 percent growth at an  annual rate is realized The run-up in stock prices and the high level of confidence reported  in consumer surveys as well as early reports on retail sales and residential construction  support this conclusion On the one hand, such an outlook suggests that the downside risks  for the economy are limited in the short run On the other, the longer-run inflation outlook is  not so sanguine Despite moderate decreases in PPI and CPI inflation so far in 1997, there is  a heightened concern about an inflationary impulse emanating from observed price increases,    3/25/97  a tight labor market, and a continuing easy credit market In addition, we have seen  anecdotal evidence along the lines of what Bill McDonough mentioned with respect to the  apparently shifting pattern of health care cost increases from a declining to a rising trend that  will no longer tend to offset at least a portion of the wage increases  It does not seem to me that the current stance of monetary policy will mitigate the  inflation impulse that I outlined Growth rates in the broad monetary aggregates, which  conceivably are back on track, are running at or above our announced targets The yield  curve has steepened further, increasing the likelihood that the federal funds rate target is too  low to prevent further acceleration in monetary growth All told, the longer-term inflation  trend may be a lot less favorable than the 3 percent norm of most forecasters My reading of  the economy supports the conclusion that we are at risk of losing the hard-won credibility of  our commitment to hold inflation at 3 percent In the current situation, it is vitally important  that we act to preempt prospective further increases in inflation and thereby avoid the  substantially higher costs of having to do a lot more policy tightening later "
3049,1997-03-25," Alan, I agree with what you said in terms of the likelihood of  more tightening down the road I think we will need to do more, and I might be inclined to  do more at this point, but I can accept your recommendation "
3092,1997-05-20," Thanks, Alan The Eighth District economy continues to grow  moderately, with firms reporting sales increases and net new hiring Labor markets are  generally tight In March, the unemployment rate in Missouri was 42 percent, the lowest  since 1979 District automotive production by Ford and Chrysler was up 11 percent in the  first quarter from the fourth quarter of 1996 Second-quarter production is expected to  increase another 2 percent Resolution in early May of the Mound Road engine strike in  Detroit put about 2,500 auto workers, who had been out about a month, back on the job  making pickup trucks at Chrysler's St Louis plant March flooding along the Ohio and  Mississippi Rivers and tornadoes in Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky led to about 6,000  claims for unemployment insurance Estimates of total storm damage are sketchy but may  total around $80 million for infrastructure alone  Nationally, real GDP growth in the last four quarters is just over 4 percent,  matching the best performance since 1984 If adjusted for a change in survey methodology,  the April unemployment rate would have been 4-1/2 percent, a level not seen since 1970  What about the future? Recent forecasting records have not been good In October 1996,  many forecasters projected that the economy would grow at an annual rate of less than 2-1/2  percent in the fourth quarter; that, of course, turned out to be well short of the observed rate  of 38 percent In January of this year, many forecasters projected that the economy would  grow at a rate of less than 2-1/2 percent in the first quarter, and that forecast turned out to be    5/20/97  even further short of the observed rate of 56 percent reported so far In the current quarter,  forecasters are again projecting growth at a rate of 2-1/2 percent or less They may be right  this time, but with such a record, it is hard to argue that monetary policy actions should be  based on forecasts of short-run real economic growth  It is essential for us to maintain a longer-term orientation focused on the general  level of prices, which is all that monetary policy ultimately can influence Inflation has been  running at a rate close to 3 percent for the past five years, and it has continued at about that  rate so far in 1997 Thus, I see little reason to believe that the longer-run inflation trend will  decline Looking forward, the risks remain on the upside Broad money and credit have  been growing rapidly, which could easily translate into upward pressure on demand growth  and inflation Because the economy remains so strong, we have an ideal opportunity to take  a longer-term view about appropriate action to temper inflation risks  While sending a message that our intention to cap inflation at 3 percent is  desirable, it is a mistake to give markets the impression that inflation near 3 percent is  consistent with our long-run price stability goal The most recent IMF report on the world  economic outlook posed the question Is inflation outside a range that the country's  authorities consider to be consistent with price stability? According to the IMF report, the  answer for the United States was ""no"" I think the question is a good one and the FOMC  might benefit from discussing it My judgment is that there is less than a percentage point of  bias in the CPI and, accordingly, 2-1/2 to 3 percent inflation is not price stability in spite of  the views that the IMF reports Furthermore, I certainly am uncomfortable with an IMF  forecast of US consumer price inflation in 1997 and 1998 that is higher than that of any  other G-7 country    5/20/97  To clarify our goal, we need to get our inflation measurement straight How can  we answer the question about whether current inflation is consistent with price stability  without being clear about what we are talking about CPI, core CPI, median CPI,  experimental CPI, GDP or PCE price indexes, or something else? We certainly need to be  specific among ourselves if not before the public How should we interpret the current 1997  and 1998 forecasts in the Greenbook of an acceleration in the GDP chain-weighted price  index and the core CPI and a deceleration in the overall consumer price index? Is inflation  accelerating or decelerating?  At our February meeting, there was general agreement on the need to be more  explicit among ourselves about what we mean by price stability what measure to emphasize,  where we want to be with respect to that measure, and ideally a time frame to get there I  hope we can continue that dialogue at our July meeting and sharpen our internal  understanding of our long-term objective "
3093,1997-05-20," Thanks, Alan I think the inflation risks are on the upside, as I  said before, and I believe it would be prudent to take out some additional insurance now in  the form of a 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate To reemphasize a point that  was made earlier--I know Al Broaddus made it and others probably did as well--we cannot  lose sight of how important our credibility is in assuring the kind of economic climate we  have enjoyed in recent years The confidence that people have that we are going to keep  inflation low and stable is very important, and I see a move in the direction that I am  suggesting as consistent with maintaining that kind of credibility As others have said, if we  are wrong and there are unique circumstances here that would not lead to an imminent  increase in the inflation rate, what would be so bad about moving the inflation rate lower?  We are not at price stability We have some distance to go, and frankly I think exercising  monetary restraint at a time when the economy is strong is more likely to succeed in an  opportunistic sense than doing so in a recession or a recovery This is what is implied by the  so-called opportunistic strategy Even though people would associate me with the deliberate  approach, I think one could characterize a tightening move today as opportunistic    5/20/97  Finally, I do not think that inaction on our part will do anything to stem  speculative behavior If anything, inaction will foster such behavior "
3137,1997-08-19," Alan, I just want to make an observation on another issue for Peter We  are a fairly substantial holder of inflation-indexed Treasury securities in our portfolio, 5 percent of  the outstandings or something like that Looking down the road, as those securities become more  useful as guides to monetary policy in terms of giving us insight into inflation expectations and real  rates, I wonder whether we ought to be investing in that market In other words, if the perception is    8/19/97  that we are a significant enough player to affect how those markets trade, it may undermine the  usefulness of the information I don't expect an answer right now I assume that our purchases  have been on the same basis as they are for any other Treasury securities, but we may want to think  about continuing to acquire those obligations as we go forward, perhaps as they become more  useful to us from an information point of view   That occurred to me   It's a complicated issue, but one that I believe is worth continuing to  think about "
3138,1997-08-19," Thanks, Alan The Eighth District economy is still growing at a  moderate pace District firms report continued growth in sales and employment, although tight  labor markets throughout the District are a limiting factor Average unemployment, at 44 percent,  remains below the national rate District payroll employment, which earlier had increased much  faster than nationally, grew only 14 percent in the year ending in June compared with 21 percent  for the nation Estimates of District automotive production are down about 4-1/2 percent for the  third quarter and 2 percent for the fourth quarter from high levels a year ago Residential  construction activity also remains below last year's high levels, though some bankers have noted a  pickup in mortgage demand recently Commercial and consumer loan demands are described as    8/19/97  steady In agriculture, crops are in reasonably good condition despite the hot, dry weather that has  prevailed in most of the region, and an above-average harvest is expected in most of the District  Regarding the UPS strike, concerns have been expressed by District contacts about the  long-term ramifications of the strike for future labor market bargaining, including the ongoing UPS  dispute with its pilots and the Teamsters contract with less-than-truck-load carriers, which expires  April 1 next year  The nation seems poised for another year of above-trend economic growth despite the  strike and some slowing in the second quarter Rising real wages, high consumer confidence, and a  recent surge in consumer expenditures, especially for housing and big ticket items, all suggest that  real GDP will continue to grow above trend in the second half of 1997 Although labor markets  have become extremely tight, there is some puzzlement as to why the employment cost index has  been on a downward trend An alternative measure, compensation per hour, has displayed a more  distinct cyclical behavior, slowing to 14 percent for the year ended in the second quarter of 1994  and rebounding to 3-1/2 percent over the last four quarters The compensation per hour measure  picks up changes in labor costs when the composition of the labor force changes as well as cost  increases due to promotions and bonuses that can be missed by the ECI We are hearing an  increasing number of reports from our District contacts about the need for hiring bonuses and other  special compensation arrangements to attract the talent that they require  The broad monetary aggregates continue to grow at or above the upper limits of their  ranges M2 growth, at an annual rate of about 5 percent and given its recent velocity pattern, is  roughly consistent with projected nominal GDP growth The good news on lower inflation in 1997  is welcome, but as we all know it is partly an illusion The low CPI inflation in 1997 reflects the  moderation of energy prices after a surge in 1996 Also, people seem largely unaware of the    8/19/97  technical BLS adjustments that will shave 1/4 percentage point from the 1997 average If this 1/4  point is added to the last 12 months of CPI inflation, the rate is back around 2-3/4 percent, which is  about the average for CPI inflation over the last several years The continued emphasis on the CPI  less food and energy can be misleading in identifying underlying inflation trends Recent research  suggests that the CPI itself is actually a better predictor of future inflation than the ex-food-and-  energy measure If we want to eliminate the month-to-month noise in the data, rather than focusing  on the ex-food-and-energy measures we can simply average CPI inflation over a longer period or  we can look at a measure such as the median CPI The median CPI averaged over three months has  remained around 3 percent at an annual rate over the first seven months of 1997, essentially the  same pattern as in recent years I guess the question is whether that is good enough Until we can  agree on a common yardstick, I don't know how we as a group can ever reach agreement as to  whether we are achieving our objective of price stability That's why I think it is so important that  we continue the discussion on inflation measures that we began at the last meeting  Finally, although we tend to assume that there is not much of a constituency for price  stability, we should not underestimate the cost to our credibility and the potential public backlash if  we permit trend inflation to rise In fact, we might be surprised at how much support there would  be for locking in the lower inflation we have seen this year, in view of how well the economy has  performed under conditions of relatively low and stable inflation Thank you "
3139,1997-08-19," Could you repeat that, Don? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt   I can accept your recommendation, Alan I will not say much more  other than to express the wish that we had the groundwork in place to lock in these lower inflation  rates I do not think we have It would be an excellent time to act opportunistically, as I have said  before I worry a little about whether there will be a defensible rationale that will permit us to act  before inflation actually starts to rise That is going to be a challenge "
3185,1997-09-30," Thanks, Alan I have little new to report on the Eighth District  economy On balance, economic performance has improved in the third quarter, as we hear has  occurred in other districts Sales exceeded the expectations of many businesses District labor  markets are stretched to the limit in many areas, and that is putting a damper on payroll  employment growth For example, the latest Manpower survey as well as a recent survey of small  businesses in the District show continued strength in labor demand relative to the supply of  qualified workers, resulting in some pressure on wages The market for high-priced homes has  weakened somewhat in the District, but overall residential building has been held back more by  supply than by demand factors District banking data are broadly consistent with an overall  strengthening in activity recently, as reflected in the apparent year-over-year growth in bank loans  at a double-digit pace in the second quarter One problem with this assessment, however, is that the  data exclude what was the District's largest banking institution, now part of another District for  statistical purposes  The outlook for the nation continues to improve The substantial upward shift in the  Greenbook's outlook for economic activity in 1997 is consistent with our view from the Eighth  District Perhaps the most important reason for this good outlook is that inflation and inflation  expectations have declined, facilitating sounder economic decisions and avoiding imbalances that  occurred in past expansions When the recession started in the third quarter of 1990, inflation as  measured by the CPI had accelerated to 7 percent By the first quarter of 1991, the CPI inflation  rate had dropped to 3 percent, and it stayed near that level until recently This year the inflation  rate has dropped to an annual rate of 16 percent through August We should view this  unanticipated development as an opportunity to take a step closer to price stability, a step that  would put our inflation performance much more in line with that of other industrial countries    9/30/97  Longer-term inflation expectations appear to have come down a bit in financial markets  as well, perhaps reflecting the view that we will lock in a rate of inflation lower than 3 percent  However, we have not taken any important steps to do so as yet If anything, and Jerry Jordan  mentioned this in a very clear fashion, monetary policy may be getting more accommodative as  gauged by the growth of money and credit The broad aggregates, M2 and M3, surged in the last  12 weeks and remain above the upper bounds of their target ranges for 1997 We see a similar  surge in the narrow monetary aggregates after adjusting for sweep accounts These indicators of an  expansionary monetary policy stance are consistent with the continued rapid growth in bank credit  we have observed and a readily available supply of loans for both consumers and businesses  The Greenbook is forecasting a substantial acceleration of inflation and a significant  increase in the federal funds rate target in 1998 If such actions are judged by the Committee as  likely to be needed in 1998, then why not adopt a tighter monetary policy stance in 1997? Policy  actions while the economy is robust, as it is now, might be less disruptive than they would be in a  situation where real growth is slowing and inflation is accelerating, as is forecast for next year A  little preventive medicine sooner, which is not a new theme in light of some of the comments made  here today, might avoid such a dilemma later I realize that markets would be surprised by such an  action because we have not laid the groundwork for it We have not been explicit about our  inflation objective If we had been, markets would not be caught completely off guard by monetary  policy actions to preserve the inflation gains we have experienced this year For all intents and  purposes, those gains have brought us to price stability Indeed, markets might react favorably to  such actions since low and stable inflation is sound economic policy Thank you "
3186,1997-09-30," Thanks, Alan I would prefer alternative C but I could accept your  recommendation The stage setting is probably very important, although I think we need to  recognize that at some point it may be only actions that will get the message across I think, as was  clear in my comments today and earlier, that the odds of our having to act are quite high In  sending a message, I believe it is very important that we focus on the benefits of low inflation and  specifically the benefits of locking in the very low rates of inflation that we have as opposed to the  evils of rising inflation That approach has the potential of playing better, and Bill McDonough had  some good thoughts with respect to your talking about this We cannot come across as taking  credit for the current economy, but we can certainly relate some of our argument to the benefits we  are enjoying today in this economy that is creating a lot of jobs and opportunity "
3232,1997-11-12," Thanks, Alan   Thanks, Alan Peter, on the issue of publishing the standard  deviation data, I have no objection to providing that additional information I think it is probably  a good idea I guess I would be concerned if I thought the Desk were going to use those data as a  measure of its performance and, specifically, if the Desk were to adopt the perspective that a  lower standard deviation in the funds rate indicates better performance I say that because I think  we ought to want the market to act as a form of discipline on those banks that have not properly  provided for their reserve needs, particularly for settlements Some degree of volatility is  desirable from that perspective "
3233,1997-11-12," Thanks, Alan The economic news from the Eighth District  continues to be remarkably good Business contacts in the District remain very optimistic about  future economic prospects However, tight labor markets are a concern The District's seven-  state unemployment rate, at 46 percent in September, remained below the national average  Payroll employment growth continues to slow, in part because of a shortage of available  workers Payroll employment grew at a 05 percent annual rate in the third quarter, well below  the nation's 23 percent annual rate District banks have been pumping a great deal of liquidity  into the regional economy Commercial and industrial lending has been strong as firms  increasingly have turned to banks to finance investment in inventories and plant and equipment  or to finance mergers and acquisitions Although there has been some slowing in consumer  installment lending, the most recent state sales tax data for the District suggest, on balance,    11/12/97 71  moderate to strong growth in consumer spending Mortgage lending has held up well in the  District, even though overall levels of new residential construction remain below last year's high  levels  The national economy continues to expand at a rate above most estimates of long-run  potential An average of over 230,000 nonfarm payroll jobs per month has been added so far in  1997, a pace well in excess of long-run trends in labor force growth Unemployment has been  low by postwar standards for some time There are signs of mounting wage pressures, including  the $13 increase in average hourly earnings in the manufacturing sector, which brought the pace  of growth there to 7-1/2 percent at an annual rate over the last three months  The third-quarter advance GDP report indicates substantial underlying strength in the  economy Final sales increased at a 5 percent annual rate and personal consumption  expenditures at a 57 percent annual rate in the latest quarter That is more demand pull than the  economy can likely continue to supply Further, we appear poised for a robust fourth quarter,  notwithstanding the turmoil in Southeast Asian currency and equity markets The fundamental  effects on the US economy of these international developments should be small  Good news on inflation and declining inflation expectations have been major factors  in producing the excellent economic performance so far in 1997 Nonetheless, I remain  concerned that some of this year's good news on inflation has been due to factors that may soon  abate Most forecasters expect somewhat higher inflation in 1998 In the postwar era, when  inflation has been lowered and then begins to turn up, it has often turned up quite sharply in the  following 12 months That could happen again, forecasts notwithstanding Rapid M2 growth    11/12/97 72  and even more rapid M3 growth over the past two years suggest that the stance of policy is not  appropriately restrictive to lock in low inflation  The question in my mind is surely when, not whether, inflation will escalate more  rapidly The fundamentals have not changed much since the Chairman's House testimony before  the Committee on the Budget on October 8, which seemingly was made to prepare markets for a  possible tightening If anything, unsettled markets aside, given a high level of demand growth  and accelerating wages, the situation has worsened from an inflation risk standpoint Market  conditions may cause us to defer any action today, but it seems to me that the challenge for  monetary policy could be far greater going into 1998 and beyond if economic growth tapers off  and inflation picks up as expected We may be running out of room for continued deferral in  taking an appropriately anti-inflationary policy stance  Certainly, there have been some opportunities this year and last when the stance of  policy could have been firmed without surprising the markets Yet, it is hard to quibble with  results so far, and inflation is unlikely to rise at the rate it did in 1990 and 1991 But I wonder,  had we been more explicit among ourselves, if not the public, about our objectives, whether we  could have locked in CPI inflation at 2 percent or less when the economy was expanding  strongly In my opinion, it will be very difficult to act opportunistically and lock in lower  inflation in a weaker economy because of pressures to focus monetary policy on the real side,  even if inflation pressures continue to mount We cannot do much about the real economy, but  we can and should use the current opportunity to lower the inflation trend a notch Thank you "
3234,1997-11-12," Thanks, Alan I favor alternative C, like Al Broaddus, but I could  accept ""B"" on the basis of unsettled market conditions I believe inflation is likely to rise in the  near future as I mentioned in my earlier comments, and I think, as Al does, that there are risks in  waiting So, I believe it is very important that when the Committee becomes convinced that  inflation will rise, it must be prepared to act promptly and forcefully Strong actions like those  taken in 1994 send a message that the FOMC will not tolerate rising inflation In my view, such  actions would encourage markets to build in expectations of permanently lower inflation  Let me close with a longer-term thought expressed in the form of a few questions  What are the FOMC's intentions? Do we like seeing inflation below 2 percent? Does the public  know it? I think, as I have said before, that we ought to be more explicit about our longer-term  objective In that event, it would be much less likely that our actions would be misinterpreted as  being anti-jobs or anti-growth I believe the last five years of relatively low and stable inflation  have demonstrated to businesses and consumers the desirability of relative price stability It  comes back to a comment that Jerry Jordan made about how ""Main Street"" would perhaps be  more supportive of our moving than we might think I also believe that long-term interest rates  likely would be lower because of a reduced inflation risk premium And finally, I think it would    11/12/97 102  probably take less forceful actions to contain inflation and inflation expectations because of  enhanced credibility Thank you "
