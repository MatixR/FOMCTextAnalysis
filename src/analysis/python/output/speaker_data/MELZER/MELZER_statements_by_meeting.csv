2811,1985-07-09," Thank you Steve, I had a question in terms of comparing the present situation to the 1983 period--where we not only had a decline in rates but also had the account innovation--whether that represents a substantive difference in terms of the analysis I would think, certainly in terms of the perceptions of a rebasing, that it might be more difficult at least from a layman's point of view to rationalize a rebasing at this juncture than it was at that point   One problem that I have in terms of thinking about rebasing--and yesterday I thought that was the appropriate way  -38-    7/9-10/85  to go--is not knowing whether the problem is behind us That concerns me On the other hand, putting M1 on a monitoring basis also troubles me As I reflected on some of the activity in terms of the foreign exchange markets and also what is happening to the growth rate in GNP here in the United States versus overseas economies, I could see a substantial shift in psychology in terms of what has been driving some of the capital flows in this direction None of us really knows how the dollar is going to correct We have assumed an 8 percent depreciation for next year, but it seems to me that if we got a more dramatic weakening of the dollar--not even a precipitous one, but a more dramatic one than that--that is going to feed back pretty quickly into inflationary expectations here, certainly amongst market participants in the domestic credit markets At the same time that will affect feelings about the ability to continue to finance the deficit through foreign investments And at the same time we have what we were talking about yesterday, in terms of a less favorable outlook on the budget deficit It just seems to me that if we were to put M1 on a monitoring basis against the backdrop of all those potential developments, people could question our resolve in terms of dealing with inflation in the long term And it could have a very significant impact, particularly in terms of the shape of the yield curve, I would say So, as between monitoring or one of the other two options, I would do one of the other two And, as I say, I am troubled about rebasing because that implies that we know the problem is behind us As I said yesterday, I think it is a more difficult argument to make in terms of the rationale than it was two years ago   That might give a little more room to tolerate much slower growth toward the end of the year   It was okay last month; it ought to be okay now "
2836,1985-08-20," Peter, how would you characterize dealer positions right now?   Steve, your projected money growth for August is 143 percent, which is [a month-end level of] about $6028 billion and we are at $6019 billion What do you think the risk is in that forecast? Obviously, it implies very little additional money growth over the month of August   By the way, on your point about the psychology of single digit rates, my feeling would be that there is some validity to that--that people have a very hard time accepting committing their money over a longer term for less than 10 percent   I don't have anything to add on the regional side other than to say that in June we had an increase in manufacturing employment at a 2 percent annual rate, which was an encouraging sign But some of the other indicators are flat to down  One comment I would make is that I appreciate the risks on the down side in the forecast as well, but I think there really is something to be said in terms of addressing the long-term imbalances in the economy arising out of the trade deficit and a moderate rate of growth at this period of time I know that has implications for how the budget deficits are ultimately financed, but I think in the longer term enduring a lower rate of growth for a period of time could be very constructive in terms of addressing some of these imbalances   Yes   My view would be very similar to what Governor Rice expressed at the beginning I think we have an opportunity here possibly to slow down the rate of reserve growth without a substantial impact on rates I was struck by the fact that banks apparently have been running off some of their term liabilities, the Fed has snugged perhaps imperceptibly here over the last period, reserve growth has slowed down, and yet in terms of the impact on the funds rate really all we washed out probably was an unwarranted expectation that there would be a further cut in the discount rate We really have not firmed beyond the equilibrium level we thought funds might trade at with a slightly easier borrowing target I asked Peter before about dealers' positions; they seem to be in pretty good shape So I think there is an opportunity here possibly to slow down the rate of growth of reserves somewhat and perhaps buy a little more flexibility for the future, particularly against the backdrop of 14 percent money growth expected in August We don't have a lot of flexibility in terms of credibility in foreign exchange markets and so forth to ease reserve positions without damaging that credibility So I think there is an  -26-    8/20/85  opportunity here, as I say, to buy some flexibility for the future without a dramatic impact on rates I would say that ""C"" is too dramatic a shift, but I would position myself somewhere between ""B"" and ""C;"" perhaps a target of $500 million is about appropriate   Didn't we have ""would"" last time?   If the thought is to lean a little firmer this time, I would think we'd stay with ""would"" "
2862,1985-10-01," At the last meeting I was in favor of leaning toward somewhat greater restraint, which has since been realized And the numbers we have gotten on the economy overall and what I am hearing in the District would tend to make one feel moderately [positive], anyway, about what is going on in the economy On the other hand, I did not come here today with any strong feelings that greater restraint was necessarily called for One of the reasons why I think that is the moderation we have seen in the rate of growth of money, particularly that which is expected looking forward One thing that gave me concern immediately after the G-5 accord was the reaction of the government yield curve, specifically the coupons, where we had a steepening of the yield curve of about 10 basis points At this juncture I would say that is something I have taken note of but at the current levels of those spreads it is not something that concerns me terribly But I think that market, and probably to some extent the foreign exchange market as well, feels that the Fed is sitting here with its hands tied and may not be able to respond to improving numbers on the real side and rapid money growth Because of the G-5 agreement and so forth, I don't think it would be particularly politic to consider greater restraint at this juncture; however, if things don't unfold as we expect them to with respect to lower rates of M1 growth and if we continue to get good numbers on the real side, I would certainly be leaning toward greater restraint in the intermeeting period  I have one or two anecdotal comments First of all, among retailers in the District there seems to be a feeling that car sales are definitely sapping the general strength of retail sales Secondly, corroborating what Si said about inflationary expectations, I picked up the same [tenor] in a luncheon we had at the Bank no increased inflationary pressures on costs; no perceived ability to raise prices substantially; and, to the extent that there were wage pressures, strong feelings that those could be offset with productivity gains "
2886,1985-11-04," Peter, would you say that the somewhat firmer and more volatile funds rate is associated primarily with this uncertainty surrounding the Treasury's financing requirements? Or are there other factors that are operating now?   Did the intervention activity create any difficulty for implementing domestic--?   Jim, in what kind of shape are inventories in general?   To pick up on what Bob Forrestal said, I heard the same thing from a major retailer in St Louis that in the Far East the Japanese and others already are beginning to jack up prices on apparel and other textile goods One other thing I've noticed in talking to people around the District is that there seems to be an interest developing now in bidding on farm land People have talked about it before but I sense now that there is some very serious expression of interest, along the lines of what Ed Boehne was saying in terms of equipment, for putting together groups to bid on the land, which I think is a constructive development   That's at very low prices This would be in Arkansas and northern Mississippi and I'd say prices are probably down 40 to 50 percent from their highs   One thing that struck me, really, is the volatility of expectations about the economy around the table This month they tend to be negative, while last month they were very constructive Before that I think they tended to be negative That only leads me to the conclusion that there is still a lot of uncertainty with respect to what's going on in the economy, and I personally wouldn't be inclined to overreact to that The other thing I would say is that there was mention yesterday of expectations in the market about the possibility of a concerted action among the G-5 countries to get the dollar down So any easing that is undertaken in the near term here could be misconstrued in a sense, in the context of that, and could be potentially very damaging in terms of that thought It could cause a more dramatic fall in the dollar   The other thing that I have been turning over in my mind, in reaction to yesterday's presentation, is a feeling that in terms of responding to a rapidly declining dollar my instincts lead me to feel that the right national policy response to that is probably for interest rates to rise somewhat Easing in response to a weaker dollar had some implications that I didn't particularly like What I've been thinking about is that we already have had a fairly significant decline of the value of the dollar and that possibly some of the general dynamics that were talked about in the hypothetical presentation yesterday may be coming into play here We may be dealing with a sort of natural increase in interest rates and I don't know, frankly, whether it would be appropriate to lean against that too heavily Now, I know there are other considerations Net, based on those several considerations, I would be inclined to stay where we are, with some degree of reserve restraint, and not be looking for the next opportunity to ease at this juncture   That's right Sure   I guess it's relatively minor, but some weeks back we were running borrowing levels that were well in excess of the somewhat lower target and funds were trading below 8 percent Now we tend to be running at borrowing levels that are somewhat below the target and funds are modestly above 8 percent It's relatively minor 15 to 20 basis points   I think that's possible  -27-    11/4-5/85 "
2911,1985-12-16," I would say, just as a general comment--I am not closely in touch with the psychology of that market--that the fact that there might be a perception that we have reached target levels and that we have achieved some kind of stability actually could increase the vulnerability to a precipitous decline because those that were short dollars and riding it down very likely have covered those [short positions] So that takes a bit out of the market Now, I don't know whether that is the case, Sam--whether you feel positions are pretty well squared off--but if those short positions are out of the market, there could be a chance for a more precipitous decline   What about the tax bill, Jim? If that were passed, what impact do you think that would have? And have you taken anything into account for that?   First, on Jerry's comments about the responses to the lower dollar I think I mentioned last time that I talked to a major national retailer based in our area about price responses, and I had an opportunity to ask that question again just a week or so ago In terms of textiles and apparel, in particular, what they are being told in Japan is that unless they are prepared to pay price increases of 10 to 15 percent on those goods, delivery can't really be assured Now, that's not at all the case in areas such as electronics where there is a lot more softness in the markets; but I think we could see some relatively rapid responses both in terms of shifting business activity and prices as a result of that The second comment is that, particularly in view of the response in the long-term bond market to Gramm-Rudman, I was somewhat intrigued a couple of weeks ago with the idea of that somehow providing some room for more accommodation on the part of the Fed But I guess I would have to say I am from Missouri on that I would have to be shown I think that the amount of actual reduction we could get in fiscal 1986, as reflected in Jim's forecast, is next to negligible And who knows what conditions--in terms of new    12/16-17/85  legislation or an outlook for a recession or whatever--might interfere with it down the road? So, I think it's very positive that it has had the effect of apparently reducing inflationary expectations amongst long-term bond holders But I guess I would say that more accommodation on the part of the Fed could actually run counter to that trend, particularly against the background of what some might view as an already very accommodative policy So I think it's important that we not interfere, in a sense, with the process of that reduction in long-term inflationary expectations   Well, I think the long-term bond market was discounting essentially nothing in terms of hope or progress on the fiscal side for quite a long period of time We had a little flurry last May and then some of that was washed out So I would be inclined to agree with what you said before that even if the expectations of a discount rate cut that are in the market now were washed out, I don't think we'd give up the gains in the long end of the market They may back up a little but they would not give up nearly as much as, say, the front end of the market might give up I guess I'm a little reluctant to get caught up in that euphoria As I said before, I think it could conceivably be a mistake to have a discount rate cut and easing of policy--or however an easing might take place--somehow tied to Gramm-Rudman And I think people would try to do that based on what is on the table right now on that score I also have a feeling that I'd like to see a little more evidence on what is happening in the economy right now because of these forces we've discussed and what I sense is going to be a pretty good Christmas season for retailers and so forth I have a general reluctance to get caught up in a [view] that this just has to happen--that it's a one way bet and that's all there is to it I would certainly be responsive down the road if foreign exchange market conditions or current evidence on the economy and other considerations indicated that there was room But I'm not sure that this is the time I have an aversion to, in effect, jumping on this bandwagon So in terms of  -55-    12/16-17/85  policy, I'd favor alternative B and might be sensitive to leaning toward alternative A under the right circumstances down the road   That would be cleaner, I think   You could use the prior structure "
2936,1986-02-11," Jim, on the current services budget, it dawned on me that maybe the reason the market hasn't reacted so badly in the long end to this unconstitutionality aspect of Gramm-Rudman has to do with the thinking that is evolving with respect to the current services deficit Looking out to 1991, as I understand it, with nothing further done than what is already on the table, and that would include the fiscal 1987 actions, I guess--no it doesn't; it's just the fiscal 1986, right? You probably wouldn't agree, but I would be interested in your view Is that a viable scenario? Seeing the CBO come out with similar numbers is what caught my attention   First of all, I would say that on the real side I tend to be among the more [unintelligible] camp I think monetary policy was generally stimulative last year, so we are coming into this year with a good deal of momentum in terms of employment gains and how that will spill through to income and retail sales and so forth On the inflation front, I would be among those who are somewhat more concerned about it I am concerned about the change in psychology toward the dollar that was referred to earlier and what the impacts of that are going to be over the course of the year I also react to the fact that we have record employment levels and we have this question of what the natural rate of unemployment is In some areas, financial services in particular, we are going to see pretty hefty wage  -24-    2/11-12/86  increases For example, one executive of a large insurance company mentioned to me that they are looking at 6 to 7 percent wage increases in the coming year Basically, I guess I am at the extremes in both camps I think we will have a pretty good year on the real side but I am concerned about the rate of inflation we could be looking at Apart from some of the effects of oil and so forth, I think the behavior of some of these other indices is something that ought to be watched There are some special effects in terms of food prices in there, but we see this Economist index has shifted as well   I decided not to go last today One other aspect of M1 that I would mention is that it bears the closest relationship to what we do, and for that reason I think it's important to maintain it as a target and not just as a monitoring range Also, as I expressed yesterday, I tend to be among those who are more concerned about possible inflationary developments--what Steve cited in the first instance And in that context it may be desirable to have M1 as a target If we find ourselves in a position where we might have to exercise a greater degree of restraint during the course of the year, an M1 target could add to that argument At the same time, I recognize the uncertainties about the behavior of velocity and for that reason I could be persuaded to expand the band at the upper end somewhat I don't think there would be adverse market reactions to that In fact, if we found ourselves in a position where we continued to have very aberrant behavior of velocity, we could deal with that in the same fashion we did [last] year without losing a tremendous amount of credibility In any case, I do think it's desirable to have the M1 target I could settle for a 4 to 7 percent range, although I think the chances are that we would be running near the upper end of that I wouldn't mind providing more room In fact, it might be inappropriate to shoot for, say, the middle of the 4 to 7 percent range, given the rate of money growth we had in 1985; but I do think we ought to lean toward slowing that down and, under certain circumstances, I wouldn't necessarily rule out aiming for the lower part of a 4 to 8 percent range--if other factors led us in that direction   I would be in favor of alternative B I might just say that down the road my tendencies possibly would be to lean toward a somewhat firmer policy I am, as you expressed before, concerned about the behavior of the dollar and the change in psychology there One interesting manifestation of that recently was    2/11-12/86  on the unconstitutionality of Gramm-Rudman The bond markets here very quickly looked right through that; I am not sure the foreign exchange markets did There are other factors there, such as how the low oil prices have differential impacts and what the credit implications are for the United States and so forth, but along the lines of the argument that bigger deficits are more stimulative Maybe that would be positive for the dollar; maybe that subtle shift indicates that the dollar is starting to get to the point where there is concern about the inflationary implications of the deficits and the financial problems and what that might imply for monetary policy at this time So in any case, for the moment, I would be in favor of ""B"" I would lean possibly, depending on future developments, toward a somewhat greater degree of restraint down the road Given that I think there are difficulties in projecting money looking forward, I don't take a lot of comfort in the low projections looking out over this period That doesn't make me say that maybe we ought to be tipping [policy] toward somewhat greater ease I think we probably have been accommodative In general I would tend to recognize this penchant I have of leaning a little in one direction toward trying to get to $350 million as opposed to being overly sensitive to the funds rate   Is there any feeling that if we moved to $300 million, that would show through and could possibly be construed as an easing in the degree of reserve restraint coming out of this meeting?    2/11-12/86  As far as the foreign exchange market goes, I think that would not be a particularly timely conclusion   If that's the judgment of the impact it would have, it probably wouldn't be perceived that way It's something you're totally sensitive to, so that's satisfactory as far as I'm concerned "
2962,1986-04-01," Peter, there's no evidence in the funds market of the change to daylight overdrafts? I guess with the quarter-end--   You assume 20 percent over the year--   What about 1987?   One aspect that has not been mentioned, with respect to lower interest rates and their effect on housing, is the tremendous amount of refinancing that is going on In terms of anecdotal evidence, I have heard of some of our branch directors talking in terms of having 6, 8, 10 people on the phone just to take names and say We'll call you back about your request In due course I think this is going to affect cash flow of consumers quite significantly An interesting comment we picked up from a retailer was that he felt that was a factor that was really holding down retail sales in the short run as people incurred the front-end costs of refinancing And, of course, the benefits in terms of the cash flow will be spread out over time I would say in general that in the Eighth District the situation looks pretty good We have the same mixed picture but some retailers we talked to have seen gains of almost 10 percent on a year-to-year basis in their sales Auto sales are clearly slow, although the manufacturing that we have in our District seems to be in models that are not backed up in terms of inventories, so there is not an anticipation of big employment cutbacks there In terms of new housing, again, that is somewhat mixed But in the better areas, St Louis and Louisville in particular, home builders are looking for 15 to 20 percent year-to- year gains I would say the same thing that Ed was saying It's strange that the data we have seen lately on the economy and how it is doing right now are quite poor, and yet I sense in just talking to people that in general there is a lot more confidence about the outlook right now than there was a month or two ago when we were seeing much better current data   One dealer for Japanese cars that we talked to indicated that, in addition to the new model year increases, they have had 2 to 3 to 4 percent increases already and they expect at least one, and maybe two, more over the balance of the year   Steve, where do you view the long-run equilibrium real rates to be in the long term?   Oh, I have been here writing away I have been trying to figure out how to get in the word that was mentioned last night--what was it, desiderata?--but I haven't been able to do it   Shall I go ahead? I would be in favor of alternative B, maintaining the existing degree of reserve restraint  -21-    4/1/86  That's based on [my view] that the intermediate-term economic outlook is generally favorable, as was discussed today, that we already have an accommodative monetary policy that I think recognizes some of the uncertainties that exist in the short run, and I guess a skepticism on my part still about Gramm-Rudman and what that's going to produce We didn't talk about that at length today As I look further down the road, I am concerned a little as we go through the process of adjusting to lower trade deficits and a shift from foreign investment flows or foreign savings to more reliance on domestic savings about the effects associated with that As we get to that point in time, and it's probably a good 6 to 12 months out before the process really begins, the inflation that naturally would be associated with that process would trouble me; and presumably at that time the effects of lower oil prices pretty much will have washed through the system It would trouble me at that time if that adjustment process were taking place against the backdrop of a monetary policy that was perceived to be too accommodative, because I think that would simply exacerbate the problem and the interest rate effects of that and so forth That's looking a little further down the road, but to some extent we have to take that into account in terms of where we are positioned now   Leave it 6 to 10 percent   I wouldn't change it for that reason "
2986,1986-05-20," That's right I will have to try to offset this As was reported last month--and this is somewhat dated, but right now what we have for the District are first-quarter data--there is really strength across the board in terms of employment, construction, and consumer spending Our District has been growing at a rate considerably in excess of the rate nationally We have had particular strength in non-ag employment, including manufacturing employment, and also in residential construction Also, in general in our area I think the commercial overbuilding is occurring at a later date, so we would still anticipate strength in commercial construction through this year with perhaps some slowing next year  Just talking to people in terms of what's happening on a more current basis, I sense that the tone is very good in terms of attitudes One specific piece of anecdotal information A retailer I talked to some weeks ago expressed some confusion as to why furniture and consumer durable sales weren't really following the strength we have seen in housing, which normally is expected There is now some evidence in a couple of the major cities in the District that those areas are beginning to pick up  In my mind, one of the most significant developments in this intermeeting period has been the shift in market psychology I have just focused on the government bond market, and I think there probably is some good news and bad news in that I guess the good news might be that market participants, broadly speaking, may be somewhat more confident in their outlook about this forthcoming strength in the economy I would agree with what has been said about this dichotomy we have had in the current outlook and looking down the road for some strength I think there is some evidence in the bond market, anyway; I guess it's expressed in the form of concern that perhaps that in fact is going to develop The troublesome aspect of all of this is what it might imply in terms of inflationary expectations I think it was noted in Peter's report and in Sam's, to some extent, that there could be a psychology emerging whereby the best is behind us in terms of oil price declines We are beginning to feel the impact of the decline of the dollar on prices, and perhaps we'll be moving into a period of cyclical recovery and have price pressures arising out of that In connection with that we have had a steepening of the yield curve between the front end and the long/intermediate end of roughly 25 to 50 basis points There is always the possibility that this is just congestion or indigestion from a large supply of securities, although all through this period we haven't really seen any supply problem showing through I think it's significant to note this shift    5/20/86  There is one other point related to the market I attended the meeting of the Committee on Investment Performance about a week ago and it was interesting how many investment advisers--I would say at least three, maybe four, and these tended to be more stock-oriented people--cited one of the very positive factors in their minds in terms of the outlook for the markets in general was the liquidity that was in the economy I think they were referring very specifically in that context to what they perceived to be a generally accommodative monetary policy The question that raises in my mind is If the feeling develops that maybe the major move is behind us and the financial markets people start to shift some of that liquidity into spendable balances--and in fact start to spend it against a backdrop of maybe some expectation of increasing prices--we could possibly be at a point where some of that liquidity that has been going into the economy gets pulled out for spending That's just a question at this point, though   I might comment on that I think there is an expectation that the rates of increase will be lower this year than we experienced last year but still will be on the order of maybe 5 percent, down from 6 percent or something like that   I'd be in favor of maintaining the existing degree of restraint right now but I definitely would have a bias in the direction of a somewhat firmer policy In other words, at this point in time, I think it's more likely that we will have to firm than ease, as you said earlier What concerns me is that there is always the possibility that when we see the ""whites of their eyes"" it will be too late I am not sure that this is the time to begin to get some [unintelligible] back in, but we may be getting close to that time And I would be particularly concerned if we did see some pickup in economic activity and that didn't flow through to a firming in the dollar; I think Sam said before that the trend in general still seems to be downward That would concern me--if there really came a time when almost no matter what we did we couldn't easily turn that tide In any case, I would be in favor of the existing degree of reserve restraint, but would favor language that would indicate something other than symmetry--language that would indicate possibly moving toward a firmer policy down the road   You weren't doing this, but I think it's dangerous to draw a parallel between now and year ago when we had similar problems The reason I say that is that interest rates are down a heck of a lot more than they were a year ago, the dollar is down, and oil prices are down In a sense it's easy to slip into the mode, in general, of thinking that this is exactly where we were a year ago I am not sure we are because of those other forces that are at work and what we may see down the road in terms of a possible resumption in inflation In my mind, it may not be as easy this time around as it was a year ago, just from a market perspective point of view, to abandon the targets But I guess that's for July   Nothing ever got written down this way   With those kind of numbers there, I don't see how we can give it symmetrical treatment   In a sense, to have any fundamental impact in the long run, it would have to be unsterilized and run fundamentally counter to the policy--in talking about the situation you described   You said we could take that away unilaterally It would have to be in the context of the agreement with the Treasury   In which case there might be so much confusion--   That is the problem I have with it in the fundamental sense   It seems to be in the realm of possibility, doesn't it? "
3011,1986-07-08," What would be the likelihood of continued official intervention? I think in the intermeeting period it was about How would you characterize the size of that? Is there a willingness to continue to intervene on that scale?   That was just for the intermeeting period?   Is the scale of that intervention an extraordinary amount for the six-to-eight week period of time?   I have another question You mentioned the diminishing willingness to hold longer-term dollar-denominated securities particularly--I believe I heard that correctly in your remarks What evidence of that have we seen?   Don, I might ask a question that was triggered by your statement You used the phrase a couple of times ""should interest rates need to decline"" Maybe this is a question for Jim, too How would that be treated in the model? Would one be able to control interest rates that effectively? There has been talk, for example, of highly stimulated interest-sensitive sectors of the economy How would a 50 or 100 basis point decline in interest rates affect GNP for 1987, for example, all things being equal?   I have gone back and forth in my thinking about this I wanted to hear some of the discussion here today In general, I think it's very important that we have a narrow aggregate like Ml And I guess Ml is the best one we have right now because of the control characteristics and historically, anyway, the relationship to GNP Now, whether any of the work going on to come up with a better narrow aggregate will pay off and we will come up with such an aggregate, I don't know But for the reasons Governor Angell and President Corrigan cited, I would favor an approach that maintains the credibility of M1 down the road should we need it One thing that concerns me about either rebasing or increasing the growth ranges at this juncture would be the implications that might be read into that in terms of how policy would be conducted in the second half If somebody tore it apart and said ""Well, 6 to 11 percent looks like a pretty broad range but that implies month-to-month money growth from June to December of less than 8 percent"" we conceivably could be sending a signal of tightening at a time when I don't think we want to do that I think, politically, too many people are trying to jump on us right now in terms of policy, and [adopting] that range might increase that   In any case, whether it is established as a monitoring range or whatever, I think there is potentially a problem in terms of resetting the range at this juncture that could really affect the credibility of this aggregate down the road In other words, we should only reset the target if we pretty much rededicate ourselves to trying to meet that target I don't think that we have a credibility problem with markets right now in terms of Ml; I think they know we have been treating Ml differently If we were just to say that we are not going to meet the target and put it on a monitoring range through the balance of this year, that would not create a problem I would agree with what Jerry said that we ought to have targets for next year I think that's important We could see circumstances where we will need the rationale to support a firming in monetary policy and that likely would provide it So, I would like to get from here to there maintaining as much credibility as we can for the Ml aggregate or a narrow aggregate that might take its place   In the Eighth District, I'd say things are going along pretty well We've heard a couple of comments about a change in psychology; I haven't detected too much of that Psychology among businessmen is pretty much the same as it has been according to what I've picked up On an annual basis, we've had a good year in terms of nonag employment gains; they have exceeded the national gains by about a percentage point Manufacturing employment has been pretty much flat, although in the most recent three-month period we had modest gains there Retail sales were lagging somewhat early in the second quarter, although the sentiment was that the second quarter and the third quarter would come in quite strong Residential construction has been mixed Single-family construction has been and continues to be very strong, particularly in St Louis; commercial construction activity in St Louis, which I think in general has lagged behind some other cities in the country, continues to be strong and in the District overall it is down less than nationally  In terms of the broader picture, our forecast would be for the same rate of real growth as the Board's staff has both for the balance of this year and next year and somewhat higher on the inflation side In terms of real growth, while that's lower than I might have expected a month or two ago, I'm not particularly troubled about looking at 3 to 3-1/2 percent real growth as a projection, given the overall growth rate that seems to be prevailing in the world and productivity gains and so forth So, while it's lower, it's not something that at this point troubles me to the extent that I'd be inclined to react to it   ""While the tentative 3 to 8 percent range [for Ml] has been carried forward, the Committee recognizes""--   Rather than that, why don't we say ""the 3 to 8  percent tentative range has been carried forward""?   Could I just clarify a procedural issue? For example, the discount rate issue aside, I would be in favor of maintaining the existing degree of restraint It becomes a curious sort of thing One could argue that what Ed just expressed a preference for was an unchanged degree of reserve restraint, with the $300 million borrowing target, but with a different assumption on the discount rate I will address my comments to that, but it's a little tricky in terms of how the record reads and what we ultimately vote for, it seems to me   Yes, but I don't know how I can vote for an action that presumes something that hasn't occurred yet   Anyway, I'll tell you what my main concern is I am sensitive to some of the political considerations at this time and also to the views of other Committee members about the    7/8-9/86  uncertainties and concerns What concerns me the most is this We have just received the court ruling on Gramm-Rudman, which could have a major effect on the psychology in the markets about deficit cuts; and we have experienced lately a weakness in the dollar and have heard reports about the possibility of a diminished willingness of foreigners to hold dollar-denominated securities, given shrinking interest rate differentials, and so forth I think there could be a considerable risk, because of these two developments taken together, in our moving at this time to reduce our rates; it sounds as if it might be unilateral, at least for a while   That concerns me We have been worried from time-to-time, to a greater or lesser extent, about the risk of losing control of the dollar on the down side To think only about the dollar having been under pressure maybe wouldn't be enough, but if you take that against the backdrop of the Gramm-Rudman decision and this being an election year, I worry a little about that psychology in the context of what probably will be viewed as a continuing stimulative fiscal policy and a monetary policy that moves toward further accommodation Beyond that, I expressed my views on the economy before I probably will reduce my projection but I think [the lower growth] is still at an acceptable rate And I would argue that with the current borrowing target we have run a very accommodative monetary policy Just to pick up on your point, Wayne, about not resisting rates adjusting to market levels One might even argue that having pumped in reserves at a rate of 22 percent or so over the last three months, we might be resisting what would be a natural upward movement in the funds rate, not a downward movement I don't want to make a big argument out of that particular point, but the point is that we have been adding reserves at a very rapid rate   So you want the short version! I have just two other points I would also question, in terms of looking at the next six months, what impact a reduction in rates is really going to have I am not sure it's going to have a very significant impact in terms of real output in the short run The numbers that Jim gave us yesterday on what the inflationary impact might be out in 1988--whether you believe them or not, and I realize there are a lot of [unintelligible] between here and there--[lead me to] think that we are getting down to a relatively few bullets left to fire in terms of monetary policy I don't know where we cross that ragged edge of tipping expectations over, but my sense is that we are getting preciously close to that And with that in mind, I am not sure I would trade my flexibility right now because if this one goes through and there continue to be weak numbers, we will get jumped again So, I don't know where one should make one's stand, but those would be my reasons to argue for the existing degree of reserve restraint, alternative B  -58-    7/8-9/86   How about 3 to 10 percent? "
3037,1986-08-19," If you stop buying long coupons right now though, it will be very visible, it seems to me If you did a coupon pass and didn't touch long coupons, I think somebody would try to read something in there with respect to inflationary expectations or whatever So we're better off not to do a coupon pass at all   I was going to make a comment along those lines because as I looked at your numbers--with personal consumption going from 17 percent in the fourth quarter of last year and then to 36 percent [in the first quarter] and 59 percent in the second quarter and employment growth and personal income growth and so forth seemingly staying pretty much on track, at least over the course of this year--one really has to question the dropping down of personal consumption to the 24, 25 percent level, looking forward You actually raised those same questions in your comments already, so I don't want to elaborate on it But it seems to me in looking at this, one could say that there was some uncertainty in that direction in the forecast   Also, the elimination of the deductibility of sales taxes has been cited in that connection Make your big ticket purchases this year because you can't--   We had a 4 to 5 percent decline in the dollar against all the other major currencies I would think that would even accelerate   Part of the psychology with respect to the dollar seems to be looking to the level of economic activity here To some extent you would think, initially, that a pickup in activity here would be a positive factor, some kind of insurance policy Then I think about what we were talking about earlier that the risk, if you will, is on the consumption side If the consumption side picked up one could conceivably feel initially, given that psychology, that the pickup was an insurance policy--insurance that we wouldn't get into a free-falling situation But I worry a little about that psychology turning on us because if our consumption did pick up we could continue to run large trade deficits At some point, inflationary psychology could possibly start to filter in there and [with it] the  -36-    8/19/86  unwillingness to continue to hold dollars at these rate levels or however you--   I noticed--I may be pre-conditioned to look for this sort of stuff--that in the last month there seem to have been a lot more stories in the popular press about reviving concerns domestically about inflation I have seen three or four different ones and I don't think we can lose sight of that either in looking at our monetary policy in the context of the purely domestic setting   Gary, you have said everything I was thinking-- almost I would agree with that position in general I have just a couple of other observations It seems to me that we are taking, in a sense, a marginal approach to policy If we take a look at what has happened in the intermeeting period in terms of the economy and we are not happy with that then we think about easing policy further And I am not sure that we have given enough time for the accommodative policy that we have been pursuing for some time to take effect I am concerned about the risk that Gary cited and I share his feeling about the outlook right now I mentioned some of the commentary in the popular press about inflationary expectations seeming to be reviving; I might also mention that long rates since two discount rate cuts ago are actually higher now than they were then We have had a steepening in the yield curve I have a little trouble with the thought that somehow lower rates are going to help the economy here I think the market place, in a number of different ways, is telling us to be careful in terms of inflationary expectations So I would be in favor of alternative B, the $300 million borrowing target, and no change in the discount rate   Did I detect less certainty in your description of discussions [with foreign central banks] about the discount rate this time? At the last meeting I felt it was pretty much a fait accompli I might not have heard you just right, but--  -50-    8/19/86   I didn't mean that I mean about whether or not we would do a discount rate cut--that perhaps there were other discussions that had to take place in an international context   Just thinking in terms of that, would it not make sense to presume nothing in that regard and convene a conference call if a cut in the discount rate were to occur rather than to try to anticipate all of that? I don't know whether that--   I would be happy with that if there were a call at the time Wouldn't it raise the question as to what to do with the borrowing level at that time?   Yes, but the fact is that, in effect, it is the same thing given the high degree of probability of a discount cut happening I don't think-- "
3063,1986-09-23," Jim, how would you view the declines in the consumer confidence indexes? Would you attach much significance to that, what do you think the causes might have been, and so forth?   I would say about the same for the Eighth District The most recent indicators we have all would show an improvement, particularly in July For example, nonagricultural employment was up over 9 percent and we even had an improvement in manufacturing of 1-1/2 percent or so Retail sales over the second quarter were quite strong, at a 7-1/2 percent annual rate of increase Also, both residential and nonresidential construction were strong in July, although looking at those sectors over the period of a quarter, they declined somewhat, as you might expect In terms of conversations I have had, there has been an improvement in sentiment among businessmen; retailers said the same kinds of things Gary was referring to in terms of good back-to-school sales  On a broader basis, one of the things I have given some thought to is the question of whether this concern about inflation is something that is just reflected in the markets or whether it has perhaps what some people would consider more solid underpinnings The first observation that I would make is that while often markets overact in the short run, I think we are looking at something that has been developing over a period of some months--going back to early April--with respect to how long rates have performed relative to short rates So I am not inclined to think that this is just a passing fancy, particularly when you look at the kinds of volumes that are traded--for example, $100 billion a day in the government securities market I tend to think of that as condensing the best odds and expectations of a broad cross section of people, so I am inclined to put some credence in that Also, one of the things you read about is the Commodity Research Bureau Index and I asked some of our people to  -24-    9/23/86  take a look at that Since June that overall index of about 27 industrial and agricultural commodities is up at an annual rate of, say, 11 to 12 percent If you take out the 7 grains in the index, which tend to be very much influenced by the government's support programs, it is up at an annual rate approaching almost 30 percent So, just on that score, I think there are some things happening with respect to underlying commodity prices that go beyond pure speculative influence What I have been trying to pick up, and haven't really picked up yet in talking to people, is whether the behavior of purchasing managers who are running inventories has changed at all Going back over a period of time when I have asked these questions there has been really no expectation of inflation; accordingly, people aren't really building any inventories That is one of the things I am going to be looking for in talking to people but I haven't picked up any evidence of that yet   I also would favor alternative B Policy has been moving in one direction for some period of time and I don't think it's appropriate to turn it around on a dime I have some concerns, as you know, about some of the developments on the inflation and inflationary expectations front Looking down the road, I think we have to be mindful of the fact that the operating regime that we are pursuing now provides the reserves that are demanded, so pressures aren't really going to show up in the funds rate After things have had time to settle out--and I guess by that I mean the effects of the decline in interest rates and so forth, all things being equal in terms of the economy--if we don't begin to see some of the slowing in the aggregates that Don has referred to, then I think we have to be prepared to move to a firmer stance As I say, the pressures are not going to show up in the funds rate, and I think we cannot continue to provide reserves at the rate we have been under the circumstances I just brought up   ""Taking account of"" probably does it   I would support that "
3088,1986-11-05," Peter, do you have any thoughts on the decline in the demand for excess reserves?   Mike, the trend in personal consumption expenditures has been upward since the fourth quarter of last year You are really showing a dramatic shift in the fourth quarter, which I guess is primarily autos   Do you try to factor into that the effects of the tax legislation and accelerated big ticket purchases to the extent that you can?   A related question What happened to real disposable income in the third quarter?   I know   Our numbers for the District continue to look pretty good We continue to have better growth in non-ag employment than we've experienced nationally Retail sales in the most recent three-month period have gone up more rapidly And we've had a turnaround on the construction side where we have been lagging a bit; both residential and nonresidential construction in the third quarter were quite strong Anecdotally, on the retail side, a national retailer in the District mentioned that for three months now they've experienced stronger numbers; he wouldn't describe it as a boom situation by any means, but it's the first time for a long period of time that he has seen three months--August, September and October-- with continued improvement in terms of their own sales On the price side, we had a group of small business owners in for lunch not too long ago and I asked them whether any of the developments in terms of markets and expectations of higher prices were affecting their behavior at all And there was certainly no evidence among that small group that they felt any better able to put through price increases or  -13-    11/5/86  were seeing any major increases in their costs So, at that level, there is no real change in the price picture  I would say on the overall forecast that the one difference we might cite is that we would tend to be a little more [positive] on the personal consumption side just because of the rate of increase in income growth over the course of this year versus last year As Mike pointed out, the fourth-quarter GNP number is more than accounted for by net exports and the inventory numbers; and if personal consumption were to be stronger we could be looking, in the short run, at considerably stronger GNP numbers   One of the things that I failed to mention is that a big plant, a new plant, in Westfield that doesn't run a third shift has very efficient [unintelligible] In a downtown truck plant that is closing, 2,000 or 2,500 laborers might get laid off and this other facility expects to pick up as many as 2,000 of those So, maybe there is some of that going on "
3112,1986-12-15," One thing that struck me in reading this paper is that the advantage of a narrow aggregate is that we can influence it When you get out to M2 and M3, our ability to influence is somewhat limited Just from an operational point of view it is desirable, at least the way I see things, to have something there that we can influence should we choose to do so The other thing that struck me is that the NOW account aspects of Ml are really going to cause ongoing problems in that regard There may come a time when we want to go to some more strictly transactional base, whether it is M1A or some other type of narrow aggregate This isn't the time, I don't think, to lay a new narrow aggregate on the table because there are still a lot of uncertainties But I do have this feeling that it is a desirable thing, if we want to choose a regime around a narrow aggregate, that we could control it--that we have the concept of that intact in some way, in terms of how we set targets   That's what would trouble me As I said yesterday, I think it's desirable to have a narrow aggregate, but it would trouble me to roll another one out right now when there is still    12/15-16/86  this uncertainty in general about the behavior of velocity That could not only discredit that aggregate but also could raise questions about what we are doing because, when we roll the new one out, we are implying a higher confidence level in that aggregate and in aggregates targeting in general   That is essentially where I would be I would set a range and then put language around it like we did in July indicating that we wouldn't necessarily expect to hit it In connection with that, that's where we could bring in Governor Heller's point that because of the interest elasticity of Ml, we are looking at other narrower aggregates that would have less elasticity I don't think we have lost a lot of credibility by having the range and then not meeting it My own view is that it doesn't create a lot confusion in the marketplace as to what we are doing I think when the market gets worried about rapid M1 growth, it may well be against the backdrop of other developments like, say, a weak dollar, a steeper yield curve, and so forth They're not making judgments about rapid M1 growth solely based on what our range is   In the Eighth District, conditions continue to be pretty good We have had good non-ag employment growth in the last three-month period--about a full percentage point greater than nationally Retail sales are a little slower than the national growth In a sense, a surprising area of strength continues to be both residential and nonresidential construction in the most recent three-month period through October we have had annual rates of growth of 20 percent in residential and 16 percent in nonresidential Following up on that, real estate lending has been very strong at District financial institutions; there also has been a notable pickup in commercial lending activity I would say that some anecdotal comments we hear tend to bear that out In Louisville, for the first time since I have been involved, I have heard people mention a pickup in manufacturing activity there, particularly among smaller manufacturers Homebuilders in the St Louis area are expecting to do next year maybe 90 percent of what they have done this year in the single-family area, with multifamily construction down substantially There continues to be anxiety about the Christmas selling season; there is evidence of a lot of promotional activity in the newspapers and some talk of price cutting, but that still remains to be seen I would say that in general the anxieties remain what we have heard about before--in terms of the consumer in the first quarter of next year, capital spending early next year, and so forth  Overall, our outlook on economic activity would be somewhat stronger than the Board staff's, though not substantially On the    12/15-16/86  price side, we believe there is somewhat greater risk But in general I would be quite satisfied if we achieved the 27 percent growth that the Board staff is looking for next year As Mrs Horn was saying, that sort of growth rate tends to facilitate the kind of adjustment that we need to see in order to get the trade situation into better balance   I would also favor alternative B I would not favor asymmetrical language To an extent, I think we've already allowed for potential weakness in the first quarter; we've been pursuing a very stimulative policy I would be somewhat concerned if we didn't begin to see some slowing in Ml with stable interest rates We are having to provide reserves at a very high rate to maintain the funds rate at this 5-3/4 to 6 percent level I don't know how long those lags are either, but if we continue to see very rapid rates of Ml growth against the backdrop of stable interest rates, there may be some pickup in economic activity and I'd be concerned So, I favor alternative B, with no asymmetry    12/15-16/86   In connection with the dollar, could I ask a question? You may choose to answer [or not] If the Germans were to cut their discount rate tomorrow would it necessarily follow, in an economic sense, that we should leap to match that? In other words, you could make the argument that, standing alone, that might be a salutary action over time to address the trade imbalance I don't know whether that's something that-- "
3136,1987-02-10," Second   Peter, with regard to these expectational effects that you were just referring to, I agree with you that what you described there is a major shift in psychology Can that have a permanent effect on the level of the funds rate for a given borrowing target?   And there is probably one guy out there who bought them at 38 percent and sold them at zero   On the real side, our forecast is just a touch higher than the Board staff's I would be inclined to agree with Frank Morris; I feel good about the current statistics that we are seeing, although I am not inclined to read too much into that I certainly don't pick up anecdotally the idea that people are consciously recognizing a significantly strengthening picture right now The only thing I would say on the price side--just to pick up on what Ed Boehne said--is that in general in our discussions, particularly of late, we tend not to place too much weight on the effects of M1 growth and so forth But just to pick up on this year- end phenomenon, one way that you could conceptualize that is that what we have done is monetize or liquify a lot of unrealized capital gains And that has been done largely through an expansion of bank credit that hasn't run down significantly That money is sitting there and some of it certainly will go back into other investments; but some of it could well be spent I just think that at some point, when money has run at such rapid rates, we are going to see some impact in prices that may not really be built into the forecast we are looking at So, we're higher on the price side; we are at the high end of that range   A good point along those lines, Manley, is that the withholding went down for a lot of people and a number of retailers, particularly the ones that compete on price I view that as a real positive   I'll try to keep this short alternative II   Basically, I like this language or the concept of it I might just suggest an extension to what you've suggested What you have suggested makes a lot of sense In general, I have some problem with the signaling effect of abandoning a narrow aggregate altogether As I said at the last meeting, I'm not sure that we have the right one in M1 as it is now Also, I'm not sure that we can really pick another right one right now I think we have to let this unwinding of inflationary expectations that's been in process sort of run its course I don't think any of us is confident that it has done that, so I don't think it's a good time to pick another narrow aggregate Roger Guffey commented before, and I agree with him, that what we do with respect to M2 and M3 doesn't have much of a signaling effect at all I'm afraid that not setting any target at all for M1 could potentially have a negative signaling effect And as you've observed, Mr Chairman, it could have a negative effect on Mr Proxmire I would suggest that we consider setting a target along the lines of what Don suggested based on what we know now We could set a target range for M1 of, say, 7 to 13 percent, but with language surrounding it indicating that we might miss that on the up side or the down side Now, when I thought about this, I was concerned about what the implications of that might be But if we add to that the kind of language that's in variant I with respect to missing that substantially on the down side--and also recognize that we've got to approach this target flexibly and we ought to be prepared to change it--I think that there's some advantage to having the target out there As I said, not having a narrower aggregate--which is what we can really exert some control over based on our behavior and what we do with reserves--could send a negative signal What you're suggesting could potentially be misread in the other direction as well The 7 to 13 percent range certainly puts out a clear message in  -36-    2/10-11/87  the market that we expect the very rapid growth rates in money that have occurred in the last two years to come down We expect, and intend in a way, to commit ourselves under certain circumstances to bring those down   Oh, I understand that   In a way, with inflationary expectations on the rise right now, somehow I would like to see the message out there that we've noticed that   Okay, if you accept that part, how do you get away from the fact that we're walking away from a narrow aggregate target at all? It's not that M1 is the right one, but how do we get back into that ball game down the road?   Yes As long as abandoning the concept of setting a target does not take away the fact that we think it's important to pay attention to what M1 does and that it has to be evaluated under certain circumstances, that's fine As a matter of fact, on that point I asked our people to look at what would happen if velocity went back to what it was--roughly a level of 7 at the beginning of 1982--over a two-year period If that were to happen, based on the liquidity that's in there, we could have roughly 5 percent nominal GNP growth each year without adding any more money   I'm very sensitive to the problem on the down side I just also am very concerned about the signaling effect-- making sure that the message out there is that we can't set a range but we're paying close attention to this narrow aggregate in the context of what's going on more broadly   The question is the difference between expectations and actions, too It may go beyond just expecting it; we might be prepared to take steps to achieve it   That is the desirable aspect of a narrow aggregate [target] because we can affect its behavior   Well, that goes a long way in addressing my concern   Right  -40-    2/10-11/87   And the idea that it might be or could be targeted [later]   I'd like to make some comments I came in somewhat predisposed to leaning toward a greater degree of reserve restraint But I really wanted to hear the discussion; it has been a long time since we've gotten together And I was really struck by the discussion yesterday [unintelligible] really the whole time I've been sitting in I would characterize people's general feeling on the real side as one in which the risks, if anything, are that the staff's projections might be a little low But I wouldn't put too much weight on that or necessarily too much weight on the December economic numbers What struck me more was the broad expression of concern, made in a number of different ways, about inflation and inflationary expectations There are some things that trouble me right now and there are some things down the road that I think could put us in a difficult position, possibly The things that trouble me now are the extraordinary growth of money, reserves, bank credit, etc over a three-month period--November, December, and January Some of it has washed out but, still, over a three-month period it's quite extraordinary We all know about the year-end factors, but I just have this feeling that there may be something more afoot than that As I said yesterday, even some of those special year-end factors have the effect of liquefying unrealized profits And that money is in there; that's grandfathered  The other thing that has been troubling me right along, as I have been saying, is that I'd be concerned about continued rapid growth in M1 against a backdrop of stable to rising rates We still could have some lagged effects from earlier declines in rates, but basically we have been pouring in reserves at an extraordinary rate to try to hold funds somewhere around 6 percent, although some market observers have interpreted it differently Now, that really begins to bother me in the context of these other things There are some pressures building up, and as Jerry Corrigan pointed out, we're really pumping in reserves at an extraordinary rate to try to hold the line Again, that's a straw in the wind that troubles me I don't think I need to comment about the dollar, and we've talked about the buildup in liquidity before As I look down the road, what bothers me is the box we could be in--really, as early as later in the first quarter The staff's projection on the CPI is 46 percent; it wouldn't take much of a miss on the upside for us to be looking at a 5 percent CPI in the first quarter Secondly, I really think that this year Congress will not be able to come up with anything close to credible in terms of that $108 to $118 billion Gramm-Rudmann-Hollings deficit target Now, maybe this would come a little later than these CPI numbers, but I think we very likely could see--even though the progress on deficits might be in the right direction--a need to walk away explicitly from the Gramm-Rudmann-Hollings legislation and the general concepts and guidelines there And that, too, I think could have a negative psychological effect So, basically as I look at these straws in the wind now and then look at the position we could be  -47-    2/10-11/87  in down the road--and I don't think we're ever absolutely sure at times when we have to move--what I say to myself is that if we don't start to lean against this now we very likely could be in a position where we're going to have to do a lot more down the road if we lose control of these inflationary expectations  One final comment I would have is that if we were to have tightened policy last summer and last fall there would have been a dramatic impact, in my judgment, on short-term rates--markets were discounting the possibility of further ease I think all of that has been washed out now The three-month bill is trading essentially even with the funds rate on a yield basis, whereas I suspect that at points in time it might have been 50-60 basis points below the funds rate Would that be about right, Don?   Okay But it's around 6 percent now?   It might have been trading substantially below the funds rate in the summer and fall--maybe 50 basis points So, a little snugging on our part now, in my judgment, is not going to have a major adverse impact on short-term rates It could have a salutary effect on long-term rates, although we haven't really seen the same kind of negative signals in the long-market to the extent that we did earlier in the year, at least in terms of the yield curve   Well, I don't think we have achieved that, really I think what has happened is that we are pouring in a tremendous amount of reserves to try to avoid it, and the market is sending us a signal To the extent that we keep trying to do that, I think we are really going to create some problems in the longer-term market   I am for alternative C   In citing those conditions it is possible to use an ""and/or"" structure In other words, I could imagine circumstances where you wouldn't necessarily have all four of those   You could use ""in the context of signs of"" or ""in the context of surrounding circumstances"" and you could use an ""including"" structure and an ""or"" at the end   I was suggesting that we could say ""It would be appropriate in the context of surrounding circumstances, which could include, for example,"" and then just list the four and put an ""or"" there If they are given as examples it doesn't necessarily imply that there will be just one or all four   You could say ""which might include a combination of""   You could say ""accompanied by some combination of"" and then use the ""and"" structure, which could mean all or it could mean one or two   Did you say ""or""?   On the last sentence of the second page ""[The Committee] will evaluate appropriate growth in M1 from time to time in the light of circumstances then prevailing, including the rate of growth of the broader aggregates"" That says evaluate; it doesn't necessarily imply very explicitly that we might set a target I am just wondering if we could add a phase ""and under certain circumstances might establish short-run target ranges"" That is very explicit about it   This sounds like stuff we say all the time  -64-    2/10-11/87   What if you replace ""will evaluate"" with ""may target""? I think you want to stay away from that, but I am just--   The last sentence   I think that is the statement that adds something to what has already been said Otherwise, you're right that it doesn't--   That's fine "
3160,1987-03-31," On this point about manufacturing, Frank, we not only saw a big pickup in January--81 percent at an annual rate--but an annual growth rate for the last three months of 32 percent So we have been seeing the strength in manufacturing for some time now and it is reflected in non-agricultural employment more broadly Retail sales are reported with a considerable lag, but I think that retailers generally feel pretty good about the way things are going Someone made the comment before that economic conditions are a little better than they might have thought I think retailers generally feel good about things on that side A lot of these sectors could have been affected by weather, as residential construction was, but I think there is a sentiment that there is some fundamental underlying strength as well The one area of weakness that has shown up more recently is nonresidential construction Yet in one of the local businessmen who is in the commercial glass business, or quasi-commercial or whatever you call that, indicated that late last year and early this year they have put through two 5 percent price increases both of which stuck, after a long history of trying to  -22-    3/31/87  put them through and they just wouldn't stick And they are looking at maybe another 5 percent increase down the road this year On a broader front, I personally am somewhat skeptical as to whether the effects of the lower dollar, which I think will filter through in many ways over a long period of time, can really be handled as a one-time level adjustment, as perhaps energy prices would be viewed, in terms of inflation I would be somewhat concerned about the ability to contain, as Bob Forrestal mentioned, the secondary effects arising out of higher import prices  Finally, on another note, we had a group of institutional investors in for lunch last week--this is perhaps somewhat irrelevant at this point in that it has already happened--but I was struck by the level of anxiety about market valuation Generally, people felt that the US stock market on a valuation basis was overpriced but in comparison to other world markets it looked like a great buy right now So in the cases where investors maybe had taken some US funds offshore, where they have enjoyed tremendous gains both in the currency and those market movements, they now look at the relative valuations and say maybe the US market isn't a bad buy But there was this general anxiety that a rising tide lifts all ships and that that is not a very good fundamental underpinning for the level of markets   Yes, I think Again, I was struck--and maybe it was just because this was at our Reserve Bank and they were saying what they thought they ought to in the central bank--that, generally speaking, they felt that the liquidity that had been provided wasn't having a lot of impact on the real side of the economy It was all going into the financial markets and it was blowing up this balloon and creating anxiety about what might happen should that balloon burst   I come out in essentially the same place Let me just mention a couple of things While it is implicit, I think, in the discussion, maybe one thing that ought to be mentioned explicitly is that the problem with the dollar is not the level but the rate of decline that we have experienced--more than 7 percent between the December and February meetings I am not sure what the decline is through yesterday, but it's probably on the order of 5 percent on a trade-weighted basis So, one thing that is important in thinking about the dollar is that we are not necessarily saying that this is the right level but that some stability is desirable Picking up on Governor Johnson's earlier point--it seems to me that the message being sent to us there is really quite a negative one if our real growth outlook is considerably more attractive than that of our major trading partners and yet our currency is weak I think that is saying something about what people think about the inflationary prospects here I recognize that there are a lot of risks on the table with respect to the economic outlook, but going back to what Jerry Corrigan said earlier, the most destabilizing risk would be that of losing control of the dollar on the downside after the very rapid declines that we've had So, in my mind that alone takes away any thought of easing In fact, it seems to me that the dynamics we've been witnessing here, with a weaker dollar and how that spills right back into the bond and stock markets, are what will unleash the liquidity that's in the economy that we've been talking about for some time It's going to lead people to tend to want to liquidate financial assets and, I would guess, be much more inclined to spend That could really add to the momentum in the economy, particularly on the price side, which is where my concern would be It really comes down in my mind to a question of whether we tighten now or wait I guess we can all take some comfort in the slowdown in the growth of reserves and money but, on a quarterly basis, we're really talking about M1 slowing down to 11 percent in the fourth quarter; for the average through March the projection is around 9 percent Reserve growth also has slowed down from very extraordinary rates toward the end of the year But we're still talking about historically high rates In my mind, there's no reason to be at all concerned about slow money growth Eventually, although it's not a very happy choice, it seems to me that we will likely be put in a position of having to tighten policy I don't know whether it's now or later It seems to me that the arguments against any move now are these international discussions that you mentioned, Mr Chairman, and also the trade negotiations with the Japanese right now While I don't necessarily agree with it, I could see that at this point--as a negotiating tactic, really--the dollar bashing is the club we have in trying to reach some agreement in a very short-term sense  So, all things considered, I'd be in favor of maintaining the existing degree of reserve restraint now But if we can't hold the  -32-    3/31/87  dollar at about this level, then I think we have to be prepared to move to a firmer policy much more quickly Or if, at the present degree of reserve restraint, we see a pickup in the rate of growth of money in relation to what's projected here--let's say we have 9 percent on the table for the period ahead--I think we're going to have to pay more attention to that I say that for all these other reasons inflationary expectations are quite high now, and I don't think we have the latitude as a central bank to ignore extremely rapid money growth The slowdown from the rapid rates of last year, from 13 percent down to 9 percent, is okay But if we see either a pickup in monetary growth--and when I say pickup I mean in relation to this 9 percent projection for the quarter--or a weak dollar, those would be the things I'd be looking at as short-term indicators of the need to respond in the direction of further tightening   There used to be a range in the directive for borrowings, which may be appropriate here We could maybe skew it a little in the direction of the sentiment that has been expressed   Put a range in?   Couldn't you finesse that?   Could we not deal with that in a less explicit way by just putting the behavior of the aggregates phrase in the second sentence and keeping the third sentence what it usually has been, which is really our best guess?   The way this is worded right now, though, it seems to me that we are not looking at the aggregates at all, which I am not sure is right I wasn't advocating putting them up there in the ""depending on"" phrase but I would put them in the ""taking into account"" litany of things that we look at Otherwise, we're just saying we don't take them into account at all and we are just making a prediction of where we think they are going to come in   I wasn't suggesting that I was suggesting just putting in this phrase that was dropped out when this was retyped   If we say ""about 6 percent,"" it's pretty clear to people that we are shooting for the lower end of the cone, and everybody knows the uncertainty associated with that I think we've already sent the message if we say ""about 6 percent""   I don't view that third sentence as really the operational language I can't ever recall a conference call, when I have been involved, over the aggregates misbehaving This is simply saying-- "
3194,1987-05-19," Sam, how do you reconcile this negative sentiment on the dollar with these very wide interest rate differentials that you mentioned? What is that saying here?   Peter, just in a technical sense--and I know that extraordinary things were going on in this recent period--if you had a spread of 125 basis points between the discount rate and the prevailing federal funds rate, does that provide enough of an incentive to borrow that it makes it more difficult to hit a particular borrowings target? And does that, therefore, perhaps introduce a little more volatility in open market operations? I know that in the most recent period, as you've described, there were some other things going on I guess my question really runs to the spread on an ongoing basis   Jim, what is your assessment of the inventory situation other than autos?   Were you talking about the CPI? You mentioned some very low figures I have some here--   I am not going to try to defend Wall Street, but I think there is another aspect to this market behavior we have observed, and that is, as we all know, that we have a tremendous growth in debt in the economy And when you get markets whipping around like these have, there are losses out there It would be fortunate, in a sense, if a $275 million loss ended up with Merrill Lynch; they can afford to take it But what if one of those ended up  -20-    5/19/87  in Financial Corp of America or one of those? Maybe it has; I don't know whether it has or not All I'm saying is that this kind of behavior tends to widen quality spreads; you see it a little in the new issues, though there haven't been many of them But you can have a situation where somebody needs to realize liquidity with some of the lower quality paper they have bought and there might not be a bid out there So one of the aspects that hasn't been brought out about this market behavior, which I think has been very much fueled by inflationary expectations, is the financial fragility that these kinds of swings can bring to the surface Beyond that, as Jerry mentioned, six or eight weeks ago when we were talking about this initially, there was just a whiff of inflation; basically, it came through a weaker dollar and that psychology was transmitted into the bond market and so forth But I think now what we are seeing is poor performance, if you will, in the bond market based on sources other than the lower dollar--other reports of commodity prices and so forth I thought what the Board staff did in sections 23 and 24 of part II [of the Greenbook] really makes the case that there are a lot of things happening with spot prices that go well beyond the realm of what I would consider just speculative behavior I think there is definitely a tendency out there to sort of poo-poo all of these developments by saying this is just speculation on Wall Street and these guys deserve to take their losses anyway In a sense, I don't think enough attention is paid to it We had some corporate treasurers in last week and, in terms of how they are operating their businesses, I was a little surprised that they are not concerned about inflation They are still enjoying the good wage performance that we have observed; of course, that would only adjust with lags They haven't really changed their inventory behavior and, in a sense, I think that gives us an opportunity If we nip this in the bud now--when maybe it is largely expectational, as Gary Stern said before--we can have some impact on it But if it gets deep-seated enough that business people begin to change their behavior with respect to inventories and so forth, then it really becomes a much more difficult problem to deal with  As to economic activity in our District, growth both in manufacturing and non-agricultural employment in general continues to outstrip the national figures I would say that the attitude is generally positive and that there are no major weaknesses in any sector   I would be in the same position that Ed Boehne  just expressed I think that if we wait on the discount rate until there is another test on the dollar, there is a good chance that a 50  basis point move wouldn't be enough By showing some resolve sooner, I think we have a better chance of dealing with that Also, as Gary  Stern pointed out, that deals with the inflationary expectations decisively   One concern that I have is that all we have done, in effect, is just ratify the level of reserve restraint that we have right now Listening to what Sam and Peter said, that there might be some expectation out there--   Yes I am not talking about the minutes now "
3218,1987-07-07," Mike, I wanted to pursue your assumptions with respect to money growth and your statement earlier You have very slow rates of growth of M2 and M3 over the projection period As you mentioned before, I guess that's associated in part with rising interest rates and increasing velocity First of all, what's implied for M1 growth if you looked at that? And secondly, apparently you're comfortable that the liquidity that's being provided, if you will, is sufficient to sustain the type of expansion you're projecting But I wondered what that implied overall in terms of velocity behavior   Okay   I just want to ask I assume the way you've stated interest rates as an assumption means they are more or less an endogenous variable here Where would this come apart had you not projected the kind of increase in rates that you have?   I want to pick up on Bob Parry's theme, using a money-driven model and extending the debate about what money is growing at right now Just extending the present growth rate--which for this purpose we assumed to be 8 to 10 percent in M1--into 1988 produced what I would consider unsatisfactory results, with the deflator getting up to 5-1/2 percent by the fourth quarter of 1988 So, in coming up with our projections, we assumed a further degree of restraint in 1988 vis-a-vis 1987, which I guess, Bob, would really translate into another way of looking at your interest rate assumption The net result was that, basically, in 1987 we tend to be at the high end of the [Committee member's ranges] with a 7-1/4 percent nominal growth rate--3 percent real and 4-1/4 percent deflator But then in 1988 we're more in the median area with 7 percent nominal, 2-1/2 percent real and 4-1/2 percent on the deflator But we found, really, the same thing using another type of model   I would leave it the same as well I agree with Ed Boehne, [unintelligible] I don't think it is a particularly good intermediate policy guide We know it is not how we are going to run policy And looking at it on a long-term basis, it looks to me like velocity growth has been essentially zero over a long period of time That would be consistent with our GNP forecast for the year; it would fall right about in the middle of a 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent range And finally, I think this signal effect point that Roger Guffey and Manley Johnson raised is also an important one I don't think that this is necessarily a time when we want to send a signal that we're somehow tightening up policy further The recent actions have gained a lot of credibility in terms of the willingness of this group to respond to pressures Those pressures don't seem to be on the table right now, so why send that signal and potentially destabilize things?   Don, what would you say is the trend velocity in M2 right now? I threw out zero before as the trend velocity growth Is that fair?   One of the things that concerns me a little is that we get down to ranges that embrace trend velocity growth and factor in what we expect in nominal GNP and the ranges roughly bracket  -41-    7/7/87  that If we start to take into account short-term velocity behavior to drop the ranges down even further, that's almost building in the fact that at some point down the road we are going to have to jack them back up and move them around Maybe this is a historical question in terms of what the tradition is But I would tend to view these, particularly for M2 and M3, as much longer-term I would be comfortable, therefore, embracing a trend velocity concept together with a nominal GNP forecast; and that would lead me roughly to the 5 to 8 percent range for M2, which is what I would favor I think there is a danger if we get these ranges down so far that, first of all, we are almost making it necessary to project interest rates to set the targets because of the sensitivity of velocity to interest rates Also, later we might get into the situation Wayne described where just because we change our outlook and interest rate forecast, we're jacking them up and sending a false signal   I'll agree   ""Some evidence of greater prices""--   It seems to me the last sentence could be ended after ""prevailing"" "
3243,1987-08-18," Mike, I wanted to ask about short- and intermediate-term business demand How do you conceptualize the slowdown that is occurring there? How would you explain that?   Yes   I wanted to pass on just one piece of anecdotal information that bears to some extent on what Jerry and Bob Heller were saying one businessman in our District in the shoe business mentioned to me that they're running at essentially 100 percent of capacity now I sense that's close to true in textiles, and, at least in some respects, in the steel area So I mention that I guess what concerns me, when you think about this external adjustment process that Jerry talked about, is that we shut down capacity so quickly over this period of years that I think we are bumping up against capacity constraints in those industries a lot sooner than anybody could have anticipated I asked a logical follow-up question to this executive ""Well, are you going to expand capacity?"" In that case, they have closed facilities that they could probably reopen without a major capital investment But, basically, the message was that chief executive officers and financial officers, having been through this period of shutting capacity down for so long, are going to be very slow to make the investment to reopen As a result, even in these industries that have been depressed, I think the pressures on the labor markets are apt to build a lot faster, because the investment is not going to follow as quickly as it might have in a more orderly  -22-    8/18/87  period, if you will I wanted to pass that on; I thought that was interesting   I read that, at one point, to mean the opposite of what it is intended to mean I think it could be interpreted that way If you were worried about the slow growth, you might actually encourage--   I definitely would put the priorities on the side of worrying about inflation as opposed to the recovery I would favor ""B"" with a tilt toward tightening I could certainly accept a $600 borrowing target, although I'm not voting, so I don't need to accept it I'd feel particularly strongly about moving if I felt that we were sort of maintaining a 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent funds rate against a very strong demand for reserves Now, as you pointed out before, Mr Chairman, on the velocity argument, maybe we won't see that We're certainly not maintaining a lower funds rate than would otherwise prevail through rapid reserve injection here; but that's where I come out I would be inclined to leave language in there about the dollar I think if we lost control of the dollar on the downside, we could kick off that whole cycle that we dealt with just a couple of months ago; and I'd be very sensitive to weakness in the dollar in the language "
3268,1987-09-22," Peter, you reported on the first 11 days; there is apt to be a pretty large borrowing spike Wednesday How would you expect that to be interpreted in this environment? This is a period that has had some technical problems with the tax date, so I guess you are not going to be able to conclude much from that either   Mike, if this linkage between dollar weakness and inflationary expectations isn't broken, and you weren't able, for example, to achieve over the forecast period the 10 percent annual of decline in the dollar--let's just say that that becomes impossible-- how would that affect the forecast in a broad sense? In other words,  -11-    9/22/87  if you couldn't achieve some of the external adjustment through the foreign exchange price mechanism--   What I'm saying is that the box we are in right now is that, as a practical matter, if we tolerate that dollar decline, it kicks off inflationary expectations So, let's say that you just assumed that the dollar was stable How would that affect the forecast?   First of all, I would say that over the last year or so, performance in our District has been somewhat stronger than the national average Employment has been about in line, retail sales somewhat stronger, and I guess the most notable area of strength has been construction, both residential and nonresidential Over the last couple of months, I would say things have slowed a bit, relatively speaking We haven't kept pace with the employment gains nationally either in non-ag employment or manufacturing employment Retail sales have held up well, relatively speaking Residential construction is in line with the national averages and nonresidential is still somewhat stronger but growing at a much slower pace than it was Anecdotally, we've picked up some evidence of the same thing that has been mentioned around the table today in terms of labor shortages There was a company with about 90 semi-skilled employees that was shut down, and another big employer in St Louis in town  -24-    9/22/87  expected to pick up, I don't know, somewhere on the order of a third to a half of them It ended up getting only five of them, because there were so many other people bidding You hear that in other areas as well One other thing I've heard in that regard is that companies that have generally been stable in terms of employment, or maybe even reducing employment here, recently have added employees There are some noises about trying to negotiate some of the give-backs that were obtained over the last couple of years I've heard just one example of that; it's not widespread  On the broader outlook, while I have been, and continue to be, in agreement with putting the priority on price stability versus growth, the projections that come out of our Bank, which are based on money-driven models, have been showing for some time--and I thought I would mention it this month--the risk of a sharp slowdown in the economy in 1988 and even the possibility of a recession Given the behavior of velocity and so forth, I think it is hard to evaluate this exactly, but one of the things that people continue to feel reasonably strongly about is the effect of a sharp slowing in money in relation to trend, if it is sustained for two or more quarters And, it's really on that basis that we come up with this forecast So, that's a very different view than previously expressed I think it's difficult to evaluate because you can't know the effect of all the liquidity that was put in over the last couple of years, and whether that might continue to have a stimulative effect looking forward  One last point on the interest rate question I suspect it's a combination of an increase in inflationary expectations and some increase in the real rate The only other thing I would mention that hasn't already been mentioned is that we are at, or have passed through, a major inflection point in terms of the interest rate outlook that's internalized in, say, the minds of traders and so forth; and people I would say, as we do, just follow markets quite closely, very quickly But, in terms of broad-based behavior, I think that really gets built into prices over a surprisingly long period of time I think one of the things we are seeing here is people continuing to adjust portfolios to a different interest rate outlook, and probably thinner participation in the market, at least on the buying side, by final investors So, I think there's a certain element of uncertainty associated with this adjustment phenomenon   I would align myself with Bob Forrestal's position ""B"", with a $500 million borrowings target and asymmetric language The main thing that is influencing me is a longer-term view and, I guess, trying not to get out of position And I think Bob Black said it any way you look at this--whether you look at rates, at the provision of reserves, or at the behavior of the aggregates--over the course of this year, we have taken some significant steps And I am not quite sure, as I expressed earlier, what the impact of that is going to be But, being an old market participant, when everybody thinks the same there's a chance that it won't work out that way Sometimes you get a little afraid of a consensus that is apparently that strong Having said all that, I could certainly accept ""B"", with a $600 million borrowing target and symmetric language But I have a slight preference for the position Bob Forrestal mentioned   Although there will be a perception for a while that we did, I think, as the $600 million shows through-- "
3298,1987-11-03," Peter, on your assumption of excess reserves of $12 billion, how long do you think that will be in place?   Echoing what Gary Stern said on the retail front, I talked to national retailer in our area and he said they looked at the week-by-week comparison of sales at their outlets throughout the country in the two full weeks since October 19, and only one store showed a decline in that first week That was the World Trade Center store and sales picked up in the second week He is really quite optimistic; his attitude is that this is not going to have an impact Now, you  -20-    11/3/87  have to believe that the loss of wealth, long-term, will have some impact But I guess my own feeling, based on this isolated comment and other comments I have heard, is that it's a little too early to try to sort it all out and to decide how to respond in a long-term sense  The other comment that I wanted to make is that the area that shows particular strength in our District is manufacturing employment Implicit in what Jerry Corrigan was saying about the risks of a lower dollar, it seems to me, would be the inflationary risk at a micro level I think what we have been seeing in terms of pressures on capacity and wage rates has really been on the manufacturing side When I say that, I base it on anecdotal evidence; I don't mean that it has been reflected in the data And to the extent that a rapidly declining dollar causes a more rapid external adjustment in [the manufacturing] area, it seems to me that we could get greater price pressures in those industries that are producing for export or are import competitive--the shoe industry, the apparel industry, and some other industries where even before the most recent developments, we were already hearing reports of some pressure So I think on the inflation front, that is something to be mindful of on the micro level   I favor alternative ""B"" I have one question I want to raise If you look at the directive in the policy record that comes out Friday and then you look at this language here, it's really not clear what ""existing"" means Nowhere in the policy record is it memorialized that there was an adjustment in the borrowing target; we don't put borrowing targets in there I think it was generally perceived, but it is not recorded there in any fashion That may be something to think about In any case, I would like to express a little concern along the lines of what Jerry said about balance here There has been a major shift in policy; and the broad perception of policy, I think, was that we were headed toward further degrees of tightening at the last meeting That has been washed out and there has been some easing Now, on the balance side my argument would be this I guess I never felt that we could defend a particular level of the dollar--that's going to be set by market forces So, maybe now the fact that the dollar has moved down and there haven't been major  -34-    11/3/87  adverse effects to that is okay In the short run I think we can influence how that transition to the different levels takes place and whether it's orderly or not But it seems to me that any changes in monetary policy that we make now add to the perception that all that is happening is that the dollar is adjusting to reasonable market levels What I'm trying to say is, if it's perceived beyond that that monetary policy is being conducted in a fashion that we really think we have the latitude to run out of sync with the rest of the world, that would be very damaging to that future psychology that you've described In other words, I think we have lost the flexibility to ignore what goes on in the rest of the world here Policy coordination is important and I hate to see us take a policy stance in the short run that might fuel that perception that we somehow backed off the need to do that for all the reasons we have discussed on the financial and the real side today So, in any case, I favor ""B"" and symmetrical language I think Variant I is fine but I come out where Bob Black is in a sense there are too many statements in there dealing with the extraordinary circumstances; it might convey more of a sense of uncertainty about current conditions than we want to convey I think I'd stick with what Bob suggested on that first statement--   Well, I think what he was saying was stay with the desire to ensure the provision of adequate liquidity But the statements about flexibility in open market operations in lines 90 and 91 and then around line 105 or so in the part about the frequent consultations would be thoughts I would be inclined to take out I think our actions are more important than our words, and I think the perception of our actions in the financial markets is a positive one I think the perception is we are doing the right thing   It will be?   Right; so in the verbiage that leads up to this directive we are indicating--   I think that's fine   If we are adopting the existing degree of reserve restraint now, that somehow implies that a change, in a policy sense, occurred prior to this action   But let me ask you this, Don If there had been a telephone call at which that was specifically put to a vote would it then have been reported as an addendum?   You know, that's a small subtlety   When you say ""apart from such considerations,"" it seems that it's not necessary down below to have ""conditions in the financial markets"" in there again  -44-    11/3/87   You need a comma after ""would,"" too "
3322,1987-12-15," Don or Peter, the question I want to ask is this Other than the experience in the marketplace, do we have any evidence of a shift in the borrowings function? I think we have to look at that The reason I'm asking is that in the most recent reserve period we missed by roughly $80 million, I believe Isn't $220 million where borrowings came in?   Okay If we had forced the target at $300 million, that would have meant only $1 billion to $1-1/2 billion in borrowings on the last Wednesday; I don't know that that would have produced disastrous results, being the end of a two-week statement period Even if we had forced that level of borrowings on a Wednesday and had had that measure of volatility, generally over that period the equilibrium funds rate might still have been perceived to be 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent My question about evidence stems from this I asked our discount officer whether he had seen anything unexpected in our District, and he hadn't in terms of unwillingness to borrow But the issue came up, I guess, at a recent meeting of the discount officers that you might have attended They have seen a shift in the borrowings function, but it's not really associated with October 19th in particular; it has been going on for a much longer period of time So, we are talking about an operating procedure here that was based on the response to October 19th, and I don't think the shift we are looking at was necessarily associated with that I should give Don a chance to respond, but I have one final comment If we were to go back [to a borrowing target], I think year-end would be an ideal time to go back because there will be seasonal pressures, as there often are at the end of a quarter In fact, if we didn't, and we stabilized the funds rate through the year-end, we might encounter some serious technical problems in getting those reserves back out   I think you can use the cover of year-end, as I alluded to before I think it would be a mistake to start right after the FOMC meeting; that's how you would get the misinterpretation that Bob's afraid of   Well, I have another idea that I want to lay on the table Would this be an appropriate time?   Well, it has to do with aggregate targets   I have two comments about the environment we're dealing in First of all, there is a lot of uncertainty about exactly  -26-    12/15-16/87  how policy is being conducted in the long run It's not unusual, but I think this is one of those times when there are those kinds of questions in the marketplace And the kind of discussion we are having right now is very, very healthy in terms of talking about different approaches But, on top of the uncertainty that I perceive in the marketplace and some of the difficulties with the aggregates and with interest rate targeting that we have talked about, I'd say that we are now in a period--and I think it will be exacerbated--when there is going to be a conflict between the pressures we face domestically and the pressures we face internationally in terms of how policy is conducted And, I think there would be no better time to have some kind of an intermediate target or guide  What I wanted to put on the table was the idea that had been mentioned earlier of looking at a monetary base target of some sort There is no question that we can control that, and I think it's a good indicator of the thrust of policy I don't have any delusions about the ability to pick a specific growth rate of the base and say we therefore expect nominal GNP to do ""Y"" Some of the work we have done on the base and income relationships would indicate that the relationship is no worse than M2, for example But, that's not really what I have in mind I think it is possible to select a relatively narrow channel in terms of possible growth rates for the base that in the long run would be consistent with satisfactory economic performance and, at the same time, preserve in the short run the latitude to react to all the various types of incoming data that we react to now In other words, this approach I'm describing would allow for discretion in the short-run conduct of policy but at the same time--assuming we were to stick with it --it would take away some of the extremes in possible policy results in either direction that is, very simply, either too tight a monetary policy, or too easy a monetary policy  Right now, I don't think we have a lot of confidence in the other aggregates and I don't think the marketplace pays that much attention to them If we were to substitute some kind of a base target, first of all, I think the announcement of that would carry with it a considerable positive impact just because the market would know in general what policymakers are going to be looking at in the conduct of policy And this channel that I have talked about would tend to eliminate uncertainty and increase credibility I think the existence of a target like that--if I'm right about the type of environment that we are in and that we're apt to be in next year in an even more important way--could be used to diffuse domestic and international pressures, to do something in the short-run conduct of policy, particularly to influence rates And in the long run, if pursued religiously, I think it would tend to result in more stable and more balanced economic results So, I guess what I wanted to do was put the idea on the table We've done some work, and I think we have to do a lot more work, but if there were any support for that kind of idea, maybe with more background work done it's something that could be discussed more thoroughly at the February meeting   Well, just to repeat one thing I said obviously, you would not use it in the short run to operate policy But I think you probably could pick a band of something like 2 percentage points or so --just looking at data for the 1980s, for example--that you could argue would give you plenty of latitude in either direction to get satisfactory economic results, to meet your long-term objectives   Well, this is an extraordinary time   It may be one of those times when we wouldn't stick with the target But we would have to announce that and we could explain it very straightforwardly; it doesn't come down to explanations like, ""Well, velocity changed"", which is not all that credible after a while   Jerry, the only thing I would say is that if you look back over the experience--and I just eyeballed it, this isn't econometric analysis--at the points in time where there were inflection points in policy in one direction or another, this sort of approach I have outlined would have been consistent with what I said That indicates to me that, at the extremes, something like this could be helpful   Jerry, how about the European central banks that have a base target?   Okay   I think that's right   In our District, the real strong point is employment Non-ag employment has kept pace with national growth rates And we've seen particular strength in manufacturing employment; in the three months before October, that was up over 4 percent Construction has been notably weaker in both sectors but for a long time it was stronger than the rest of the economy I would say that the retail sales situation is a little more moderate than described in other areas I talked to a major national retailer about two weeks ago and they were disappointed with their November results December started off better, but their profit plan for February through August has been nudged down significantly; and they're taking about 10 percent, or $75 million, out of their capital spending plan for next year which, in a sense, doesn't surprise me This individual also mentioned that apparel manufacturers are talking about double digit price increases for the spring line and he does not see that that's in the cards at all, based on his outlook of demand Adding to what Jerry Corrigan and Gary Stern said about the adjustment process that Jerry was describing it seems to me that the big risk--and I'm talking in the broad sense, not about monetary policy specifically, though it certainly fits into the picture--is that if we are perceived as not pursuing underlying policies that are consistent with that adjustment process, then it will trigger prices in exactly the way Sam Cross was describing before As I said at the last meeting, I don't believe in defending the value of the currency; but the fact of the matter is that I perceive that we are in a financial situation where we just don't have a lot of room to ignore it I wouldn't put my view in the context of specifically defending the currency but I do think that we have to run policies that are consistent with that adjustment process That gets back to Ed Boehne's point that we have to be  -61-    12/15-16/87  looking at lower demand growth than we might otherwise be willing to accept   I also would favor ""B"" I would define that as a $400 million borrowings target In my mind, that's where we were and what we've done since then was really to accommodate the special conditions   On the normal relationship I would expect that to be associated with a 7 percent funds rate and I would be symmetrical in terms of the language As to the other--I guess I should have done that first--I would favor alternative (4) I wouldn't go back to it abruptly; I think I'd use the year-end as a cover, but I would get back to that relatively promptly I really don't know what (3) means   I like Peter, but I think I like number (4) better   Could I ask a question? I had a similar question last time How will the policy record reflect what happened here? I think some people interpret the $300 million as kind of where we were and as no change in policy; others interpret it as a change in policy in that we're moving the borrowing target down from $400 million to $300 million, albeit under that flexibility arrangement If somebody reads the policy record next time and the directive talks about the existing degree of reserve restraint, where does it get memorialized that the degree of reserve restraint was changed, if in fact it was? How will that be read?   What would be the equilibrium borrowing assumption?   Fine   He likes you too, Peter   No, but the language on reserve restraint-- "
3358,1988-02-09," In the Eighth District, the fourth-quarter data that we have are all very strong--quite a bit stronger in any number of measures, including employment, construction, income and so forth, than the national data I guess more importantly, for where we are now in terms of discussing anecdotal information, the sense I get from a major national retailer is that there is some disappointment with their sales performance There is improvement in relation to last year, but probably not as much as was being targeted But I don't get the sense of an inventory problem in terms of general merchandise Where I pick that up is more in talking to people in areas like furniture, consumer durables, appliances I sense that this is not a problem yet that has spilled back into the production cycle People have not changed production plans based on this, partly because of order backlogs and the like But in the major appliances area, one  -17-    2/9-10/88  particular manufacturer is about 9 percent behind where they were a year ago By the same token, that same manufacturer indicated that they're really seeing a lot of raw material price increases coming through, and for the first time since 1984 they're going to try to pass that through with a price increase in their products So, that reflects some of what we've been hearing elsewhere around the table  Finally in terms of the [national] forecast, I would say our forecast is quite a bit different in the sense that we are looking for much slower real growth and modestly higher inflation than the central tendency To some extent, I think that's influenced by our assumption of a monetary policy roughly consistent with last year's This was based on a model using 5 percent money growth What that shows in 1988 is what I would call a reasonable economic performance on a longer-term basis--in the 2 to 2-1/2 percent area real [GNP]--and maybe 4 to 4-1/2 percent in prices What our model, and interpretations of it, would tend to indicate is that trying to respond to the short-term weakness that shows up with very strong money growth here would have very little effect in the short run; really a lot of it would pass through into prices looking out into late 1988 and early 1989 I share the view that has been expressed in terms of recognizing the constraint that the external adjustment process puts on policy, and perhaps to some extent, the desirability of accepting slower real growth than might have been accepted, say, a year or two ago   I would favor the 4 to 8 percent alternative; I'd go with alternative II but I would widen M2 to 4 to 8 percent I think the half a point reduction that we already have in the preliminary numbers sends the right long-term signal I think a further reduction now would, in a sense, almost be confusing People perceive the thrust of policy to be in the opposite direction and I think that would be a potentially destabilizing signal I think everybody knows from my comments over a long period of time that I've felt just as strongly as Jerry and others about the long-run inflationary risks, but I think that might be confusing I think the 4 percent lower band on M2 recognizes Jerry's concern; it actually gives us the latitude to move further in that direction than alternative III would if we had to And I don't think the widening of the ranges from 3 percentage points to 4 percentage points is really a problem I don't think anybody perceives us to be targeting monetary aggregates anyway; we certainly don't We take an economic forecast and then pick [monetary growth] numbers that we think are roughly consistent; and if they don't work out, fine So, I don't think that violates anything in terms of what I perceive we're doing here and what I think the outside world thinks we're doing So, that's where I come out   I forgot to say that I wouldn't rebase either Sorry to interrupt   Peter, did I understand you correctly? In the early part of your report I believe you said that the continued sensitivity in approaching open market operations most recently was largely due to the shift in policy and the uncertainties that surrounded that, not to any other factors   Right   Yes   I was surprised that the implication of alternative A is that it could be implemented solely through open market operations In other words, it has a borrowing assumption of $100 million--I guess I had in my mind that frictional borrowing was somewhat higher than that   I would prefer alternative B on the short run, with a $250 million borrowings target Basically, my feeling is that there clearly has been a significant change in the thrust of policy, no matter how you want to look at it Interest rates, in terms of fed funds, are down 100 basis points from where they were in late September-early October And a dramatic shift now shows through, for a month anyway, in the growth of reserves and the monetary base So I would say, let's let that work I don't think any more easing is called for at this stage Secondly, and I guess perhaps more importantly, we already decided to make a move back to more normal applications of the borrowings target and I think, as Governor Angell suggested, we ought to take advantage of these stable conditions and complete that move now I understand what Peter said about the need to be sensitive in the short run--letting the policy change show through--and I think that is appropriate But I think now we can move back and we ought to get that done I really think that the markets had become quite accustomed to dealing with that, and the fluctuations you got in the funds rate tended to be on the last day of a two-week statement period I just don't think that's a problem in terms of conditions So I would move back to that now I would indicate in the directive that we were doing that--I wouldn't have language in there in terms of continued flexibility If there were agreement about that, we might even have to deal with that lead-in phrase ""taking account of conditions in financial markets"" on line 108 The other thing I would do in the directive is, in the lead-in I think we'd have to say maintain--or whatever we're going to do-- maintain/increase/decrease ""the degree of pressure sought in recent  -56-    2/9-10/88  days"" I think it should be worded in that fashion probably; to me that usually conveys that there has been an intermeeting movement Finally, I take heart in the stability in the foreign exchange markets, as you do Mr Chairman, and I think there is some significance to it I take heart in that, but I don't want to do anything to test it I think we ought to take it and be happy we got it, but not press our luck on testing it in any fashion   Well, I'm not sure I necessarily agree with that   I guess I can believe that there never will be such a thing as normal--where it's a totally stable, predictable, relationship All I'm saying is that in some of these cases where we have missed, one of the reasons it might have run low--and I think this was said before--is that we have been unwilling to force it toward the end of the [reserve maintenance] period And I'm just saying that a spike of a billion or two billion of borrowing on the last day of the two-week statement period generally is not going to be disruptive My understanding is that $250 million is roughly consistent, even under present conditions, with a 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent funds rate And I would be quite comfortable with that   Oh! My long-term is alternative II, but I'd do 4 to 8 percent for M2   I think what ought to be conveyed to the market is that one easing took place here They're going to see that Just today we had a period ending that way; they're going to see that low borrowings number; there are already feelings around that some easing has taken place I think one thing that the directive ought to convey is that there was one step; I don't think you want to somehow in the language create the impression that a step was taken and then a subsequent step was taken today   If it doesn't, we have a problem with the last policy record "
3382,1988-03-29," I favor the normal operating procedures, pre- October, without the additional flexibility The reason I say that is that, in my mind, we've gone as far on this spectrum as we can go toward funds rate targeting And for a lot of reasons, all of which have been said--political, the relationship of the funds rate to our economic goals, and so forth--I would rather look at our business as being defined in terms of reserves, not interest rates And frankly, even though it might be perceived by us as a subtle shift, if we begin giving Peter directions in terms of the funds rate, eventually that's going to become known And I think there's a point of intellectual honesty in terms of communicating that to the public I don't think we can do that and expect that it will not become known Then there will be an issue of why this change in procedures wasn't communicated  The final point I would make--it can be made even with what we're doing now, but even more so if we went to a funds rate target-- is that to be consistent with what has been done in the past, we certainly would have to go to a proviso on some aggregate In other words, you would have to have that balance in there Just as we now talk about a degree of reserve restraint, subject to fluctuation in the funds rate, if you went to a funds rate, it would have to be subject to some constraint on a narrow aggregate, in my judgment That's all I have   I want to comment on a particular area of activity commercial construction We had a group in recently and a couple of things came out of the discussion that really surprised me, in terms of psychology St Louis and the District in general have lagged the national economy in this area We have not had the overbuilding that occurred elsewhere, so I don't know if these observations are broadly applicable We kicked off the discussion by talking about the external adjustment process and what the implications of that were for savings and investments--to see whether these real estate people were seeing any pressures on the financing side And what we heard is that they are literally awash with money-- foreign money, insurance company money, [unintelligible] October 19 Nobody mentioned that there was a flow of monies into real estate because of inflationary expectations The other thing that we did not pick up in this discussion, which surprised me, was any sense of caution about the ability to build space, lease it up, and so forth Well, I shouldn't say that--there was one person who was somewhat cautious But the general mood was ostensible optimism Finally, I was surprised at what I heard on the inflationary front people on the building side said that they could still build things for what it cost them four years ago I asked specifically about steel Two people said that the one area where they picked up some sense of price pressure was on the operating side--that it was difficult to make the kind of margins they would like to make So, I relate that discussion  I also have some observations about what is going on with the takeover and LBO activity and so on Last night we met with an investment manager who was saying that junk bond spreads to Treasuries are as narrow as they have ever been historically, and the GIC market is very tight just because there isn't enough high yield product out there to satisfy the demand And I think to myself, here we are three, four months or so after October 19 and there is all this leveraging and speculative activity going on at a time when, frankly, I would like to see a little more caution  I think we are all comforted that consumer confidence has held up But at the moment there is a lot of liquidity out there I'm not saying that we provided it; I don't mean to suggest that we have been pumping in a lot of reserves But, if you look at the construction industry on the inflation front, it's kind of a tinder box waiting to go off If the inflationary psychology tips there, and that gets factored into interest rates, people will try to move very quickly to lock in financing and begin building before the inflation    3/29/88  hits I think it could create a surge in spending I am somewhat concerned about that aspect, and as I say, just in general about the speculative activity--the highly leveraged type of activity--that resumed so quickly after October 19 "
3405,1988-05-17," I've followed the moves that have been taken, but my sense is that, in effect, they are rather small following moves I think at some point we're going to have to step out in front of this situation if everything we've heard today is correct And that's going to take something more on the order of alternative C The timing issue has been talked about I would guess--and again, Mr Chairman, I think you did the right thing by moving within your latitude--that if you had the benefit of all this discussion you might have moved it a full 50 basis points, and we wouldn't get into two increments of 25 basis points Because of this view that I think we have to get in front and make a strong statement, I would favor ""C""; but I could certainly accept a ""B"" with asymmetrical language--$100 million now and $100 million later   [Unintelligible] because I think it tends to support [the view] that there is a desirability of having such a constraint Now, one argument you can make is one that was in the follow-up memo I sent around, and I think we've just witnessed it in our discussion And that is the difficulty of coming to grips with, in effect, targeting interest rates; it is difficult to deal with that process without some tool that enables you to take a longer-term view,  -18-    5/17/88  which I think the constraint does Don, having complimented you on your memo, let me just say--I'm not going to criticize--but I can't really say any better than it was said in that memo why I think this type of constraint would be desirable This is on page 10 ""Generally, periods of rapid growth in the base in recent years have been followed, with a lag, by a tightening of monetary policy In some cases (1983, 1986) these have been periods in which the Federal Reserve had been easing Greater attention to the base might have tempered the degree to which policy was previously eased, reducing the need for subsequent tightening, and damping the cyclical variations in interest rates, albeit at the expense of somewhat greater short-term interest rate volatility"" I think that in a nut shell makes the case right there Again, I'd say that just the short experience I've had here on the Committee would tend to support that  With respect to the question of targets versus a constraint, I personally would be much less inclined to adopt a base target Now, I think you could say that the base might have an advantage in that it is more directly controllable than any of the other aggregates that we presently target Its relationship to our ultimate goals of policy is not better And I guess I fear, and it's implied in Don's memo, that if we just decide here today, let's say, to set target ranges for the base instead of M1, we're actually going to hurt ourselves in the process If it is treated as the other aggregates have been--in effect, that we set the target but then we're willing to violate it--I think that could do more harm than good, frankly, to the credibility of this process So, I'm not saying there aren't any circumstances under which I would ever favor a base target, but I don't think this is the right time I don't think the econometric analysis could support that being the desirable thing to do  With respect to the constraint itself, there's a suggestion of a four-quarter moving average, which troubles me in this sense I think it basically defeats the purpose of what the constraint does, which is to put some real limits on how fast or slowly the base can grow in any one quarter Technically, with the 5 to 9 percent that has been used for demonstration purposes, if you will, with a four- quarter moving average you could have base growth rates of 20 percent, 20 percent, -2 percent, -2 percent, and back to 20 percent In effect, you could have the same kind of volatility and still meet the constraint and, I think, suffer the adverse economic consequences that that kind of volatility in base growth occasions Also, I think this four-quarter moving average would have some of the same potential problems as an annual target--namely, that if the base grew very slowly for two or three quarters, or very rapidly for two or three quarters, and you were approaching the end of the four-quarter moving average period, you'd be faced with a decision of whether to adjust the growth abruptly in the base to stay within this constraint, or to ignore it I think our experience has shown us that, typically, that's a hard decision to make And I think that, too, could undermine the credibility of this [procedure]  I guess there are two points I'd like to make in connection with this When I suggest this 5 to 9 percent range, or whatever, I'm not saying that it should never be ignored I think, in practice, it probably would be observed most of the time But there could be situations where we choose to ignore it and, as has been pointed out, those situations very likely would be associated with the behavior of  -19-    5/17/88  currency But that's something we can observe Our analysis on currency has indicated that where there have been aberrations in the growth rate, they have tended to be reversed within a quarter or two But if we had a situation like that, I think it would be related to broad economic circumstances that we would generally understand and could explain; and we could very easily justify violating the constraint But, in general, I don't think it would be violated The final point I would like to make is that I agree with the work that Don and the others did in terms of the nonborrowed base--that from the controllability point of view it would have an advantage I guess what I'm not so sure about is whether we lose something in a conceptual sense, because the base is something people are familiar with Do we lose something in the conceptual sense to go to a more esoteric concept like a nonborrowed base? I could live with either one, but I prefer the base and not the nonborrowed base; I'd live with the short-term controllability problem as, over time, I think it can be controlled I think that's all I would care to say right now, Mr Chairman   Frank, to some extent, though, there would have been reaction to the very slow growth of the base that took place all the way through 1981 and a good deal of 1982   Well, I know; but you can't just pick up on some--   That's all I'm saying   Frank, do you know what reserves would have grown at in 1986 to meet the constraint on a quarterly basis? The answer is 9 percent, 14 percent, 13-1/2 percent, and 12 percent And that would have brought us inside the constraint To me, that is very healthy reserve growth, taking into account what currency did And it may well have necessitated much less of a reaction in the other direction in 1987   It was 16 percent for 1986 91 percent in the first quarter; 166 percent; 193 percent; and 194 percent   Again, Frank, one thing I would point out is this difference between a constraint and a target If you were targeting the base, I don't know that you'd be setting a 4 or, as Don even mentioned, a 5 percentage point range And in my mind, there is a big difference If you widen that range out and you're only trying to pick up the excesses at the peak, that's a lot different than relying on a target The second thing I would--   That's correct Well--or you wouldn't allow it to get above it   Well, the only problem I have with that is that it just puts it in a category of things that don't really impact our policy decisions at all I don't think the targets have a heck of a lot of credibility either within this room or outside this room And I think what is proposed has the ability really to influence policy actions, at the extremes, in a very constructive way And I don't know that you get that with what you're suggesting It would be easier to explain; there's no doubt about it   Wayne, those numbers are simply for the sake of example What I've laid out is a framework I think it would be up to the Committee to set the bands, so that's quite--   Jerry, on those situations you commented on, I would just observe that those clearly would be situations, under the way this has been articulated, where the Committee could decide to violate it, and simply be obligated to explain it And I think in both cases--   I think there could be, Wayne But I think we're talking about a fairly extraordinary period--only two situations in eight years that might require that  -26-    5/17/88   Well, in a sense, I think that's good It would cause the Committee to think very carefully about whether or not we ought to be violating it If we do, consciously, then we explain it Right now when we violate a monetary growth range, we get into explanations of velocity I just don't think that that is something that is bought by the public on a broad basis It just sounds like you are talking your way around the issue with technical phrases and so forth   One thing I'd say, Manley, is that there's no way around it our business is money--whether we like it or not and no matter how difficult it is And I think people would generally agree that inflation is a monetary phenomenon   And, finally, I think in our discussion at the last meeting, people who have had a lot of experience around this table kind of spelled out the difficulties we have if we view our business as being one of interest rates and don't have some kind of a counterbalance based in money and reserves To do that just because of the inherent opportunities--   And that hurts again   Where are you looking?   What the proposal envisions is the average growth rate for the next quarter from the prior quarter's average Are you looking at growth rates, Mike?   Okay So, first of all, what would the first month in one of those quarters you were talking about imply in terms of level for the average of the quarter?   Well, let me put it in the context of where we are right now   Well, first of all, I think the staff would have some ability to project what they expected to happen in terms of the growth [vis-a-vis] what we were trying to hit as an average for the quarter There could be a circumstance where it would require some response reasonably early in the quarter If you look at where we are right now in this quarter, we are probably right at, or preciously close to, the level that would be permitted by a 9 percent upward bound   Okay But you just can't look at the monthly growth rates; I think you have to look at the level And, if I looked at these correctly--I'm looking at the St Louis base--we are roughly at where I think a 9 percent constraint would be, or a little below it So, you would have to be asking yourself at a meeting like this Should I be taking a step now to slow that thing down?  -31-    5/17/88   Yes   Right   I guess to the extent I thought about that part of it, I've just been looking at the average for one quarter in relation to the average for the next I would think you could do it well   Yes   Sure I would think that would be quite possible, wouldn't you Don? Not to make decisions--  -32-    5/17/88   I think there's an advantage to having something in that type of equation that relates to what we do day-to-day in carrying out monetary policy "
3428,1988-06-29," I noticed in one of the recent daily wires that staff were somewhat surprised about the increase in demand deposits and the reserve data I guess it's in this current period Any feeling as to what that's associated with and what's driving the--   I don't think the local District numbers provide a lot of insight; they're very much in line with what's going on nationally--somewhat stronger manufacturing growth, somewhat weaker residential and nonresidential construction But, particularly in the nonresidential sector, we were late to adjust; it was quite strong while national figures were turning down  On the wage side, the only thing I have to add pretty much mirrors what Bob Forrestal said I got this from  a major consumer durables manufacturing firm, and it really is that people see CPI numbers that begin to approach 5 percent His anticipation is that the pressure won't be very strong from labor; he's not seeing it yet And in my judgment, that would be the reason for this, here on the wage side  Nationally, our forecast is based on our St Louis model And what we've done is pick monetary growth--I don't know whether you call it appropriate monetary policy or likely monetary policy--that's consistent with what we've seen in '87 and in the first half of '88, which is M1 growth somewhere in the 4 to 6 percent area What that throws off in terms of numbers is something that's very close to the Board staff's forecast for the second half of this year But for next year we're considerably higher--about a percentage point--in terms of nominal growth and somewhat higher in real growth; we're a good 7/10ths of a point higher in terms of inflation, which is troubling, I think, particularly because of the kinds of things we're seeing now in terms of the behavior of the dollar and financial markets and so forth There's a risk that in the short run we could get lulled to sleep I think we need to be very mindful of that problem  But having said that, I guess I also have to say that in comparing this period, say, to the late '70s and early '80s, we're dealing with monetary growth rates that are roughly half of what we were dealing with at that time So, I'm not sure in a longer-term context that we have to do as much to accomplish the longer-run inflationary goals I guess I'm saying, in part, that I think what's showing through in our forecast are the effects of some earlier monetary policy actions going back perhaps to '86--some temporary effects and so forth And I think that the process of dealing with those building inflationary pressures in the longer-term sense has to be a gradual one In other words, it doesn't require the same kind of response necessarily that it would have in the late '70s and early '80s And I suppose we've seen that in terms of our actions now, because very timely, relatively modest, actions have had a considerable impact I'm not saying that it isn't going to take more  -21-    6/29-30/88  of that to deal with this problem we perceive of this temporary inflation getting built into wages But that's what our forecast shows   I favor sticking with what we have for '88 and alternative III for '89 And I'm inclined to agree with what Martha said about the market impact I don't think the markets place a lot of weight on this I think we are heading in the right direction and we ought to do that; but in the final analysis, if we had to violate the ranges in either direction I suspect as a Committee we probably would And I suspect that's how the market probably perceives this   The adjective ""provisional"" could be confusing because we talk about the provisional range for debt all the time  SPEAKER(?) How about ""tentative""?  SPEAKER(?) How about ""preliminary""?  SPEAKER(?) The statute says preliminary  SPEAKER(?) I like the word provisional   It is a good word I am just pointing out that we also use it in another context all the time for the debt range   On that M1 sentence--again, this is just a drafting issue, but we are saying that the behavior in relation to economic activity and prices will be evaluated in light of economic developments and emerging price pressures Somehow it seems redundant to me It's not a big point, but I think we could do a better job drafting this   That probably is a good way to fix it, Don   I would support what you have in mind I don't perceive the move on the telephone call--I guess it was last week--or what you're proposing now, as really pegging the funds rate What I perceive it to be is an intelligent move which the market really has  -49-    6/29-30/88  discounted--and perhaps it has discounted more tightening than, in fact, we've undertaken Not only has it discounted it, but it has discounted it very constructively, if you will, in terms of how markets are performing I think we would all generally agree that we're in an environment where probably more [tightening] will be necessary I perceive what you're suggesting here is that we take advantage of that and just validate a rate and a policy expectation that's already discounted in the market And on that basis I would do it In terms of the policy record, I don't know how we could communicate it in such a way that it doesn't appear that the Committee has in two successive weeks here taken two further tightening actions There's probably a way to handle it, in terms of words, so it doesn't come across that way I think that would be desirable And I would favor the asymmetric language   I think it's a good idea  SPEAKER(?) Yes, inflation ought to be first   What did this two-week period that just ended come in at?   No--I mean in terms of borrowing? "
3448,1988-07-19," I'd like to make just one comment I don't claim to understand what the psychology is in the currency markets right now, but I can imagine circumstances, if you have a lot of speculative activity, that if we were to move very visibly--and I know we're not discussing it right now--for example, with a discount rate increase, speculators might feel that that's going to be the best news they get And you could actually get dollar weakness out of a move like that, not further strength I'm just making that observation But, in general, the thing that concerns me, given this strength that we all seem to see here, is whether we can continue this pattern of sort of following the market with modest moves I don't feel particularly strongly about moving today versus moving a couple of weeks from now, but at some point I worry that we're going to have to move more forcefully And the longer we wait to do that, the bigger the stakes become, in a sense "
3470,1988-08-16," Mike, I wondered on the personal consumption expenditures, does the greater amount of floating rate debt--home equity loans as well as ARMs--in this cycle have a significant impact there?   Anecdotal information that I've picked up in some recent calls would tend to confirm what's in the Greenbook For example, I would describe retailers as guardedly optimistic August got off to a good start in the first week and then was somewhat slow in the second week, but I think that was felt to be largely weather- related In general, I think retailers feel that they've got their inventories in pretty good shape They don't feel terribly exposed and they are guardedly optimistic about the prospects here  On the manufacturing side, you pick up the sense of strength still in capital goods orders--backlogs, and so forth The commentary    8/16/88  on the raw material price increases over the last year or so is that there's still some evidence of difficulty in passing all of that along In the District itself, our numbers for the most recent quarter, which would be the second quarter, reflect what Bob Forrestal has described Some employment declines show up in construction, textiles and apparel, food processing, and the like But in general, we have paralleled the rest of the country I don't attribute too much to this weakness I think it has to do, as Bob said a while ago, with the fact that there's strength elsewhere as opposed to signs of imminent weakness in our District   I may be a little confused, but I think this is the third time we are discussing this, and it has already been resolved twice So perhaps it's already--   On the merits, I'll simply say I really feel strongly that it's in our interest to define our business as being in the business of reserves and not rates I understand the linkage between the borrowings target and the funds rate, but the funds market has automatically been extended to other markets And as soon as the public and politicians attribute to us having control over interest rates, I think we are on dangerous ground They do enough of that anyway So I think it's important how we define our business  Secondly, I'd say when policy is on the move there's going to be volatility in rates There's more uncertainty, and that's going to be the case I don't think it's a bad thing And finally, even when the market gets ahead of us, it's not necessary to validate what gets built in Now, I think it has made sense to do it where we've done it; and I've been in favor of that But, for example, as we sit here today with a statement having been made with the discount rate, I think we have the flexibility not to validate what might be getting  -36-    8/16/88  built in now and not give up any ground at all in terms of where we think we need to get Those are the thoughts I have   I agree with what you outlined, Mr Chairman, the $600 million and asymmetric language I feel strongly also that we are going to have to move again I'm particularly concerned about the very rapid growth in the last couple of months of the narrower aggregates And picking up on what Bob Black said earlier, I think that the nature of our implementation of policy is such that if the demands are there in the market for reserves we'll fill that demand at the given borrowings level So I think we can't be complacent that we've done enough, certainly But I also agree with what you said I think it's important to let the prior move get digested And I don't feel strongly that the ordering in the language has to be changed "
3494,1988-09-20," I want to make a couple of comments on projections based on a money-driven model and just what that looks like Essentially, I'd say the projections are very similar to those of the Board's staff There are some differences between the second half of this year and next year, but I would characterize the pattern as one in which inflationary pressures are contained, but not significantly reduced, over that 18-month period The projections I'm talking about are based on an assumption of 4 to 6 percent M1 growth And I guess the conclusion that I reached from looking at that--and obviously, this is the model output and then, just as the Board staff does, some subjective judgments are made--was that I'd be much more concerned about, say, money growth in June and July of 9 percent, than  -19-    9/20/88  I would be about August of less than 1 percent I think the general pattern is such that the same conclusion comes out in this sort of model--that the risks are more on the upside than the downside As far as the District goes, the report is essentially the same as last month We're still showing weakness relative to the rest of the economy and in some areas, particularly in industries like textiles and apparel, there are employment declines   I'm in agreement with that proposal "
3515,1988-10-17," Tom Melzer, here I just wanted to quickly ask what their remaining reserves are and how much $3-1/2 billion would augment them In other words, is there a prospect here of really catching the shorts and lending some support to the currency just through the announcement? "
3536,1988-11-01," I would favor it as well I don't have anything to add to the comments that have been made   I had a question that I guess would follow what Gary Stern was saying Some of the work done prior to the early 1980's would have indicated greater explanatory powers in some of the narrower aggregates I gather they are not candidates for this type of approach because of the instability in their velocity over time Is that the assumption?   Yes   Sam, I wanted to try to get an idea You mentioned the negative sentiment Is that backed up at this point by large speculation or not? In other words, I would think if there is this expectation out there that you've described about trying to hold things stable until the election that shorts would be covered rather quickly and we could be in the situation where despite the decline we've had, or maybe because of it, that there is not a big short bid in the market Do you have any sense of that?   So there's a good deal of short-term vulnerablity?   Yes   In our District, I've been reporting the last couple of times on a relative gap in employment growth vis-a-vis the national averages which has been somewhat surprising because our District is tracking [the national economy] pretty well In fact, in the second quarter we had the largest gap ever in the 30 years that this number has been looked at That trend seems to be perhaps reversing itself now, and we did have modest manufacturing employment growth and relatively flat nonag employment in the recent period In manufacturing, the areas where growth was noted are electrical equipment, nonelectric machinery, and chemicals In any case, in looking at this peculiar behavior, because as Bob Forrestal has been reporting and I have as well our activity really doesn't seem to be as strong as the national averages, we tried to figure out what was going on and some of it may be explained by a greater concentration in manufacturing in the District than nationally and services have been growing more rapidly nationally And secondly, there may be some seasonal adjustment problems But basically we haven't been able to explain or understand this fully  Reflecting some of the comments that others have made, the agricultural picture is a lot rosier than might have been anticipated at one time Corn crops came in better than expected; soybeans were higher than last year; the cotton crop was a 25-year record; the rice crop was good; the tobacco crop was the best in 4 years, so I'd say that generally the picture there is pretty rosy in the District Finally, in terms of credit demand bank lending has been relatively sluggish although we've noted a pickup in the third quarter Growth in commercial lending both in the most recent three-month period and over the year as a whole has been about 11 percent, and that's quite a shift on the commercial lending side over the last year   I'm in agreement with what you suggested, although I wanted to register a mild note of concern I have been surprised at the extent to which money and credit have flattened out since July and August I think it's a coincidence largely that it happened to be around the time of the discount rate increase; but then again, because of all the fragilities out there, perhaps the increase had quite an expectational impact I'm sure it also reflects some of the lags of what we've been doing; but if you look over the most recent three months or so, the thrust of policy as reflected by the monetary base, that growth has been relatively slow, and reserves have actually been shrinking I don't think it's time right now to do anything about that, particularly with the dollar under pressure, but it does concern me because I don't think by any stretch of the imagination that we have whipped the inflationary pressures that we've seen If we get way out of position, if you will, in the short run in policy--and subsequently we're forced to reverse policy very sharply for short-term reasons, it's going to make the long-term battle a lot more difficult to win So, that's just a note of concern I would support what you said  -46-    11/1/88 "
3553,1988-11-22," Alan--maybe this is a question for Peter Sternlight--I wondered if the market has perceived that we've been somewhere around $500 or $600 million of borrowing and then if a pattern of $400 million begins to show up, will there be any interpretations that somehow we are easing the degree of reserve restraint in the face of, say, weakness in the dollar and so on?   Yes   I would not personally be concerned about some spike in borrowings or the funds rate on the final day of a two-week period But I think that's comforting in terms of Peter's interpretation I would be troubled if the market interpretation were other than that "
3575,1988-12-13," Peter, what's in the market in terms of the confusion over borrowings? How are people interpreting policy right now, and how importantly do borrowings figure into that?   I also think that operations were handled very well in this period But I have the general sense that we are moving closer to a funds rate targeting regime, and I agree with the comments about the confusion that that can create internally and externally I think in general--and I believe for reasons that Ed Boehne was implying without saying--that it has helped us to define our business, if you will, as being reserves and not interest rates [even though we]    12/13-14/88  characterize changes in policy as changes in the degree of reserve restraint as opposed to changes in a target for a market interest rate I think that's helpful in deflecting political pressures and so forth, but if we continue to move closer in a sense to a funds rate target I feel we ought to be explicit about that But if we did, I personally would feel very strongly about having a different proviso than we have right now In effect, the borrowed reserves regime is targeting the funds rate, and then we have a proviso based on the funds rate that really can never be operative So, were we to go explicitly to that, I'd like to see, if we had had at times in the past some kind of proviso based on the reserve base, whether that would have given us the kind of balance I think we are looking for in the directive  I guess, finally, I might ask just a rhetorical question, and this is part of the confusion How are we going to describe what's happened in this intermeeting period where in my mind the degree of reserve restraint has been measured by the borrowings target that has been set? In effect, we are saying we really increased the degree of reserve restraint at the same time that the borrowings target has come down I think that puts the confusion in perspective If you describe the degree of reserve restraint in terms of what balances the funds rate, that's one thing But in my mind that's not really what ""degree of reserve restraint"" meant Why don't I just leave it at that? I'm not sure that's easily answerable, and I think I know how we can do it   I just had a couple of comments I wanted to add Jerry said one of them, and that is that the econometrics aren't really there to tie the funds rate to our goals, which I think is a very important point   And secondly, nobody's really said this explicitly, I think Gary alluded to it, but the funds rate is a procyclical target; and that's why I feel rather strongly that if we explicitly use that target, we need some kind of a proviso that is reserve-based   Ted, when you talked about sluggish exports, you didn't mention anything about capacity constraints My impression from some work one of our people did is that in key export sectors we are still in pretty good shape on the capacity side--electrical machinery, non-electrical Is that your impression?   I was afraid, when Bob was introducing me here, that I had better come up with a question Mike, you mentioned that in looking at the 1990 forecast you had not attempted to project any potential shocks The Chairman had mentioned one in terms of the currency shock If you had to list the likely candidates, what kinds of shocks would you think about in that context?   I guess this would be the first report in four that I've given where, for the latest three-month period and this one would include the period through October, we've had some gains in nonagricultural employment But those were quite modest, really, and primarily in the manufacturing sector In the latest three-month period, manufacturing employment is up about 14 percent over the preceding period In both residential and nonresidential construction on a year-over-year basis year-to-date, activity is down substantially, not quite double-digit in residential and about 13 percent in nonresidential Christmas sales in major metropolitan areas I would say--and this doesn't include this last weekend--are running a little better than last year In St Louis and Memphis, that would mean a nominal gain of about 5 percent Little Rock, and Louisville actually will have slight to moderate decreases on a year- to-year basis The general sense is that retail inventories are in good shape and there is not a lot of evidence of unplanned price cutting There have been price promotions, but they pretty much have been planned so far Also, in the retail area, while [there is] difficulty finding help, we don't pick up a sense that there have been a lot of wage increases in the retailing area One other anecdote I might pass on, is a large manufacturer of consumer durables; his general sense is that cost increases may have abated a little on the raw material side They are very difficult to pass on and are being absorbed in margins His sense is that basically this will continue to keep a lid on wage pressures in that particular area And I guess that's the general picture there, although it certainly is not surprising given what we see on a broader basis in that sector   I saved my policy comments until now, and I discovered at the end of the other discussion that I may be the only  -54-    12/13-14/88  one who hasn't commented on policy My view, basically, is that I'm concerned about inflation I think it's too high and I think it will probably go somewhat higher in the coming year, so I don't disagree with that view But I also feel, given the restraint that we've exercised over the last two years in general, that inflation is not going to get away from us I take some comfort from what's going on with long bond yields, as some people have mentioned And I think we have to put the inflation in a longer-term perspective in a sense and say that to some extent the seeds for the inflation we are looking at now were sown in 1985 and 1986 when we had 12 - 15 percent growth rates in money And I think to attempt to wring it out all at once-- and this is consistent with some other views that have been expressed here--to try to deal with that too aggressively is just going to take us off the track as I mentioned at the last meeting of really making long-term progress on the inflation front And if you take a reserve or aggregate base view of what Don was expressing earlier in terms of real interest rates, I think the course we've been on particularly in the last 6 months or in the last 3 months, and particularly where we've had virtually no reserve growth, incremental tightening at least viewed from that perspective could lead to negative reserve growth that is going to hit the economy a lot harder than people may appreciate  So, what I'm saying is that in general I've been quite satisfied with the course we've been on, and I wouldn't advocate substantial additional tightening at this time I would certainly build into what we are doing what is in effect discounted in the market In other words, I would definitely support being in a position where our degree of reserve restraint, however defined, would result in a funds rate of somewhere around 8-1/2 to 8-5/8 percent at this time And I wouldn't object to steps that might lead that modestly higher But basically I've been satisfied with the degree of restraint and, I think Bob Heller said it right, our primary concern has to be inflation So, I'm not reacting to what we might set off in this area or that area [of the economy] and we ought to worry about that and that should hold us back What I really worry about is a very volatile path of policy that in effect makes our long-term job harder We are coming off a very difficult period I think every- body here appreciates that in the 1980s and maybe the experience in 1985 and 1986 was sort of the last chapter and that to the extent that we can stay on a relatively steady sustained growth of monetary stimulus, I think that would be most constructive I'd hate to see actions that would disrupt that So, implicitly I would not favor a discount rate increase at this time   There's no gentleman here! "
3599,1989-02-07," Mike, is the main difference in terms of your deficit assumptions--I forget what chart that was on--   Second chart Is that based on the difference in interest rates--primarily that 63 percent or whatever the former Administration had been using versus what we are projecting?   One thing that strikes me in looking at this-- and to some extent I agree with Bob Black that it's hard to absorb all the implications of these alternative forecasts--but you get the feeling that maybe our economic policy mix is really not what it ought to be And that sort of puts you in a fog I think this is a rhetorical question but, is there a way of positioning what we're doing that puts us in a better posture in that regard? Because there are a lot of things that come through in this that we could get blamed    2/7-8/89  for the [unintelligble] deficits, stalling out of the trade adjustment, you name it And the politics become very tricky   Our forecast this time falls within the parameters of the central tendency, which is a little unusual, I think, for us in recent years We're at the low end on real GNP at 2- 1/2 percent and at the high end on the CPI at 5 percent But we're modestly higher in terms of unemployment at the end of the year Looking out into 1990, our forecast would be quite similar to what we've seen from the Board's staff with maybe somewhat stronger real growth--at about 1-1/2 percent--and the CPI continuing to be somewhere around 5 percent So, no declines Looking out beyond that, even though we didn't do projections, I think we'd expect the CPI to begin coming down The big difference, however, between our forecast and the Board staff's forecast is that we've assumed Ml growth of somewhere in the 3 to 5 percent area to produce these essentially similar results, whereas the Board staff's forecast I think has Ml growth of zero in 1989 and I'm not sure about 1990 Based on that, I think I'd have to say that we view the risk in the Board staff's forecast to be on the down side in terms of real growth Using our methodology, if we drove that kind of assumption through [our model] we would definitely have weaker growth--in fact, a recession  In terms of what's going on in the District itself, we have seen some growth in nonag employment for the most recent three-month period and for the year For a long time I was reporting that our employment was actually declining, so there has been some pickup But [our growth rate] is still sluggish--about 1-1/2 percent versus 3 to 3-1/2 percent nationally Manufacturing employment has picked up a little more strongly but it's still slower than the national [average] Residential construction has shown some strength recently, as has nonresidential construction, particularly in St Louis commercial office building construction But on a year-to-year basis that's down quite significantly Reports on the retailing side indicate, as expected, when we plot [them versus] a year ago that nominal gains were about 6 to 7 percent I guess that's really all I have to say   You could swap the base for M3   I favor the 3 to 7 percent [range for M2] I have one comment Don, you pointed out the language in the directive and I just don't know whether it's appropriate for us to be qualifying all the aggregates in the context of the longer-term ranges I agree with what you said in terms of intermeeting [developments] and how you interpret them But to some extent, that sort of runs in the other direction In other words we have put M1 on the bench; and if somebody looks at this cynically, in effect, this language begins to put some of the broader aggregates potentially on the bench I think we already have the flexibility, should it become necessary, to miss the target ranges--and that would most likely be on the low end this year--and to explain it So I don't know whether I would add that language there; that is the question I would raise   Could we ask questions of Don?   I didn't mean to cut you off I just wanted--   Maybe I should!  SPEAKER(?) I hope this is a good one   Don, you talked about the instability of the borrowing function You mentioned that normally there's about a $400 million difference per 100 basis point difference--in terms of what's transpiring now versus what historical relationships might have produced My question is What is the potential for somehow really getting a surprise? In other words, I think the Desk has dealt very effectively with the kind of instabilities we have had, but what is the prospect of something much more dramatic than that in terms of a change in the propensity to borrow? I wonder because the spread may get to the point where banks figure, what the heck, we haven't had a problem with discipline at the window Do you worry about that at all?  -45-    2/7-8/89   So you're not overly concerned about that prospect?   The funds rate would be 9-1/4 percent roughly? What funds rate level would that be?   Slipping back from what level?   9-1/4 percent?  SPEAKER(?) 9-1/8 percent   Yes   Well, first of all, I'd like to make up for that rude question before I'd like to reiterate the position I stated earlier first of all, I think inflation is too high; and secondly, I think it's going higher On the other hand, I don't think it's getting away from us or that it's going to get away from us if we stay on this course of monetary restraint that we've been on In addition, I feel that the only shot we have at long-term price stability--and I would agree with Lee that that should be our goal in the long term--is if we can get there with a more or less stable real economic performance In other words, I don't think we're in a situation now where it will be productive in terms of the long-run inflation fight to run too close to the line in terms of a recession  In formulating this view I think that, in a sense, it's all too easy to ignore the narrow monetary indicators; that's not something that gets a lot of discussion around the table As a result, there's a great temptation for [unintelligible] most recent numbers we see and so forth Obviously we should be looking at those But I think at inflection points that can really result in procyclical policy, in easing too long or tightening too long Having said that, if you look at the reserve base and M1 as well as M2, we've been looking at slow growth rates for two years with further slowing in the last six months or so--and particularly in recent months In the fourth quarter we had reserve growth that was barely positive; I think the Bluebook showed that in the period from November through January we were actually looking at a negative growth rate of 5 percent And the Board staff's forecast is assuming 0 percent reserve and M1 growth for all of 1989 Now, in my own view, that kind of policy is very restrictive and I think there's a reasonable likelihood that that will put the economy in a recession in late 1989 or 1990 As I say, the reason I'm concerned about that is that the response in the other direction is going to put us so far off of a sustained path of monetary restraint that it could take us years to get back to the position I think we're in right now I want to be clear on this I'm not afraid, in a sense, to take a recession if that's what we have to do I don't think you ever like to do that, to make that judgment But obviously if things have gotten out of control, in the end we have to be willing to run that risk for the very reasons Lee said And it becomes difficult later But, as I said, I don't think that's where we are There has been a lot of discussion but it seems that important financial markets don't think that's where we are either Otherwise, why would the dollar be doing what's it's doing, and gold doing what it's doing, and long Treasuries doing what they're doing?  My final point, which is more or less an aside, is that I think the FOMC has done an excellent job in this period in terms of moving early But I wouldn't necessarily say that we have led the markets I simply want to point out that if dramatic additional tightening is undertaken at this time, we certainly don't have the fact that the markets are calling for it The constituencies, if you will, that are represented there are supporting it In a dramatic move here--and I know that's not really on the table--in effect, we would be really stepping out in front, which I don't think we've done Obviously, in pursuing a path of tightening there always are going to be constituencies that are against that, as Governor LaWare referred to before But in this case where investors feel inflation is getting  -56-    2/7-8/89  away I just think one is in a better position--if one is responding to pressures either in the foreign exchange markets, presumably backed up by our foreign trading partners, or behavior in long-term securities markets--to move against that background Obviously, there's the chance of doing that too late and never catching up; I understand that Anyway, that would lead me to a position where, really, I would support ""C"" as stated--not ""B"" as stated   I figured I would "
3625,1989-03-28," Mike, I wanted to ask if you had any insight into what's going on with short-term business credit--that there's some strength apart from the LBO situation   Thank you   It's not a problem; we even had a foot of snow three weeks ago I think Roger might have something to say about that In terms of the District numbers, the most recent reported activity is very strong both relative to what we've been seeing lately and also compared to the national numbers In general, the more recent anecdotal information would tend to confirm that The general sense I get is that orders are growing, albeit at a slower pace, and that there is some weakness in the consumer area but the commercial area is still quite strong In particular, we're seeing strong manufacturing employment growth and the industries that you see there are transportation, textiles, food products, and chemicals On the transportation side--just picking up on what Bob Parry said--a fellow from mentioned to us the other day that they have a five-year order backlog in commercial aircraft and I think half of  -27-    3/28/89  their workforce has about an average of one year's experience on those particular assembly lines He did go on to say that the order backlog includes options--I think they call them reservations--so that some of that could fall away On the textile side, where we've seen some strength as well, a textile manufacturer who had just returned from the Far East mentioned that, looking at Korea for example, between what's happened to their currency and wage rates domestically in Korea they're looking at cost increases of 25 percent in manufacturing there And to a lesser extent that's happening in Hong Kong and Taiwan So, in particular types of products the United States is much more competitive  In terms of other insights of an anecdotal nature, the general sense I get is that people--whether they are in a commercial business or even in a consumer business--really feel that they are under a great deal of margin pressure Raw material prices are up a lot, as somebody said, over the last year I think the increases have slowed down recently There is some sense of potentially growing wage pressures And certainly in businesses where they're selling to original equipment manufacturers there is still a great deal of difficulty passing along price increases But they will try to work both ends of the costs savings, passing along increases where they can  In terms of growth in orders, clearly the sense I got is that [the rate of] growth has slowed down in the last couple of months but orders are still growing I've heard of no cancellations as yet, but reading between the lines I sense a little anxiety about the possibility of cancellations In a similar vein on receivables, one consumer products company mentioned that they are really taking a very close look at their receivables, which have been growing; and they noted that now 20 percent of the companies they sell to have been involved in LBOs So, they view the quality of their receivables as really quite low and they are looking at that carefully  On the national front, my observation would be--just going back a month ago--that our forecast in terms of the result was very close to the Board staff's but it presumed roughly 4 percent M1 growth over the forecast period Clearly, to the extent that we have very low money growth, people who prepare [our forecast] have become increasingly concerned about whether or not things are going to work that way In a sense that leads me to a bit of concern, to the extent that in our discussions here we tend to focus on current inputs and whether or not we see weakness and how we try to trade that off against price pressures In a sense I think there's a trap in that process in that it doesn't really take into account some of the inherent lags in policy By the time we see the weakness it could be too late; and when we do see the weakness we probably will continue to see price pressure What do we do then? If you look back to the discount rate increase, to some extent the market in effect demanded that, in my view I'm not saying we wouldn't have done it anyway, but in a sense I don't think we had a choice because the perceptions out there were basically that we were going to respond to these short-term inputs So, I think at some point we have to introduce into the dialogue something else to look at that can be a guide In general, I would just urge that we not ignore what's going on with the aggregates We all know we set a target on M2 and we know where that stands it's a little below the lower end of the cone I'm sure you  -28-    3/28/89  all recall my proposal for a [monetary] base growth constraint In the fourth quarter that grew at less than 5 percent, which is what I suggested as a lower bound; this quarter it's probably right around 5 percent I took a look at reserves and I was interested in what I found there If you go back to '79 we've only had two quarters over that entire period of negative reserve growth one was the fourth quarter of '88; the other was the third quarter of '87 And as you know from the Bluebook, we're putting together a second back-to-back quarter of negative reserve growth of fairly substantial proportions In any case, I just think that as we contemplate policy actions we have to consider not only what's going on in the economy currently but also some gauge of the thrust of our actions and the lagged impacts they are going to have   My preference would be for ""B,"" symmetric I can certainly live with what you suggested, Mr Chairman The other point I would make, consistent with what I was saying earlier, is that I'd be a little concerned if we reacted to a single number in the intermeeting period It may be that the markets force our hand and we have to do that But I think there's going to come a time when--and I don't know how this will be achieved--there will have to be something else on the table so that when we decide it's right to start moving, the markets aren't sitting there saying, well, where's the Fed With respect to the M2 ranges, I don't know whether we have confidence over a long period of time that if we stick with the lower end of the ranges that that's going to contain inflationary pressures I just think at some point we've got to get out of this mode of the expectation that if a bad number comes out, boom, the Fed ought to be there doing something right then And if we are not, all the markets [unintelligible] That's a very difficult thing to deal with but it does trouble me And, in my judgment, just not moving in response to a number won't solve that But I think we're getting to a point that we ought to be worried about trying to break that "
3652,1989-05-16," In the District we continue to see some relative strength in the most recent three-month period that we have numbers for, both in nonagricultural employment and particularly in manufacturing employment But a lot of that strength was in the early part of the period and some weakness has started to show through in the last couple of months In autos, which is a big industry in Missouri, both GM and Chrysler have announced four- or five-week shutdowns when they do their retooling in the June-July period as opposed to a normal week or two Also, a consumer durables manufacturer, an appliance manufacturer, apparently eliminated a third shift some time back and now there is talk of going to a four-day workweek because of softness in that market Residential construction has been flat, a bit better than nationally We've had particular weakness in nonresidential construction There was recently a strike of operating engineers in connection with which 20,000 of 30,000 construction workers in the St Louis area went out That strike was settled in about two weeks with total compensation increases of about 2 to 3 percent in salary and benefits  In terms of our broader view, our forecast for the year is very similar to the Board staff's in terms of the outcome, although it is based on 4 percent money growth We've become increasingly concerned that, with virtually no M1 growth since July of last year, the risks of recession either later this year or early next year are becoming considerably greater Also, I have the same impression that Manley described before many of the private forecasters who use interest rate-driven models really have an interest rate scenario of rates coming off in the latter part of this year to achieve the soft landing that's in the Board staff's forecast   Don, two questions One If you look over the last year or so how good have we been at projecting future M2 growth?   My second question is As people rebuild their balances, what implications do you think that will have for the real side?   This is tough one I looked back before I came to the meeting; since December, I think, I've been expressing my concern about the aggregates What I am struck by at this meeting is this sudden shift in the outlook and perceived risks and so forth that even 6 or 8 weeks ago didn't seem to be very apparent And what I worry about is that if we wait to see signs of recession, given the lags in the impact of monetary policy, it's basically going to be too late In terms of money, we've talked a lot about the short-term aberrations; but we're really looking at a pattern of monetary restraint that has been very tight for a long period of time Certainly, the technical aberrations may add to that somewhat; but I don't suspect that's the whole issue To sit here hoping for a bounceback--I don't know That to me sort of smacks of looking at current indicators and making the judgment; and I think ultimately we're going to get trapped  Now, I continue to think that the major problem we face is inflation But I don't think it's going to be any easier to deal with if we destabilize the economy through a monetary policy that's too tight In fact, I think the response will be such in terms of monetary growth that it will make the long-term problem even tougher I don't believe in strictly targeting monetary aggregates but I do think in the extreme we've got to observe them, in some sense And I think we're at an extreme at this time So, where I come out is that I would favor slightly less pressure on reserve positions In other words, I wouldn't move all the way to ""A"" but I'd be willing to let, say, 25 basis points show through here I think that's really quite consistent with the approach we've taken to policy We haven't been taking a big risk approach such as ""We're going to wait until we're  -45-    5/16/89  sure that we're at an inflection point and, boom, move it 100 basis points, or whatever"" We have been gradually adjusting I think the risks of recession as they relate to the inflation problem are really quite significant; and I think we ought to be moving earlier to try to get those aggregates growing again In terms of market expectations, there's no question that there are risks involved if we move slightly in one direction and then have to reverse That could create some confusion But I think we ought to put some weight on the long-term monetary targeting procedure that we go through each year; we could point out that we're falling below the range and we're taking some action to try to get in the lower end, but we intend to run money for a long period of time near the lower end to contain inflationary pressures So, I think it's doable I wouldn't view a move like this as an irreversible move that somehow says ""That's it; we've thrown in the towel on inflation"" I personally think we could deal with that "
3664,1989-05-31," This is Tom Melzer in St Louis My view hasn't changed; the reason I didn't express it is that it's essentially the same as it was at the last FOMC meeting I have watched the data come out in the meantime and sometimes they give me greater confidence that that's the right view and sometimes they raise questions I think the data have been mixed I made a couple of contacts today One was to a major national retailer who said that April sales were very good He said sales were strong, and this [assessment] was based on broad geographic evidence across the board   April was very good and May was good up until Mother's Day and then it went dead   Well, this is stores that I'm talking about and for them it has been sluggish since Mother's Day; particular weakness was noted in discount stores In June they expect sales to start out sluggish I also talked to a major electrical equipment manufacturer; they sell electrical equipment to manufacturers and they are also in retail The capital [goods business] has declined and they noted particular softening in the retail end Their sales year-to-year are down They are not looking at layoffs but certainly are reducing overtime and possibly the workweek there Their capital goods business is still very strong They're not getting [unintelligible] order backlogs anymore but they have leveled off at very high levels; they have a little anxiety about cancellations, but that still looks okay And export growth has softened but it's still relatively strong--in the double-digit area In any case, my view is the same as I expressed at the FOMC meeting I would have no problem waiting to see the employment numbers and some additional data, as you've suggested "
3694,1989-07-05," So move   In terms of the outlook, our money-driven model ends up with a pattern very similar to the Board staff's forecast--in other words, slowing real growth and inflation leveling off over this year-and-a-half period The main difference is on the real side where we have considerably weaker real growth--roughly 1-1/2 percent for this year as a whole and 1 percent for next year But in terms of the deflator our numbers are within a tenth or two of what the Board staff has The only other thing to mention is that our forecast assumes, as does the Board staff forecast, a reacceleration in money growth in the second half of this year and continuing on in the next year  As far as the District is concerned, our numbers show this continuing pattern of slowing that has been mentioned Non- agricultural employment growth is slower than the national average It's interesting that even though the unemployment rate is coming down the District rate is still somewhat higher, at around 62 percent But the labor force obviously is growing very slowly Manufacturing employment, in contrast to the national picture, has really held up with other employment growth We're not seeing the relative weakness that shows up nationally there However, there are some industries where there is a slowing or, in fact, declines in employment in the auto industry employment growth is slow; and there have actually been declines in food processing, electrical machinery, and printing and publishing The one area of notable weakness is nonresidential construction where in the most recent period for which we have data, the 3-month period ending in May, we have a decline of about 20 percent compared to the prior period Again, I think we have just gone through this cycle quite a bit later than some other parts of the country in terms of the nonresidential construction As far as [unintelligible], I don't really detect the same shift in tone as some others have mentioned Certainly, people will acknowledge that there has been a slowing, but in the contacts I've had I have not picked up this concern about possible cumulative weakness  -22-    7/5-6/89   I think Gary and I were reading off the same sheet of notes In a long-term sense, I'm in sympathy with alternative III Eventually, we've got to get those ranges down But  -38-    7/5-6/89  I don't think this is a time right now when we need that announcement effect In other words, I don't think our credibility in terms of commitment to price stability is in question now And, as some people have pointed out, there's a risk If we take [the ranges] down now and go back up we have actually adversely affected our credibility Secondly, we have some evidence to indicate that it would be hard to hit them; we may be right at the upper end And I agree with what Gary said that's where we really hurt ourselves If we set the range and then don't meet it, I think that could have an adverse effect In any case, I come out waffling between alternatives II and III, basically And I think probably the best answer is to acknowledge that uncertainty just by adopting the '89 ranges and refining them in February   Don, in the Bluebook and in some comments yesterday and today there has been a fair amount of discussion about what the market has built in, in terms of expectations I don't view this as particularly unusual--that at the time policy is perceived to be on the move for the market to get ahead of itself--or particularly damaging if the expectations are not ratified Would that be consistent with your view of the past? This isn't particularly unusual is it?   Well, I'd be cautious about the extent to which we let that influence what we do; that's mainly what I'm saying   I agree with what you suggested I think caution is appropriate for the reasons that Lee expressed before If we fall into the trap of short-term fine-tuning it could be very disruptive in the long run So, I think the caution is appropriate and I think the symmetrical language conveys that as best we can "
3719,1989-08-22," does that just largely give them reserves? I guess it gives them the appearance of more fire power?   Peter, when does this need to drain reserves end? In other words, how soon would you expect that? Generally, funds have been trading a little below 9 percent When would you expect them to trade at 9 percent or above? And what have market participants discounted? Normally, they expect the funds rate to be soft when you have that need to drain   I just wanted to ask about durable goods orders Did they come out this morning?   Let me start off with the District The picture there is still a tad weak We have had nonagricultural employment declines in the most recent quarter of about 1-1/2 percent That also spreads to manufacturing, which relatively isn't as weak; but still, there was a decline of almost 1 percent There was particular weakness in the construction employment area and, on the manufacturing side, in textiles and apparel I just want to pass on a couple of anecdotal comments One thing that has surprised me with the general weakness in the District and nationally is that when I talk to business people I have not yet, until recently, run into anybody who is terribly alarmed Yes, things are slower; but generally they are not terribly concerned about recession and that sort of thing  a major manufacturer of consumer durables and for the first time about a week and a half ago he laid out a somewhat different scenario Of course, demand there has been quite weak for some time He said the initial response of people was to try to sell their way out of it, in effect, and maybe cut back hours a little Basically, he doesn't really see that working and he thinks that we're now going to get into a phase of perhaps more layoffs, curtailment of capital expenditures, and so forth, as the difficulties of selling one's way out of it begin to sink in The other observation he made, which really runs to some extent to this real estate discussion Jerry was describing, is that they have two major [sales] channels homebuilders, which have really been soft for a while, and then retailers They are noting particular weakness in both; and in the retailing area, considerably more credit problems are surfacing And that, of course, will spill back into the shopping centers, which I think is one commercial area that has been notably overbuilt Another piece of anecdotal information on the homebuilding side the reports we get would tend to indicate that some of the pickup that's evident in the broader numbers is being seen in the trenches in our area as well The second quarter was better than the first and July is showing continuing improvement  On the national picture, I would align myself with those who generally are pleased with what's going on in the short run In that connection, I would not be inclined to overreact to one month's data of somewhat stronger real numbers I still think, as Jerry pointed out, that we have one heck of a challenge in front of us in terms of bringing inflation down; I don't know exactly how that's going to happen but I do think it's going to take some time To pick up on another thing that you were saying, Jerry--your observation that you are skeptical as to whether this forecast through 1990 will actually work out--it just seems to me that this slow growth will, in time, begin to wring out some of the excesses that you described In other  -34-    8/22/89  words, the pressure is there but it's building up much more slowly than people expect What I hear from people I talk to is an expectation that we've reached an inflection point, that policy is going to ease, and that somehow the floor is going to be pulled out from under rates and people are going to be looking at rates 100 basis points or more lower than where they are now I just don't think that's going to happen; and I don't think people have adjusted to that These pressures are going to build up over time And I think the challenge we're going to face is one of not overreacting to the process of wringing out some of these excesses, which are going to be reflected in bad credits and the like because of the longer-run inflationary challenge that we still face   I favor ""B"" with symmetric language And I interpret ""B"" to mean 9 to 9-1/8 percent on the [funds rate] Is that correct? "
3746,1989-10-03," I have some of the same concerns and I have raised them, in the fundamental sense, as we had these votes But I think the Fed is in the fire and this is not the time when you fight the philosophical battle It almost has to be resolved when you are not in the middle of the program I guess the way I look at it is that if we were to get our backs up and refuse to participate at this point in time we'd, in effect, be embarrassing the United States in international policy circles And I can't think of a dumber thing to do in a political sense Even if we could defend it on price stability grounds, or try to, I think we would be painted with a different brush [It would raise the question] as to why we have this arm of the US government that has this kind of independence to pull that sort of thing I think that's quite possible Beyond that, in terms of market perceptions, I don't share your concern, Manley, about this intervention somehow really undercutting our credibility in a price stability sense I think it would be far more damaging if the Fed refused to participate here and that became a cause [celebre] Then market participants would be very concerned because of the split between the Fed and the Treasury and what that might imply in terms of US economic policy   Well, we have this study going on, but there comes a point where--purely from a financial point of view--looking at our balance sheet, we have more holdings of foreign currencies than is really justifiable in a financial sense I guess that would define a limit But I have some hope that if this proves not to work--and given the path the Chairman is taking--that the Treasury will change course I have some hope that rather than through brinkmanship--   As I say, I think there could come a time; but I don't think this is the time   The pattern in our District is the same as I've been reporting We have had sluggish employment growth all year both in nonagricultural payrolls and in manufacturing, and that pattern continued in the most recent period The only manufacturing sector that showed any growth was chemicals There was particular weakness in electrical equipment Whirlpool laid off 850 in Portsmith, Arkansas; GE has announced layoffs of about 800 coming up in Louisville; [unintelligible] Having said all that, though, I think we also have had very slow labor force growth Unemployment rates are still relatively low; St Louis just published an unemployment rate of 5 percent, its lowest in a number of years And there has been a pickup recently in nonresidential and residential construction contracts Even at GE, for example, the feeling is that this process isn't cumulative; they see a bottoming out here I think they feel that with these announced layoffs their production will be in line with demand They see next year as being relatively flat but they don't see a continuing deterioration One final thought--which I mentioned last time and it continues to be the case--is that I've been traveling around the District a little and it's very hard to find businessmen who are worried about the economic situation Nobody grabs you by the lapels and says ""This thing is going south and you better do something about it""   I favor ""B"" Symmetrical language would be my preference but I could live with asymmetrical toward ease I would just comment that several months back I was concerned about the degree of the restraint I'm not sure what to make of M2 But in terms of some of the narrow aggregate and reserve measures, I take some heart in the fact that they had a pickup in September and are projected to pick up [further] through the end of the year So, I think that the shift that Governor Angell was concerned about to some extent has taken place, at least based on those [data] "
3760,1989-10-16," Alan, this is Tom Melzer Peter mentioned that the reserve projections would indicate a need to take out further reserves I presume that we'll provide a larger allowance for excess or somehow amend the directive informally in approaching open market operations today   Okay "
3794,1989-11-14," Sam, when did we last have short-term interest differentials as narrow as we have now?   So move   [Conditions are] somewhat better than I have reported earlier Although things generally haven't changed much, this is the first time in three FOMC meetings that we've had an increase in nonagricultural employment in the most recent three-month period We still have some weakness in manufacturing employment-- somewhat less than I've talked about the prior two times--but the weak areas are food processing, electrical equipment, and transportation equipment The electrical sector we've talked about; I think that's largely appliances The auto area has been mentioned We've had some shutdowns a week at the medium and heavy truck plant in Louisville and about a month at one of the two Ford plants there Chrysler has in [unintelligible] and they have announced that that plant will be closed indefinitely after the first of the year--or actually, one of the shifts will be laid off after the first of the year It involves somewhere between 1600 and 1900 workers Interestingly enough, at their other plant, which manufactures minivans, they would like to add a third shift They made a proposal to the unions for three 10-hour a week shifts and the unions turned it down So, they could be putting some of those idle workers back to work if they can't get it done One other comment, which I think confirms what Mike said in the Greenbook in terms of other consumer expenditures ex-autos We recently had a luncheon with chief financial officers, and two individuals--one with a very large national retailer and another with a smaller retailer--confirmed that they view this environment as ideal for their business Things are going well and they are quite comfortable with how things are going; that was a bit surprising to me That's really all I have   Don, this is unrelated to the presentation that you just made, but I wanted to ask you what you thought the frictional level of borrowing was If it were necessary to inject more reserves, would you view it as a problem if the funds rate actually dropped below the discount rate?   I would favor ""B"" symmetric as well I could live with ""B"" asymmetric, as you suggested I have thoughts that I think are quite similar to those Wayne expressed First of all--and I mentioned this on the ""Call""--we've got to be careful in the short run about not overreacting to the current data We've been on the move for some months now with policy And if we made a mistake with policy I don't think we're making it now; we probably made it last winter or early spring But we certainly have taken the steps over the last five or six months, as I view it, to put policy back on an appropriate longer-term course The second point I would make relates to this longer-term view of what we've achieved over not quite a three-year period If you go back to early '87, we were looking at 12 quarters of trend growth of money that was almost 12 percent and we brought that down over this period of time to a little less than 5 percent That's reflected in the P* model It's very consistent with our longer-term goals and I would just hate to see us trade all that progress away by overreacting  My final point is that, to some extent, I think we have to be careful about how we characterize what we are doing Even though we all believe in it and understand the benefits of zero inflation, however defined, I'm not so sure how broadly supported that would be I've heard comments--not today, but around this table--about businessmen thinking the environment we have been in is just fine and why not just continue that, with inflation running 4 to 5 percent So I think it's important [to recognize] as we look at what's going on here that there are some forces operating that are much bigger than we are in this sense Now, it's not totally unrelated to monetary policy, but we've got this external imbalance situation that we're living with and that's imposing certain things on the economy If we don't run the type of policy we've been running, which is consistent with that, there will be a much more drastic adjustment imposed on the economy I suppose people could come up with a longer list, but to cite another example we also have an adjustment going on to the unsustainable credit growth that we have observed, really, throughout this recovery There are a lot of situations where people have geared their plans toward an economy growing much more rapidly than potential To the extent that we can lay out a broader set of issues --that it's not just the Fed single-mindedly pursuing this price stability objective and ignoring all else--I think it would be to our benefit I'm not sure how to do that But I think that's a risk of where we are right now "
3822,1989-12-18," I had one question, Mike You mentioned at the beginning that five years was a relatively short time frame in the sense, I think, that if you didn't get right at it there was no way you could slow money growth by enough, quickly enough I don't want  -12-    12/18-19/89  to read too much into what you said My question revolves around what would happen to the sacrifice ratio if the time frame were longer? I think I know what would happen to the expectational effects and the credibility and so forth But do you have any sense of that? If you made it 10 years instead of 5, does the sacrifice ratio come down materially?   So, it would be the same?   And then, if you believed it, it becomes more of a political question than an economic question--if the model were exactly right   On the first question on stability in the price level or a steady low rate, in theory I think stability in the price level is the right answer Practically speaking, if we could achieve a steady low rate of inflation, I think it would be a heck of a lot better than what we've seen for many years I think it's important in looking at the price level to look at it over long periods of time I wouldn't feel that if we picked the price level and we had a little inflation that that should be immediately reversed with deflation But that's, of course, implicit in that That's why as a practical matter I think I would find a steady low rate of inflation acceptable On the second point, if we don't have a timetable I think that we're too easily [unintelligible] I think we need it as a matter of self discipline and I think it could have positive effects on expectations But I don't object to what Jerry has suggested in terms of a general point in time when we would like to arrive there I have a difficult time in our trying to set out a specific path of how we are to get there because that runs into the risk of what John was saying--an embarrassment along the way and all of a sudden we will have been derailed altogether My general point would be--I've said this at earlier meetings and I've heard some other people say it today--that I worry about whether we really have the public and political support to do this now I don't think there's a broad understanding outside of this room--and John your comments would reflect that--of the costs of a continuing, say, 4-1/2 percent rate of [inflation]   Okay Well, I won't lecture on that But my only point is that, even though I support this direction and I support some kind of a timetable on it as opposed to [accepting] the general [unintelligible], I think we have to recognize that our timing is not great right now This is not a good time to be out beating the drum on zero inflation because we don't have the support and we run the risk of getting derailed in the short run   What I'm saying, Alan--I'm not tending in the other direction--is that we have to be politically smart about how we unveil this thing   Yes   That's exactly what I'm saying   No, you made my point much better than I could   It's a tough argument, but I think it's one we absolutely have to try to make In a sense, if we're talking about this and if we set this goal--and Wayne I think you touched on this-- we may be closer to that goal than we realize One of the great risks is that we trade away in the short run the progress that has been made in the last two to three years There have been some very good things said about how we make that argument Another element of it, in my mind--and I don't mean this in a self-serving way--is that I don't think we convey how we conduct operations properly There is this  -47-    12/18-19/89  general perception, and we help to perpetuate it, that we move interest rates around That's very dangerous because it leads people to ask us to do something about it to provide short-term fixes What's so striking about the analysis that has been done, particularly the earlier versions when we had no mention of interest rates at all, is the realization that inflation is a monetary phenomenon Obviously, this is not something we're going to get answered at the February meeting But if we embark on this course, or if we continue on this course, there has to be some gauge of policy that is somehow, I think, aggregates based and gives somewhat heavier weight [to the aggregates] in terms of our public relations I understand that we set the targets and so forth, but I think the general perception is that we set them but we're very happy to miss them [We need to convey] some concept of our willingness to compromise in the short run--that we are willing to provide more liquidity to avoid the risk of a recession and to overcome a shock or whatever, but that there are limits on that within the framework of achieving the only longer-term goal that a central bank goal can achieve I don't have a proposal I made one in the past and I'm not trying to beat the drum for that But as we proceed in this direction, I think there has to be something along those lines to put us in a more defensible position We can't defend it on interest rates; we will get buried every time [we try]   So move   In our District we went through a sluggish period in terms of employment, which I reported, in the second quarter The third quarter picked up; it was still slow relative to what was happening nationally, but we had employment growth Interestingly enough, October was particularly strong 43 percent growth in a month, with most of the strength in manufacturing construction and miscellaneous services I don't think one can read too much into one month but our economy still seems to be [unintelligible] It's not [unintelligible] In Missouri, we have the second largest auto concentration behind Michigan Interestingly enough, autos represent only 19 percent of our output in the District versus 12 percent nationally I realize that the business extends more broadly than that, but that is in terms of autos directly Chrysler has announced a shutdown of its number one plant in Fenton, which produces Daytonas and LaBarons, for a five-week or one-month period rather than the normal one-week shutdown That's not news; what is interesting to me, anyway, is that people who are idled in this fashion will earn at the lowest levels 65 to 70 percent of their normal wage and the higher seniority people will earn up to 95 percent So in terms of the impact on income currently, it tends to be minimal I've also talked from time-to-time about the consumer durables business We have a fairly heavy concentration of that And the pattern there was that through midyear billings were up about 5 percent and then in July they fell off quite [sharply]; they were down about 17 percent compared to the prior year But then for the months of August, September, October and now most recently November, they have been down about 5 percent in each of the months compared to the prior year So there hasn't been a cumulative deterioration there One of those manufacturers that I'm aware of is laying people off over the holidays for a longer-than-normal idling period--three to four weeks instead of one On the retail side, in St Louis I think the retailers are quite optimistic about the Christmas season They were running higher inventories intentionally going into the season and  -84-    12/18-19/89  they feel pretty good about the prospects They don't expect it to be a great year in terms of profits but in terms of buying it should be  On the national front, I just want to make one comment I don't think the general outlines of our forecast would be much different from what Mike and his people have developed I'm certainly struck by the comments I hear around the table in terms of incipient weakness The only thing I would say is that, in a sense, we anticipated that around this table six or eight months ago Policy was eased beginning in May; it was eased quite a bit And in my judgment, whether or not we sweep through this period--or however you put it, Jerry--is going to depend an awful lot on that bet we placed then and not on bets we make right now I just think we have to keep that in mind We all see the weakness; but don't forget that it was anticipated and steps were taken; and we do have that other goal that we discussed yesterday that gets jeopardized to the extent that we try to overcompensate   I come out essentially where Ed Boehne did Let me add another thought or two here One is that I don't think we have a lot of opportunities left to ease Now, that could be proven wrong What I would tend to look at in that regard is if the demand for money is falling out of bed and we're pegging the funds rate, we better pay attention to that So even though I don't favor easing now, I don't rule out the possibility that that may become necessary down the road But the way I see things now, we don't have many opportunities; I think perhaps you're implying that by moving to symmetric language But as things have progressed, I think it was quite appropriate earlier on to try to stay ahead of the situation, to anticipate and then move in advance I think in a sense we're probably beyond that now I don't have the impression that markets are expecting us to do anything and I think pressures will develop I know there are expectations over time that the funds rate will come down, but I don't have the sense that people looking at it right now in general would conclude that the Fed really ought to do something right now And given the view that we have very few opportunities left in this direction, I would tend to conserve them and not use an opportunity now Beyond that, my view is based on some comments I've made before I think we have made a significant adjustment in policy; I think the aggregates are growing now at rates consistent with continued expansion; and I'm concerned that a move in this direction at this time would make our [unintelligible] in terms of price stability   Could I make one other comment?   I would prefer to capture it in the description of the discussion myself To the extent that we can wean ourselves from moving these things around and having people draw up charts showing which one we put first, second, third, and fourth the better off we're going to be, I think   If we just leave them alone people will ignore them over time and I think they should I think the rest of the policy record captures the sense of the discussion   The second point is we-- "
3849,1990-02-06," In our forecast we have inflation about the same as the Board staff's forecast and somewhat less real growth-- actually relatively weak real growth--and somewhat higher unemployment as a result I would characterize it, just because of the approach used in our shop, as the lagged effects of prior monetary restraint In that connection, last July and then a year ago when we did the forecast and had to make an assumption about what we considered to be an appropriate monetary policy, it was rather a stretch in the sense that money growth was so weak We were trying to assume something reasonable in terms of 4 to 6 percent growth in narrow aggregates so that it was difficult to see then how that would actually be realized In contrast, this time around--for what it's worth--I think it's a little easier to make the assumption, with which I agree, that monetary policy looking forward is on a more or less reasonable course from the St Louis perspective  As far as the District goes, again looking back, our regional economy was considerably weaker in the first part of last year than the national economy But in the most recent quarters, and particularly in the latest three-month period, our employment is right in line with national averages in the nonagricultural area and reflects almost identical weakness in the manufacturing area We've had gains in medical and business services, finance, insurance and real estate, and in construction And the declines--and this has been the same pattern we have been seeing--are in electrical equipment, fabricated metal products, and transportation Maybe the addition to that list would be the fabricated metals as the weakness in autos has filtered back  You all know in the consumer durables area I asked him not long ago whether he  thought easier monetary policy would really help the problems in that industry and the answer was ""no"" He perceived the problems as demographic, which is the same thing that's affecting housing In the auto area we've all read that Chrysler has announced the shutdown of the No 1 plant in Fenton That will affect 4,000 workers, 2,000 more than had already been laid off; the second shift had been laid off indefinitely That closing will occur in September And I think I mentioned in the past that at the No 2 plant that produces mini-vans, where they're running just two shifts now, there had been a proposal  -15-    2/6-7/90  to add a third shift But there are different [union] locals at these two plants and the local at the No 2 plant didn't want to hear anything about integrating some of these other workers to put on a third shift So, I don't know where Chrysler will pick up that capacity There also is an expectation that Ford is going to repatriate some truck production from Brazil to a plant in Louisville later this year  In terms of the residential [construction] area, activity in our District has been essentially flat most recently compared to declines nationally There have been reports in the press of what people characterize as very heavy traffic in January and some better-than-expected sales In reports I've read, Si, we don't pick up quite the same negativism in terms of auto dealers; they were more positive about what went on in January and the prospects there That's just another perspective Nonresidential construction has been especially strong, largely because of the large paper mill in Arkansas; it's a $300 million facility where the contract was let in December Finally, just a comment on the defense area McDonnell Douglas is our largest employer and two defense programs are scheduled for cancellation; the Defense Department has put out the F15 and the AV8 But generally the expectation is that McDonnell Douglas will make this up with some aerospace contracts that they have and in addition--and I guess you can afford this, Bob--with moves in production from California to the St Louis facility So right now in terms of McDonnell Douglas there is not a lot of negativism about how the cutbacks in defense will affect the local economy, although there is indeed some uncertainty  The last comment I would make is that I've read some reports and I heard some comments the other day that lending standards clearly are being tightened as a result of developments in the S&L industry and elsewhere One person who is in the business of arranging financing for smaller companies mentioned to me that there's a view that the regulators are overreacting Now, I suspect the regulators are being used as scapegoats by lenders who may not want to make the loans, but that tap dance is beginning to develop a little out there   In terms of the broader strategies, I don't have any trouble at all identifying with strategy II, the tighter option As I look at the baseline, I think the progress toward price stability is really minimal over 5 years If you accept the P* model, it shows that when we get down to 3-1/4 percent or so we're stuck there Under that type of program I just don't see how we can get any benefits of credibility, assuming there are some benefits of that in reducing the cost I also think that we're unlikely to be able to sustain a program--and I know this is just a projection--of trying to keep the economy below potential for an extended period of time So, I favor the tighter approach there And, as the Bluebook observes, that logically leads one to alternative III in terms of the ranges Obviously, we're in a very tricky period here But, first of all, along the lines of what Gary was saying, I think the upper end of that range should be more than adequate to support positive real growth And I think it signals our intentions in terms of really moving toward price stability relatively gradually I think the 1/2 percentage point reduction in the M2 range conveys that We moved the ranges a percentage point a year ago I guess we're trying to trade off the perceptions of a number of different audiences here, but I think the most important audience--and the audience that is really going to determine what we're able to do or not do--is the market What I think is important is the markets' perception more broadly, including the foreign exchange markets, along the lines of what Jerry was saying yesterday If the perception is that we have thrown in the towel in terms of progress toward price stability, I think we're going to be dealing with much more difficult problems in the coming year than may be possible if we maintain that credibility I still feel that if circumstances develop where we're forced to violate the ranges because of some very adverse developments on the real side, we can do that and maintain credibility So, I would opt for alternative III   I favor ""B,"" symmetric There's no expectation of an easing of rates out there now and I don't see what we gain by creating one again "
3873,1990-03-27," The picture in the Eighth District is one of continuing improvement In January, for example, we had very strong employment in comparison to December Even if you take away strong growth in construction and in retail and wholesale trade sectors, which I think benefitted from the mild weather, other sectors grew at least modestly In manufacturing, for example, employment was up 52 percent and that included declines of almost 10,000 jobs in the automobile industry So, virtually all major industries had moderate to strong employment growth In both residential and nonresidential construction we continued to have strong growth in the most recent three-month period ending in January In the area of anecdotal evidence, we recently had a group of chief financial officers of major corporations in the St Louis area to lunch and the things that came through from that discussion were (1) scarcity of qualified labor; (2) a sense of growing pressure on wages; (3) a margin squeeze--the feeling that any easy productivity gains have long since been realized; and (4) the feeling that the recent increases in the dollar have not really presented a problem in terms of export activity Finally, and this is somewhat in contrast to what Bob [Forrestal] mentioned but I don't think either one of the views would be conclusive, I didn't pick up any sense of dissatisfaction with policy In fact, some people expressed a preference for a diligently slow, stable situation in economic growth So, nobody really is squealing about monetary policy being on an inappropriate course I think it's right to question, though, whether people really would support the price of bringing down the rate of inflation significantly from current levels  A final thought in terms of the general picture nationally I have felt that policy has been erring on the side of ease for some time and that we are in the process of giving up some ground in terms of our progress toward long-term price stability, however defined  -28-    3/27/90  So, I would agree with what the Greenbook says in terms of the need for some additional tightening I'm somewhat ambivalent about whether that needs to be right away I take some heart from the Bluebook forecast of a slowing in M2 growth I have some questions about what the impact is going to be in terms of the profit margin squeeze, the general pressures of leverage on the economy, and the credit crunch we've heard about, and how that all may [affect] consumer confidence So, while I think we need to move, I could be persuaded that it doesn't need to be right now   ""B"" asymmetric I could live with ""B"" symmetric   I don't have a colleague from Missouri   Before I make some comments, I had a question for you, Jerry Could you explain what you meant by the Treasury co- opting monetary policy if we weren't involved? How would that work?   I see it as an uncertainty risk, but we still have all the cards, I think But they're--   No, I understand   Yes, I think that's a good point   [Unintelligible] for us to ease or tighten if we don't want to in the short run, but the uncertainty would be damaging Let me just make my point I don't disagree with the general idea that we ought to be involved in this and we can bring a constructive influence to the table But I think we have to recognize that we have a finite institution here in terms of the resources and that there is a responsibility for these resources in a sense that goes beyond this room in terms of [Reserve Bank] boards of directors and--I don't want  -62-    3/27/90  to make this a government [unintelligible]--but there's a basic institutional question in terms of how we commit our assets and what the risks are associated with those assets Clearly, I hope we never get to the point where we have to draw that line in the sand But there is, I think, a line in terms of what is reasonable with respect to an ultimate commitment of the Federal Reserve and its resources to foreign assets  Now, I think there's another area where we ought to have a better understanding of some of the rationale for this and that is What is a prudent war chest to have on hand if we need some foreign currencies on hand? But that's a much smaller issue, in my mind And finally, I don't know what the implications would be if the Treasury went elsewhere to finance [their currency holdings] and how it would be handled in a government accounting sense But I'm a little troubled about the issue that some other people have mentioned--that if there is a large exchange loss and all of a sudden Congress and other people wake up to it then they will look to see how it happened And if it happened not only because we intervened for our own account but--under this somewhat questionable authority on the theory that it's an open market purchase--we also warehoused roughly an equal amount for the Treasury in what could be painted as sort of a secret transaction, I think there's a--   No, I understand that, but--   If somebody wanted to do a job on the Fed they would say that we really, through some sort of a subterfuge, financed this behind the back of the Congress and the taxpayers  SPEAKER(?) Absolutely   And that puts us in a position now where the American people [could] have this huge exchange loss   Could I just get in one final thought, which is simply that I don't view it as either we're in or we're out at this point I don't think it's reasonable to say ""That's it; we're not going to warehouse anymore"" But I think we really have to try to draw some ultimate line in the sand and then work very hard to get a different understanding with the Treasury I know you've been trying to do that but I think with that ultimate [unintelligible] power that Manley and Wayne were referring to To me it's not a theological issue We're charged with running this institution prudently I know volumes in the foreign exchange markets have gone up But the fact of the matter is there are not enough resources in this central bank or all of them combined to stand in the way of those markets for very long, whether you think [intervention] works or doesn't work And we have to understand what those limits are In my opinion that's a very defensible position and one we have to take In order to leave ourselves enough room and time to get it done, [we need] to get a better understanding with the Treasury on how this can be used and how it can't be used because I could very easily, on the course we've been on, see this going to $60 billion, $80 billion Who knows?   Could I just ask another question? What does the Treasury think we're doing at this meeting? Do they think we withdrew for technical reasons or do they know at this stage how fundamental these concerns are?   In view of that and of the fact that these are fairly substantial increases in the limits, it might help us--and I don't know whether you'd be prepared to do this or not--if you were to indicate that though we never say never this is pretty much an outside limit at this stage and that to go beyond this really would require some very careful consideration   My point--   Well, I didn't mean it to come across as a threat But on the other hand, they may well view this as just that we had these limits and an FOMC meeting was coming up, so as a technical matter we approved new limits   Yes And I'm not saying that you should say that's an outside limit But to the extent you were comfortable with it, you could say something to the effect that you're really not sure what kind of a reaction you would get going back to [the Committee for more] That's--   That might be helpful   It might be very helpful in influencing their behavior if they thought in terms of having this much left and of operating within that limit Having managed traders, I know how that works   How are warehoused currencies treated? Is that a Treasury obligation or is it a foreign currency?   Well, in answering that question on the $25 billion did you presume that it jumped to $15 billion as well or is that--? "
3906,1990-05-15," I would say that in terms of our broad view, we wouldn't be as concerned as the Board staff about monetary policy being somehow badly out of position here Our outlook is for modest growth, containment of pressures in the short run, and gradual long- term progress But we wouldn't envision the kind of tightening that's implied; in fact, I think it's much too early to tell If you look at page 5 of the Bluebook and what has been happening to money, credit, and reserve aggregates over the last couple of months, you have to wonder whether there's a significant tightening going on already with the funds rate at a constant level Again, having said that, I think a month or two is much too short a period of time to react to In general I think we've been well served this year by not letting very volatile expectations whip us around I think our ""steady-as-it-goes"" policy has been quite good  On a District basis, I would say we're growing modestly better than the national economy Even without auto workers coming back, we've had growth in manufacturing jobs On the agricultural front, the flooding in Arkansas has created some problems, although I don't expect them to have national implications I think some wheat crops will be plowed under and some cotton, rice, and corn crops will be late getting in But basically at this stage, there hasn't been a major impact On the price front, I haven't picked up much commentary about the minimum wage [increase] I did pick up some comments in Arkansas where firms have below minimum wage employees; they are complaining about the compaction effect on their salary scales and the fact that it has a much broader implication in terms of their costs than just on the people below minimum wage A couple of people said the way they are dealing with it is with gradual, phased-in price increases over the first six months of this year, so they aren't faced with a step increase in their prices around midyear One final comment Our large reporting banks in the three-month period ended in April have actually had a decline in loans outstanding It's in other categories There is still growth in real estate and C&I loans, but a decline in personal loans and big declines in some other categories   I wanted to go last so I didn't feel the pressure of others wanting to speak after me ""B"" "
3930,1990-07-02," Mike, on Chart 9, the alternative fiscal scenarios, I wanted to ask you just what happens in your model for the longer-term growth rates of money where interest rates are adjusted to keep output close to the baseline path? Is there a change in the model in the longer-term growth rates of money yet?   My point in asking and my general concern about this is that, basically, I would view a dramatic shift in fiscal policy as some sort of a short-run shock, and we can use monetary policy to try to offset it But we're going to be giving up something in the long run to do it and I guess the model would incorporate that in a sense with higher longer-term growth rates in money   One other question I had with respect to rates What occasioned the dramatic change in your assumption on the path of interest rates between this meeting and the prior meeting?   Thank you   In terms of our long-run outlook, we're right near the central tendencies in both years; we tend to be at the lower end in terms of nominal GNP, real GNP, and the CPI, and a bit at the higher end on unemployment The one comment I would make is that in 1991 we're looking for somewhat lower inflation, just a quarter of a percentage point from the lower end of the central tendency I would say that's based on the progress in the trend growth in money and the decline from double-digit rates in the 1986-to-1987 period to less  -15-    7/2-3/90  than 4 percent now Essentially, I think that kept us from overreacting earlier this year to the temporary runup in prices And it also influences us now in the sense that we have built such a good base here that I think there's some reluctance to trade away a lot of that Now, there's concern about the recent slowdown in money, but in general where I come out--and not everybody would agree with this--is that I'd need to see more before I reacted to that, particularly in the context of trading away some of this longer-term progress  As far as the District goes, the situation still looks pretty good right now We have had growth in nonagricultural employment in the most recent three-month period that's right in line with the national numbers and over the last year almost right on top of them Our manufacturing component is actually a bit stronger; it's growing sluggishly but that compares to declines nationally in the most recent three months and over the last year On the horizon, however, there are clearly some problems We have a lot of auto industry exposure in Missouri--in St Louis and Kansas City Chrysler has a shift that is scheduled to go out this fall and as I recall it involves about 1,900 workers And recently McDonnell Douglas has talked about layoffs; they have not made any specific announcements but the rumors are that 4,000 jobs in St Louis will be eliminated, and that would be 03 to 04 of a percentage point in terms of our metropolitan area unemployment rate The interesting thing about that is that I would attribute those layoffs solely to current inefficiencies That is, it may put them in a better position as contract cuts come a couple of years down the road, but basically this is dealing with current problems And I think it caught people a bit by surprise in that they weren't really looking for any winding down until 1992 or some time around then On the banking side, asset quality continues to improve in our District Nonperforming loans are going down; real estate problems have gone up a little but they are still well below national averages In St Louis, for example, nonperforming real estate loans are less than 2 percent, compared to much higher numbers in some other metropolitan areas On the agricultural side, the weather has affected the wheat crop We have had, of course, very wet weather It also has affected planting but I think corn is the only crop that would possibly be affected by that; soybeans and cotton are in pretty good shape  I wanted to comment on one other thing quickly We had a series of meetings a week ago with our pension fund managers I think it's dangerous to draw conclusions from a relatively small sample of managers, even though they're very professional, but what struck me was that I did not pick up from any of them a great deal of anxiety about the outlook Basically they are assuming a soft-landing type of scenario In other words--or I guess to put words in their mouths--they are assuming continued sluggish growth, a continued unwinding of inflationary pressures, and a gradual decline in interest rates I would say that, in effect, what most of them were doing was looking through current [profit] margin pressures, which are very evident, and the effect that will have on earnings They feel that a gradual decline in interest rates will offset that and that from a valuation point of view they will be okay The flip side of that--and we didn't ask this across the board but we talked to one group--is to ask what they would worry more about And I think in general they would be much more worried in a longer-term context about a resumption of inflationary pressures as opposed to some shallow recession Of  -16-    7/2-3/90  course, they were quick to add that once a recession started who knows whether it would be shallow So, that was kind of a soft question Generally, in the bond part of the portfolio there is usually not much of an interest rate bet; in fact some of them won't make any at all They just stick right around the Shearson-Lehman index in terms of their duration But there were two standouts, one on either side One manager is betting on declining rates and another on rising rates So, overall, there's a pretty neutral view there   No   I have a couple of general thoughts on this I would say first of all, in terms of long-run strategies, that I would be in favor of strategy II Generally, I think there is a lot more informational value in the ranges if we gear them to what we believe long-term trends are In other words, I get very concerned about [moving around] these ranges over time Given where we are and where we're headed, there is very much the prospect of ratcheting these ranges down at some point to accommodate some short-term velocity development and then having to bump them back up And I think that becomes very confusing Personally, I like to think of these ranges much as Bob Black does--in terms of where we want them to be in a long-term sense--and I'd move them gradually toward that I guess that view leads to two points (1) with respect to problems in the current year, I would [allow actual growth outside] the ranges and explain that and not reset them; and (2) as to the future year,    7/2-3/90 -37-  particularly with something like M3 which I think has limited value anyway, I would set a range that's reasonable in the context of what we think the long-term trends are, knowing full well that actual growth probably will miss it I'd telegraph that right up front and indicate that we are going to be putting less weight on it for that reason  The other point I would make is that while I'm in favor of strategy II, I don't think we have all that far to go If you take the number Bob Black threw out--around 3 percent--as what we might want to get in terms of M2 growth, that would assume roughly 3 percent potential growth in the economy, with roughly 0 percent velocity Taking that as the center point of the range, that means we have the potential of eventually getting down to 1 to 5 percent on the range Therefore, we'd be taking a pretty big bite out of what we have left if we ratchet the ranges down a full percentage point right now So, all of that put together would lead me simply to reaffirm the 1990 ranges And in 1991, I would ratchet M2 down by 1/2 percentage point and, if it is in a longer-term sense consistent with that, do the same with M3 and debt I look to the staff for guidance on that, but that's essentially where I am   I'd favor ""B"" symmetric but I could certainly accept ""B"" asymmetric as you specified it "
3952,1990-08-21," For the District, the most recent numbers, which are second-quarter numbers, show a decided shift Generally in recent months I have been reporting that we have been out-performing the national economy; in the latest period both absolutely and relatively there is weakness in employment and weakness in non-residential and residential construction In talking to our directors and others around the District, I have not picked up any sense that they have noticed anything dramatically different What's interesting is that, despite reporting that things are pretty much as I have described them in recent months, there is a lot more anxiety Last week I had our staff do a survey of business contacts throughout the District, which was rather interesting In general, it supported an outlook for continued, albeit somewhat slower, expansion for the balance of 1990 One surprising part of it to me was a good deal of optimism in terms of retail sales, which either met or exceeded expectations And those sales were obtained without unusual price cutting; their inventories were in good shape Basically, 7 out of 9 retailers contacted reported that their outlook was good or optimistic for the balance of the year   Just last week Now, we have relatively sluggish job growth and some layoffs coming in the aerospace industry --in St Louis in particular--and in the defense industry So, whether or not that optimism by retailers holds up in the face of slowing or maybe even declining employment growth and lower incomes  -23-    8/21/90  remains to be seen Based on this survey and the views of our people, in general we would expect weakness in autos and construction and some strength in services, agri-business, and mining That pretty much sums up the results of that survey  On a national basis, I would be in general agreement with what the staff has forecasted What's very tricky, if we come to grips with monetary policy, is that there's an assumption in that forecast of an essentially unchanged monetary policy in terms of the funds rate And, of course, given our operating procedure, an unchanged funds rate in a slowing economy could in fact create a tightening--from the perspective of monetary stimulus And I think that's something we have to watch pretty carefully Now, I've personally been encouraged by the pickup in money growth recently and what's projected for August and so forth, but we have to watch that carefully The other general comment I would make is that I think the July experience sort of showed us that we're not in an environment, given the concerns about inflation, in which we can try to lead the market lower I think we're in a position where we have to follow behind market expectations in terms of policy actions   I would agree with what you recommended here I'd make three points First, in this kind of environment, while I don't think we can rely exclusively on it, I really do think as Don Kohn suggested that we need to watch what money is doing because I don't think we can assume that an unchanged funds rate is an unchanged policy Secondly--I've said this before as well and I think Don suggested this too in his remarks--I don't think that we can pretend to lead markets in this kind of environment; we really have to follow Now, we don't always have to buy what markets are doing in a volatile period, but I'm suggesting that unless there were expectations of ease evidenced in financial markets, it would be very difficult for us to ease and get away with it given the concern about inflation that's out  -41-    8/21/90  there And the final point I would make is that if a recession is imminent--if we're going to go into recession in the fourth quarter--I don't think we can do much about it right now Even in the face of weak incoming data, if we feel that we're on a monetary policy course that is consistent in the long run with sustainable growth and progress toward price stability, that's about all we should do I worry about overreacting--not on your part but just in general--to incoming weak data on the thought that somehow we could pull this economy out of recession in the short run I don't think we can "
3973,1990-09-07," This is Tom Melzer I would support where you came out as well And I might add a comment on what the markets are doing I continue to think that this is an environment where we ought to be sensitive to expectations that are reflected there  I have a couple of comments based on a is in the housing business nationally  and he commented that the housing market is still turning down, even in some of the better markets He happened to mention Sacramento So, things in better markets are slowing down as well, which is not terribly surprising I think the issue is just as consumers stay frozen for an extended period of time [unintelligible] confidence bounces back up But I can see a scenario where things continue about where they are right now and consumer confidence could come back A comment in the other direction in the trucking industry--and he also has national exposure--said the first couple of weeks of August were lousy in terms of volume but the second two weeks    9/7/90  picked up dramatically, and actually August came in as a very good month Some of it could be military-related  I agree very strongly with staying where we are right now, but I would not be at all surprised if down the road there came a time when we decided to move One other thought I would share If we're concerned about anxieties and consumer confidence and so forth, one could make the case that we [might] want to move when there is a very compelling case and we can move quite dramatically I'm not sure that we necessarily are in an environment where we should be nibbling away at the edges We don't have all that much room between the funds rate and the discount rate right now Our Bank doesn't have a recommendation in for a discount rate change, as you know, but I for one would rather think in terms of possibly creating some room fairly early in this process, not later on In other words, if we nibbled away at the edges with a couple of 25 basis point moves and then had only 50 basis points of [spread between the two rates], we might be forced for technical reasons to cut the discount rate at a time when we really wouldn't want to--sort of at the end of an easing as opposed to the beginning That's just a thought for future reference "
3994,1990-09-17," This is Tom Melzer I guess I better speak so you know I'm here! In our board meeting last Thursday, I picked up a tone similar to that cited by Gary People would comment that they felt very negative and yet the information that they were looking at hadn't really changed that much Right now, the facts perhaps don't confirm the kind of pessimism that is out there and that is whipped up to some extent by the press I don't think this is the time to move; so, that's where I stand "
4018,1990-10-02," Right They'd be looking for [something]   As for the District, I would say activity in terms of what we can measure is still slowing; I would guess we're probably bouncing along around zero right now in the District One relatively bright spot, at least through June 30th, is the banking area For the first six months of the year, we're showing at small banks in the District return on assets of 1 percent, return on equity of 12 to 12-1/2 percent, and really no significant buildup in nonperforming loans Now, I don't think that's going to hold up necessarily through the balance of the year, but that sector so far looks pretty decent In terms of the numbers on the large reporting banks, there's not a lot of credit being extended but my sense is that that's somewhat of a mutual thing I think there's just a sort of paralysis Dick, you mentioned this too I'm not sure borrowers, even if the credit is available, are all that anxious to borrow in this environment  I had a dramatic example of something we have heard about from a number of people this morning I was in a couple of areas in our District last week where geographically the economy is really doing quite well, not only statistically but also if you talk to people they say business is going well But their attitude is much more negative than the reality of what they're dealing with I think that pervades people's actions in the conduct of day-to-day business  The other feeling I get is that there's not a lot of sense that monetary policy is somehow at fault In other words, I'm not getting accosted by people saying ""You guys have really screwed up; you really ought to be doing something differently"" I'm just not picking that up Perhaps the corollary to that is that there is a general malaise out there, a lot of uncertainty, paralysis--however you want to describe it I'm not sure we have it in our power to snap the economy out of it And maybe yesterday's stock market reaction-- and I realize this is just temporary--gives us some insight into the influence the Middle East situation has on expectations and this malaise that has set in the slightest whiff of some resolution there really had a very positive, temporary, impact on attitudes  Turning to the national situation, I personally would not be surprised to see one or two negative quarters, and I wouldn't really have any quibble with what Mike has projected We look at monetary policy from perhaps a somewhat different perspective than Mike, but I think we're saying essentially the same thing Our assessment is that the current course of policy is unlikely to exacerbate whatever recessionary pressures exist I think there is some sense--and I mentioned this a meeting or two ago--that some people might criticize the Fed for being too tight And yet if you look at the latest three months--whether you look at reserves, the base, narrow money, or broad money--compared to the prior 12 months, there really has been no tightening of monetary policy on that basis In fact, some of the measures suggest somewhat of an easing Anyway, my view is that we have built a tremendous [foundation], or whatever you want to call it We have wrung out a tremendous amount of excess liquidity over the last three years that had been built up from monetary stimulus or  -24-    10/2/90  whatever in the mid-1980s And if we can just come through this next period here with a reasonably good monetary policy still intact-- probably a combination of good luck and good policy--the prospects for making significant progress on inflation down the road are really pretty good, I think   How is the long end behaving today?   May I ask a question on the luncheon discussion? If you decide to do that, how do you think that will play? Will that be perceived as some sort of an easing in policy or will it be perceived as a technical matter?   Yes   What will it do to the growth rate? Can you calculate an effective growth rate of reserves?   My preference would probably be alternative B, asymmetric toward ease If I were voting I wouldn't dissent against the 25 basis point move downward In any case, I'd be very sensitive to growth of the aggregates--sensitive to their heralding a possible slowdown and a decline in market rates, and thus pegging the funds rate at too high a level So, I can identify with the general sensitivity that you have I'd like to make three other comments very quickly One, I agree with what Bob Black was saying I'd much rather see the rationale here being made in the context of what's happening in the economy--expectations with respect to how that may affect our performance against monetary aggregates and so forth as opposed to [the budget issue] I'm just thinking back to how the unintended credit tightening rationale played in July; and if we can put [our action] in a broader context of the economy and our broader goals, I think we'd be better off Secondly, I'm very goosey about tying too much to budget deals, particularly if there are two steps in that My assumption has always been that that is a political position more than an economic position I understand why we're there and I don't--   No, I understand But, again, in an economic context I might have some questions as to the extent of the response that would be necessary My only point is this If we make one adjustment that's perceived to be in connection with that, that might be quite enough If we make another one, the perception might be that we're following right along I don't think people will necessarily distinguish between the budget deal and fiscal restraint, and there's a lot more fiscal restraint promised down the road And I'd hate to see us get into a linkage where we sort of condition people to think that there is always going to be a monetary policy offset   Okay Well, I just wanted to express that concern And then finally, I really don't know about the adjustment in reserve requirements, but I'm sure you are weighing it in the context of everything else you have in mind As you know, people have been taught to think in terms of the three tools of monetary policy And I'm not sure how that would play, particularly in conjunction with the two contemplated easings   That's fine; that's a concern I have that I don't know how to accommodate "
4043,1990-11-13," Peter, again this is a hypothetical question If you had been able to meet the demand for reserves that would have achieved the target funds rate, would that have substantially affected the growth rate of reserves over this period? I'm not sure you can answer that   I'd favor dropping it I would just observe, in thinking back to that memo Ann-Marie Meulendyke did 3 or 4 years ago, that it's interesting that we have had different operating regimes, but if oriented toward the funds rate there used to be a constraint associated with reserves or aggregates--I don't remember specifically Of course, the irony of this one is that, in effect, we have an operating regime that practically targets the funds rate and our constraint is the funds rate And a point that falls down the road is that if we're going to have an operating regime and a constraint, the constraint really ought to be oriented toward reserves or something behaving drastically differently from what we expected That would be a sensible restraint in the current operating regime   Yes I would just eliminate the sentence   They're going to be suspicious that we have something else in the works   In our District for the most recent three-month period the economy is still growing, albeit at a slowing rate Right now if you could measure it, we're probably just bumping along holding our own But that performance is somewhat better than the national average Payroll employment in that period was up about 1 percent; the gains are in government services; employment in wholesale and retail trade and manufacturing is down about 1 percent The area that I hear the most about in manufacturing is the consumer durables area; both Whirlpool and GE have had layoffs that are very much tied into the housing industry One interesting note in Missouri itself--and Missouri is the second largest state in terms of automobile and auto- related employment--we had some layoffs by the Big-Three and also at McDonnell Douglas, but District-wide auto employment in the most recent quarter is flat Basically, what has happened is that the Japanese transplants in Kentucky and Tennessee and their suppliers have really picked up that slack Finally, construction activity, while it's declining, is not nearly as depressed in our District as nationally In the first nine months of the year residential construction was down only 1 percent compared to 7 percent nationally, and nonresidential construction was down not quite 4 percent One bit of anecdotal information, which I've heard on a couple of different occasions, is the sense that inventories are being managed more closely I picked that up from in the trucking industry the pattern they're seeing there is one of much more frequent shipments of smaller amounts His general interpretation of that is that firms really are trying to manage their inventories very closely  I still have the feeling that the sentiment is probably worse than the reality, although I agree with Mike that there is more evidence of a downturn In that connection, I think probably the most important factor bearing on sentiment is the Middle East situation I just wonder--and this may be politically naive--whether or not from an economic point of view a stalemate situation couldn't be construed as somewhat stable and we could see some drop in oil prices that could turn that sentiment somewhat  On the national situation, generally I haven't been terribly concerned about some of the forecasts in terms of a slowdown in economic activity or a recession That has been based primarily on my general feeling that the thrust of monetary policy has been about right as measured by the behavior of the monetary aggregates If that's the way you look at things, when you see a month like October you have to be a bit concerned I'd simply say that at this point I would not be inclined to overreact based on one-month's data I'm not sure that we really have the ability--though I know how much effort goes into it--to project with all that much confidence what the aggregates are going to do down the road And, of course, the most recent easing really isn't reflected in the aggregates at all  -30-    11/13/90  The final point I would make is that I don't think there is a lot we can do about the availability of credit We can make sure that we provide adequate reserves and that money grows at an appropriate rate, but I think the behavior of credit really is largely out of our control I would simply observe that in the months of August and September--we don't have complete data on October yet--short- and intermediate-term business credit was growing at a fairly decent rate 77 percent in August and 101 percent in September I think there's some evidence that the commercial paper market and finance companies and so forth are picking up some of the slack from the banking system   My preference would be ""B,"" although I could support this One of the things I worry about a little is all this prior unfortunate dialogue and how through comments the Administration has made and so forth we sort of have been linked into this budget process I'd really prefer to do something after more time has passed because I think all that runs fundamentally to our credibility I guess the reason I'm worried about it is the point Jerry and others were making about the dollar I think we really have to guard our credibility because when it comes to defending the dollar we're really the only act in town So, that gives me some concern; but I can live with [your proposal]   No, I understand that I just worry that this might be interpreted as a second installment, and I don't like that linkage "
4062,1990-12-07," Don, what has Ml been doing and what do you expect it to do? And, are there possibly any distortions in those broader aggregates?   Thank you   This is Tom Melzer I might just quickly mention that we had earlier this week  a national home building operation, said that they were surprised by their November sales results, which were much better than they expected and about in line with those of a year ago and maybe a little better So, he had the sense that things weren't continuing to deteriorate, which confirms something you said earlier And who is involved with the trucking business felt the same way His firm actually noticed a pickup in activity in the latter part of November In terms of [the outlook], my view hasn't really changed I have some concerns about the behavior of the aggregates too, but I'm not inclined to overreact to one month's figures If you look at the thrust of monetary policy over a much longer time span, going back really to the first half of last year, I think the course of policy has been one that is generally consistent with expansion I guess I'm saying that it wouldn't lead me to the conclusion that monetary policy is strangling the economy right now, and I don't think we can lose sight of the several [easing] steps that have been taken just recently "
4081,1990-12-18," Starting off with the District, in terms of the statistics we are still slowing But even though manufacturing employment is going down, we're still getting modest employment growth overall I'd say the employment picture generally in the District is somewhat stronger than in the nation In terms of nonresidential construction, over the last year we're down about as much as the rest of the country Housing has not been hit nearly as hard, but it is down As far as anecdotal information goes, and I mentioned this on our recent telephone conference call, the sense I'm getting from directors and others--and it was reinforced in some further discussions last week--is that things have not gotten materially worse in the last 30 days As far as holiday sales go, I think retailers in the District are expecting modest, or maybe somewhat larger, real declines in retail sales But that generally was anticipated and I think inventory levels in general are in pretty good shape One very bright spot is bank performance in the District We have third- quarter numbers in now Returns on assets are still about 1 percent; returns on equity are greater than 12 percent; and nonperforming loans are unchanged from the prior quarter and the prior year   Probably the fourth quarter won't look as good; I'd expect some deterioration But again, it's a much better picture than I think we see elsewhere In terms of expansion of credit, that generally has been sluggish over the last year in the District  On the national front, the one comment I would make is that we've had some concerns over the last couple of months--really since September, October, and November--about the slowdown in the monetary aggregates I guess the way that one would conceptualize what is going on is that as demand for reserves has fallen our operating procedures of pegging the funds rate has really caused us to drag out reserves to maintain whatever the targeted funds rate was I think there was evidence in, say, the early part of this 2-1/2 month period that we weren't really keeping pace with declines in other short-term market rates I don't know to what extent we can rely on these spreads, but it's something that I think is worth looking at The main point I wanted to make in this connection is that with the steps that were taken in November, we really have not only caught up with the declines in market rates but actually have moved the funds rate ahead of them Just to cite a couple of examples From the end of September to the end of October, the funds rate had only come down 9  -15-    12/18/90  basis points, whereas short rates had come down on the order of 20 to 30 basis points depending on what instrument we looked at; but for the period as whole, from the end of September through the middle of December roughly, the funds rate was down 100 basis points and these very short-term rates were down roughly 30 to 60 basis points So, if one worried about our being out of position and not providing adequate reserve growth, to the extent that these interest rate spreads are some indicator we certainly have caught up with the market movement and gone beyond that Perhaps that gives a somewhat more optimistic perspective in terms of what reserves and money might do down the road   Don, I noticed in the money projections in the Bluebook that there's a very dramatic difference when you get out to February and March between alternatives A and B, much more so than I think we normally see Do you want to comment on that?   I just can't recall 2 and 3 percentage point differences in the growth rates between these various alternatives It just struck me   I can accept your recommendation on the funds rate, Alan I think it's probably appropriate I have a sense--as I expressed earlier and to use a phrase I heard elsewhere--that we're getting ahead of the curve a little I think we have brought the funds rate down faster than market rates, and I presume that that is going to show through to the aggregates But this is responsive to the concern of the slow growth I agree with you that we're likely to overdo it Unfortunately, I don't have the same confidence that we'll undo it I say that simply because I sat here as recently as 1986 and 1987 as we looked at quarterly growth rates in M2 in excess of 10 percent and I have to tell you there are lot of asymmetric monetarists That's Lee's phrase, but I think it's very true There were many people not at all worried about that [M2 growth] at that time I hope I'm wrong, but I'm not--   Oh, I understand what position we're in, and that's why--   Yes   In any case, I would like to try to avoid the overshooting not only for that reason but also because I think a volatile monetary policy has other consequences that flow from that On the discount rate, if it were up to me I would let the 1/4 point  -39-    12/18/90  show through in open market operations tomorrow and I'd be inclined to cut the discount rate on Friday And at that point I'd make it very clear that it's simply a technical adjustment to move the discount rate in line with other rates I think the communication in this other scheme could get a little confusing I think we could establish a 7 percent funds rate by Friday and then just have a technical adjustment [in the discount rate] and use the appropriate language for that I'm not concerned about Wayne's concern here We could be left in the same position if the Board decided not to move the rate on Wednesday and then we would have a situation where, with the authority we are proposing to delegate to the Chairman, we would still have the funds rate coming down close to or possibly below the discount rate So, I'm not troubled with that I'd go ahead with the open market operations "
4098,1991-01-09," Dave, how about reserves? Have you been able to restate the path data? Do you have any sense of how reserves are growing?   Could you just tell me again what the bottom line is?   Along that line, given the concerns Wayne just expressed about the informational value of M2 and M3, it seems to me that we may want to consider in February whether or not we might want to look at a broader array of reserve and monetary aggregates We could conceivably get way out of position by acting on the wrong data   But we may want to look explicitly at a broader range so we don't get locked into a course of action that in retrospect we may not be happy with I'm not saying that we have to do that at this point; I'm just saying that's something to think about in February "
4105,1991-02-01," Alan, this is Tom Melzer I don't know whether you would consider this a technical point or not, but on the decision to let it pass through to the funds rate Should that be an action taken by the FOMC? "
4125,1991-02-05," Peter, I wanted to ask you about your thoughts on the instability of the funds rate Do you view the instability as a problem, which seems to be what you've implied, in terms of markets knowing where we are and other interest rates not being affected? Maybe it isn't a big problem, but I'm sure there are other problems in terms of overnight financing and that sort of thing So my first question is Is the instability a problem? Secondly, do you think it will persist as some of these seasonal factors affecting reserve balances, cash, and so forth pass? In other words, are the reserve    2/5-6/91  balances adequate to handle the clearings? And, finally, assuming they aren't, what do you think we can do about it?   Supplemental balances   We had our lawyers look at that and their view was that we can't use that escape hatch right now I think somebody else ought to check it out, but our view is that it can't be used   On the national scene, we're very close to the median; I'm not sure that has ever happened before but there's some statistical probability of that and I guess it occurred In the short run, not surprisingly, our staff would view the major risk as being whether the assumption with respect to money growth, something in the 4 to 5 percent area, is realized I guess I'm a little schizophrenic about that because I'm worried that it may be realized and then some And in that context I think Mike's scenario 2 here is very instructive because we could have some considerable challenges ahead of us We have to get through the one we're in right now but, as we've discussed in the past and as Bob Parry mentioned, I hope we will be ready to respond in the other direction when we need to   In terms of our District, I don't have a lot to say Our economy is stagnant, probably declining slightly Perhaps with what is going on in autos and cancellation of the A-12, we'll have some further weakness showing up Essentially, what has been going on is that manufacturing weakness, which is not as great as it is nationally, is being offset by strength in services--health services and business services, generally  Just one last comment on the banking sector I would say that when the year-end numbers come out, some weakness probably will show up; but our banks are still in relatively good shape I was at our Memphis branch a couple of weeks ago and one of the bankers said ""This kills me to do this, but I've got to tell you that I don't think additional stimulus from the Fed is really going to help We're swimming in reserves; we don't know what to do with them And the problem is that when we try to lay them off, eventually we get to the New York money center banks and we don't necessarily want to sell very  -29-    2/5-6/91  much!"" Another banker--these were both large bankers in that area-- said that they have cut their fed funds selling by 70 percent in the last year I took that to mean in terms of approved names on the list So, that's a pretty dramatic shift   That's the incremental amount, Mike?   To bring it up to a total of what, Mike?   Let me just comment first on the strategies that Don laid out I strongly favor strategy II Given our role as a central bank, I can't see associating myself with any other strategy The only thing we can affect in the long run is inflation; that's the only one that really shows any progress That does not lead me, however, to alternative II in terms of the ranges; I would support alternative I As Bob Parry already acknowledged, there's already a reduction in the ranges implicit in the tentative ones, so in my mind that's consistent with strategy II My own view is that a further reduction in the ranges, given the environment we're in right now, really wouldn't be seen as particularly credible I don't think we would buy any credibility by ratcheting them down any further What is credible and what we need to do in this environment is to make sure that we acknowledge that the one thing we affect in the long run is prices and that we're still committed to price stability [I mean that] not in a saber rattling short-term context, but we have made so much progress over the last four years in bringing down the growth rate in money that, as I've said before, I think we have a tremendous opportunity here to make a permanent impact on inflation And I want to make sure we don't lose sight of that I'm sure we won't as a Committee, but in terms of what we're conveying to the public we need to convey that we have some short-term problems to work through now but we still have our eye on the right ball   What I'm suggesting is that we can't rely on that alone to convey the message   He wants to go short!   I support alternative B also Let me just pick up on some things Jerry said I was writing some notes here and when he started talking I thought he was going to say the same thing I am But when you hear what I have to say, you'll realize that that was virtually impossible Basically I agree with this focus on slow money versus weak current economic numbers I think that's what we ought to focus on; that's what we have influence on But I'm also sympathetic to the uncertainties with respect to the short-term behavior of money, particularly the broader aggregates Don has talked about it--the restructuring that's going on in depository institutions and so forth And I guess we also know that the base is distorted by currency flows overseas So, if it were up to me, I would pay some attention to reserves That's what we affect directly And over the last year there has been virtually no growth in reserves Now, I'm not being critical here, because I think we've tried to respond to that to some extent by bringing rates down; and we have recognized in this Committee the perils of funds rate targeting and we've been trying to respond to that But we shouldn't sit around and be surprised that we're not getting any money growth if we're not providing any reserves   I'm not sure My only point is that I don't think we can expect money to grow if we don't provide the basic fuel that's necessary; we're demand driven   Well, I'm not proposing a specific approach here I'm just saying that I would pay some attention to what is going on there We have some uncertainty about how the aggregates are behaving; that's what we can influence And I think we should pay some attention to it   Yes   I guess what I'm suggesting, picking up on Jerry's point that we're vulnerable, is that where we're vulnerable is that somebody may look at it and say basically that by targeting the funds rate we haven't provided any reserves to permit an expansion in  -56-    2/5-6/91  the aggregates And my answer to that is not smoke and mirrors; our best defense against somebody taking a shot at us is trying to do the right thing And I think we have been--   I'm not suggesting that we target reserves I'm just saying that in this uncertain environment it could be helpful because if we're sitting here pegging the funds rate at the wrong level and we're shrinking the supply of reserves, we are not going to see the money growth that we are going to need I think that could just be helpful to us in this process I think you all know what I've advocated over time; I'm not one who would be inclined to go nuts on the easing side, but I think this could be helpful in the other direction as well My main point is that our best insurance policy is just to assure ourselves that we are doing the right thing And that's going to be the best defense We are going to be vulnerable if the record shows on a continuing basis that we're still not providing adequate reserves And I'd be the first one to say on the other side that it's a problem, too, if those [monetary growth] rates shoot up to double-digit rates over a sustained period of time, as they very likely could with what has already been done Anyhow, I support the Chairman's proposal   I forgot one other point I was going to make, which is that I think we can best defend ourselves by sticking to promising things we can control and we can affect We cannot solve an intermediation problem in the economy, and I think that creates false expectations But what we can do is make sure that we're providing  -57-    2/5-6/91  adequate reserves to the System so that the financial intermediaries can do with those what they will   Which, of course, we haven't seen   I'm not suggesting that we use it as an operating target   I'm just saying that if it were up to me, in this environment where we're worried about getting the money growth path, I'd hate to be sitting here three months from now with a slope on that line of total reserves that was still totally flat as it has been over the last year "
4151,1991-03-26," I would agree with what Bob Forrestal said about getting too technical here; I think it could be a problem Where I would come out, because I have sympathy for what Lee said on the legal side, is that if a discount rate action causes a change in the instructions that the FOMC has given to the Desk, in a very simple- minded fashion it's hard for me in a very technical sense to let that happen without consultation As a practical matter we are on a fed funds targeting regime now We have chosen not to say that to the world I think it's bad public relations, basically, to say that that is what we are doing, and I think it's right not to; but internally we all recognize that that's what we are doing Those circumstances call for greater consultation, not less So, I have some of the problems that were expressed earlier by Bob Black and Roger Guffey about exactly what this language means because it seems to define very little I really don't think we could define a specific rule; but in    3/26/91  the circumstances we're operating in right now it argues for erring on the side of more consultation, not less, when in effect we're changing the instructions to the Desk  The other observation I would make, Don, is that I don't know how to interpret the historical evidence but, as I look back at a couple of situations that I happen to remember quite well, generally all we've done is to relate discount rate changes to fed funds changes; no one has ever looked at whether or not consultation took place But I can remember in a strict borrowings regime--for example, in July and August of '86--there were discount rate changes that showed through to the funds rate and there was consultation with the FOMC The FOMC basically acted at its meeting to ease policy and recognized that that might be effected through a discount rate change I'm not saying it's possible to get it nor that it would necessarily clarify things all that much, but the evidence that we have is in some sense not the right evidence   One thought I meant to mention is that there's a lot of potential value added in terms of conveying any technicalities of interest to one group versus another I think there is a potential for a higher quality decision, even though it may be more difficult to get, just through the consultative process   I'm going to overlap a little with Ed and agree with David When we started off a couple of years ago, in the beginning the idea of that foreign exchange study was to see whether we could develop some rationale It turned out to be very effective because I think the weight of that effort slowed down in a broad sense the propensity of the Treasury to intervene, but we never answered the threshold question I'm not sure there is any answer in a number sense but conceptually there's probably an answer And I think we have to be prepared with that because there's the potential for some heat here and with good reason   Longer term, I think we need to pursue that; there are some international financial considerations that the people who are going to be taking the shots at the profit and loss statement don't really appreciate So, I think we can do an educational job and we have to be ready to do that well Longer term, I suspect the problem is that most of us feel that sterilized intervention doesn't really do any good and yet we're caught in a sort of international alliance in which some of our counterparts do So, in order to play in that game, we do something that we don't fundamentally believe in We're not going to answer that today but I don't know what the dynamics are that perhaps ultimately will lead to more sensible combined behavior in that regard internationally As a practical matter I agree that we have to play the game We can't just say that we think this is stupid, that it doesn't work, and we're not going to do it Maybe over time there are efforts we can make to lead the world to perhaps a more sensible approach on this Maybe that's idealistic; I don't know   I was just going to ask how you would characterize the conversations with the Treasury on reducing the warehousing so far Have we been pushing hard on them and have they been reluctantly going along or are they going to sit there and say ""Why didn't you tell us to sell this stuff?"" How have those communications gone?   And have we had to push them hard to peel off what has been sold already?   Wished to do what, Wayne? I didn't understand   In our District I would agree with something Ed has said So far there is little that one can really put a finger on statistically; it's more of an attitude change that I've noticed I had the same experience that Ed and Bob described with our directors about a week ago; there was a very noticeable shift in sentiment Statistically, I guess the one thing we can hang our hat on is employment growth It had gotten very sluggish; it never had turned negative in the District on a year-to-year basis, but there is some evidence that it has bottomed out and started moving up And that's a combination of both less weakness in the manufacturing area than nationally and considerably more strength in the non-manufacturing area The other piece of evidence we have is not so much in terms of the current economy but we have year-end numbers on banking; bank performance has continued to hold up with [delinquencies] of about 09 percent and not a significant increase in either loan losses or nonperforming loans We're perhaps a little behind the rest of the nation in potential real estate problems, but I don't think those are going to get significantly bad; we never had the boom, really  Nationally, the only comment I would make is that I'm pleased to see that we can now look back and say that we have had some sustained growth in reserves and money And at least for my part, I'm not too concerned about reacting to that at this stage There would  -31-    3/26/91  come a point in time when maybe I would, but things are tenuous enough now that I'm just pleased to see it and leave it at that   Oh, I do get to go before Ed! Maybe I can be briefer Yes "
4173,1991-04-12," This is Tom Melzer Alan, I heard the same anecdotal information you heard out here yesterday and I would agree with your [assessment] The question I had in my mind is Has there really been time for the rebound in housing to show through to the industrial sector? There are other people on this call who would know the answer to that much better than I I'd also say that I wouldn't rule out the possibility somewhere along the line here for us to have to ease further, although I wouldn't be inclined to do anything now Most of my reasons have been expressed First of all, I'm not inclined to react to one piece of weekly or monthly data; I think that's dangerous Secondly, I think it could be a trap of letting market expectations lead us around Finally, and most importantly in my view anyway, the cumulative thrust of monetary policy over the last three or four months has been quite stimulative I think that has been very appropriate But all the aggregates, whether you look at reserves or money or whatever, have been slowing at pretty rapid rates And in general that [slowing] has been accelerating I don't know how to interpret M2 and I'm a little reluctant to rely on our projections of what an aggregate will do in the future Anyway, for those reasons, my preference would be to do nothing right now "
4208,1991-05-14," I haven't heard much change in the kind of anecdotal information we've been hearing for the last couple of  -15-    5/14/91  months, though there is a somewhat more positive tone to it, with strength in the obvious places but no evidence in those comments of new areas of strength and no new areas of concern One other comment on the anecdotal side I would make is that Jerry mentioned the sour comments from manufacturers and I wonder--and it's too early to tell now because I suspect their orders are still pretty lousy--whether they're going to be expecting too much out of this recovery They may be thinking of more traditional recoveries My guess is that it's still going to be a very difficult environment in which to do business On this point I was amused that when Alan was in St Louis a month ago we heard one manufacturer who heads up a very well-managed company fussing about the margin pressures He said he hadn't seen anything this bad since '74-'75 But subsequently, having seen their first-quarter earnings, there was another increase--maybe a record So, there are some people who like to tell us how tough it is  As for the numbers themselves, as was noted before, the positive information we're receiving is mostly anecdotal and it isn't there in the numbers In our District it's starting to show up in the numbers through the first quarter We actually had nonagricultural employment growth at about--not quite--a 15 percent annual rate Manufacturing is still weak; that's primarily in transportation, autos and aircraft And in nonmanufacturing and services, there was strength across the board with most of the contribution being from wholesale and retail trade and services We also had growth in the construction sector The previous four quarters all had declines, so this was the first positive quarter in nonresidential construction contracts in over a year  On a broader basis, one comment I want to make is on this inflation question I'm somewhat troubled the more I hear comments about and see in the press good reported inflation numbers When I say in the press, I mean comments from market observers--I don't associate this with what Jerry was saying before about better reported price numbers in the short run--that somehow that gives policy room to move I have two reactions to that One is that I think the numbers we're seeing now are the result of actions taken many months ago, if not years ago And in that sense I don't think they justify any action on our part in the short run if policy is in the proper position The second aspect of that, and the more important, is that these are declines from unacceptably high levels to somewhat lower but I think in a longer-term context still unacceptably high levels What I'm saying is that if the policies we've put in place over a long period of time are working, we're going to go through a fairly long period where we're going to see better price numbers, but that in and of itself shouldn't be a justification for easing There is this rather simple-minded concept sometimes in the financial markets that somehow that gives the Fed room to ease and I just don't buy it   I just want to explore the stock market issue We talked to some investment managers a week or so ago and my sense is that some are expecting some sort of a correction   Oh, we did? How much?   Well, I'm not sure that's what they had in mind! [Laughter]   Maybe this is a peculiar circumstance at this time, but I think it's a little tricky to tie monetary policy into a stock market predictor I just don't know what the linkages are   Well, for the record, I would be in favor of what you proposed as the policy prescription "
4245,1991-07-02," We're at the low end of the central tendency for the inflation outlook in '92, so we're very constructive on that score I might add that that assumes a tighter monetary policy than I think the baseline does I'm not sure about all these velocities and so forth   Picking up on Jerry's last point and a little on what Bob Black said earlier about the uniqueness of this opportunity we have It took four years of good policy to get here and I hope we don't screw it up, because I do think it's a very unique opportunity  As far as current District activity goes, we have the same pattern that I've described in recent months We're getting slight employment growth and basic weakness in manufacturing--not as much weakness as nationally--being offset by growth in nonmanufacturing And the particular weakness in manufacturing is in transportation-- McDonnell Douglas and Chrysler, with the layoffs they've had in the St Louis area And in nonmanufacturing, we're seeing strength in services Somebody said earlier that they are not seeing that yet; we're seeing that and we're also seeing a pickup in construction employment In fact, both residential and nonresidential contracts are up in the most recent period, and residential is up very sharply That's now beginning to spill through to some other sectors of the economy GE in Louisville has called back 1,000 employees because of what they see going on in homebuilding  As far as banking conditions go, if you compare the numbers in the first quarter to the first quarter a year ago, it's really hard to detect that there has been any change There's a very slight deterioration in return on equity and in nonperforming loans, but it's almost indistinguishable So, banking conditions in the District are still very good Despite that, and even though the banks are in a position to lend, we're seeing very moderate credit growth, which I think probably reflects a weakness in demand   In terms of the strategies laid out, I'd favor strategy II, the tighter one, and flowing from that alternative III in terms of the ranges We're talking about a long-term approach to strategy here, and that underlines our commitment to price stability, which I think is the one thing we really can influence in the long run The credibility point is the major argument in favor of it It seems to me that we could get the most positive impact by making a move now I agree with Jerry Our actions are more important than the symbolism of this But I think if we change it in February, it's going to be because we're perceived to be on the run; and I don't know whether we buy a lot at that point in time Some of the arguments that I've heard I'm not particularly persuaded by--for example, gradualism We've been at this for four years and I think we ought to keep down that path I agree with what you said, Mr Chairman, and with what Lee said There's some distance to go here And I think this is the time to try to consolidate some of the gains In terms of this issue about a top end of 6 percent somehow constraining our ability to act if the economy is weaker than we expected--and this picks up on Jerry's point--we're already ""acting"" quite a bit now; we have projections in the Bluebook of M2 growth moving up to a 6 percent rate, which is 50 percent higher than what we've averaged over the last four years So, we're doing our part in trying to assure a recovery In fact, I would agree with Jerry that what we have to be thinking about is When do we take some of that rope back in? On the final point that I've heard some arguments that I don't necessarily agree with, I'd add the financial fragility point I don't think the conduct of monetary policy, so long as we're providing adequate liquidity to the economy, is really the appropriate tool I think we can look ourselves in the mirror and say that we've been doing our part on that score I don't disagree that there are problems out there, but I think there are other policy approaches that need to address those If you step back and look at them, the problems that we're having with the financial system are really the products of a monetary policy that sowed the seeds for inflation, and a lot of the problems are inherent now as inflation is coming down   Where is that weakness in M2? Is it across the board or in the non-M1 components?   Is M1 still growing?   Wouldn't that give you some comfort in connection with your response that-- "
4286,1991-08-20," In terms of the first three alternatives in Dave's memo, allowing more fluctuation in the funds rate really doesn't appeal to me very much I don't think ambiguity would serve us very well The point about pressure on us to divulge more about our targets if there's ambiguity about what policy is I think is a point well taken In terms of automatism, if you will, it doesn't appeal to me to tie anything to M2; in other words, those fourth and fifth alternatives don't appeal to me at all I guess I still have some affinity for looking at reserves or the base I don't think we should write off Ml for all time There's a possibility that in a more stable environment in terms of inflation and inflationary expectations M1 perhaps is going to be more meaningful So, I would support Al's and Bob's suggestion that we do more work on that But I don't think we're anywhere near being able to go to an operating regime that targets reserves Something that might be possible in the short run--and this was in your summary memo, Don, not in Dave's-- would be this idea of continuing to do what we do but having some broad constraint based on some short-run aggregate that may modify behavior as we approach the limits of that constraint I really think of that as a trade-off We've talked about this concept before in the context of the directive; when we had monetary targeting we had that caveat in terms of funds rate fluctuations Now we have funds rate targeting and I think it would be quite appropriate to have some kind of constraint in terms of aggregate behavior But I don't think we can look at a period as short as an intermeeting period; we've got to look at much longer-term behavior of some reserve or monetary aggregate   The more I listen to this discussion, the more I think that maybe we ought to do away with this listing That's partly because the table presented in Governor Kelley's memo reminded me that I've seen that table in certain research where people try to figure out what the Fed is doing That sort of scares me because, as Jerry pointed out, sometimes we consciously change [the items in the list] and sometimes we don't think about them at all And it seems to me the purpose of that language is really guidance to you, Mr Chairman, and to the Desk in the intermeeting period I personally have confidence in your having listened to the discussion in the meeting and in your interpretation of that, and I'm not sure you need that guidance And I'm not sure that guidance adds any value to public [understanding], really These are sort of boiler plate things that any central bank is going to take into account in setting policy So, I'd be in favor of doing away with that recitation myself   Dave, wouldn't you think the policy record would reveal that, though? Wouldn't it reveal our particular concern without restating that in the operational paragraph of the directive? That was my main point   Yes   The numbers for our District show a little different pattern These would be for the three-month period ended in June, so they're somewhat dated But this is the first time we've shown overall employment declines in recent months Manufacturing hasn't really changed much; it has been declining slightly What has happened is that we haven't had the offsets on the non-manufacturing side There is particular weakness in mining and construction In mining it has to do with the Clean Air Act and the high sulfur coal deposits in Illinois and Kentucky; in construction, it's a reflection of [the nationwide slump that] we're all familiar with I will say, though, that contracts in both residential and nonresidential construction show growth, so I think there's some improvement in store down the road there Just one piece of anecdotal information on this inventory story a large cotton grower, and he mentioned that the consumption of cotton in the textile industry is at the highest rate in 15 years Mills are running flat out 7 days a weeks and it's basically--   Right But the other comment he made is that the inventories have been run down to a [low] level His instinct, anyway, is that we'll be seeing a turnaround in the inventory situation in that particular industry  On a more general note, having listened to all the commentary, I think we have to caution ourselves at this point not to get whipsawed too much by the incoming data We're all familiar with the lags in policy, and this is going to be a time when expectations are going to be very volatile And at least in terms of how I look at policy, I don't think M2 is a very good indicator of the thrust of policy; I think we have to look at something narrower On that basis the thrust of policy has continued to increase throughout this year We just have to bear in mind, for example, that the growth rate of M1 over the course of 1991 has accelerated I certainly can't pretend to tell you whether a 7-1/2 percent growth rate in Ml is too much stimulus I'm just saying if we look at that as an indicator of the thrust of policy, we've been pumping more and more in And at some point we have to have the confidence that the actions we've taken are going to have the desired effect and not [let ourselves] get whipsawed by incoming data on the real economy To me that's a very dangerous guide for what monetary policy ought to be   I prefer ""B"" symmetric, but were I voting I could certainly live with what you suggested With respect to the language, let me just raise a question It's possible that M2's behavior has nothing to do with what the real economy may be doing, and I question how we would be reacting to it Let's say that we're sitting here a month from now and M2 is still not performing and we're much more comfortable about what we see unfolding anecdotally on the real side; I think that language could trap us I'd be much more comfortable if, when we refer to the monetary aggregates, we were referring to them very broadly--in other words, including Ml I think we're getting ourselves into a trap in terms of too much focus on M2 and M3, which we can't directly control We would have much more opportunity to keep ourselves out of a corner that we may be painting ourselves into if we thought about M1 a bit I'm not saying we should target Ml; but if we thought about it a little more, it might help keep us from getting painted into that corner So, for that reason and because I presume we're not really looking at Ml, I'd favor version I in the language; I don't want to be painted into that corner   Like Wayne did [Laughter] "
4300,1991-09-13," Alan, this is Tom Melzer I certainly agree with the action on the discount rate And the action having been taken, a showing through to the funds rate ought to be allowed In a sense, we almost have to I must say that in a long-term context, I worry a little about reacting to current numbers on the real economy It just seems to me that at a turning point, we're going to see some numbers that don't look too good and, in effect, we're reacting to bad numbers I simply think this exposes us to the same sort of mistakes that historically were made in monetary policy around turning points I have somewhat of a problem about it because I think we've [moved] quite generously over the last three or four years and going into this recession And [unintelligible] need to The other thing that troubles me even more in a sense is the idea--and this is sort of the mentality of the market--that good price numbers now give us room to move the discount rate down Probably in an expectant sense they do, but what we do with monetary policy right now, of course, won't be reflected in prices for another couple of years And just looking down the road, if we find in retrospect that we are overdoing it now,    9/13/91  it seems to me that we're going to be in a very difficult environment over the next year to take the proper steps to reverse that So, as I say, I agree with 25 basis points showing through but I just want to express my concerns, if you will, about the longer-term view   Thank you, Alan "
4319,1991-10-01," Jerry, as this begins to sort itself out--I don't know what the potential is but obviously we're dealing with confidence here--it seems to me that an important part of this, if it were at all possible, is not having whatever decision is reached jumped on by key politicians right and left I don't know what that--   Right    10/1/91   I just want to make one follow-up comment Thinking about what John [LaWare] was saying--and again not prejudging where this ought to come out--it seems to me that one can draw a distinction between violations in the auction process, which the Treasury oversees, and our decision with respect to primary dealers, which is whom we choose to deal with to execute our transactions It just seems to me, getting back to John's point, that in effect as a punishment--and maybe it's perceived by some as an appropriate punishment--that implicitly the statement the Fed is making is that we're not comfortable dealing with these people I can just imagine what the reaction will be It will be ""The Fed must know something about this that we don't know,"" if they say they're not comfortable dealing [with that firm] That's a pretty serious statement, it seems to me And if somehow a distinction could be made between those two issues--the Treasury bidding process and our role in executing transactions--which is a distinction you've made before, I think it's an important one   Yes, we can suspend them from the auction process without pulling their primary dealership; that's what I'm saying    10/1/91   Sure   I don't have any comments on that particular subject In terms of the District in general, I would say the numbers, which are necessarily somewhat stale at this point, would indicate that maybe we're at the beginning of a turnaround I have been reporting overall employment declines We have had pretty healthy growth in manufacturing employment in the most recent three- month period and a seeming cessation in the decline in nonmanufacturing employment, and both residential and nonresidential construction contracts are growing at pretty healthy rates Anecdotally, I picked up a somewhat different tone What I've been hearing, particularly from our board of directors, over a long period of time is that things are just moving along at a slow pace without any significant declines  We were in a couple of different parts of the District last week, and particularly in Evansville I picked up some very positive comments They all seem to go back to roughly midyear; they talked about a very lousy first half of the year One fellow who supplies automobile parts is running [his production facilities] seven days a week and has record shipments Another in electronic components has increasing orders There is some talk of capital expenditures in the industrial area there A lot of people are looking all of a sudden to relocate It's not new construction; it will be relocated manufacturing facilities But the observation was that people don't even look if they're not somewhat constructive, and there's a lot going on there In general, I would say this is mostly manufacturing- driven, just given the people we had in the room from that general area  In another area where the economy isn't performing so well, Mt Vernon, Illinois, there was a lot of talk about credit availability But in general I think there was a recognition that a rebuilding of balance sheets needed to take place One thing that surprised me is that no one really attacked [the Federal Reserve] in terms of interest rates In other words, no one said ""You've got to do something about interest rates"" Now, I think if you're in areas such as Boston and the West Coast, where maybe there's a lot of real estate hung up, that interest rate pressure is still there But in these areas there's just a general feeling that rates are not the issue And I would say, picking up on John LaWare's point about the credit crunch, that our aggregate banking data for the District continue through midyear to show no increase in nonperforming loans; we're at roughly the same level we were at the end of last year, with less than 2 percent in nonperforming loans and yet no loan growth So, this should be a group of bankers that isn't as shell-shocked as some others; and loans aren't growing  -22-    10/1/91  On the national situation, I'm comfortable with the Board staff's forecast I would make at least four observations First of all, I personally don't think monetary policy is inconsistent with recovery and expansion; I think it has been consistent with that for some time Secondly, I'm very skeptical about our ability to fine- tune the real side So, the concept that we can somehow buy more insurance bothers me I just don't think we'd be good enough to cash in that insurance, or however you want to describe it, when we need to And in that connection, I think there's a good deal of monetary stimulus in train, as Wayne pointed out--whether you look at what has happened to interest rates and in particular short-term real interest rates or whether you look, as we would be more inclined to do, at the behavior of narrow money or reserves over a period of time There's a good deal of stimulus in the pipeline and I don't think it has all shown through In fact, and this would be my final point, our view is that if we were to continue this rate of narrow money growth for a sustained period of time, we're probably already risking a somewhat higher inflation rate than the 3 to 4 percent that we're talking about achieving in the forecast period down the road   Which way, Ed? [Laughter]   ""B"" symmetric "
4340,1991-10-30," Alan, this is Tom Melzer In terms of the District, I don't think it's gaining momentum but I don't think it's deteriorating either So, in that sense, not much has changed  In terms of policy, I'm satisfied with the thrust of policy As I look at it, policy is consistent with continuing economic recovery And as I said before, I'm very leery about our ability to do short-term fine-tuning, especially trying to fine-tune confidence I was in a meeting this morning so I didn't get a chance to look more than quickly at the screen but I think we got some pretty decent personal income and personal consumption numbers You said that the initial claims figures are going to look pretty good tomorrow I don't know what unemployment will look like on Friday, but there's a possibility that those good numbers coming out in and of itself could build some confidence And then if we take some dramatic actions, the    10/30/91  public reaction is going to be ""Well, my word, even in the face of some fairly decent numbers, the Fed is taking dramatic action"" And we could actually go at cross purposes to what some people seem to be trying to accomplish In other words, the reaction will be ""The Fed must know something that we don't know; these numbers look pretty good, so they must see or know something that looks a heck of a lot worse"" I worry about that In any case, in terms of any policy response, predictably, I would be inclined to be quite cautious I would prefer to wait until next Tuesday when we have an opportunity for all of us to sit down and fully discuss any moves "
4360,1991-11-05," I have two questions, Mike One has to do with layoffs and quarterly earnings announcements I don't know whether you ever look at that, but often those two actions might be linked Is there a possibility that this spate of bad news we have gotten on the job front in terms of certain layoffs is simply a seasonal thing associated with the announcement of the third-quarter earnings?   My second question relates to the statement you made about real interest rates Just as a general matter I'm somewhat skeptical about our ability really to set those over time In any case, I was surprised to hear you say that you felt there was considerable scope for further reduction I'm curious as to how you're measuring that A look that we took would indicate that on an ex ante basis using, say, [unintelligible] the CPI and a 3-month Treasury bill rate, we're beginning to get to levels that, if sustained, were associated in the '60s and '70s with periods of rising inflation I just wanted you to expand on that if you could   In terms of our District, I would say it is still expanding but the expansion is sluggish We have employment growth in both manufacturing and non-manufacturing; it's somewhat stronger in manufacturing Residential construction over the most recent three-month period is up over last year; commercial construction is still down, but down considerably less than nationally, particularly year-over-year  On a broader prospective, my view is that certainly some of the numbers that have come out on the national economy recently are disappointing in relation to what we expected But they really are not all that bad, as others have observed Clearly, confidence is very sour I guess I'm influenced by what Mike said earlier and this was confirmed by people on our staff that confidence really has not proven to be a very good forecasting tool  I get a sense that we're very much caught up with a very short-term orientation toward policy right now There's considerable ease in train, whether you look at money or whether you look at interest rates Clearly, there has not been enough time for all the effects of that to be felt And, following up on my question to Mike Prell, I just don't see--whether you look at money or at interest rates--that there's all that much more scope for further easing Now, certainly we can try to force interest rates down further But I don't see why it is that we think we can step into the same trap that we have stepped into in virtually every postwar recovery and then be good enough and strong enough and smart enough to turn that around and not end up in the same position we've been in before I think we have been approaching this whole period of the last four years considerably  -17-    11/5/91  differently than in the past and I hope we can continue to do that In my view, that argues for considerable caution at this juncture, in line with what Bob Black said   I'm in favor of standing pat right now I'd go with alternative ""B"" We just moved [Unintelligible] It's not an  -32-    11/5/91  original idea; Wayne alluded to it and others have mentioned it But I'm not so sure that a lot of activity isn't frozen on the expectation that rates are going to go lower A lot of people are just waiting to see So, I'd just stay where we are and watch for a while Also, I wouldn't be so quick to say that there isn't any inflationary risk right now I continue to think long rates are a reflection of long- term inflationary expectations I wouldn't be a bit surprised, if we made a move, that long rates would come down somewhat But I don't think that's the measure; it's a measure over a longer period of time of what those rates are doing I think we have to be careful if we disturb them   I was just going to ask Peter If, say, we did it tomorrow, how effectively could you transmit it? I don't know what mode open market operations are in right now   I'm a little rusty on this I was just going to ask What is the dollar price effect of 10 basis points on the 10- year?   That's impossible   I didn't want my comments to be misinterpreted I'd support going ahead and announcing it It think it's unfortunate but I support that "
4382,1991-12-02," Alan, this is Tom Melzer I've been on [this call] since the beginning but I didn't interrupt you at that time I would say that conditions in the District have not changed much since the last meeting either, as others have said We touched base with a number of our major companies here Major retail department store chains ended up, with what happened on Friday, with a better November than planned but a somewhat disappointing start for [December] The pattern of sales over the weekend [was] very good on Friday, not quite so good on Saturday, and worse on Sunday But in general they're more optimistic about the Christmas season certainly than what is reported in the press And I did hear the same comment that someone else mentioned That the press was really affecting consumer confidence and their performance In three other industries--chemicals, electrical equipment, and consumer nondurables--the reading I got was that business is about the same as it has been They don't see any dramatic deterioration and don't see any dramatic improvement In the chemical area there is really no sign of a double-dip there The order pattern and shipment pattern are holding up [among] major customers of the auto industry And that generally confirms what someone said about suppliers not seeing a major downturn in their business Even if they did, I think they feel that they are geared to handle that without a major change in their business In the electrical equipment area, there has been an improvement in consumer- related orders, primarily for tools One area where I did pick up some sense of a downturn is in the paper industry There was a very strong pull-out in September and October and some decline in November --perhaps somewhat more than the expected seasonal decline  One final comment It is interesting that among people I've talked to in this context and other contexts, I don't find anybody asking for monetary policy to do more If anything, a concern is evolving among business people that monetary policy is going to be asked [to do] too much and that in the process it will lose sight of longer-term goals There was no pressure for further ease in any of these conversations "
4403,1991-12-17," Alan, I'll start on the theory that if I say something positive maybe we'll get three or four more [doing so] after    12/17/91  me; that's the usual pattern Lately, we've been starting too much on a negative note, so I'm going to go first  In terms of the latest numbers we have on the District, we have had reasonably strong payroll employment growth over the period, about a percentage point higher than nationally Most of that is coming from manufacturing, although there's some growth in the nonmanufacturing segment Residential construction is particularly strong over the three-month period Contracts are up 10 percent; that's not at an annual rate; that's a percentage increase over the prior three-month period Nonresidential is still weak  Our banking sector really continues to look very good If we look at the numbers through the third quarter in the Eighth District overall, we're looking at 1 percent ROAs; 12-1/2 percent ROEs; nonperforming loans that are really up imperceptibly over the last year and are at less than 2 percent; and reserves that are about 10 basis points shy of fully covering nonperforming loans In fact, in the month of November at the large reporting banks we have seen for the first time some meaningful loan growth, mostly in the C&I sector That sector in that month was up 2 percent--not an annual rate but 2 percent absolutely  The anecdotal information is hard to read, but what I keep picking up is that [business conditions] are basically pretty much the same, though I wouldn't be surprised to see a little deterioration in employment showing through in the last couple of months of the year The national sentiment that we all read about in the press is quite a bit different than the numbers we're seeing in the Eighth District  As for the economy overall, the only comment I'd be inclined to make is that I think there are dangers inherent in trying to apply what the economy is doing right now to what policy ought to be doing I worry increasingly about that Obviously, that doesn't take account of the lags, and there is no gauge of the thrust of policy in there That's all I have I hope we get some positive comments to follow [Laughter]   Jerry, if you think what you said sounded preposterous, wait until you hear this! To say I'm not worried about the real side would be silly; I think one has to be But at the same time, I have the feeling that there's a limit to what monetary policy can do on the real side and that whatever it can do is only temporary The permanent effect of our actions is really only on inflation And I'd have to say that policy has become very stimulative in the last six months To gauge that, I look at reserves and I look at narrow money I do that because those are things we really affect through our actions And both of those are growing at double-digit rates One can argue about what that means, Alan But in terms of being surprised about what happened to inflation, one of the things that we look at is a three-year moving average of Ml When you came on, in 1987, that was over 11 percent; and in the next three years the three- year moving average of Ml came down to about 3-1/2 percent or a little less To us that indicated that the thrust of policy was very much on a disinflationary course and we've seen that flow through Now, what worries me is that, given the actions in the last six months, that trend growth rate has moved up a full percentage point My guess is that if we did nothing further, it probably would move up another full percentage point in the first half of next year And I worry about the long run I'm not sure we've stepped into the trap yet, but I think we're getting very close to making the same mistake monetary policy typically makes at this point in the cycle in that we could be sowing the seeds of the next inflation Now, I don't disagree [about the near term] I think we're going to see very good inflation numbers in '92 and we're probably going to see very good numbers in '93 What we're doing right now isn't really going to affect those years in terms of prices I think the effects are further out It gets back to what Mike was saying before I worry about setting up a stop-and-go policy and putting us in a position where several years down the road we're going to have to tighten dramatically I think the only chance of bringing inflation down in a permanent sense is through stable policy applied over a long period of time So, that's my longer-run concern  -32-    12/17/91  In the shorter run, what I worry about is the risk in foreign exchange markets I was struck by Gretchen's describing that earlier We have a fiscal policy that's in pretty tough shape; we're going to be looking at deficits next year of 6 to 7 percent of GDP; and we're going to be hearing a lot of political discussion about other measures that might be taken on the fiscal side We could continue to have a weak economy with that background music and we could find the dollar under extreme pressure If at that time we are sitting here with a monetary policy that is way out of position--and I'm arguing that I think we're getting there fast--we could have a real problem next year So, where I come out is that I would not be inclined to change policy now Obviously, that's not going to fly; I understand that from our discussion, but that would be my preference What I would argue for, assuming that we do make a change, is that we begin to communicate in some fashion that monetary policy has done about all it can because, if we don't start getting that message out there, expectations and pressures and so forth are going to continue to try to stampede us David, you talked a bit about this I probably wouldn't favor doing it with as aggressive a step as you would, but we need to get that message out And we need to do that relatively soon or we're going to continue to get run over by these pressures   I don't think I said that, Bob  -34-    12/17/91   That we shouldn't   You don't want to hear that one again, do you Alan? I'm ""B"" symmetric   Well, I'm relieved "
4419,1992-01-09," Alan, this is Tom Melzer Just a couple of comments quickly, Jerry [With respect to the elimination of the requirement that a dealer maintain a one percent share of the total customer activity reported by all primary dealers] One thing that one percent did was to make sure that the Desk was dealing with firms who were legitimately making markets; and it sort of prohibited speculators from becoming primary dealers I understand the franchise value, particularly with respect to access to brokers and so forth It's quite a bit different than this But my presumption is that [the proposed] requirement that they make good markets in your view is sufficient to make sure that you don't end up in some sense being required to do business with a speculator None of the things is contingent on that, but that concerned me a little when I read this  One other comment On page 4 where you talk about evaluating their market-making performance and in the second sentence get into    1/9/92  the various conditions they need to meet I'm not sure I'd make those additive   The way it reads now, they would have to default on all of those things   Yes It could be embarrassing to us if we ended up with a business relationship with a firm that is simply speculating in government securities That's my point on this "
4439,1992-02-04," Second   Ted, I don't know quite what to make of this, but it seems as if your projection of consumer prices in the G-7 countries represents an extraordinary convergence of inflation rates and even of real output Am I right in making that observation? And if so, what do you think the implications of that are for exchange rates and so forth?   In terms of the outlook, our view is similar to the Board staff's We're somewhat more positive on real growth and right in the middle of the central tendency as far as inflation, as measured by the CPI, goes But what I want to comment on are the assumptions It's interesting how two people can look at the same thing in different ways Dick was worried about an unchanged interest rate [assumption] and I'm worried about what I think is another policy assumption implicit in there! [Laughter] When we do our forecast further out--this would have very little impact on '92--our presumption is that at some point, not in the reasonably near future but in the course of this year, we'd get back to Ml growth of 4 to 5 percent We don't run our projection solely on that; there's a lot of judgment implied But implicit in the policy assumptions in the Greenbook and the Bluebook is an 11 percent plus growth rate in Ml for all of 1992 Now, I guess my view is that an unchanged interest rate is not necessarily an unchanged monetary policy If we're pegging an interest rate and we have an economy that is picking up and there is greater demand for credit and associated with that transaction balances are created, we have to supply the reserves So, my view is --though some things could occur in the short run to disturb this-- that over longer periods of time if we're fostering growth in reserves and narrow money at double-digit rates, that's going to come back to roost in terms of higher inflation So, in terms of underlying assumptions looking further out, there are considerable differences The other thing in this context that troubles me in general is that this can go on with an apparently benign policy as far as M2 is concerned because only 25 percent of M2 is comprised of the Ml component; 75 percent is in the non-Mi components And special factors will hold the growth of those non-M1 components probably to zero in 1992 So, we can sit there with 10 percent Ml growth and have M2 growing at 2-1/2 percent Enough about that now, but I think we had the same sort of problem between the middle of '88 and the middle of '89 in reverse in essence, where M2 looked as if it was growing  -17-    2/4-5/92  fast enough at a rate of about 4 percent We were comfortable with that, but in fact what we were doing to maintain our pegged funds rate--which arguably was perhaps too high--at those levels was that we were pulling out reserves Ml declined and we pulled out reserves over that one-year period at an annual rate of 32 percent So, I think those are important considerations as we look ahead to tomorrow  In terms of the District, I didn't go first today--that didn't do any good last time--but the numbers still look pretty good Non-agricultural payrolls in the most recent period for which we have numbers were growing at 13 percent compared to 03 percent nationally, and we're seeing that growth both in [services and goods- producing industries], with particular strength in food and kindred products and in textiles I continue to hear this anecdotal story about textile mills running flat out [in our District]; it's partly a delivery problem as I understand it Inventories have been run down to the point where wholesalers and retailers can't wait for foreign deliveries so domestic mills are benefiting in the short run As far as construction goes, residential construction has been particularly strong over the last year Contracts have been growing at twice the national rate over that period Nonresidential construction is off over the year and most recently, but it's off I would say modestly-- about 4 percent over the course of the year--and there are no signs of further declines at least at the moment I picked up the same thing Bob Black did on the anecdotal side Over the last two or three weeks for the first time in many months, I have started to hear some positive comments from people in the housing area, from a couple of bankers talking about a pickup in loan demand both in the consumer and commercial areas, and also from the retailing side A major national retailer based in St Louis saw activity pick up in the week or two before Christmas and that pickup has been sustained throughout January At the same time they point out that this is a very promotional period in terms of prices and that, as Si mentioned, last year is really a bad benchmark But they're doing better than their plan Anyway, District-wise, the story is really about the same as I laid out last time At the moment things look pretty good   I wanted to ask Don a question; are we still in that mode?   Don, what M2 growth would you consider consistent with price stability based on what we think longer-term relationships are? Is it the 3-1/4 percent in strategy II?   In the out years is that--   Well, what if [unintelligible] will not accept zero measured inflation?   I have this view that, if we adjust our cones over the years, I don't want to get into a position where we need to move them back up if we can avoid it Ideally, in a perfect world we'd like to ratchet those things down gradually, getting to a cone that's consistent in the long run with price stability If we missed our cone, we'd explain why; but I don't envision a world in which we're juggling these things around And I was trying to get some feel for how much further we have to go; probably we'd have to ratchet it down another percentage point, maybe a little more   I prefer alternative I; I could accept alternative II First of all, I think alternative I is consistent with strategy II, which I believe in and I guess [other] people around the table also do I just wanted to make one other point in connection with this I think M2 is probably the best indicator we have of concurrent economic activity It gives us some sense of how we're doing with respect to our goals I have some problem calling it a target I don't want to get into a semantic debate and I wouldn't suggest we change how we describe it, but in my view a good target is not only something that relates to our goals but is also directly controllable by our actions As I mentioned yesterday, the component [of M2] we do control is only 25 percent of the total and our ability to indirectly influence [M2] through our influence on interest rates is questionable; I think the evidence that we've seen here recently calls that into question This isn't a proposal but I urge people not to lose sight of things like reserves, the base, and narrow money that we do directly influence because I think they give us some indication of the thrust of monetary policy actions, which I don't think M2 really gives us In that connection, I get somewhat troubled when I hear suggestions that we ought set as our longer-term goal somehow getting M2 into the upper end of the range that we're setting because if that happens under circumstances where we're getting no growth in non-M1 components of M2, we're talking about 25 to 30 percent Ml growth One can scoff at Ml, but I feel very strongly that if we put that kind of stimulus into the system over a period of 6 to 12 months,  -44-    2/4-5/92  we will have big problems Now, if we get into the upper end under different circumstances where M1 is much more controlled and some of those other components are growing, that's a different story Anyway, I would urge that we not lose sight of those [measures]; I think we need to pay attention to them I wouldn't advocate a target but we may even be at a point in time when we would want to monitor consciously or explicitly the behavior of a narrower [measure] that reflects the thrust of our objectives   I don't know about the politics of that, Alan, but that's something we ought to think about in terms of the longer- term influence of monetary policy--possibly reducing reserve requirements and spreading them more broadly over broader classes of deposits  SPEAKER(?) That's a good idea   There would be no reason for people to presume that we would be anyway if growth were in the range Isn't that right?   I would prefer ""B"" symmetric, but I have absolutely no problem with what you recommended If there were a presumption of another easing step in the asymmetry, I'd have a lot of trouble with that I agree with you that I don't think we can do anything with our policy that is going to affect what we get in fiscal policy The politicians are going to have to be seen to be doing something, and they can't just stipulate that the Fed has taken care of it and they don't have to do anything So, I agree with your analysis on that  The only other thing I would suggest--perhaps this is partly tongue in cheek but not totally--is that we ought to get an alternative C back in the Bluebook We have recognized all along that we were probably going to overshoot on the way down here There's a statement in the Bluebook that was music to my ears about unsustainably low real short-term interest rates Now, they can become sustainable, I know, through two courses But, at any rate, I think we ought to get used to looking at an alternative C because there could be circumstances where we're going to get some rope back, and it might be better to move on that sooner in small steps rather than later and not let too much build up I have no problem with alternative C not being in there for this meeting "
4463,1992-03-11," Alan, this is Tom Melzer I'm glad I didn't have to go first to try to jump start things today; it took a while to happen In our District we're seeing the same things in terms of retail sales and residential real estate that others have reported And the problem is sort of the same What has been most striking to me is that in the manufacturing area we're seeing the potential for what may be some widespread employment gains We're seeing established manufacturers calling workers back a tire manufacturer, a major household appliance producer, an electric motors company This is on top of, in the case of the major appliance producer, earlier callbacks We're also seeing expansion in activity new plants in aerospace, plastics, jet engines, and steel We're also seeing some relocations, which will result in employment gains in the District My feeling is that people don't think about relocating and consolidating plant operations and so forth if they are concerned about the outlook So, that's where we've seen the most striking new piece of anecdotal information Just on a broader note--   Actually, what I had in mind there is a new plant that has to do with the shuttle space program It wouldn't be here in St Louis   I think McDonnell on net is laying people off; they're adding some engineers here but on balance I think it's probably pretty flat   On a broader note I would suspect we're still going to see mixed data Right now, as Bill mentioned in his foreign exchange report, everybody is reacting to the positive information It wouldn't surprise me as we go on here and see some additional negative information to have expectations swing in the other direction But from a monetary policy point of view, I think we have to be very cautious about responding to that because I do have the feeling that we may be at the incipient stage of a recovery And our focus is going to have to shift from the concept of trying to let more line out to getting the line back in I'm not talking about when we next meet certainly, but I think we just have to be very cautious at this stage about how we react to incoming data and shifting expectations I expect them to continue to be quite volatile, and we have to take a longer-term view of things "
4489,1992-03-31," Just a quick question   Fundamentally and technically    3/31/92   Peter, let's say we did tilt toward doing more operations in longer coupons I don't know what your reaction would be, but it seems to me that a cynical market observer could question what that implies in terms of the System's long-term commitment toward price stability I don't want to carry this too far, but to the extent we are seen trying to jawbone long rates down or conducting operations that substantively are not going to have a lot of impact, if someone looked at that cynically they could view that as window- dressing to try to hold long rates down while perhaps we were trying to pursue basic policies that weren't consistent with price stability Do you see the opportunities for that kind of cynical interpretation?   My point, Alan, was that there's probably no problem doing what [Peter is] suggesting, but it's probably better for us if it's just done quietly than if for some reason what we do attracts publicity That's my point   No, I know   In our District the statistics continue to be generally positive We have modest nonagricultural employment growth; manufacturing employment is down modestly compared to the prior three- month period but that's more than offset by gains in nonmanufacturing I would say that manufacturing has been bouncing around a little; I think I reported a modest increase last time Both residential and nonresidential construction contracts are quite strong, up about 15 percent in each category against the prior three-month period And the banking numbers that I report on periodically have continued strong through the fourth quarter Basically, the question always is Will those numbers hold up through year-end reserving and so forth? And in our case they did ROAs are still around 1 percent; ROEs are around 12 percent; nonperforming loans are flat and also are fully reserved  On the anecdotal side, I've had three or four contacts with branch boards or our board and other groups since our conference call, and I would say that the pattern I've heard there supports the more positive tone that seemed to emerge on that call I continue to be struck by people reporting plant relocations, plant expansions, labor callbacks, and so forth So, I get the sense that this [better tone] is gradually working its way back into the manufacturing sector We had a group of CFOs in from major St Louis companies, and I would say that in general the picture I got from them was not as positive as some of this other information They still view this as a very difficult business environment with not a lot of flexibility on the price side They are basically either maintaining or increasing earnings through a lot of focus on the cost side So, that pattern goes on  Nationally, the only comment I would have is that our forecast generally is in line with the Board staff's in terms of real growth looking out to 1993 On the price side, we're not quite as optimistic and generally are getting increasingly concerned about the stance of policy vis-a-vis what might be shaping up on the real side   I'd prefer ""B"" symmetric but I can live with what you proposed One of the concerns I have in that regard is the public relations aspect of it I know [our directive] doesn't get [published] for a long time but if we were releasing it today after the meeting I think a lot of people would react by saying ""Oh my god, what are they worried about?""   Well, I'm not suggesting that it should be   Well, I guess unfortunately, I always operate on the theory--and I'm not commenting on the FOMC in particular but in general--that if I make a decision, no matter how hard I try, it's likely to become known So, I frankly worry about that And I think  -33-    3/31/92  symmetric language gives us every bit of flexibility that asymmetric does to respond  Let me just comment about what I touched on earlier when I said I was becoming increasingly concerned about the posture of policy I think M2 over long periods of time is a reasonable indicator of economic activity I think it's helpful in that regard, but it doesn't tell us anything about the thrust of policy And I do think we have to pay some attention to the narrower aggregates whether it's reserves, the base, or Ml I'd be ready to admit, as a lot of other people would point out, that some technical factors very likely are influencing the growth of Ml right now But what I worry about, and I've said these things before, is this In an interest rate targeting regime like we have, if we have that rate pegged at the wrong level in relation to where policy ought to be given what the economy is doing, the only way we're going to keep it there if it's pegged too low is by pumping in more and more reserves Now, we've seen short-term market rates in this period move up 20 to 25 basis points I'm willing to say in that connection that that probably just reflects wringing out expectations that were built into the yield curve that short rates were going to continue to fall--that policy would continued to be eased--and I think those have been washed out For at least some period of time here, I think the market is discounting an unchanged policy But I would begin to get more and more concerned if short-term market rates worked their way up even further and we continued to hold the funds rate at 4 percent because in effect that would be indicating to us that we're having to pursue a more and more stimulative policy to hold it there So, that's my concern But at this meeting, I think there's enough uncertainty in terms of what is going on with Ml on the technical side to come out for an unchanged policy and watch for a while But what I'm worried about is that we may conceivably be getting out of position in a longer-term sense "
4514,1992-05-19," I'd like to make two general comments; the first relates to M2 and how to interpret that One comment that I don't think has been made in the comments we've heard today is that some work we've done would indicate in our view that the relationship of M2 to nominal GDP is stationary only over very long periods of time I think we're talking five or more years It follows from that that the ability to predict velocity shifts in the short run is not at all good Therefore, the idea that--and I'm not suggesting anybody has advocated this--M2 can be used as a short-term targeting tool for  -21-    5/19/92  monetary policy, as far as I'm concerned, just doesn't fly To some extent, I think the emphasis that we have placed on that target has perhaps in a public relations sense painted us into a corner somewhat, and there are probably ways to deal with that by citing some other factors But the fact is, when push comes to shove in the short run, I would have a hard time justifying a policy action aimed at trying to get M2 into the target range or to some point in the target range for these very reasons I've cited Obviously, it's better to be in the target range, but if we have questions about whether M2 is [outside the range because of] technical or fundamental factors--and we're pretty confident there are some important technical factors--I would be inclined to explain those and take the heat for missing it That's the first point I wanted to make  The other point, which relates generally to the economy, is that we're a year into the recovery now and my sense is, both in terms of the statistics that we see and what I hear anecdotally, that the pace is picking up Obviously, the recovery is not in line with other post World War II recoveries, but I think it's well in place and picking up And I'd say that in general other forecasters are probably looking for the best inflation performance in 1992 with some pickup in '93 Now, we all know what the Board staff's forecast is; but even there Mike has seen fit, based on some recent information, to ratchet the forecast up And I think we've seen from time-to-time, not at the present moment, in the bond market and perhaps to some extent in the foreign exchange markets some questions about the Fed's resolve with respect to long-run price stability and so forth versus short-run fine-tuning of the real economy The point I would make with respect to that is that I don't think one can get terribly alarmed by anything we've seen in those areas as yet, but once it's clear in those indicators that we've lost credibility it's very hard and very expensive to buy it back So, in my view we want to stay ahead of that All of this is to suggest that I think the time really has come for us to focus not on when we're going to ease next but on when it is we are going to tighten And my final point on credibility is that while words can help, this is one of those times when people are going to watch what we do, not what we say  Just very quickly on our District, the picture is the same as I presented last month We are continuing to have moderate growth On the employment side, [growth] is coming primarily in the services area Manufacturing is still sluggish In particular, strength on the nonmanufacturing side is coming in construction; we have residential and nonresidential contracts up 20 to 30 percent from the prior three-month period My sense is that in the nonresidential sector it's primarily in the industrial area I don't have any sense of [much] going on with transactions in office buildings and so forth at this time Finally, just the tone of the comments I pick up is improving The anecdotal information seems to confirm this picture we've been looking at for some time in terms of improving economic activity in our District   Jerry, I might interject for those who worry about money that from the third quarter of 1987 to the first quarter of 1992, M2 grew at a 42 percent annual rate even with all the weakness we've had recently   Yes   No, I don't   I'd favor ""B"" asymmetric toward tightening I think we've had a stimulative policy in place, no matter how you look at it, for a long period of time And, at a minimum, that's consistent with recovery and expansion Consistent with what Jerry was saying, I also think there's a risk as this expansion progresses that our policy, in terms of interest rates, is likely to be inconsistent with progress toward price stability We ought to be mindful of that I was quite comfortable with what you said in responding to Governor Lindsey, Alan Your earlier comments about perhaps seeing an opportunity to coax long rates lower worried me a little That may be possible at points in time, but I think it's very risky business at the level of short-term real rates we have right now and could well backfire, for what that's worth Finally, I could live with your prescription of ""B"" symmetrical but I'd prefer ""B"" asymmetrical toward tightening "
4540,1992-06-30," Bill, you mentioned the market's expectations with respect to what might come out in Munich in terms of multilateral intervention Is there validity to that? Is that an expectation that has some substance behind it?   In terms of the economic projections, we're an outlier at the high end in both years on real GDP and the CPI I don't put a lot of credence in these projections in general in terms of how helpful they really are in the policymaking process But even if we were where the staff is, with a somewhat more modest projected recovery, I would actually be somewhat encouraged by that I think the monetary policies that we have pursued really have been quite different than those pursued in and around other postwar recessions And I think the fact that we're coming out of this recession with a much more modest growth rate gives us the chance to make some sustainable progress on the price front I would say in general that the pattern in the past was that monetary policy was much too stimulative in and immediately following recessions; and that has been associated with much higher rates of real growth than we're seeing now But that creates relatively soon, in a matter of several years, a fairly tricky [choice to] reverse course to keep things expanding So, I'm actually not discouraged by what we're seeing here In terms of what our fundamental job is, that may set up a unique opportunity for us The other thing, which is not something that I've heard around this table but when I read it in the papers I cringe, is this thought that the low measured inflation we're seeing right now somehow gives us room to do things It may in a sense if we could perform this high wire act and figure out when to reverse [course] again But I really think the effect of our actions on inflation ought to be based on what we see happening two or three years down the road and not on the concept that low measured inflation right now gives us perceived room in somebody's mind to do something  As far as what we're seeing in the Eighth District, it's the same pattern that I've been reporting We continue to have job growth that's considerably in excess of what we're seeing nationally And the pattern is still the same We're seeing very modest declines on the manufacturing side that are made up by fairly significant growth on the non-manufacturing side, generally across the board except in mining There is particular strength in construction; residential construction contracts remain very strong We're seeing some slowing on the commercial side, which had also been very strong The anecdotal information that I'm hearing is consistent with continuing improvement I'm not picking up any ebullience but I haven't picked up some of the negative vibrations that I've heard others report here In terms of the anecdotal information, I see a pattern, for what it's  -18-    6/30-7/1/92  worth, of an expansion that's continuing to take hold, with confidence among consumers and business people that is increasing and no warning signs on that front   No, on the high side   That sounded like 50 percent agreement to me, Bob!   Alan, I'm in agreement with what you recommend The only other comment I would make is that in principle I'd align myself with what Jerry was suggesting and I think Bob was suggesting in terms of what these targets represent If, let's say, we were experiencing some temporary demand shifts or whatever but we still felt confident about longer-term relationships between money and income, I would like to get to the point eventually where we set the targets to be consistent with what we think is an environment of price stability In other words, we should gradually work them down to some level that we think is [unintelligible], explaining why we missed and not get into the mode that Bob suggested of possibly moving these targets up and down based on what could be short-term [developments] That's a moot point in this context, I totally agree   Oh, I understand that I'm just expressing my view on that point, but I totally agree with where you are right now   Alan, just to clarify Your proposal for '93 would be just to stick with what we had in '92 and explain? It's not to say that we have nothing for '93   Right And that will be what we had in '92?   Okay If we do that, I think a lot of the public is not going to look at the nuances, though some people will But they would really notice if there were nothing there  -47-    6/30-7/1/92   I agree   I come out the same place, Alan I feel that symmetry is an important issue At the last meeting we in effect communicated to the public--probably earlier than intended though it should be communicated this Friday--the fact that our having moved to symmetric language at that time was quite significant And to move back to asymmetry toward ease would communicate the wrong [message] about how we ought to approach this process There's no question about it There's a lot of uncertainty now But I don't think we can let ourselves get whipped around by these changing expectations the same way speculators in financial markets do We have to take a much longer view and we have to be willing to look through one month or two months; we have to be looking at quarterly or longer numbers So, in a sense the message we're sending here is a very confusing one and probably a much more significant one than anything we might do with long-run ranges It gets back to the issue of ""Look at what we do and not what we say,"" but this is something that we say that's much more significant, I think, than the long-term ranges  The reason I come out where I do is that first of all, I think we have an expansion in place somewhere around the economy's potential I think at a minimum monetary policy is consistent with that expansion process In other words, I don't have the sense that the economy is being choked by any means on the liquidity front As the expansion progresses and it comes through in a number of ways--you just said it yourself in your comments and I think it's implicit in some things in the Bluebook--we're going to have to be going in the other direction And to be thinking about additional ease now makes that next job that much tougher Again, I don't want to flip-flop It's really in the context of where we were last time In general, thinking along those lines at this stage has some important credibility effects which could be reflected in long markets and in the foreign exchange market I don't really put much credence in declines in longer-term yields that are supposedly associated with expectations of ease I think what tends to happen is that when that sense develops, speculators [find] that a very effective vehicle in which to speculate That's where one gets the most bang for the buck The speculators get in there; they may drive yields down temporarily but in the event you could have a lot of sellers [who are] very disappointed So, I take heart in the fact that whatever disappointment was reflected in our moving to asymmetry last time washed out fairly quickly and long-term yields worked their way down Obviously, they may have come down a little further on some of this speculative behavior I'm describing, but I think that's how we're going to make our contribution We took a stand last time and I think this is the time to stay with it  -69-    6/30-7/1/92   Do we have more confidence in the funds rate?   Just by stating those low growth rates on the very face of it we've indicated that we're willing to accept those growth rates even though they are below the target range That is the confusion we're trying to clear up with that last sentence I think we could take the last sentence out altogether   Starting with ""however""? "
4574,1992-08-18," In our District I would say that the same shift that Bob McTeer described has occurred statistically We are looking now at June numbers and I would describe the situation as one where we've had modest employment growth, manufacturing more or less flat or maybe slightly negative, and nonmanufacturing offsetting that For the most recent three-month period, we actually have nonmanufacturing [activity] flattening out and modest employment declines I would say that one of the areas in nonmanufacturing that is particularly weak from an employment point of view is construction and that's reflected in contracts--residential as well as nonresidential--although compared to a year ago we're still up very significantly in the residential area Anecdotally, it's hard to place in time when some of this was detectable; it may have been a couple months ago But basically I don't detect any major shift in sentiment toward the negative I spoke with a handful of CFOs of some of our major companies, and in the retailing area the description I got was the same as what was mentioned earlier--I forget by whom, maybe Si--that the first couple of weeks of July were very strong and then sales slowed and [the slowdown] seemed to continue into August The retailer who passed that along said to me that they're not sure but they think the Olympic coverage may have had something to do with that; he likened it to the CNN effect to some extent Another retailer described things as generally volatile Every time they think things may be coming together they have a downturn From a profitability point of view, the largest of the retailers I've talked to had just reported a very strong quarter and they got it basically by controlling costs On the manufacturing side, a major electrical equipment manufacturer described their consumer-driven business as very strong They, too, reported very strong earnings, largely again a contribution of cost controls and so forth I did talk to a chemical manufacturer as well; a lot of their chemical business is driven by the auto business and housing and that has been generally sluggish, with no particular signs of strength there The capital goods side is described as sluggish, basically Order backlogs are holding up but not growing very rapidly So, the general picture I get from business people is that the environment hasn't changed dramatically  With respect to monetary policy--just picking up on some of the comments that have been made, particularly Ed Boehne's in terms of what the role is for monetary policy in this sort of environment--I agree that monetary policy can't solve some of the structural problems that we're dealing with And at least in my view, whether you look at interest rates or reserves, we're pursuing a very easy monetary policy right now Short-term real rates are negative and reserves over the last two quarters have grown at almost a 17 percent annual rate compared to a four-year trend of about 4-1/2 percent I know it's a very difficult period in which to get a handle on the thrust of monetary policy, but I think there's a lot of danger in focusing just on the real economy as our guide for what we ought to be doing--and that seems to be what is happening--and not trying to look at policy from some other perspectives I think we've had some warnings in the  -25-    8/18/92  foreign exchange markets and in long-term credit markets from time-to- time depending on what statements are made--albeit those rates have come down--that we may be testing the limits of our credibility And we could well find ourselves in a situation here given the season--and I gather some people are looking at the same facts and coming out a different door--where we're going to want all the credibility we can get If we don't have any, since we're the only game in town in that respect, we could have some very serious problems   I would not favor ""D"" I had some sentiment for ""C,"" but I am a little concerned about the precision that second sentence might imply I don't have any problem with the concept of doing ""C"" and then saying we don't think we're going to make the ranges for the year I don't have a suggested change, but I think the words here may imply more certainty about these relationships than we have; I think Wayne was saying the same thing I could live with ""B""   I favor ""B"" symmetric, Alan I won't go into a lot of reasons; it's essentially for the same reasons that I cited at the last meeting but I feel even more strongly about them I think credibility is more of an issue now Also, we just eased and, if you think about it in percentage terms, it was a 15 percent cut in the level of nominal rates; that's not insignificant Finally, I think this view captures a number of people who want to ease right away, and  -42-    8/18/92  I just feel so strongly that that's the wrong thing to do that I guess it's hard for me to put myself in that group "
4601,1992-10-06," Joan, I know this most recent reserve period started off with continued pressure on the funds rate I don't know if that has continued into this week or not Were you surprised by that? I know the quarter-end has passed and we may still have Treasury balance problems and so forth How do you evaluate that?   At whose expense, right?   Move it    10/6/92   Ted, maybe I read too much into your comments, but you seem to take some comfort in the fact that the dollar is up on a trade-weighted exchange basis something like 1-1/2 percent over the intermeeting period and maybe 4-1/2 percent from the lows I must say I don't share that [view] The reason is that when one looks at how we've done against the other two principal reserve currencies, the DM and the yen, [the dollar is] down significantly and at historical lows I'm concerned that in a period of international turmoil we're really not providing much of an option in terms of a safe haven, and I think we ought to take note of that I don't know what your reaction to that is I would have expected that we would have provided more of an option and that in fact maybe we were part of the problem rather than the solution So, I just don't take that much comfort in looking at the broad trade-weighted exchange rate   At the last meeting I reported that our picture, which had been generally positive on the employment front, had weakened a bit That would be the case in the most recent period as well We have modest declines in employment, more in manufacturing than nonmanufacturing Earlier on, gains in nonmanufacturing were really offsetting the weakness in manufacturing Notwithstanding those numbers, I have not detected any significant change in attitudes among directors and other people I talk with Last week I was in two areas of our District that probably have never seen a recession, as a matter of fact Many businessmen I talked to--these tend to be small and medium-sized businessmen--are reporting record years and yet they just feel lousy Their complaints run to things like regulation, clean air, ABA, and things like that and the impact those things are having on them There's a great deal of uncertainty or lack of confidence--I don't know how to describe it It's just a not good feeling about where we're going or a lack of knowledge or confidence about where we're going And that, I think, is really affecting people I picked up the same thing we've heard from Ed and Gary Very seldom does anybody say that additional interest rate cuts are going to help; in fact they say quite the opposite  On the banking side in the Eighth District, as I've commented from time-to-time, our numbers still are looking very good We are outperforming our peers We tend to look at banks of less than $15 billion and I guess the most significant point is that nonperforming loans are lower--about 1-1/2 percent versus almost 3 percent in the peer group--and charge-offs are half that of the peer group, maybe 1/2 of 1 percent versus 1 percent I think that's the principal thing affecting results So, all during this period I've perceived our banks to be in a position to extend credit and I've felt that demand has been the problem, not supply We've seen modest growth in loan    10/6/92  demand over the last year and that has continued in the most recent period The most significant point is that it's across the board this time around We've all read articles recently about the increase in [banks'] securities portfolios Over the last year those have grown about 18 percent in our District but in the most recent quarter only 2 percent So, I sense that what is going on--and I don't know whether it is a harbinger of things to come more broadly--is that with a healthy banking sector we are beginning to see a little more loan demand, which is being reflected not only in the loan growth but in much slower growth in holdings of investment securities Probably, in terms of the aggregates, as demand picks up that will get reflected in M2 As you all know, the non-M1 components are really very weak-- negative--and all the growth we're getting in M2 is from very rapid Ml growth  Commenting nationally, the one concern I have about Mike's forecast is the longer-run inflation outlook I hope he's right I have no quibbles with what inflation is likely to be next year and maybe well into 1994, but the lags here are very long And one of the things I've commented on from time-to-time is this trend growth in Ml, which is a 3-year moving average I don't think we can make short- term policy decisions based on the short-term behavior of Ml; but over longer periods of time it gives us some information on what the thrust of policy has been From, say, late '86 or early '87 we had brought that trend growth down from 11 percent to roughly 3 percent In early 1990 it moved up in a relatively short period of time to over 7 percent and, of course, M1 is growing at about 15 percent now Again, I don't know that it has any relevance for decisions we'll be making today but longer term I worry about whether or not we're trading away some of that basis for lower inflation that we had created several years ago and that we're reaping the benefits of now  Just a couple of other comments, quickly One has to do with market expectations and whether we should gratify them or not because they're there or whether that gives us room to move I think we have to recognize that when this party comes to an end, whenever that is, it's going to be disruptive In other words, we've had a long period of declining interest rates and human nature, being what it is, is going to anticipate more That's just the way behavior in markets tends to work over time So, whenever the time comes for us to say ""that's it,"" it's going to be difficult I don't think that will ever be easy The other general observation I would make is that I'm more sensitive about the risks in foreign exchange markets, [along the lines of] Governor Angell's comments, than what I've heard in general around the table I just feel that that's a process; we learned this in the mid '80s Monetary policy was very stimulative for a long period of time and the chickens really didn't come home to roost in the foreign exchange markets until '87 as a result of actions that were taken in '85 and '86 I think we all know from that experience that once they do, it's awfully hard to get them under control again While it's easy to say that another 25 basis points may not engender any kind of crisis, if it ever did we would have one big problem on our hands   Alan, if it were up to me, I'd prefer to take action here at this meeting Having said that, I would vote ""no"" [Laughter] I basically view the hard asymmetric you've described as a decision to move It's almost a certainty And for the reasons I've articulated at other meetings, I just can't support that I think we're expecting far too much out of monetary policy as a short-run, fine-tuning tool for the real economy Frankly, I think there probably would be some benefits in terms of stability and so forth in communicating to markets The easing is over; now let's adjust to this level of rates and work from here I think there's ample stimulus in train To cite a quote from you ""My mild state of delusion continues"" [Laughter] "
4628,1992-11-17," On a District basis I don't have anything new to report The statistics or anecdotal information we have suggest that the Eighth District is growing modestly more rapidly than the rest of the country, but there are no really dramatic changes  On the national front, I would have two brief comments One is--and I think Mike Prell allowed for this in commenting on the forecast--that I personally wouldn't be nearly as sanguine about the long-run inflation outlook as the forecast is with an assumption of an unchanged funds rate I'm talking about looking out a couple of years I have trouble with that working out that way Secondly--and this is by no means a criticism of the staff's efforts to forecast because I think the staff is among the best in terms of that job, but it's a very difficult job--the third quarter served as a reminder to me of the questionability, if you will, of short-run fine-tuning monetary policy based on economic forecasts As good as that process may be, it's a very, very difficult thing to do We essentially are looking at a rate of growth in GDP that is probably twice what we thought a couple of FOMC meetings ago If you look back over time, I think that pattern repeats itself So, I was reminded of that and thought I'd share that  -13-    11/17/92   I would favor reducing the ranges now and I think a range of 2 to 6 percent is probably right I could live with 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent A case can be made for either one With respect to the timing, I feel the case is there now and we ought to go ahead and get it done As a lot of people said, we don't know in what climate we would be trying to do this some months down the road I would go somewhat beyond making the argument just a technical one because I think we're trying in some sense to consolidate the progress we've already made toward price stability In terms of impacting expectations, that could be a part of it without implying that we're rattling the saber; it would have to be done artfully The other thing to think about, which you mentioned, is the communications problem I guess there really isn't an opportunity to arrange some sort of forum Congress is not going to be in session for the balance of the year, is that right?   You might want to consider ways to take the initiative here--in a speech or something--so that you could get the message out with your spin on it rather than responding to, say, Mr Gonzalez, or somebody in the press teeing off on it If we were going to do it now, we'd have to think about ways to communicate it to the public on our terms, not in response to somebody else's  With respect to short-term policy, I strongly favor ""B"" symmetric There's a possibility I might even be leaning toward a nonexistent ""C"" The way I feel about this is that we've had a relatively smooth adjustment in financial markets to a significant change in perceptions about the thrust of monetary policy I don't believe for one minute that what we've seen in intermediate-term rates is a response to what our economy needs I think it reflects a lot of other factors with respect to expectations about inflation and the real economy So, if we were to ease now, I don't think those rates would retrace their runup; I don't know to what extent they'd even come down I realize every cycle is different, but in general I think this is the time when the Fed typically makes mistakes because we sit here and we're uncertain about the speed of the recovery We all probably know, or I at least feel, that we're pegging short-term rates at a level that is not sustainable in an economy with any kind of upward momentum I think we have to be very sensitive to a situation where short-term market rates move up as we peg the funds rate to fixed levels This is obviously not a new concept; we've talked about it before But the net result is that to keep that administered rate where it is we have to provide reserves at a very rapid rate, and we're doing that There are certainly some technical factors one can point to in that regard, but I suspect there may be more to it than that So, I think we have to be very sensitive to not overstaying [ease] Finally, I think a symmetrical directive gives us plenty of flexibility to respond in either direction   I don't mean to interrupt, but if we're not going to do anything now--if there's a sense of the meeting not to do anything--do we really have to vote on it?   If we're just leaving the ranges the same--   One of the things we ought to focus on also is this issue of accountability and the assertion that individually we're not accountable I don't agree with that I'm not an expert on the Supreme Court by any means, but there may be a helpful precedent there in terms of the concept of a majority opinion and then minority opinions I'm not sure, for example, what discussions and negotiations go on in the Supreme Court to get the majority to sign off on a majority opinion But I suspect that such discussions don't take place in the Sunshine And I think the same principle probably applies here An important starting point for this is asserting that we are accountable and--this may sound strange coming from me--that this is a consensus oriented body When one ultimately signs off on the policy record, one has implicitly bought into the view that is stated [in that document] or if one has dissented, the record states why Through that vehicle, for starters I think everybody is accountable I can appreciate what a benefit a more detailed record might be to historians and others later, but the problem I have is that it comes at considerable administrative cost Let's say we did the memoranda of discussion; I suspect that participants would come in to the meeting and say ""I have my written statement that I'm going to come in and read"" There would be more of that rather than people reacting to the discussion at hand or a combination of each of us presenting [views] that we had in mind coming into the meeting and reacting to the discussion that goes on We'd have to get advice from the lawyers on this, but I worry about going down that path If in effect we say we're willing to do this--to create a memorandum of discussion if Congress gives us this protection--it would be very easy to lose whatever protection we need under FOI, yet we'd be stuck in terms of saying it would acceptable to us to do this I think the end result would be, first of all, that we'd have a much more cumbersome process and secondly, that we'd very likely end up releasing the memoranda a lot sooner than we'd like to  -53-    11/17/92  The final point I would make is this I've been intrigued with this idea of whether we can cut the legs out from under some of this argument by releasing more promptly something very simple after each meeting regarding the decision that was made Did the Committee decide to tighten, ease, or maintain the same degree of reserve restraint? But to the extent that we go down that path--a number of people have mentioned this--we really have to think about that very carefully in that it starts to raise questions of whether we include the asymmetry of the [directive] language in [what we release] Think about what the markets would have done after the last meeting if we had released the directive with asymmetry toward ease and then never acted And what do we do about decisions in between meetings? Are those disclosed on a real-time basis or are those disclosed at the next meeting? I suspect that we could get trapped into what more and more would become a very complicated web It's seductive in a way because I think all of us probably believe that the information on our actions is in the market right away; generally speaking, the problem is not that the markets do not know where the Fed is at a point in time But there's this perception of secrecy So, it's very seductive to think we can cut the legs out from under that But if we go down that path, we really have to think through all the ramifications   Right   When I go full circle on this issue, where I come out is that if it's defensible, what we're doing right now is probably about right, subject to thinking about something along the lines that you just described   I'm not sure we'd want to disclose it so soon   We can just disclose actions taken  -60-    11/17/92   Yes   Just a very quick comment on earlier release of the policy record A couple of people said they weren't sure that we could defend what we're doing now I would just say that it would be normal in a body like this in effect to review the minutes of the [previous] meeting when the body gets together again, because there's always the possibility that somebody who reads that last revision has a problem with it and we're all together and can resolve that and close out that issue Whereas if we're reviewing the minutes in effect through a series of independent calls, we would never have that opportunity And I think we could defend it on that basis "
4664,1992-12-22," I'd like to make three comments on the national economy First, just as a lesson for the future, I'd like to remind us all that as recently as two meetings ago we couldn't see the strength that was unfolding in the second half That isn't a criticism of the Greenbook forecast It wasn't in our forecast; it wasn't in other forecasts; and it wasn't in the anecdotal reports We were standing right on top of it and we couldn't see it That's just an important lesson to remember going forward It's not a question in my mind of whether we made mistakes in the forecast It just points out how difficult it is to do that and really use it as a basis for making policy decisions Secondly, I realize that Mike has to make an assumption with respect to what policy is going to be, but it's just inconceivable to me that we'll get through 1993 without an increase in the funds rate The real issue may be that we are probably lucky to be getting out of 1992 without making one; I think it's something we're going to have to be thinking about a lot sooner than [the staff's] assumptions might imply  The final point I'd like to make, and it relates to the second one, is that it troubles me greatly when I read pieces in the paper--I don't hear it around this table--about how we need to have more economic stimulus, whether it's fiscal stimulus or monetary stimulus, to increase the rate of employment growth In my mind, the reason that we're seeing sluggish employment growth is that we're getting good productivity gains, and that's what one would expect at this stage of the cycle Those gains are going to provide the basis for increased output and income and eventually employment down the road To jeopardize this basic setting we have of declining inflation or to jeopardize the progress that we're making toward price stability in order to try to increase employment gains would be a mistake The final observation I'd make on that particular issue is that just because of demographics and slower labor force growth, we won't be seeing the kind of employment gains that we've seen in other recoveries That's an important factor in that  With respect to the District, my comment would be that in employment basically we're seeing a pickup in momentum For a good deal of the months during the middle part of this year, I wouldn't say we were lagging but the pace had slowed to that in the rest of the country I'm seeing increased momentum in the most recent three-month period in relation to the last year and significantly higher gains both in the last three months and over the last year than for the nation as a whole So, we have another one of those situations where there are very significant regional differences that are somewhat masked in the overall numbers   I'm wondering how I can outdo Wayne here! I would favor ""B"" biased toward tightening, but I could accept ""B"" symmetric And just for the video cameras, I once dissented in favor of an easier policy in 1989!  Alan, just to pick up on what you were saying, if you're right about this productivity phenomenon--and I know you weren't asserting this but just laid it out as an explanation--and we in effect have greater potential than we realize but temporarily we also have associated debt and more unemployment, this goes back to what I was saying before I really don't think it's the job of monetary policy to hurry the adjustment [process] along, and I don't think you were suggesting that The economy is going to have to absorb that, and we've got to focus on price stability As I think Don said at the end of his statement, we can't use a pickup in inflation as our signal that we need to begin to tighten policy I've heard that suggested, but if we wait until then I think all of us know that we're going to be way too late--probably by not just a matter of months but by years  The other thing I would say is that [when we were easing policy] we said that we would very likely overshoot in terms of trying to stimulate the economy and get the funds rate too low, but that once things turned around--and I know this turnaround has been long in coming and there is still uncertainty about it--we would have to be prepared to pull that rope back fairly quickly I think we're approaching that point That's what I have to say "
4704,1993-02-02," Bill, do you have any sense of what the market is discounting on the mix of this refunding package? Is there an expectation of a significant reduction in the [size of the] bond [issue]?   Al Broaddus asked my question   In terms of our projection overall, we're at the high end of the central tendencies except, of course, for unemployment where we're at the low end I'd make several observations about these projections One point I've made before is that because of the [wide] confidence intervals I think it's a very difficult basis on which to make policy And that's particularly true with respect to timeframes and inflation Our inflation forecast for '93, even though it is at the high end of the central tendency, is still what I would call a very benign forecast But in a sense it's irrelevant because of the impact of policy on prices and much longer time lags in that area Just as an aside, Mr Chairman, as you're thinking about the Humphrey- Hawkins testimony, given particularly what I read on the questioning at some of the [previous] hearings, that might not be a bad point to make about current price performance I'm not making it the way you would in testimony, but I'd suggest a little education about [the fact that] future price behavior is not necessarily governed by what is happening right now with respect to prices  I have the general sense that the pieces seem to be in place for a fairly strong cumulative upturn So, in terms of the risk in the forecast, I would say that there's a significant upside risk I'm not as confident that we'll see continuing declines in inflation over the next couple of years as in the Board staff's forecast  District-wide we're seeing an acceleration of economic activity It's pretty consistent with what Bob Forrestal was saying I guess a change from ""modest"" to ""moderate"" is probably reasonable, Bob In the most recent three-month period we are seeing 2 percent employment growth and before we were seeing growth in maybe tenths of a percent Still, we have more or less the same pattern--flat--in manufacturing employment; the growth in the District is coming from the nonmanufacturing sectors The other comment I would make is that even in that 2 percent growth number we're absorbing fairly significant head winds in a couple of areas, specifically electrical equipment and construction In that three-month period both declined 3 or 4 times as much as they did nationally and [yet] we're still showing that kind of overall growth for the District As far as real estate is concerned, the residential side is a strong point, as has been mentioned for some other areas We are seeing in the most recent period some weakness in the commercial area, but on an annual basis we still have significant growth in both residential and nonresidential construction  As for anecdotal comments, what I've experienced is very much similar to what Al Broaddus described The tone of the comments I'm  -16-    2/2-3/93 -17-  picking up--and I guess the sample where I have the most consistent experience would be our St Louis directors--has changed very dramatically in the last two times we've talked about monetary policy in that the comments are much more positive What I sense is a lot of caution, though, with respect to getting too optimistic In other words, I don't sense the ebullience that I have read into some of the comments here; there is still a good deal of caution And I think we may be affected by [the fact that] this whole recovery and expansion process has taken so long that it's difficult to make oneself get too constructive about it But the tone of the comments definitely has changed   I had some similar thoughts, but I would favor alternative II, though I could certainly live with what you have suggested I think some reduction in the M2 range is important I don't think one can emphasize too much this credibility point that you made and [the need to avoid] any perception whatsoever that we're caving in to political pressures It's not just a question of the Fed's credibility as an institution I think it's very important to US economic policy right now in general that we guard that credibility I have suggestions similar to Bob's with respect to things that could be said There is the technical issue I think the way to deal with Bob's point on inflation may simply be to say something along the lines of ""Just recognize the progress that has been made in bringing inflation down"" That in a sense is a technical argument, too, that ought to be recognized in the ranges as a technical point without any implications with respect to rattling the saber As to the future, I think Bob's point on controllability is a good one, as is what you said about controllability; it's something I've agreed with for a long time I think the value of M2 when it was behaving was never as a target but as an indicator of what was going on in nominal GDP and not something that we could influence I guess that raises another possibility in terms of things you might say, a la Steve Axilrod's suggestion, but it might not be a bad idea to point out at this time that we need to look at a broad range of things other monetary indicators, the behavior of the economy, etc It's just a good time to make the point that we're required to set these-- you've made this point before--but we look at a broad range of indicators in making policy decisions When you said ""forget the whole thing,"" I trust what you were talking about was that at this point in time, given the uncertainties, it would be a mistake if we as the central bank backed away in a long-term sense from trying to understand the behavior of money and having money in some sort of--  -43-    2/2-3/93   At this point in time?   Okay   Right   I favor ""B"" asymmetric toward tightening, but I could support symmetry I have sympathy for what Wayne said, and in a sense it was all summed up in the discussion yesterday about our inflation forecast versus the Blue Chip forecast If our staff forecast is right, 3 percent is probably not a problem; if the Blue Chip forecast is right, it's probably a big problem And I think we have to be very sensitive to that   What do you mean by an ""actual action"" announcement?   How about intermeeting moves? How would you view those?   Okay   Okay And that's embodied in ""E,"" as you've said, right?    2/2-3/93   Okay I misunderstood what you were saying I thought you were going beyond what was in ""E"" "
4722,1993-02-18," Alan, I think what Jerry might want to do is to add to the statement you started to read about overdoing it   Alan, this is Tom Melzer This is not something in the written statement but it picks up on something you said before and just mentioned a minute ago that I think you may have to be a little careful on And that is saying ""let the markets be the arbiter,"" with the implication being that if long-rates come down, that perhaps creates some scope for monetary policy to be eased Now, I think that might be right if the posture of current monetary policy tended to be one of leaning against inflationary pressures in the economy and we were [restrictive] in some sense But I don't know whether that would necessarily indicate a situation where real rates are larger [unintelligible] zero; it may not be a [restrictive] policy in a current sense So I think it's really very tricky for you to say even that I know there are conditions under which that would obtain; but if you say that, it creates the implication that if long rates came down and stayed down, then people could reasonably expect us to lower short rates And I'm not sure that we want to be in that position  -8-    2/18/93   No, I understand   Yes, okay "
4745,1993-03-23," I was just going to make a comment This draft that you're seeing is the first draft that we've seen on the subcommittee too In concept it sounded like it made some sense When I looked at it and compared it against the policy record, it seemed to me almost impossible to do it without adding meaning Now, I think it's a good summary for somebody who's not going to bother to read the policy record But I think the people who will read these, the press and the Fed watchers, can read more meaning into it For example--I don't want to beat this to death--where it talks about the Committee's commitment to maximum sustainable economic expansion the word ""noninflationary"" was added here and it wasn't in the policy record Or where it talks about the uncertainty with respect to velocity, in the policy record that led us in effect to say that we were willing to miss the ranges; in the summary it says that it led us to conclude that we have to evaluate monetary developments in a broader context, which is said later in the policy record I'm just saying that all the people who read this are going to add meaning that we may not have intended by how we say this, what we say, and what we don't say So, I have some problems with trying, in effect, to restate the policy record   I have several comments to make on the District economy First of all, on the employment side we're seeing much stronger growth statistically We look at this on a 3-month moving average basis, so it's more than just the most recent month One of the two big shifts there is that we're seeing reasonably strong  -24-    3/23/93  manufacturing employment growth, which we hadn't seen up to this point That had been slightly weak and we were offsetting that with nonmanufacturing employment Nonmanufacturing employment is strong as well So, at least for the most recent period we have a much stronger picture there On the other hand, in terms of anecdotal information I've picked up the same things some others have mentioned Since the announcement of the economic program, expectations have been dented a little The uncertainty associated with that I think has undermined confidence a bit In terms of credit demand, we are still not seeing a significant pickup at the larger banks but we are at smaller banks We had a group of bankers in last week and [their reports were] a mixture; it was interesting to watch the bigger bankers listen to the little community oriented bankers who deal with small businesses talking about their increased credit demand So, I think that's going on One interesting comment that was made in that regard is that this demand is associated both with capital spending and in one case in particular with some inventory building The banker associated it with concerns about building price pressures It may be overstating to call it speculative inventory building, but I haven't heard comments like that for a long time  The final comment I would make about the District economy relates to the issue of price pressures I have heard a number of comments recently about building price pressures Just three months ago if you even brought up the idea of inflation, people looked at you as if you'd lost your mind It's very interesting how quickly this has shifted Some of it is in the obvious areas Scrap steel is up in the first two months of the year by close to 20 percent, I think, and we've all heard the stories about lumber costs Also impacting residential building, at least in the St Louis area, are finished lot costs The inventories are being run down; they're not being replaced and there are probably only a handful I heard one person mention that maybe three developers could get financing to develop lots in this environment That's not a credit crunch comment totally I just think the nature of that business has changed Probably some people have been washed out of that business who maybe shouldn't have been in it for the long haul anyway In any event, I'm hearing more comments about price pressures, not just in places where one would expect but more broadly--comments by people just hearing about this [from various contacts]  On the national front, I'd associate myself with what Al Broaddus said and what Dave Mullins just said in that I don't think this is the time to take action, but I think we are in a difficult position in a sense We don't have monetary indicators that we have a lot of confidence in and we're in a very difficult political environment But I think the day is probably fast approaching when these straws in the wind that we're seeing now may really take hold-- and maybe it's more than straws in the wind--and we will have to move I was struck by what Mike Prell said in his presentation--I think this is what you said, Mike--that it wouldn't take much of an overshoot in nominal GDP to see greater price pressures   Okay In any case, we're going to have our work cut out for us in the not too distant future  -25-    3/23/93   I could accept your proposal, Alan As I think about the symmetry issue, we might as well take the heat when we make a move, not through some words We've been to that movie recently and it's probably not worth it There are two things that influence my thinking right now I'd probably be more concerned if we hadn't seen the slowdown in M1, reserves, the base, and so forth over the last couple of months As you know, I don't think those are an appropriate target for policy, but I do think they have some value as an indicator of the thrust, and they have slowed down The other thing is that we're looking at higher inflation numbers, although David makes the point very well that we're still probably not looking at enough numbers yet to be sure It's dangerous to overreact to high frequency data But I agree with what Al Broaddus said, that if we wait until  -43-    3/23/93  we're absolutely sure we're looking at inflation and expectations have become imbedded, it's very hard to catch up, as you said too   Yes "
4768,1993-05-18," Gretchen, in the [written] report there was a comment about the [market's] vulnerability to the dismantling of these longer-term investment positions--and you just mentioned it in your remarks--in Europe in particular Do we have any sense of the magnitude of that, what dynamics might drive a liquidation, what the impact of that could be, and so forth?   I'm talking about investment positions in US dollars   First of all in terms of the District, the unemployment numbers I'm going to report are really the best numbers I've seen in a good while We had payroll employment growth in the most recent three-month period, which would be through March, up 38 percent in the District Another notable change [is that] we've been getting marginal growth in employment And certainly the St Louis District in general has done better than the nation through the recession Another shift has been that we're getting more of the growth through manufacturing That was actually up 48 percent, with particular strength in electrical equipment and transportation equipment; it was up somewhat less in nonmanufacturing, 3-1/2 percent And there is considerable strength in construction It's somewhat stronger in residential in terms of contracts and significantly stronger in nonresidential for that most recent three-month period Notwithstanding that, as I talk to people around the District, I don't get the sense--in terms of the tone of comments--that people think  -26-    5/18/93  we're in any kind of a boom And I'm hearing the same concerns others have expressed regarding uncertainty about fiscal policy and other government policies  With respect to the national picture, in thinking back to the second half of last year when real growth came in at around 4 percent, I'm struck by the fact--just thinking about where we are now and where we thought we were then--that the economy is fundamentally in a lot better shape now than it was then We are getting some job growth now which we weren't getting then There were considerable uncertainties at that time and, indeed, there are uncertainties now But in some ways they were even greater at that time The whole financial restructuring process has proceeded further I think one has to assume that we're in better shape in that sense And the anecdotal reports we've heard around the table today in general are better As Mike Prell acknowledges in the Greenbook, there is a possibility of the first-quarter GDP being revised up But I think it's a little dangerous to put too much stock in one quarter's GDP numbers We could actually be surprised in retrospect in terms of how well things are going now  As some others have mentioned, notably Al Broaddus and Gary Stern, my principal concern is on the inflation side I, too, am skeptical as to whether or not we will resume the disinflationary trend we seemed to be on And I think the experience of the first four months of this year has definitely had an impact in terms of expectations In terms of why that could be, it seems to me there is an explanation relating to money and credit, though not one we in this room generally put a lot of stock in We had M1 growth over the last two years through the first quarter at double-digit rates I guess I'm not prepared to try to translate that into what it may mean exactly in terms of real growth and prices, but I view that as a very substantial monetary impetus As that growth slowed very dramatically in the first quarter it gave me some comfort that perhaps the general thrust of policy had shifted somewhat But what I'm seeing as far as M1 projections looking forward [concerns me] Again, this is only a month or two, but for May we're talking about a possible 25 percent annual growth rate in M1 It may be that what I perceived as a significant sea change in the thrust of the growth in that aggregate in the first quarter of this year was really only a temporary pause and that we're still on a very strong upward trend in terms of monetary thrust We're probably not compelled to act now, but if these inflation expectations become embedded and the first-quarter [inflation rate] turns out stronger than people perhaps think it is now and if real growth is stronger, it's just going to be harder to catch up later So, my principal concern relates to developments we've seen in the wage and price climate   I didn't put my hand up, but I have to speak anyway! I was very much influenced by this meeting I came in sitting on the fence, frankly And based on hearing the discussion my preference would be--if I had to do one or the other--probably to move rates up a little right now But it's clear to me that there's not a consensus to do that This is a very important move and I think there has to be a stronger consensus than exists right now Therefore, I could accept deferring action I think there's a risk in deferral and David put his finger on it There's a risk that we might have to do more later if things break the wrong way In a sense, even if they break the right way and we follow [developments] in this intermeeting period, we may decide we really don't have to act We can discuss it again at the next meeting and maybe decide that we don't have to act then either, but it won't remove the fact that the funds rate probably  -52-    5/18/93  is not pegged at a sustainable level The question is What is that [delay] building in, in terms of lagged effects that ultimately are going to come home to roost later? And then there's the credibility question that Al Broaddus raised in terms of where we all expected inflation to come in this year and where it is likely to come in and what that means if we take that sitting down It's a tough issue, but that's where I come out "
4794,1993-07-06," I was just going to raise a general question Is there a case to be made for doing some more generalized work in terms of household portfolio behavior?   One of the things that's not particularly satisfying about this is that we're only capturing a piece of that total picture If we're willing to commit resources to do more work, I'd be in favor of committing them more broadly and looking at that basic question of household portfolio behavior   Looking at our economic projections, we're at the high end of the central tendency for 1993 and we are clearly an outlier on the high end with respect to 1994 I wouldn't make policy based on these projections, but basically how we look at it is that we've had a very stimulative thrust of policy for a couple of years running here and that's showing through to the real side a little in 1993 and more of that would show through in prices in 1994 If that were to happen, though it's quite possible it's just an inflationary bubble, the question would be this expectations issue that we've been talking about Even if we thought our policies were on a course that would gradually bring that back down, how do we deal with expectations in the meantime? So, I see that as a potentially tough issue for us to deal with The other issue I see is one that Ed Boehne, Gary Stern, and others have touched on, which is this longer-term question    7/6-7/93  as to how we approach some concept of price stability and over what time frame  With respect to the District, we're still showing strong numbers I've heard a number of people say that they see less gap between their Districts and some of the stronger Districts I guess we see that too, but I would be more inclined to view it as [an indication] that the rest of the nation may be catching up as opposed to our losing steam We're still, in the latest three-month period for which we have figures, getting strong growth in both manufacturing and non-manufacturing employment, basically in the area of 2-1/2 percent at an annual rate In the manufacturing area that's across most sectors except chemicals and transportation Interestingly enough, despite this strong pattern on the real side, we're not seeing much growth in bank credit demand For large reporting banks we'll see the numbers up one week and down the next week; and C&I loans on an annual basis are still down about a percent from the prior year Recently, we had a group of homebuilders in and they said they are looking ahead to a very strong third quarter--that's already built in --and they expect to see significant follow-through in consumer durables On the other hand, some people in the commercial area--and this is just anecdotal information from a group we talked to--see capacity basically being disassembled They see the entrepreneurial developer really not being able to get financing and that is beginning to spill back to the contractors and general contractors Some of those contractors can hang on for a while, but even the stronger ones --looking ahead a year or two--are wondering how they're going to keep going In that conversation I heard the comment--[mentioned] before by Gary, I believe--about the impacts of certain government policies and the concern about that When I asked about inflation, these people mentioned the price of cement, which has gone up about 50 percent in St Louis That has to do with the plants that produce it just being unwilling or unable to spend the money to put on the environmental controls So, it's a short-term supply problem I think the people at that luncheon and generally the people I talk to view things like that as aberrational They don't seem to be generally concerned about a build-up of broad inflationary pressures; I think they are more concerned about real growth That about wraps it up   I have a lot of sympathy for what Larry Lindsey said I could live with what you're proposing, Alan, and I think it can be explained that way I think the other way can be explained as well I have trouble with the concept that all this is useful; in a sense M2 ranges for the next 12 or 18 months were really never all that helpful in that velocity over those periods of time could be quite volatile Probably where it was useful, in my mind, was in a very long-term perspective with zero trend velocity over those periods of time and [an expectation that] gradually we'd get down to some range that was consistent with price stability In that context, then, as Larry explained, we open ourselves up to the arguments about what sort of nominal GDP we are in effect projecting And possibly we get into this problem of eventually having this bounce around Then what does that mean? Up until recently my own view has always been to work the range down gradually to where we think we ought to be in a longer-term context and then leave it there; and if we're going to miss, we explain the misses So, my preference would be to leave it and explain that we're going to miss I can live with what you're proposing but it raises a question as to how we convey our longer-term intentions to the public and what they can look at as some sort of indicator Right now, of course, there isn't any If they want to know, there isn't any   Right   Given that this is essentially a forecast for this horizon--if I heard you correctly, you sort of detach it from the policy debate by saying it's purely technical and it's a forecast-- then even if we miss this lower range, that doesn't imply any policy response   Well, just picking up on Ed's point, rather than [talking about] our ability to forecast lower growth a better defense  -55-    7/6-7/93  may be that we're not at all convinced at this point in time that in the long run trend velocity won't return to zero I'm not saying it will We don't know that it will, but we don't know that it won't either And on that basis that's why we continue to set a range   I think where we end up may be for the wrong reason   Alan, I support what you say I think I heard implicitly in [your comments] that we really need to be watching things pretty carefully here and that we need to be prepared to move promptly I suspect that market participants and probably a lot of people in this room breathed a big sigh of relief when we got the PPI and CPI numbers; and in my view that's probably not justified As I see things, we've had a very stimulative policy in train for some period of time--when you look at the narrower aggregates or when you look at the level of short-term rates--and we're going to have to get that rope back in at some point in time And it's not going to be any easier down the road, as I view it In fact, it will probably get tougher Your analysis of the budget may well be exactly right The facts may be worse than the expectations but politically my guess is--   Yes, that would be the other way around--once they enacted something In terms of market expectations, once it becomes absolutely clear that we must move and we're looking at a structure of rates that anticipates the Fed is going to move x basis points within the next month or two months or whatever, it just becomes harder and harder to catch up In other words, we've been fortunate in a way that we've had a few signals here, a few warning shots, and we haven't been compelled to move But eventually the time will come when it's no longer a warning shot and we will be trying to chase a train that already left the station Other people have said that over time at these meetings I think what you've suggested for this meeting is quite appropriate But I just hope we will be attentive in the direction that I'm expressing here as we move forward   Well, I worked with David on that subcommittee and I was not in favor of immediate release either; but I must say subsequent developments put it in a different light, and I wouldn't be against taking another look   Alan, the guidelines you read--are we following those?   That's what I'm asking "
4821,1993-08-17," As far as the District goes, we generally have been outperforming the nation during this expansion although in the latest three-month period employment growth has been a little worse than sluggish; we've had slight declines I don't think there's much flood effect in that, however What I might do is just make a few comments on the flood; St Louis has really been the center of that And as Si said, for those who are directly affected it's very devastating But what is striking is the small percentage of the population that is actually affected; it's about 1 to 2 percent In the Bank we have 800 employees and 6 or 8 families that are affected in some way, and I'd say that's quite representative I think the assessment that the broad economic impact is going to be relatively narrow is on target Clearly, there have been some crop losses and some disruption of jobs, but really very little One of the main ongoing effects is going to be the impact on transportation We've had roads washed out and it will be a long time before the barge traffic can move on the river Basically what I hear from our directors and others is that [transportation problems] are adding to costs somewhat and it's a bit of a nuisance, but goods are basically getting moved I think that will be with us for a while  Like Gary Stern, we did a survey of banks We basically picked the counties on either side of the river--the Mississippi, Missouri, and Illinois rivers--and talked to about 200 banks They constitute about 10 percent of District banking assets; and 80 percent of those banks are less than $100 million, so they are principally small banking operations What struck me through the whole thing--and Gary touched on this--was how little disruption to operations occurred We picked this up on the survey although it would not have been obvious from our own activities Thirty-one banks had some disruption in operations--either carriers having difficulty getting in  -16-    8/17/93  or out or actually having to make other arrangements, such as having their deliveries made to other processing centers or otherwise moving their processing And 19 facilities, either head offices or branches, were evacuated because of flooding We hear concerns about liquidity --no pun intended--but there has been only one discount window loan, an adjustment credit loan, that was at all associated with flood- related problems that I'm aware of up to this point in time The big uncertainty looking down the road really is on credit quality But, again, I don't think that's going to be a significant factor even from a District perspective I would say most of the banks are looking for less than a 10 percent impact in terms of their loan portfolios And of the 200 we talked to there are roughly 25 that think the impact will be greater than 10 percent There will be a few banks--and these would be basically ag banks in small towns where both the agricultural loans and the business loans in the community would be affected--that could have problems But they are relatively small In fact, all of those 25 banking organizations have $50 million in total assets or less We will stay in touch with this In a sense, while the crisis has passed, I think we're dealing with the worst part of it right now in terms of the cleanup and rebuilding And that will take some time  On the national front, just a couple of comments Similar to what Al said, I've been very pleased with how expectations with respect to policy have shifted without really trashing the markets It wasn't too long ago when the expectation was that we were on a one- way street for lower rates [and we've moved] to a period now, I guess, where expectations are fairly balanced But the Chairman made it pretty clear in his testimony that there is the possibility that they will be moving up, and that has been very well received, I would say Done differently, one could imagine a good deal of short-term turmoil in the markets, which we really haven't had with that shift in expectations Who knows how to sort it out, but there may be some beneficial impact, as Al observed, in the longer end of the market The other thing that is extraordinary, particularly given the perception the last time around, is that the pressures on monetary policy emanating from a deficit reduction package have really been muted and well contained And I think that's quite an accomplishment from the politicians and the press  One of the things I have a little concern about is the fact that to some extent we are a bit at sea internally in terms of what we ought to be looking at We've had problems with M2; we went through the Feinman/Porter [study]; we talked about an M2+; the Chairman mentioned real interest rates And I think one of the things that we need to be careful not to do is to convey a lot of confusion in the central bank about what we ought to be doing This is, and always has been, basically a judgmental matter; and I think the judgments have been very good during this period To the extent that we roll out too many different possibilities in rapid succession, in terms of what we ought to be looking at, it's possible we could convey a sense of confusion about what we ought to be doing when in fact I think there's a lot of credibility associated with the Fed's actions In particular--and I suspect to some extent, Alan, what you said was misinterpreted in this regard--the real interest rate [issue] caught a lot of attention There was a sense that people would question if we can't really control it in the long run and all we can really observe is a proxy and we can't really observe real interest rates and we  -17-    8/17/93  don't know what at any point in time the right natural rate is, it's very hard to view that as a target I don't think that is what you were suggesting I think you were suggesting that there is information there and that we ought to use it, and I agree with that But as we go through this period of thinking about what we ought to be looking at, we ought not get too far from the basics We ought to focus on the tools of policy and what it is we affect--reserves, the base, and all the aggregates related to that I won't say any more about it today, but I'm struck by that chart in the weekly Board briefings that relates the opportunity costs of M1 to its velocity and how that has tracked--how certain periods stand out, at least to the eye, where there have been inflection points in policy There may be more information in M1 than we're willing to give it credit for   Just on that point about the behavior of traders It seems to me that if they actually see the Fed moving, they could conclude from prior experience that the Fed may be late and that it implies the potential of higher actual inflation and maybe an economy that's stronger than they perceived and, therefore, higher real rates than they thought the market was discounting   Right  -37-    8/17/93   Yes   So where do you come out? [Laughter]   Alan, I agree with your analysis in terms of going back I think the directive ought to be symmetric And I think, as Wayne Angell said, that we ought not kid ourselves that debating the language is really making policy I don't think we used it inappropriately Because things didn't unfold to give us the opportunity to move in that direction, it's appropriate to go back But we probably ought not overuse the tool because to some extent we see the down side right now in terms of possible misinterpretation in markets And I agree with Bill McDonough that a statement could be helpful at some point to clarify exactly what we mean by it because I do think the press and others put much more weight on it than we may intend "
4845,1993-09-21," In our District the situation is pretty much like the one Al described I don't detect any major changes in activity We're still seeing modest growth I would say that retail sales are reasonably strong That's not getting fully reflected in employment, though, where we've been pretty sluggish We're relatively stronger than the rest of the country in manufacturing and quite weak in services right now Some of that may be flood-related because of the impact on construction in particular, which has been a weak sector employment-wise We do hear reports from our directors and others about modest expansion in manufacturing areas--firms adding several hundred jobs here and there So, generally, I'd say that's picking up Housing has been quite strong over the last year What we heard earlier was that the wet weather in the spring was going to push activity later into the summer and I think we're seeing that now in terms of a pickup in activity With respect to the flood and its effects in general, there wasn't that much disruption of employment activity and many of those who were disrupted are back to work now Cleanup efforts are under way There will probably be some positive impact on construction activity in due course, although I don't think it will be that noticeable on a national basis Barge traffic is moving on the river and so forth, so in many senses the crisis of the flood is behind us  In terms of banking, it was interesting to note an increase in loan activity across the board in the second quarter; actually loan growth was relatively healthy in Eighth District banks, up not quite 6 percent Consumer, real estate, and business categories were all growing My final point--maybe this is somewhat related to the flood, but [it's difficult] nationally to sort out the flood, drought, and other effects--is that the crop estimates aren't dramatically down that much But it's interesting that in Missouri the corn crop is estimated to be down about 40 percent, which is a fairly dramatic hit, but in Illinois [the effects are] very little, maybe about 15 percent in terms of the corn crop  Nationally, I keep asking myself why I don't feel better about the relatively sanguine outlook that we have This ought to be ideal from a central banker's point of view I know we're paid to worry, but real growth around potential and reasonably well behaved  -22-    9/23/93  prices is something I guess we ought to feel good about But there are two things that bother me somewhat One has to do with the fact that I just don't think we can gauge the current thrust of monetary policy very well, and I'm very uneasy about the fact that we may well be in a very stimulative posture and those chickens will come home to roost The other thing--and I think it has been appropriate to show some flexibility on this front--ultimately would be the question in my mind of moving the inflation rate down closer to what would be some representation of price stability Others have commented on this at other meetings I think to some extent we've taken comfort in the fact that prices haven't been moving up But at some point we may have to think about trying to move inflation a little lower   Count me in! "
4864,1993-10-05," Alan, this is Tom Melzer   I'm just wondering, though I don't think there's any way around it Isn't it likely that talking about the tapes and transcripts will prompt a FOIA request [for them]?   I'm just thinking back to earlier discussions we had of the risk that would be associated with a Memorandum of Discussion and whether we'd be able to protect that under FOIA It seems to me we would very likely get a request on that, wouldn't we?   You know, Ed, I agree with you I don't think we will, but I'm not sure it is necessary In fact, I presume that it's Virgil's view that a FOIA request would not prevail rather easily and in any event could be delayed rather significantly in time   Alan, Tom Melzer again I'd just make an observation If somebody took you up on your offer to go back and prepare the [MOD for] a meeting three years ago from existing material, I don't know how you'd define sufficient demand I suspect you are thinking about market demand and they'll be thinking about political demand, and maybe you're thinking of both of them But in any case, if we got in a position where we were going to go back and sort of recreate a meeting from three years ago, I think we have to consider whether we want to conduct our meetings differently today on the theory that while we started this as an experiment it may continue So if we're involved in that experiment, then we better go ahead and [think about how it would affect our meetings now] This would be my concern anyway because, looking forward three years, if we were going to do the process justice, then the MOD ought to be prepared around the time [each meeting is held] I was just wondering whether that one little bite would really put us into a bigger program right from the start   Yes "
4883,1993-10-15," Alan, Tom Melzer Could I ask a quick question? I can understand why the Justice Department would defend this [type of case] for a full-fledged government agency but would this also apply to quasi-independent agencies? What is the status of [the FOMC]? Of course, this doesn't necessarily help us in the context that is coming up, but the FOMC itself is a different type of animal But in any case, my initial question was Would we be prohibited from defending ourselves as an independent government agency or however you would characterize it?   And sometimes we had options-- Well, I don't know about the Merrill case, but I know on Melcher we debated whether or not we wanted them representing us and there were--   Yes   I just wanted to confirm that there's no room on that score   Yes, I just wanted to doubly confirm that I understand   Alan, this is Tom Melzer Could I offer a somewhat different view while we're fairly early in this discussion?   I can make a distinction in my own mind in terms of what has transpired in the past with respect to the transcripts and what we ought to do going forward If I understand what Ed Boehne said, it was never official policy of the FOMC or even knowledge of [most] FOMC [members] that the transcripts were being kept Now, they clearly exist; but that doesn't mean we need to continue that practice into the future I personally feel very strongly that the minutes of the meeting are an adequate record of the meeting; I have argued that before and would argue that in my testimony And in effect what we could do is simply to continue the practice of taping the meetings,  -14-    10/15/93  preparing a transcript, preparing the minutes, and then destroying the transcripts once the minutes are approved as a practice going forward [The transcribing] was not something anybody knew was going on and I continue to think if we lock ourselves into a Memorandum of Discussion going forward, we will have no assurance that the Justice Department would defend any kind of three-year lag on that So we'd have to assume that an MOD would be available immediately, [and that] is going to seriously impair the deliberative process With respect to the other transcripts, I think we [should deal with] the FOIA request when that comes My own feeling is that those will end up being released; that's just the way it is and we have to live with that But I'd be very reluctant to let that drive us into a process going forward that could ruin fundamentally the deliberative process as I think an MOD with immediate release would   My going forward recommendation would be this You're going to acknowledge the existence of the transcripts I don't think this is something we would necessary say at this time, but I don't view those as official records of the FOMC in the sense that the FOMC didn't direct that they be kept and apparently didn't know that they were being kept They do exist and that's fine; we have to admit to that But that should not compromise our position going forward My view going forward is that the minutes of the FOMC meeting are an adequate record of the meeting and that any offer to prepare an MOD, I think, runs a serious risk [in that] we have no knowledge whether any delay in release would be defensible I think we just have to assume going forward that they would become available immediately and would seriously impair the deliberative process So I personally would like to separate the existence of those transcripts from what an appropriate policy is going forward I view them as quite separable It would be much more difficult if we as a Committee had been keeping those transcripts for some purpose of the Committee and if they were used in some way But they're not; people didn't know they existed I don't know, but I think I did better the first time; I'm not sure that was succinct   Remember, the Committee never knew they were being kept, Tom   I mean the FOMC   Also, in terms of what Wayne is saying, until we have a [FOIA] request there is nothing-- I think that's the point at which we decide   Yes, I understand   Alan, this is Tom Melzer Can I make a suggestion with respect to the concerns that some others expressed? It seems to me that if all 15 people, or however many there are, say that the Chairman has covered the practices of the Secretariat in his statement, that's going to [sound] a little suspicious after a while You may have the opportunity to say something along the lines of ""I have spoken to the practices of the Secretariat and have suggested that the Reserve Bank Presidents speak to the practices with respect to their institutions that they're familiar with"" You said something along those lines the other day when we had the earlier call in suggesting to us that that's how we approach this While I don't have the language for you, I just wanted to float out the idea that you might in your statement be able to take everybody else off the hook  -20-    10/15/93  and in effect avoid a situation where this becomes peculiar because everybody feels compelled to say it "
4899,1993-10-22," I think Virgil's absolutely right on that, because that's why we stopped doing it in the first place   Alan, this is Tom Melzer I definitely agree with you about exploring the options with the Justice Department The way I'd see it is that [there's a question] of where we want to protect and where we want to be open I'm one who happens to believe that the MOD really affects the quality of the deliberative process and I think things will change, when and if we decide to do that And to some extent maybe we would rather be open with edited transcripts and not get locked into doing an MOD going forward, recognizing that we'd have to come up with some way of protecting people who don't have an opportunity to review those transcripts But the proposal here is sort of giving them a half a loaf in both places And it doesn't really address the accusations of secrecy because in the one case we have the transcripts but we're not giving them those, and in the other case we're giving them an MOD where the people we are battling here really want more than that They want videotapes within 60 days I'm certainly aware of the politics that we're dealing with in regard to the accusation that we're not being open I don't know how well I've said it, but in sum we have a very key decision-point coming up here in the sense that once we approve the minutes for the next meeting, that will be the only opportunity we would have to change our practice in response to a different policy position on the part of the Justice Department on FOIA That's because they've changed their posture since our last meeting and it would be justifiable I'm saying in the logical sense now, maybe not in a political sense, that it would be totally justifiable to say that, in view of their decision and this new government policy--the fact that these notes and transcripts are no longer protected--we've made the decision going forward to destroy those materials once the minutes are approved  So in some sense we have to make a key decision on the MOD going forward, I think, before the next minutes are approved, or we're in effect locked in That may be smart, but the other aspect of it is--I agree with what Bill McDonough and others said earlier--that before we get into that, we really do need legislative protection As I said before, that's why we stopped doing [the MOD] in the first place--because we didn't have [legislative protection] And, as Bill pointed out, we don't want to be subject to the whims of the Attorney General at any point in time on the protection of that [document] It's just too fundamental to the deliberative process to run the risk that [an MOD] could be coming out, say, 60 days after an FOMC meeting I guess what I'm saying is that we could be viewed to be much more open about things if we let the transcripts out in edited form, redacting the comments--I think I heard you say this in the background, Mr Chairman--of those who are no longer living [We might] just put those out as full, edited transcripts How much more open could we be?   That's why I'm saying that I don't think the existence of the transcripts should stampede us into automatically doing an MOD, which in some sense is what happens in this proposal "
4948,1993-11-16," Virgil, you and Don both mentioned Congressional subpoena Could you describe that process in more detail and how it might relate to tapes and transcripts that are prepared in connection with doing a Memorandum of Discussion even if we had a procedure whereby once that MOD was approved the tapes and transcripts could then be disposed of pursuant to authority from the Archivist? Further, if there were legislation that specifically protected us under FOIA with respect to public release with some appropriate lag, would that have any bearing on Congressional subpoena power?   So, in theory, it would be possible, say, in extreme circumstances, or under any circumstances, [for Congress] to subpoena tapes and transcripts on a real time basis?   Okay   I wanted to come back to the MOD and its relationship to FOIA I guess this would be a question for Virgil Even if the Justice Department agreed with the procedures we intended to pursue and therefore presumably would defend us in the future against a denied FOIA request, assuming policy or personnel didn't change, isn't it likely that we would in fact have a lawsuit? In other words, if we decided to do an MOD going forward, it seems to me that at some point--sooner or later, and probably sooner--someone would test that in the courts, whether the lag with respect to its release was three years or five years We'd have the litigation and ultimately be subjected to some judgment in the courts That's part of the question The other part of my question is As the FOMC has considered this in the past, is the only way that we could really be sure we would be adequately protected is if we had specific legislation on that?   One other question, Virgil If we adopted the MOD procedure going forward, do you think the likelihood of litigation is fairly high?   I have three general points I'd like to make and then I'll cover my thoughts on what we ought to do The first point is that past practice can and should be separated from what we do in the future Don made that point and I agree with it First of all, I think the existence of transcripts which have not been used in general for any purposes of the FOMC beyond preparation of the policy record or minutes, depending on what we called them at a point in time, should not require that we continue to tape and transcribe Secondly, I think the President's new policy with respect to FOIA should cause us to review our future practices In other words, that is a significant change; and regardless of what may be going on in terms of a general legislative debate about FOMC disclosure, that should cause us to review what we're doing It's unclear to me what the outcome of litigation would be with respect to an MOD Even if we were taping and transcribing, there is the possibility of a FOIA request for tapes and transcripts, which would in effect freeze that process Now, I appreciate what Virgil said about the position we have, but we just really don't know where litigation is going to come out And we would have that overhanging our deliberative process for some considerable  -24-    11/16/93  time as we fought it out through the courts So, really, the only way to protect tapes, transcripts, and so forth going forward is through legislation That's the only way we can be sure that the deliberative process is protected  My second general point is that I think we need to resolve today what we want to do with respect to the release of information about past meetings We just have to do that Because of the importance of decisions with respect to future meetings we may want to consider what we do further and decide later, albeit promptly--in my mind certainly no later than the December meeting  My third point is that as a general matter I think it would be desirable from a public information point of view to consider doing something in the future which provides greater disclosure without adversely affecting the deliberative process I'll get to that briefly at the end  With respect to past meetings, Alan, I favor what you recommended lightly edited transcripts with a five-year lag And I would be inclined to release those for 1988 as early in 1994 as we could and then establish some schedule for release of the earlier ones, which would really be determined by the availability of staff to prepare them And I'd just make those available according to some predetermined schedule As people have said, I think they would be more open than an MOD looking back would be and I think the cost is considerably more reasonable I'd favor review by the Secretariat staff only in the interest of getting this information out on a timely basis And one final point with respect to releasing them with a five-year lag The precedent of what we did with the old MODs is what we ought to look to in terms of setting that timeframe; five years would be consistent [with our past practice]  With respect to future meetings, I would favor our current approach to keeping minutes Don, I don't know which alternative this is of yours; I guess it would be your alternative one, the current minutes with no taping or transcript and with any notes of the Secretariat staff made in connection with preparing the minutes disposed of on approval of those minutes That would be, in my view, normal practice for that sort of function My general view is that the FOMC ought to be held accountable for its decisions, not the details of its deliberations And in my view the minutes are more than adequate in that regard and include details of how individuals voted Secondly, our procedure of taping and transcribing is not required in any way In effect, it has only been for the convenience of the Secretariat staff And that raises questions that have been touched on before with respect to retention of these records--tapes and transcripts--under the Federal Records Act Third, I think tapes and transcripts, as I've said before, would be subject to FOIA litigation and [would result in] considerable uncertainty overhanging the Committee for some period of time Finally, as has been pointed out, tapes and transcripts would be subject to immediate Congressional subpoena, which would be a form of oversight that goes well beyond the semiannual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony and could raise questions in financial markets of the Fed's independence Another point on this approach, which I think has considerable advantages, is that no legislation would be required in order to make sure that our deliberative process was protected going forward  -25-    11/16/93  My final point would be, and I touched on this at the beginning, that I do think in a public information sense we need to take steps to be more open and should consider such things as either enhanced minutes or prompt release of the directive in connection with the approach that I laid out   Lightly edited is my first choice; my second choice is raw with annotation   Five and ten   Enhanced minutes first; current minutes second   It's prompt release like [the current minutes]   It's the same as what we do now   How do enhanced and current minutes taken together come out?   And current?   So it's four   Well, you could have the opportunity to--   No legislation would be necessary   Thanks, Alan Well, I would just make two points One is to reiterate what I said earlier This is very important with respect to the future functioning of the Committee I think the most important decision we need to make today is the one with respect to going back I think it would be helpful to make one going forward but if we can't do it with the sense that there is total comfort in the decision, maybe we shouldn't Maybe we should think about it more and decide--  -54-    11/16/93   The other point I wanted to make--and reasonable people can differ on this--is that I don't feel we have as much flexibility to change going forward as you do [If we were to decide] to go to an MOD now, we would be announcing that publicly I think the perception would be that we've moved toward further disclosure because we think it's appropriate; some in Congress certainly feel it's appropriate Then, if within a short period of time--months or even years--we decided that we didn't think that was appropriate any more, I doubt that [a change] would be accepted very well [The perception would be that] we made a move toward further openness and then all of a sudden, presumably as soon as the heat was turned up and we got a Congressional subpoena for tapes and transcripts, we immediately changed our procedures I think changing our procedures at that time would be even more difficult than changing them now   I think it would be appropriate in that case for the Chairman to say that this is an issue that the Committee has to focus on and the Committee will respond through the Chairman when it has completed its deliberations   The Eighth District economy has been buffeted by floods, strikes, defense cutbacks, and corporate restructuring over the last year Cutbacks in defense spending and auto production have adversely affected the Missouri economy These cutbacks were  -77-    11/16/93  especially noticeable in the St Louis area Flooding along the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers and persistent rainfall reduced the District's production of both corn and soybeans while foreign demand for District agricultural products remains soft District employment gains have been offset somewhat in southern Illinois and Indiana by a coal strike that is now more than six months old This strike has reduced US coal exports by 25 percent and depressed barge traffic along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers Lacking domestic supply some utilities in coastal areas are now reported to have stepped up their coal imports from South America and Asia  Despite these factors, Eighth District economic activity improved this year and the prospects for next year are encouraging This has been confirmed by the tone of comments I have been hearing for the last couple of months Payroll employment is above year-ago levels and while highly variable it should grow on average by approximately 2 percent in 1994, near its long-term average growth The Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi economies all continue to expand and diversify with numerous reports of new industries, robust loan demand, and higher bank earnings In September unemployment rates in the District's four principal states, Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee, were at or below the national average Some areas report shortages of qualified workers Small businesses throughout the District report generally strengthening demand Sales of existing homes and residential construction remain strong, and bank lending continues to grow The District is the country's largest rice-producing area Strong Japanese demand for California rice has caused rice prices generally to double in the last month and may bolster the District's rice production next year  With respect to the national economy, our outlook is similar to that for the Eighth District Nationally the unemployment rate has fallen by more than a full percentage point from its cyclical peak and all indications are that it will continue its downward trend Despite growing at a rate significantly below potential during the first half of the year, output grew at 28 percent in the third quarter and 27 percent during the past two years Moreover, in my view the prospects for a strong fourth quarter are excellent and we anticipate that much of this strength will carry over into 1994 Indeed, the economy now appears poised for a significant period of average growth at or above potential   Alan, I'm going to spend a little longer on this I favor alternative ""B"" with a bias toward a greater degree of reserve restraint The economy is gaining momentum, which is reflected in faster GDP growth and faster albeit still sluggish growth in the broad monetary aggregates Nominal interest rates have also risen If this rise in interest rates is sustained--along the lines of what David was saying before--monetary policy will automatically shift toward a more inflationary stance under a federal funds rate operating regime Accordingly, the funds rate must at a minimum be allowed to move up with market interest rates over time Moreover, the thrust of monetary policy as measured by the growth in M1 and reserves has been quite stimulative throughout the current expansion M1 has grown at an 118 percent annual rate from the second quarter of 1991 to the second quarter of 1993 and reserves have grown at an 116 percent annual rate Even after allowing for technical factors, which have temporarily increased the demand for M1 and reserves at times,  -88-    11/16/93  the growth rates have been very high The effects of this stimulative policy on inflation will be felt only with considerable lags, probably not for another 6 to 12 months or more Accordingly, one can not take much comfort in current rates of inflation though they appear reasonably stable In addition, the 3 percent annual increase in the CPI, which many forecasters believe is the lowest rate we will achieve in this cycle, can hardly be viewed as representing price stability "
4976,1993-12-21," Thank you, Alan The economic outlook for the Eighth District economy continues to be favorable Retail and auto sales are very strong and most of the other firms we surveyed report increases in sales, orders, and employment Loan demand continues to strengthen in some parts of the commercial and retail markets for District banks On the other hand, there are some sectors of weakness such as nonresidential construction and agriculture Only Missouri experienced gains in nonresidential construction contracts during the last half of the year Moreover, preliminary estimates suggest that net farm income will likely decline in most District states this year The recent firming of crop prices does not appear to be large enough to offset the reduction in farm output due to bad weather and flooding Generally speaking, however, the Eighth District expansion appears to be broad-based and sustainable  With respect to the national economy, I would say the outlook appears to be converging with that of the Eighth District Both retail and final sales have been strong, especially relative to inventory levels Trends in employment, industrial production, investment in durable equipment, and the index of leading economic indicators point to a continuation and strengthening of cyclical expansion Indeed, the improvement in the economy now appears to have spilled over into consumer confidence All indications are that output growth would be at or above potential next year  With respect to prices, I'd say it's a testimony to past policy that the CPI increased at only a 2-1/2 percent rate during the first nine months of this year Encouraging as this is, first of all, our goal of price stability has not been achieved Secondly, some of the reported improvement in the CPI is due to the volatile food and energy components When these are dropped the CPI increased at a 3 percent rate during the first nine months of the year and at a more troubling 36 percent rate during the past two months Third, the CRB futures index has risen sharply since September and is up about 10 percent from this time last year despite the sharp reduction in oil prices Finally, such numbers tell us nothing about the inflationary thrust of current policy, which is quite stimulative when measured by the behavior of things that we directly influence like the growth of reserves and M1 If we wait until the effects of recent policy show through to inflation before we act, we will have waited too long   I favor increasing the degree of pressure on reserve positions now I think the economy's momentum has intensified to the point that the capacity to maintain moderate inflation, not to mention declining inflation, appears to have run out As I mentioned before, the growth of the narrow money and reserve aggregates has been quite stimulative during the nearly seven quarters of this current cyclical expansion Last year alone the monetary base was allowed to increase by about $35 billion in order to maintain the federal funds rate at the target level Joan mentioned the mirror image of that was the additions to the portfolio of the same magnitude At a minimum I think the funds rate ought to be allowed to move up in line with market interest rates At least this will prevent monetary policy from automatically shifting toward a more inflationary stance as nominal interest rates rise with the expanding economy In addition, the credibility gained by increasing the degree of pressure in reserve markets now may help us restrain the inflationary expectations that are almost certain to intensify with the improving level of economic activity   First of all, I think we need to go ahead and do this but let me just ask a couple of questions I understand the logical basis for making a distinction between this conversation and monetary policy deliberations Is there a legal basis?   So there is a legal basis   Okay I just would be inclined in whatever letter you send back to spell out the precedent issue very clearly In other words, say that we don't view this as precedent-setting with respect to providing tapes and transcripts I think that would be a helpful part of the letter  Another legal question As I recall that call, Virgil, you started it off by giving us legal advice with respect to the new Freedom of Information Act interpretations I suppose, in effect, by releasing this we're waiving attorney/client privilege in some sense Can that be done on a case-by-case basis without setting any precedent with respect to any future legal advice the Committee might get?   Okay Then just one final observation I personally think we need to do this I do agree with what Susan was saying before--that this will be the basis for singling out individuals and criticizing them and it won't be the end of it I think we have to try it but, just following Tom's suggestion, we need to be prepared to defend statements that are going to be taken out of context in connection with this  -49-    12/21/93 "
5006,1994-02-03," Our outlook for real growth next year is somewhat more optimistic than that of the Greenbook, but in the case of inflation our outlook is considerably more pessimistic Nearly all of the macroeconomic indicators have become increasingly favorable and point to a strong and sustainable expansion But the down side of this, of course, is that both capacity utilization and unemployment are approaching levels that raise concerns about how long the economy will stay in the disinflationary mode In addition, recoveries in the economies of US trading partners as indicated in the Chart Show's alternative scenario might also generate demand pressures that would lead to price increases  Like the national economy, our District economy continues to improve and in some sense has been outperforming the national economy, at least in terms of employment growth Many firms have reported increases in sales and employment In fact, in at least two parts of the District that I've heard about recently, northwest Arkansas and northeast Mississippi, labor shortages have curtailed industrial expansion District retailers report good-to-strong sales of most types of merchandise during the holiday and post-holiday periods Single-family home building is unseasonably strong in many parts of the District, largely because builders are scrambling to start and finish projects that were delayed in the latter half of 1993 because of wet weather After several years of stagnation, multifamily housing construction appears to be on the upswing, as apartment occupancy rates and rental rates edge up And as is the case nationally, sales of new and existing homes have been relatively strong lately and average selling prices continue to rise In agriculture, soybean stocks nationally are down 49 percent from last year and corn stocks are down 62 percent The stocks/use ratios for these crops are only 76 percent and 104 percent respectively, which are the lowest levels we've seen since the mid-1970s So, clearly, in those areas we are quite vulnerable to any kind of weather shocks One final comment Loan demand both nationally and at the District level seems to have increased At a number of our large District banks, we have reports of a significant increase in all major categories of loans during the last two months of the year relative to the previous two months  Let me just end up with some comments about inflation We project that the CPI will move up sharply in 1994 and will be even higher in 1995 Indeed, there may be some early warning signs that the economy's disinflationary course has already come to an end When its volatile food and energy components are removed, the CPI rose at a 34 percent rate during the last three months of 1993, up significantly from the 24 percent rate of increase during the previous six months The CRB futures price index is up by nearly 13  -25-    2/3-4/94  percent from its level a year ago despite a very significant decline in energy prices An even sharper increase is seen in the Board's experimental commodity price index when the food and crude oil components are omitted  In addition, long-term interest rates have risen somewhat from their October 1993 lows In our view, measured either by the growth rates of M1 and reserves or the ex post real federal funds rate, the stance of monetary policy has been very expansionary for about the last three years, and we weigh this sustained stance of monetary policy heavily in making our forecast of longer-run inflation trends   On the precedent point, Alan, I would just say that another point to consider here is the Treasury funding next week   If we wanted another rationale, namely that there be no confusion in the marketplace, that might be another  -32-    2/3-4/94   Okay Well, there is at least one audience out there that wouldn't like to hear that I think there is a risk of a headline along the lines of ""In an unprecedented move, the Fed announced, saying it wasn't setting a precedent"" But where I come out is that in the climate we're in and in view of this inflection point after five years, as Jerry Jordan pointed out, these are unique circumstances And openness, given what we've been through in general during this period, is probably a pretty good course I think how much is said is important I personally would favor saying, ""The Fed decided to increase the degree of reserve restraint"" and that would be about it It would trouble me if we got into expectations about where the funds rate would trade   Yes   I think that's all right I don't think we should be giving a target range, though   Yes   That has been advocated at times in other discussions here Also, if we're announcing a decision--and this would be a legal question--are we obligated to say anything about the vote, for example? I'm not sure Again, I'd prefer just to say what the action was It's a decision of the Committee, but if we get into disclosing the vote, that begins to set other types of precedents that could be relevant when we get to the point of deciding this issue on a permanent basis   Right, I agree   No, I didn't mean to suggest otherwise I agree we should do that, but the point I was raising is that there may be a legal question If we have announced a decision, does it follow that we have to disclose the vote?  -33-    2/3-4/94   Of course, we might not get asked   Alan, the reason I'm bringing it up--and this is more relevant to the discussion we're going to have down the road--is that if we go this way, the effect of that is to place the minority rather than the majority in the limelight in terms of who the press might be interested in talking to, which might not be optimal Just one other point I agree with Bob Parry I agreed with deferring the discussion of our recordkeeping issues and so forth, but I think we should get to that promptly From my point of view, if we could get to that at the next meeting, that would be highly desirable   I think simultaneous is risky, frankly   Well, as I stated yesterday, Alan, the stance of monetary policy has in my view been very expansionary for the last two or three years Accordingly, as I've also mentioned, the St Louis Bank expects that the CPI will move up sharply in 1994 and will move even higher in 1995 Indeed, as you mentioned, there may be some early warning signs that the economy's disinflationary course has already come to an end It is my view that we should act now to reduce the growth rate of reserves and M1 and signal this change with a 50 basis point increase in the federal funds rate target I favor 50 basis points rather than a more modest amount at this juncture for the following reasons (1) I think the stage has been well set for a change in policy; (2) in my view we are late in acting; (3) too small a policy shift may not convince markets of our resolve to keep inflation low; and (4) I suspect that each successive action could become more difficult to take That's my view on policy  Let me make just one other suggestion with respect to the language in the directive where we describe economic and financial conditions I would suggest that we include in that some mention of  -46-    2/3-4/94  the behavior of M1, the adjusted monetary base and/or reserves over the last year I think that that may mitigate against some incorrect interpretation of relatively weak M2 and M3 growth and what some might think that implies with respect to the thrust of monetary policy That's all I have, Alan   Alan, what is your judgment on adding--I'm talking about the part of our directive where we're just reciting historically what has occurred--some reference to the behavior of narrow aggregates and taking the edge off of the relatively weak growth in the broader ones?   That's fine I just think it may help in terms of people understanding that the aggregates aren't presenting a clear picture of the stance of monetary policy  -58-    2/3-4/94   Yes, whatever you decide on that is okay with me I put that forward as a suggestion that might be helpful in terms of defending our position Thanks   I'd adopt the provisional ranges shown in alternative I And I agree with your logic, Alan I've always felt that we ought to get those ranges where they ought to be in terms of some concept of long-term price stability and then not move them around, even though they're not useful right now I wouldn't provide the 1995 projections My reason has to do with the fact that they incorporate different underlying assumptions They really are not comparable People have made different assumptions about monetary policy in particular If we were going to do anything along those lines, although I wouldn't suggest that we are ready to, we'd be better off to set a nominal GDP target which, of course, implies an inflation target That's something we might want to explore in connection with setting provisional ranges for 1995, but we're certainly not ready to talk about it seriously right now "
5023,1994-02-28," Alan, this is Tom Melzer I would just comment that I agree with your statement that we can't really know what's impacting longer-term rates--whether it's an increase in the real component or an increase in inflationary expectations In any event, we can't do much about that except over the very long term; and that's in the way we affect inflation and inflationary expectations So, in a sense, no matter what's going on out there, it doesn't diminish in my mind the fact that with respect to where the funds rate is, we are probably significantly out of position And to the extent that we are, over longer periods of time that's going to mean very expansive growth rates of the narrower aggregates to hold the funds rate there, and in the long run that will have inflationary implications So,    2/28/94  just as a general matter, I would associate myself with Al Broaddus I think we're out of position and the sooner we get to what we perceive to be a neutral stance the better I don't think there's any compelling need to make a move today on this call, but I do think we have to make these judgments based on a much longer-term view of where policy has been positioned over a period of time and where we need to get it, as opposed to the interpretation of short-term economic data, which I think will be distorted We certainly have had major weather distortions in our District both in Louisville, as Susan Phillips mentioned before, and also more recently in southern Arkansas and northern Mississippi So, there will be distortions to the data The only other thing I would say in general--and I don't think anyone has done this but we should be mindful of it--is that talking the market down in this environment would not be well received by market participants In fact, I think that would be viewed as an effort to substitute words for action What really affects credibility at this stage is our action So, in my mind, the less said and the more done the better "
5044,1994-03-22," The national economy, as we all know, has been expanding rapidly and that's a phenomenon we would expect to see continue on a path above that shown in the Greenbook For example, industrial production over the last three months ending in February grew at an 84 percent annual rate; payroll employment grew at a 16 percent rate from November to February which was in line with the growth over the previous nine months; and the unemployment rate, adjusted for changes in measurement, seems to have declined in an amount about equal to 1 percentage point over the last year  In the Eighth District, we would expect economic performance in the first quarter to be affected somewhat adversely by unusual winter storms, especially in the southern and eastern parts of the District But, nonetheless, District activity and employment have grown faster than in the nation as a whole over the past year and especially in the most recent three-month period for which we have data--ending in January So, obviously, the full effects of those storms wouldn't be reflected in that data yet Employment reports recently have been dominated by expansion in industries as diverse as appliances, finance, poultry processing, trucking, bicycles, and autos Particularly noteworthy are double-digit annual rates of growth in employment during the most recent three months; this would be in the electrical and transportation equipment industries and in construction Recent announcements that Chrysler will reopen an old plant in the St Louis area and that Ford will expand its production line also in St Louis, along with the previously announced 1995 plant reopening by GM, indicate a dramatic resurgence in investment and employment in the transportation sector over the next few years  -30-    3/22/94  The continuing strong performance of the District and of the national economy as well reinforce my concerns about the inflation outlook Over the past five months both consumer and producer prices have accelerated from their pace over the previous five months Producer prices for finished goods, for example, increased at a 16 percent annual rate since September 1993 following a 27 percent rate of decrease over the previous five months Consumer prices accelerated from a 18 percent to a 27 percent rate over the same period In addition, and that's why I mentioned industrial production and employment trends earlier, I think the potential for bottlenecks and price pressures is growing Capacity utilization has reached the level recorded at the previous cyclical peak in July 1990, and labor market conditions adjusted for recent changes in survey methods are rapidly approaching the degree of tightness that existed at that time as well  Not surprisingly, I think inflationary expectations have also increased, as reflected in the 25 basis point upward shift in the yield curve following our last meeting This was on top of a 50 basis point steepening that had already occurred between October, when long rates touched their lows, and our February meeting One final note on this score would be the question Is a significant increase in inflationary expectations plausible when price levels were declining as recently as last year? And my answer would be, ""you bet"" If you look at the postwar period, there essentially have been nine periods of declining inflation And in the four quarters following those nine periods, the average increase in inflation rates over those four- quarter periods was 22 percentage points So it's not at all implausible, given what's going on now, that there are significantly higher expectations with respect to inflation   As I've expressed before, my view is that monetary policy has been in a very stimulative posture over the last three years and, like Al Broaddus, I think the quicker we get to neutrality, the better off everyone is going to be I think the cumulative effects of that policy stance are being reflected already in rising prices and certainly in rising inflationary expectations My own judgment is that we reacted too cautiously to these developments at our last meeting, and that contributed to uncertainty in financial markets and has resulted in higher long-term interest rates than we otherwise might have seen I'm not saying that they would have gone down, but I'm not so sure they would have gone up as  -51-    3/22/94  much, and I think 25 basis points at this stage runs the risk of the same sort of reaction Accordingly, I favor moving more aggressively at this meeting to an increased degree of reserve restraint through a 50 basis point increase in the funds rate And were it up to me, I might even be inclined to underscore that with a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate and basically underline our resolve to contain inflationary pressures and eventually resume progress toward price stability   Alan, I wanted to make a couple of comments First of all, I favor announcing our actions promptly whether they are taken at meetings or between meetings My preference would be to make this change when we act on the other disclosure issues that Larry Lindsey talked about, although I can accept separating them I do think that there is the possibility that announcing our actions promptly can have some adverse impact on the deliberative process But in the current climate I think the benefit of providing more information to the public outweighs whatever that cost is Obviously, that's a difficult measurement issue  With respectto what should be released, and maybe I misunderstood a little what we discussed in the subcommittee, I personally would favor releasing only a statement with respect to an increased or decreased degree of pressure on reserve positions I think any statement with respect to the impact on short-term market rates, in effect, is something that will be decoded In other words, we will be using different adjectives to describe what we think the effect on money market interest rates is going to be and then we'll be de facto announcing our targets ""Small"" will mean 25 basis points; ""moderate"" will mean 50 basis points I don't know what more than 50 would mean; that doesn't seem very likely!   Yes   Okay I'm just expressing some views at this point The other point I would make is that I'm not sure I agree with what Larry Lindsey was saying We are doing something here that, if it's done well and announced properly, will have a very positive public effect Our practice is going to lock us into that because my sense is we won't get back to these other disclosure issues for some months, and there may be other actions to announce in the meantime So, our provisional behavior is in effect going to set the precedent  -56-    3/22/94  and lock us into a policy, and it will be anti-climatic when we announce it Personally, I think we can get much more mileage out of announcing the fact that this decision has been made and just get it done In effect, we are trading it away anyway, so why not announce it and try to get some public relations benefit out of it The other thing I would say in such an announcement is that we continue to have our disclosure practices under review, because I think there are some other disclosure issues that in due course need to be reviewed   I don't have a strong objection, Alan How would Joe Coyne respond to inquiries of ""What does this mean?"" There are bound to be some requests; what's the answer?  -59-    3/22/94 -60-   It is still considering disclosure issues? "
5076,1994-04-18," Tom Melzer The question I would have is Do we help longer-term markets sort themselves out by imparting greater conviction about the Fed's decisiveness in keeping inflation under  -10-    4/18/94  control? I think that would argue for a stronger move along the lines of what Al Broaddus described I could certainly support that sort of move, and, in very short order, we'll get to where eventually we need to get So, in the long-term scheme of things, I think we're headed in the right direction But my own view is that one of the problems in the longer-term markets, and the difficulty that's existed in sorting things out, is this question as to whether the Federal Reserve really is committed to price stability, if you will I don't want to carry that too far; I'm using the term price stability in a very loose sense To the extent markets were convinced of that, it's possible that they could sort themselves out more effectively than we've seen with incremental steps "
5097,1994-05-17," Thanks, Alan The national economy continues to expand rapidly and its momentum appears, at least to me, to be building Industrial production, for example, grew at a 54 percent annual rate for the four months ending in April, faster than the 46 percent rise in 1993 Payroll employment rose at a 27 percent rate in the four months ending in April, following a 19 percent rate of increase in 1993 The unemployment rate fell about a full percentage point over the past year when comparable methods are used to measure it Despite efforts by businesses to build inventory in the first quarter of this year, the inventory-to-sales ratio fell sharply as sales boomed  In the Eighth District, economic activity has also expanded rapidly in recent months Many firms report expansions, additions to payrolls, and increases in sales The District continues to grow faster than the nation as a whole, as best we can determine For example, during the past quarter nonagricultural employment increased in all District states by a significantly larger percentage than the national average, namely by 7-1/2 percent at an annual rate versus 21 percent nationally Increases in employment are occurring in nearly every major manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sector District reports reveal that the Eighth District's expansion is spreading to parts of the District such as southern Illinois that had until recently been sluggish Particularly noteworthy developments are occurring in the transportation sector Increases in auto production, which Tom Hoenig and Si Keehn have mentioned, are expected to boost auto employment in St Louis to the highest level since 1989 Commercial aircraft orders also are rising considerably The District's real estate sector remains strong as evidenced by double- digit increases in building permits and continuing anecdotal reports that homes available for sale are in short supply Relatively strong loan demand, especially by businesses, is also indicative of the strength of the Eighth District's economy  The momentum of the economic expansion, as I mentioned before, seems to me to be building I am not comfortable with the Greenbook outlook that nominal and real GDP are poised to slow down in the second half of this year Such a slowing appears to be based on a cutback in interest-sensitive sectors, especially housing Housing affordability, even with today's mortgage rates, in my view is very favorable And reports at last week's Business Roundtable meeting expressed strong doubts that interest rate increases are retarding spending to any degree at all or are likely to do so in the near future  The continuing strong performance of the District and national economies reinforces my concerns about the inflation outlook In the Eighth District the prospects for increased cost and price pressures have been boosted by low-levels of farm inventories and new houses for sale, and more broadly by substantial job growth and relatively low unemployment rates Nationally, both consumer and producer price increases have accelerated over the past seven months from their pace over the previous five months In addition,  -24-    5/17/94  inflationary expectations have increased as well, which is reflected in declines in both bond prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar since our last meeting   Don, I just wanted to ask about the April tax payments and whether you think there is any peculiar behavior occurring that may be depressing M1 in the short run A year ago we had a similar experience but you didn't mention that in terms of--   Alan, I would endorse what you recommended I'd like to briefly state my reasons First of all, as you know I've viewed the stance of monetary policy as having been very accommodative for some time, which I think will lay the basis for an acceleration in inflation Over the last three years, for example, our net open market purchases of government securities have totaled over $100 billion, which is a staggering number This expansion in base money has fostered a tremendous increase in liquidity, with the narrow money stock, M1, increasing by one third over this period Secondly, I don't think we've gained credibility in financial and foreign exchange markets with respect to our resolve to contain inflationary pressures, let alone achieving or moving further toward price stability With respect to the risk of overdoing it, I would agree with what you said One of the things I looked at in that connection is the prevailing forward rate structure, which is cited in the Greenbook; it anticipates about 150 basis points of increase in short-term rates before the end of the year So, as I say, I don't think this move is overdoing it In fact, if we don't keep up with sustained increases in market interest rates, I think we run the risk of a policy that continues to be accommodative and will simply increase the inflationary pressures down the road  With respect to the statement that you read, I would be concerned about anything that was interpreted as our having reached neutrality, because I don't think we really know I'm a little concerned that maybe those words--I don't have an alternative suggestion--too strongly suggest that we've reached a neutral stance I just don't know what that is   One suggestion, I'm sorry to butt in, but maybe the phrase ""significantly reduces"" rather than ""substantially removes"" I don't know whether that-- "
5121,1994-07-05," This is a question for either Peter or Ted The question is whether you are concerned about the extent to which our current account deficit has been financed recently through central bank intervention and, as a practical matter, how closely we can monitor that   With respect to our projections for 1994, we have somewhat higher rates of nominal GDP growth and inflation than the central tendency, but for 1995 we have significant further acceleration in inflation--considerably more than other members' forecasts that I have seen Basically, I would attribute that to our view of the lagged effects of an increasingly accommodative monetary policy, roughly in the period 1991 to 1993 That degree of accommodation has been manifested in a number of ways One way I would cite is--I have mentioned this before--that base money over that period was up approximately $100 billion, and that in turn provided the basis for growth in the stock of M1 by more than 1/3 over that period of time I thought it was quite interesting in Joan's report that she indicated that, even though we perceive that we have tightened, we have purchased $16 billion of securities this year, so in 1994 we are essentially on the same $100 billion per 3-year pace of additions to base money  With respect to national economic conditions, conceptually I think what has been going on is that we have seen the more rapid growth in nominal GDP reflected in strong growth in output and employment rather than rising prices and wages Even though there has been some slowing in output and employment, in my view the economy is still growing at an unsustainably high rate In that regard I would cite just two examples Industrial production, which has slowed down, has still been growing at a 39 percent annual rate since February, and payroll employment has been growing at about a 34 percent annual rate over the same period I find that information particularly troubling against the backdrop of capacity utilization at a relatively high level of 83-1/2 percent, which is up 3 percentage points in the last year The civilian unemployment rate is down 1-1/2 percentage points over the same period to a relatively low 6 percent I might also note that the level of unfilled orders as indicated in Part II of the Greenbook has risen quite substantially over the last year So my view would be that our focus should be on the prospect of rising inflation at this juncture, not on growth which is slowing from unsustainably high levels  With respect to the District, economic activity in the Eighth District also has expanded rapidly in recent months We have had many firms report expansions, additions to payroll, and increases to sales Major auto producers in the District plan to boost production significantly in the third quarter, in line with announcements for national production increases Loan demand continues to grow rapidly, and favorable crop conditions are reported We hear more frequent reports of difficulties in finding labor Two of the examples that I have heard in the District would be skilled construction workers, which Bob Forrestal also mentioned, and truck drivers, which has been mentioned by someone else There are also reports of growing delays in deliveries of materials District civilian employment growth has  -27-    7/5-6/94  outpaced that of the nation in recent months As a result, our measure of the District's unemployment rate, which we base on a proxy of four principal states in our region, has fallen to 48 percent in April from an earlier high of 69 percent in October 1991 This is the lowest level registered in almost 20 years The District's real estate sector remains very strong, with robust home sales The inventory of houses for sale is unusually low in many areas, and this is adding to price pressures  Finally, let me make a couple of comments about inflation I was certainly more comfortable last year when the broad measures of prices were showing annual rates of increase of 1 to 2 percent But even then, as I think I expressed at the time, I was worried about the stance of policy and its likely implications for future inflation In the meantime, most inflation measures, as we all know, have accelerated, including broad inflation measures Just to cite an example, since September the CPI has risen at a 27 percent annual rate, up from the 18 percent registered from April to September 1993, and similar patterns obtain for other broad measures of prices In addition, some narrower price measures are moving up even more sharply For example, in the latest four months, both the PCE deflator and the capital equipment component of producer prices were up at about 38 percent annual rates This information, taken together with recent data on sensitive industrial materials prices and oil prices, makes me very uneasy about the possible path of future inflation I think the risks are very clearly in that direction   Alan, I am assuming now that you want our views on what we would do with the ranges and these other issues; I am in that mode I would reaffirm the existing ranges for 1994 and I would set the same ranges for 1995 I would be willing to adjust the debt aggregate I think we could deal with any uncertainties that that might raise, but I don't feel strongly about it My basic rationale would be the same one you expressed--the long-run benchmark concept with respect to M2 growth and normal velocity and the consistency of that range with long-term price stability  Now, having said that, and this has come up in other discussions we have had, I don't think our target ranges communicate anything with respect to our long-run intentions That is really the issue that Senator Riegle is raising It has to do with the uncertainty about velocity and how we have been treating the aggregates, quite appropriately I think My own view is that there is a good deal of uncertainty about those intentions and there would be  -50-    7/5-6/94  two things I would cite One was a survey, and I think it might have been discussed in a Board briefing, about long-run inflation expectations with respect to the G-7 countries I was somewhat dismayed to see the United States ranked among the high inflation G-7 countries, along with Italy and the United Kingdom The average inflation expectations for the United States in that survey were 36 percent over 10 years, with four other countries being considerably lower So, that would be one piece of evidence in my mind about confusion with respect to what we all say about being committed to long-term price stability and yet having a survey--I don't know how reliable it was--that creates that sort of result  The other uncertainty about our intentions is in a much more current context and relates to developments since our last meeting I think our actions at the last meeting created quite favorable responses in financial markets, particularly in long-term fixed income markets Those actions initially had considerable credibility But if you look at what has been going on broadly since then, again it's quite disconcerting to me in terms of what people think about our intentions In effect, we have had private-sector forecasters ratcheting up their inflation expectations for 1996 We have had additional anecdotal and other information with respect to rising prices and perhaps labor shortages here and there Yet, what the FOMC said after its last action was that we had substantially removed the degree of monetary accommodation that had prevailed during 1993 What has emerged in the meantime is a perception that we breathed a big sigh of relief, having moved rates 125 basis points and maybe gotten at best to neutral, and we were going to rest on our oars while all these other developments were going on which would lead to higher inflation expectations and ultimately to higher inflation In effect, we are viewed as having said, I think, that 3 percent or somewhat higher inflation is good enough as far as we are concerned  Now, I understand that all hasn't been said and done by this Committee and over the longer run we will do the right thing But there are significant costs, I think, to these sorts of perceptions, particularly in terms of longer-term rates Recognizing that the aggregate ranges do not communicate anything about our intentions and that there is confusion in the marketplace and perhaps elsewhere with respect to what those intentions are, my own view would be that it's time for us to be much more explicit about what our long-run intentions are with respect to an inflation range and to indicate that as a practical matter it would probably take us a while to achieve that objective If I did anything at all in response to Senator Riegle's request, it would be some sort of a nominal GDP target from which one could derive an implicit inflation target I think if we respond at all, that is how we ought to be responding If we don't make an explicit statement in this FOMC testimony with respect to our long-run expectations on inflation that goes beyond ""we think price stability is good,"" and get more specific in terms of a target range, then at the very least I think we have to make it clear that we consider 3 percent inflation to be unacceptable and we are not willing to accept it Obviously, we have to back that up with actions, but we are going to talk about that later I really think there is a cost to how things have unfolded here   I have a lot of sympathy for the views Al Broaddus expressed earlier In terms of reasons to act, the dollar is not a reason to act I think there is information in the behavior of the dollar I accept what Jerry and others have said about the dollar/yen, but I think there is a depreciation going on more broadly on a trade-weighted basis Basically, markets are going to set those levels, and we certainly are not going to set them through intervention nor for that matter in the short run through policy actions In the long run, as you said earlier, Mr Chairman, our policy actions matter a lot Secondly, I agree with what Bob Parry just said Incoming data are not a reason to act now, particularly real data, but even price data I think the reason to act is to keep inflation and inflation expectations from rising and ultimately to make further progress toward price stability than we have managed to accomplish so far What I have been looking at for some time, and I mentioned this before, is that we have a very large monetary stimulus put in train over the last three years that we have to offset Really, all we have done in our own words is to get back to a neutral policy I continue to think that markets are sitting there looking at what we have said, looking at what we are doing, and saying that 3 percent or higher inflation is okay with the FOMC From their point of view, if they think they have figured it out, it's okay with them too; they will just go with the flow But I don't think in the long run it's okay for the country So as far as I am concerned the sooner we change that perception the better off we will be  Where I come out is that I would move at least as aggressively as we did last time I'd move the funds rate up 50 basis points, and I would couple that with an increase in the discount rate of 50, maybe even 75, basis points I would use the discount rate announcement to make it clear that we are acting because of concerns about domestic inflation and by implication not to defend the dollar I might just say--now obviously I am interpreting events differently than others, so please take that into account--that from my perspective, not to do something that is fundamentally called for because of a concern about the perceptions about it is not a good reason not to do it We ought to do what's right and we ought to explain why we did it  To conclude, as I assess things and look at the risk-reward tradeoff, I think there is little risk of somehow derailing this expansion There is a lot of momentum out there and I don't think 50 basis points is going to derail it As I said before, the incoming month-to-month data on the real economy are not important to me at this juncture, although obviously they are over longer periods of time I think if we did move, it might allow us to get ahead of this inflation process Now, we could well have some development over the next week or two that even in the short run would make our job a great deal tougher than if we act right now, which I think is a risk associated with waiting  -74-    7/5-6/94   Alan, I forgot to comment on the announcement I agree with announcing something I guess I am wondering whether, if we just had Joe Coyne, as spokesperson for the Fed, contact the wire services and say that the meeting was concluded and that no actions were taken, that might give us a little more room in terms of setting a precedent If you actually make an announcement--   Well, no, it actually has been a statement by the Chairman in the earlier--   As spokesperson for the Fed or whatever   I just didn't think it would be a good idea to have a statement in your name on this "
5160,1994-08-16," With respect to the national economy, I think the view that GDP might slow to a sustainable pace without further timely Fed action has been resolved in the negative Employment growth continues to be strong, retail sales held up well in the second quarter, and inventories remain low relative to sales At the same time, there is increasing evidence of inflation not only in the narrow areas that Ed mentioned, but I think in the broader measures of wages and prices as well For example, the implicit GDP deflator rose by about 28 percent at an annual rate in the first half of 1994 compared to 12 percent in the last half of 1993, which is a marked increase indeed Looking ahead, for what it's worth, the Greenbook expects the CPI to rise at a 4 percent rate in the third quarter and the employment cost index at a 4-1/2 percent rate, albeit there are some special factors affecting the latter index Such increases, should they materialize, will not go unnoticed in the current environment where there are increasing concerns about price pressures Accordingly, as I have felt for some time, the risks are clearly on the side of rising inflation I would also note that the recent increases in bank credit are striking, with business and consumer loans up at annual rates in July of 17 and 23 percent respectively, and that is a trend that has been building for some time Growth of the broad aggregates has picked up as well, suggesting money and credit conditions that are quite consistent with rising demand and inflation  -14-    8/16/94  With respect to the District, activity continues to expand at a solid pace, albeit more slowly than nationally in contrast to earlier in the expansion when we were outpacing the nation A significant sector evidencing weakness recently has been transportation equipment However, following their annual two-week shutdowns during July, the District's major auto plants have resumed production at or above June levels While production is slated to slow again later in the year, this is attributed to model changeovers or plant refurbishings and modernizations Recent declines in sales, according to industry sources, result from exceedingly low inventories in certain models, not from slowing demand It seems to me that the pricing behavior of auto companies confirms this view Housing activity remains at relatively high levels in the District, with many areas reporting shortages of housing for sale and rising prices Commercial real estate activity continues to improve In Memphis, for example, the office vacancy rate is at a 6-year low, and industrial construction is headed toward a 10-year peak Crops are generally in good condition throughout the District, with record or near-record cotton and rice crops in some District states Thank you   Alan, I came in favoring alternative D coupled with at least an increase of 50 basis points in the discount rate So I, too, support what you have recommended Just a couple of comments on how aggressively to move, though there seems to be support for your recommendation I think that both to contain emerging inflationary pressures and to demonstrate our resolve with respect to price stability in the long run, we have to move aggressively now I share your concerns about the potential of ""the other shoe dropping"" syndrome with respect to doing only 25 basis points I think, as people have said earlier, temporizing now just makes our job tougher later With respect to credibility, I think there is evidence in financial markets that we have a ways to go before we really do have credibility with respect to our longer-run inflation intentions  With respect to the statement, the only concern I would raise and hope you take into account in drafting it is to make sure you incorporate what you said about not tying our hands We really can't know today what could transpire, and we have to have flexibility to evaluate incoming data and move further if necessary If financial markets really concluded that we basically were ""out to lunch"" for the rest of the year, we could set in motion speculative forces that actually accelerate the need to move again So it's got to be done carefully; I trust your judgment on how to do that, but it is tricky   I just had a comment on the language; I don't know if this is the right time to make it Have you gotten everybody's view? I shouldn't come back in unless you've gotten everyone   I think the ""at least for a time"" does it in terms of the flexibility, Alan If I heard it right, you said ""consistent at least for a time with the Committee's goals of""--what was that--noninflationary?      8/16/94   The only question I have is whether it is possible that somebody could then conclude that the roughly 3 percent inflation we are seeing now is consistent in the mind of the Committee with zero inflation?   Okay   I understand "
5184,1994-09-27," Thanks, Alan Peter, are there practical constraints in terms of how much we can do? In other words, if we put all of our reserves into the repo market, I think we would probably be    9/27/94  in excess of 20 percent of the market What would represent a practical limit there? Secondly, what are the practices in terms of collateralizing a repo initially and what sort of mark-to-the-market provisions do they have? Is it comparable to our repo market here?   So you could pretty much specify what you wanted in that regard?   Thank you   Thanks, Alan Despite hopes to the contrary, the fact is that inflation has turned up Projected strength in demand, which is a view we would certainly associate ourselves with, may well add further to inflationary strains In the past three months, both retail sales growth and industrial production have accelerated Payroll employment growth continues to be strong Correspondingly, as has been mentioned, capacity utilization has risen well above its 1967 through 1993 average of about 82 percent A rebound in auto production in August and recent announcements of auto sales and production schedules point to improving growth in industrial output through the end of this year  In the Eighth District, auto production has been booming in the third quarter, and producers recently have boosted production plans for the fourth quarter Production at Ford and Chrysler plants in St Louis is planned to rise by about 11 percent from the third quarter and by more than 2 percent from year-ago boom levels Auto industry officials continue to see sales constrained by supply as producers reduce output in some areas to retool and make capacity improvements Overall in the Eighth District, there has been some leveling in economic activity but at a very high level inasmuch as we had recovered to near capacity far faster than the nation as a whole Nonetheless, employment in the District remains robust as the unemployment rate hovers near its lowest level since August 1974 Reports of labor shortages in certain trades and geographic areas are increasing in my judgment For example, in the construction trades, there are now reports of shortages throughout the District In certain areas that had been very successful in attracting new business--areas like Bowling Green, Kentucky and Jackson, Tennessee-- regional development efforts are being altered to reassure new and expanding businesses about the continuing availability of labor Jackson, for example, recently has announced a six-month hiatus in recruiting large business prospects In some areas, there are shortages even of unskilled labor, although these are being offset in certain cases by hiring immigrant laborers from Mexico, for example in northwest Arkansas Turnover rates are very high Firms report having to hire two to three apparently qualified workers--and that implies screening a lot more--at this unskilled labor level for every one that pans out While reports of wage pressures have been isolated so far, broader-based pressures seem incipient given these developments in labor markets  Business executives in the District are also seeing evidence of price pressures from rising costs of steel, paper products, and a variety of raw materials from both foreign and domestic sources Despite continued competition in product markets that limits their ability to pass on costs, it would not take much, in my judgment, to crystallize price increases in such an environment In fact, an interesting aside, somewhat contrary to the report of the view of the National Association of Manufacturers, is the view I am getting from manufacturers in our District They perceive that the marketplace they are operating in is so competitive that to enable them to stay competitive, they would like us to take action to contain what they see as emerging price and wage pressures  -27-    9/27/94  One final area I wanted to comment on is inventories Of course, many economists have been concerned that the second-quarter buildup foreshadows slower demand growth ahead However, again based on conversations I have had with business executives in the Eighth District, my general sense is that the buildup was intended Let me give you just one example Last week we had a meeting outside of St Louis, and a manufacturer of steel for industrial and commercial buildings with operations not only in our District but the upper Midwest and the West told me that his lead times from suppliers are now two to three times above what he would normally expect and that he in turn has pushed out his delivery schedules for his customers to probably twice what they normally would be As a result, to prevent further delays in meeting his customers' demands, he has begun to order raw materials in anticipation of orders that really have not materialized I will say, however, that when I asked him whether he was willing to build speculative inventories based on the prospect of further increases in prices of materials, he said no By the way, he has seen two steel price increases so far this year totaling 10 to 12 percent and another increase has been announced and seems very likely for the beginning of the year, So far, all that is going on, at least in this sample of one, is the building of additional inventories against expected final orders   Steel products for industrial and commercial buildings--warehouses, light industrial buildings, strip shopping centers, that sort of product  To conclude, I'm very concerned about inflation no matter what measure one looks at In July and August, consumer prices accelerated to an annual rate of 41 percent and producer prices to an annual rate of more than 6 percent Inflation is certainly headed in the wrong direction if price stability is our goal   Alan, I'd favor ""D"" combined with a discount rate increase; I'd do the 50 basis points now I think it's necessary to contain the emerging inflationary pressures, and I also think it's necessary to make longer-term progress toward price stability I think, as you and others have observed, that waiting simply makes our job more difficult and raises questions about credibility I guess I interpret financial market developments much as Al Broaddus did With the bond rate at the highest level since the recession and more sensitivity in foreign exchange markets, I think credibility is an issue To the extent we lose it, it makes this process much more expensive for everybody It's not just a matter of the credibility of the institution; what really matters is how it impacts the real world  -43-    9/27/94  I think to the extent we maintain our credibility, longer rates will be lower than they otherwise would be  With respect to the language, I personally think there have been significant developments, and I think there is a danger in that sort of language One can make the argument that the existence of that language actually has undermined some of our credibility because of concerns about whether in fact we would act on a timely basis The information in terms of the real economy, prices, and financial markets frankly has been quite strong in this intermeeting period, as far as I'm concerned  Let me make one final comment about the monetary aggregates I, too, would normally be quite concerned about the very slow growth of the narrower aggregates in 1994--as you know I tend to focus more closely on the narrower aggregates that we can actually influence-- but I think their growth has to be viewed in the context of a tremendous monetary impulse in 1991 through 1993 You have heard me say it before, but the base grew $100 billion over that 3-year period I think in a sense there is a liquidity overhang and that needs to get worked off I might also observe--   Yes, that would be in the base But in any event, I view that as a very stimulative impulse, the effects of which may still be playing through In the mid-1980s--actually I think it was mid-1988 to mid-1989--we also had very slow growth in the base and reserves for about a 1-year period That was on top of two prior years of very sluggish growth in the narrower aggregates So my feeling would be that, yes, growth of the narrow aggregates has been slow, but in the scheme of things it hasn't been all that slow for that long I might also observe that there are, as you well know, some very significant technical factors that are impacting Ml, including in particular the mortgage refinancing phenomenon Our guess is that that took 7 percentage points of growth out of M1 in August, and our best guess would be, abstracting from that, that M1 probably is growing somewhere in the area of 4 to 5 percent But we'll see I don't think on a short-run basis these aggregates are particularly helpful to us in any event I think they have to be looked at over long periods of time "
5209,1994-11-15," National economic activity is much stronger than earlier forecasts anticipated Employment grew twice as fast as the labor force from January to October There was a large rise in hours worked in both September and October, including an extraordinary amount of overtime Wage pressures are building Average hourly earnings surged in October; for the past four months, this measure of wages has risen at a 44 percent annual rate, up sharply from only 13 percent in the first five months of 1994 Such reflections of tight labor market conditions are signs of prospective inflationary pressures  Strong credit demands also reveal the strength of economic activity and nominal spending Growth in business loans at commercial banks nationwide and in the Eighth District has been rapid throughout this year Since spring, banks have reduced their holdings of securities and have bid aggressively for time deposits to accommodate loan demand Nonfinancial firms have also increased issuance of commercial paper since September, corroborating the increased demand for credit by businesses The large inventory accumulation in the second quarter was followed by a larger accumulation in the third quarter Those forecasters who had expected a substantial slowing in real growth following a large buildup in inventories in the second quarter seem to have guessed wrong Nevertheless, inventory-to-sales ratios remain very low by historical comparisons, so low in fact that many firms are concerned about both deteriorating vendor performance and the prospect of continued acceleration in sensitive materials prices  My contacts in the Eighth District indicate that increases in inventories have largely been planned in anticipation of strong sales,    11/15/94  including retailers who ended the last Christmas shopping season with largely empty shelves Overall, employment in the Eighth District remains robust and the District unemployment rate hovers near its lowest levels since August 1974 This September, the District unemployment rate was 47 percent compared with the 58 percent rate for the nation in October In recent contacts with business executives and directors in the Eighth District, the consensus was that wage pressures are building, especially for unskilled workers and construction workers I have been hearing these reports and have mentioned them here for some time, but I'm hearing more and more reports of actual increases in wages Furthermore, contacts report price pressures from rising costs of raw materials from both domestic and foreign sources Prices of imported goods, which had been an important factor in holding down inflation until recently, rose at a 69 percent annual rate in the past two quarters after falling over the previous two quarters  Finally, looking ahead, I am troubled by the Greenbook forecast, which shows that among G-7 countries only Italy and the United Kingdom have a higher inflation outlook for 1996 than the United States Thus, it is not surprising that we seem to lack credibility with respect to price stability, and this is indeed costly in current circumstances Picking up on what Al Broaddus said, I feel that it may be time for us to consider setting a specific inflation target that looks out into the future I think, and this point was made as well, that it could make our job considerably easier in circumstances like the present--with upward cyclical inflationary pressures--if people were willing to look out to a longer-range target and that added to credibility   I support your recommendation also, Alan, based on what I have heard about emerging inflationary pressures and also the importance of credibility and the fact that if we have credibility, it will reduce the long-term cost of keeping inflation and inflation expectations under control  Just a couple of comments on things that came up after my earlier comments One is on the slow money growth That's something  -38-    11/15/94  that would ordinarily trouble me I think I mentioned last time or the meeting before that in view of the very large monetary stimulus from 1991 through 1993, I am not as concerned as I would otherwise be It is very difficult to evaluate when the effects of that stimulus will all be played out I applaud Alan Blinder for trying to put numbers on it I think we all know that if it were that easy to put numbers on the effects of monetary policy actions, we probably could be much more precise in setting policy But it still is helpful in a directional sense to try to understand those things  With respect to stop/go monetary policies and the risk of putting things over the edge here, unfortunately we don't have, in my view, a lot of inflation credibility The time to correct this stop/go phenomenon and try to look through current developments is when we are in a ""go"" phase In other words, I think it is much easier to correct by not driving the funds rate too low or stimulating the aggregates too much when trying to foster a recovery If we try to fix it at this stage, because of presumptions about an inflationary bias of Fed actions, it really becomes very difficult to do that and maintain credibility I agree with what you said before At some point, we are going to reach a very difficult juncture, and we will have to make some tough judgments But I think we are far from that point right now   Alan, just getting back to what you said earlier, my worst fear about what I just heard was that it may work the first time [Laughter] and give some people confidence that that can be a substitute for getting the fundamentals right I'd just pick up on something you said earlier Maybe the secret is to keep some variety in here I'd hate to see us get into a mode where there was some perception that it would be appropriate just because it worked once The markets are so much bigger than we and all the other central banks put together are Once it becomes known as a mode of operation and the surprise element is gone, I don't think it could work on a sustained basis "
5234,1994-12-20," In the third quarter, nominal GDP was up 67 percent from a year earlier, the largest year-over-year rise in five years More recently, nominal retail sales rose at a 151 percent annual rate from July to November, the fastest four-month pace since the spring of 1987 There are few signs yet that our monetary policy  -20-    12/20/94  actions have slowed the pace of spending Since March, for example, business loan growth has accelerated to an 111 percent rate, after falling in 1993 Nevertheless, in my view monetary policy has shifted toward restraint All monetary aggregates have shown relatively weak growth since spring Inventory investment has been very strong this year In my view rapid inventory accumulation has been desired and is likely to continue for a time Despite rapid inventory accumulation so far this year, the inventory-to-sales ratio has remained near the lowest level since the early 1950s According to a recent survey by our staff, attempts in the Eighth District to build inventory, especially of finished goods, have been unsuccessful simply because of continuing strong sales growth One major motor vehicle manufacturer in the Eighth District reported that it held larger stocks than its two domestic competitors simply because, in contrast to its rivals, it had the capacity to keep production closer to the pace of sales Even so, this firm has had difficulty in keeping its strongest selling models in stock Such observations matched the concern with respect to the nation as a whole expressed in the National Association of Purchasing Managers surveys in October and November  In November, employment gains exceeded the robust average monthly increases from January to October and were more than twice as large as the average monthly rise in the civilian labor force Eighth District unemployment fell to 47 percent in October, its lowest level since August 1974 That's a level at which we have been hovering for some time On a comparably measured basis, the nation's unemployment rate has fallen to its March 1989 level, which in turn was the lowest since December 1973  Notwithstanding this evidence of strength on the real side, the positive reaction of the bond and other financial markets in recent weeks is heartening I hope this means that the markets now believe that the long-term inflation rate will not accelerate from its current level Whether the nearly universal expectation that inflation over the near term, or the long term for that matter, will be 3 percent or more is acceptable is another question, as is whether we act today in terms of any short-term actions I am not at all averse to strong cyclical real growth if the thrust of our policy is consistent with long-run price stability and we have credibility   Thanks, Alan I favor ""B"" asymmetric toward tightening As I mentioned before, the response of the financial markets to our last move together with the slow growth of the aggregates convinces me that we can afford to do nothing now and observe the effects of our prior actions for a time I must say, though, that I'm not at all convinced that we have fully met the current challenge especially if our goal, as I think it should be, is price stability Therefore, I think it is important that we give serious consideration at the February meeting as to how we might convey our long-term intentions in this regard The question that we had from Senator Riegle last July was indicative, I think, of the fact that perhaps on the outside there was some confusion as to exactly what we intended   Yes With regard to that issue, perhaps one thing we ought to think about would be to provide some longer-run inflation forecasts, say beyond 1995 or 1996, because, as an initial step in considering legislation, I think one could say that monetary policy is going to have its principal long-term impact on inflation Eventually, I would be inclined to establish long-run inflation or price level objectives as some other central banks have done Now clearly this is going to require a lot of further work, and I'm encouraged by the fact that the staff is looking into that issue I would hope that we might have something, at least to start on, that we could talk about at the February meeting   Jerry, just to clarify, I favor your objective as well, but recognizing the practicalities of getting from where we are to that in a relatively short period of time and the possibility of a legislative mandate, I was suggesting that a long-term forecast may be an intermediate step we could take on our own right away But I agree with you   Yes, I'm looking even further out as a possibility "
5251,1994-12-30," Alan, just quickly, this is Tom Melzer In terms of the relevant size, with this supplementary amount we are agreeing to I guess $4-1/2 billion, which is somewhere in the area of the permanent lines for Japan and Germany I don't know what the precedent is for supplementary lines, whether there are any precedential issues I put a lot of weight on what was said earlier about our ability to demand adequate collateralization and that obviously is the key point in terms of protecting ourselves here But are there any inferences from precedents for what we might be creating for the future?   Thank you "
5265,1995-01-13," Alan, in that context will you be talking about the prospects for additional drawings on the swap line and how they might be secured?   Alan, how is the first $500 million secured and would you anticipate similar security on any additional drawings?   I was going to suggest that maybe it would be appropriate before any more is drawn to get that in place, but it doesn't appear that that would necessarily be feasible   I guess I'd be inclined to try to insist on that if possible "
5287,1995-01-31," First of all, I favor making statements only when there is a change in policy, not when there is no change Secondly, I am comfortable leaving it up to the Chairman's discretion I could imagine, for example, a change in policy where the Chairman decides not to say much at all, and I can imagine other changes where more would be appropriate But I think ultimately it has to be at his discretion From time to time he may want to consult with the Committee, but I would not make the consultation obligatory  The one concern I have about statements relates to the possibility that they may take some flexibility away from the Committee in the future We have to be very careful about that Otherwise, the language becomes subject to negotiation because it is predisposing what we may or may not be able to do in the future The statements have to be very carefully drafted in my view so as not to take that flexibility away I do not think that the opportunity for assenting statements really offsets that because once that public statement is made, an expectation has been set in motion in the marketplace Assenting statements coming out six weeks later are not going to make any difference in altering those expectations or really give any solace to an FOMC member who feels that the Committee's flexibility has been compromised by the statement   Yes   What I would want would be the latter, what you just described--a description of our rationale for taking the action    1/31-2/1/95   A couple of comments First, on this issue of turning the tape off for certain periods of time, I have had a concern that in doing that, even though it might be desirable in some respects, we could incur a fairly heavy political cost with respect to how the Federal Reserve is perceived Apparently, the public perception is that the Fed is not as forthcoming as it ought to be, and turning off the tape for parts of our meetings would be perceived as a step in the direction of becoming more secretive So, as I mentioned in the letter that I sent to Alan Blinder earlier, while it might be desirable in some sense, I think if I were going to incur that cost, I would be inclined to shut the tape off entirely  Second, in thinking about these issues, I come at it the same way that Ed Boehne described before We really have to think in terms of this tradeoff between the deliberative process and providing disclosure to the public Our primary responsibility ought to be to make sure that we have an effective deliberative process and then provide as much information to the public as possible In thinking about the issue of continuing to run the tapes, I feel much the same way as Governor Lindsey has stated here In my view it is just a matter of time, given the various avenues through which we could be served a Congressional subpoena, that those tapes will be listened to on virtually a real time basis and could be used as a means of isolating members and basically killing the deliberative process The only way to preserve that process at that point in time would be to say, now that the damage is apparent, we are going to turn the tape off But that would be in the very sort of climate that that action would be considered as a major affront Frankly, I have seen us back away from much less threatening situations because of the concern about the potential for legislation In this particular issue with respect to the tapes, we have had a couple of opportunities along the way, in my opinion anyway, where we might have had an opening to  -16-    1/31-2/1/95  correct this The first instance occurred when the Justice Department announced its new policies with respect to defending agencies on FOIA requests We may have had another opportunity more recently this fall In any event, I think that we could be leaving a future FOMC in a very difficult position In effect, in approving what is recommended here, we have to be saying to ourselves, I am approving this recognizing that an important condition would be that, in the event of that sort of request, we would be prepared to take the action and turn the tape off to try to preserve the deliberative process and fight whatever battle needs to be fought at that time But again, that is going to be one difficult battle The real question is whether there will be a better opportunity in some other environment to straighten out our record-keeping practices I think all of this is better stated in my letter that you all have than I have just stated it   There is a reference to that in our report at the bottom of page 2 and the top of page 3 It is an explicit statement of the conditions under which we would approve turning off the tape   Not on substance I was just going to suggest that it might be helpful for the Chairman to take a straw vote--a show of hands--on that issue first, just to get a sense of where people are without a formal vote   At the risk of jeopardizing the direction in which this conversation is headed, which I favor, I will point out that I was the minority view on the subcommittee against assenting statements [Laughter]   I do not see any reason to change any of our rules with respect to how we communicate with the public I think the blackout period is appropriate It is consistent with the discussion we just had Our monetary policy decision should come across as a decision of the group To the extent there is a statement issued, that is the statement explaining our action Frankly, I have taken the view that I am not going to talk about any monetary policy decision until the minutes of that meeting are out, and even then I might not talk about it The record of the meeting is then public but I have not, for example, taken the view that after one week I am at  -34-    1/31-2/1/95  liberty to talk about what the Committee decided and why I think that is a very important rule   I just wanted to clarify what you were saying, Alan I think you are right in terms of individuals never being identified We did have that very difficult period where the leaks to The Wall Street Journal and others covered Committee deliberations and positions To make sure I understand it correctly, what I want to confirm is that we really should never be talking about what went on in an FOMC meeting in terms of who said what   Okay   I think that is another issue There are pros and cons for both of them I don't think it is productive to get into that today, but if we could continue this discussion later, that is clearly one of the issues we ought to have the staff look at and we should discuss further With respect to this point, clearly just announcing that we have set targets would not do much for our credibility What really determines credibility in the long run is how we perform I guess I am saying that making ourselves accountable for something that is quantifiable is much more likely to get us to price stability than the regime we have been in We have been talking about price stability for years, but we are still a long distance away as far as I am concerned even though I think the record of the FOMC has been quite good  The third point I would make relates to something you said a minute ago, Mr Chairman That is, there will be legislative proposals on this and hearings will be held I think it is incumbent on us to get ourselves in a position where we can state a meaningful view as a Committee and try to influence the outcome It is quite possible that, regardless of what we think about inflation targeting, we will get legislation If we are confused about what we want, we could well get legislation that we do not like The other thing I would say is that it is not clear to me, and this again is not the time to discuss it, that the present legislation under which we operate would absolutely preclude some sort of inflation targeting regime I think there would be some advantage to go along the course that Al described where as soon as we can reach some sort of consensus, assuming that there is some consensus in this direction, we could move ahead to take some actions on our own We could have the staff look at various issues and announce that we are considering this matter We might indicate that we would consider this issue and report on it in connection with the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony at midyear and that we would be thinking in terms of setting some sort of provisional targets down the road Obviously, various questions would have to be evaluated before those would be finalized My point is that if we acted in a sense independently of the legislative process, the failure to get legislation would not necessarily preclude us from proceeding with something that I think makes sense in any case and possibly could be reconcilable with some of the other objectives in the existing legislation That is all I have   Ted, what is the status of the collateral arrangements that you discussed on the conference call we had some time ago?   What are the security arrangements?   What would that support? In a one-month period of time, what would those receipts be?   What ability do the Treasury or the ESF have to take us out of an obligation if funds are not appropriated by  -62-    1/31-2/1/95  Congress? Do they have the ability just to say, we committed to this and we are going to pay the Fed off?   But if they can do that, why can't they just advance it themselves?   In the penultimate paragraph, what is the identified source of repayment?   Does this legislation contemplate taking 100 percent of a country's oil payments for four years to insure repayment?   You said this might be outstanding to the ESF for what--10 or 20 years?   I don't mean that Has the ESF ever been used to provide financing, as I think you said earlier was a possibility, that was outstanding for as long as 10 or 20 years?   Ten years Is there any precedent for that? The law seems to contemplate short-term bridge financing   What are the implications of the Treasury just dusting out what they have in the ESF to provide liquidity to the ESF?  -72-    1/31-2/1/95   Are they liquid holdings?   Although that might explain some of the behavior of the dollar today   Is this a matter that needs Committee approval or are you just consulting?   I am very concerned about the overall proposal and how it would involve the Federal Reserve To the extent that a further drawing would involve us further in this arrangement, I do have concerns At the same time I recognize that you have the authority to do it and that you are being prudent in terms of how that money would be secured It is hard to object to that in isolation In fact, I don't have the right to, really! But it does concern me in terms of being another step in the direction of a toe in the water, then the foot, the leg--that is what I am concerned about I know we are going to be discussing other aspects of this issue tomorrow, but I feel that if I did not express that concern now, I would not be totally forthcoming   I had understood Ted Truman to say yesterday that $1 billion had been drawn down on our swap arrangement, and you just said $1-1/2 billion, Peter   So the total outstanding on our portion of that facility is $1-1/2 billion?   Okay   Thanks, Alan The US economy continues to grow more rapidly than forecasters had expected and likely more rapidly than can be sustained, with a four-quarter growth rate through the end of last year of about 4 percent The unemployment rate fell 13 percentage points in 1994 to 54 percent in December In the Eighth District, unemployment is averaging 42 percent in the major states and stands at 39 percent in the St Louis area, the lowest level in decades  Nationally, employment gains have been robust, with the economy adding about 307,000 jobs per month from January through December 1994 This trend has been mirrored in the Eighth District over the last year Arkansas and Kentucky registered payroll employment gains at an annual rate of nearly 6 percent during the fall Some of our District states have picked up some momentum During 1994, employment in our District actually was growing more slowly than in the nation as a whole In fact, contacts throughout the Eighth District report that labor markets are the tightest they have seen in years, with wage pressures in evidence in some markets  -88-    1/31-2/1/95  District retailers reported holiday sales up 6 to 7 percent over year-earlier levels, and post-holiday sales generally have met expectations, reducing retail inventories In a recent survey of small businesses in the District, about 3/4 of the repondents said they expected the current boom to continue or gather strength over the next six months  In general, the performance of the economy has made a mockery out of the slowdown scenario widely predicted last summer for the second half of 1994 on the basis of the inventory buildup in the first half of the year Is it possible that the slowdown scenario now widely predicted for 1995 is also wrong? Our forecast envisions real output growing about 3 percent in 1995 with the CPI inflation rate increasing to about 3-1/2 percent Unemployment in the fourth quarter is forecast to be about the same as its current level Other forecasts--both from the private sector and the Greenbook, even in the case where no further tightening is assumed as in the Greenbook--look for a sharper slowdown in 1995 than we do These forecasts of a weak economy appear to be based in large part on two observations (1) the economy has a strong tendency to return to trend, and (2) the level of inventory investment has been abnormally high While it is true that the economy does tend to return to trend, the pace at which such a return occurs is highly variable and still could be many quarters away Though recent economic performance has been strong, it has not been nearly as strong as in some other expansions and above-trend growth might well be sustained through 1995 as the economy continues to work off the enormous amount of liquidity that was created in 1991 through 1993 A prospective downturn in inventory investment is another negative consideration, but I continue to think that most of the recent inventory accumulation has been planned, which I believe is consistent with what Mike said, as a means to meet expected demand The inventory/sales ratio is holding at an historically low level  In short, while a slowdown is bound to occur at some point, presently there is little hard evidence of it In my view, the risk of misjudging the thrust of demand growth on inflation remains significant despite the widespread opinion that substantially slower growth is ahead In that light, a disturbing feature of the current situation is that most private forecasters expect little improvement on inflation over the next two years or for that matter over even longer periods That observation reflects poorly on the credibility of the FOMC's commitment to price stability With respect to CPI inflation, the recent Blue Chip report predicts 3-1/2 percent inflation in the current quarter and little change to the fourth quarter of 1996 where the projection is 36 percent Likewise, the current Administration assumption has inflation rising to 34 percent in the outyears of their budget projection horizon and basically staying there indefinitely Recent long-term government bond yields of somewhat less than 8 percent suggest longer-term inflation expectations substantially above current inflation We certainly have a way to go to establish the kind of inflation credibility that existed before we lost it in the 1970s   Alan, I am in full agreement with what you recommend The only thing I would add is that I would accompany that increase in the funds rate with an increase in the discount rate   I'm sorry, I missed it My reasons are much the same; let me just quickly tick them off First of all, in my view we must continue to restrain the growth in the monetary aggregates to ensure that incipient inflationary pressures are contained and that progress is made toward price stability Secondly, though the growth in the narrow aggregates has been very slow over the last year, their  -108-    1/31-2/1/95  behavior must be evaluated in light of the very rapid growth rates in 1991 through 1993 In addition, as the Bluebook notes, two factors are estimated to have depressed M1 growth by about 3 percentage points in 1994 Both of those I think argue for continued restraint While an argument can always be made to wait for more information, our credibility in fixed income and foreign exchange markets is fragile in my judgment That would be very consistent with what you said, Alan An imminent action is widely expected Failure to move now might result in adverse consequences for the economy, especially if subsequent information supported continued strong demand and rising prices as I think is likely Finally, I would note that the current account deficit is rising and will approach $200 billion in 1995 based on the Greenbook forecast This makes it all the more important that we focus on maintaining the value of our currency by keeping inflation low I don't think it happens very often that I can do this, but that may be a more gentle way of saying exactly what you said about maintaining investment grade, Alan   A couple of questions, Ted On the first page on the swap arrangement, item number 5 says the Treasury would provide assurance of repayment That really should read the ESF if I understood you correctly?   From a credit point of view it is not But you mean the ESF?   I endorse what you are saying We should get as much as we can in terms of assuring our sources of repayment I would think in a narrow legal sense the credit we are looking at probably is the ESF and not the Treasury Otherwise, we get into questions, if it is a guaranteed obligation, about our extending credit to the Treasury   There is no mention in here of the oil payments that you described yesterday   So, if this oil payments backup got set up, that is not really an issue for us?   But under this arrangement that becomes their business and not ours, and the swap is in effect an unsecured swap with a put to the Treasury or a put to the ESF?   Under that arrangement, what is locked up at the New York Fed now in effect gets released? So, for us that is not an issue?   Yes  SPEAKER(?) I think Tom meant locked up oil money   Okay Let me ask a couple of quick questions about the warehousing   Are we still on the first item? I'm sorry I was out of the room when you started   Let me just ask a couple of quick questions on the financial side because I think it could be helpful as you work out these arrangements to be sure we all understand As I understand it, of the $20 billion in the warehouse facility, the most that would be advanced to the Mexicans would be $14 billion Then $6 billion--   And $6 billion would be retained in the ESF When it is time to take our swap out, we in effect warehouse that remaining $6 billion and pay ourselves off   It seems to me that we have to have some requirement that the ESF retains good collateral of $6 billion so that transaction can get effected and we can get taken out I am sure you will take care of that I don't know whether it makes any sense to establish any expectations I know we have annual reviews by this Committee of the warehousing facility Does it do any good to establish any expectations up front that we would not expect this warehousing to be outstanding longer than 10 years, for example? And what sort of expectations should we set with respect to the possibility of doing additional warehousing operations, say, unrelated to Mexico? I think you said it before, but from my point of view this pretty much exhausts whatever flexibility the ESF has, or perhaps whatever we perceive we might warehouse for them Never say never, but the expectation ought to be that there is not another $20 billion behind this one if they want to intervene in exchange markets   I was talking about expectations with respect to our willingness to warehouse anything beyond this $20 billion   I see what you are saying; the ESF will have used up its assets   One last question and then I have just a couple of comments that I would like to make This has to with the excess collateral in terms of backing US currency I recall that when we warehoused a lot of foreign currencies for the ESF before, we got into a problem with fairly narrow excess collateral If we do this $20 billion, we will then in effect substitute these foreign currency holdings for domestic securities And when we have to sell domestic securities, we will have less of what is viewed as acceptable collateral to back the currency If we exceed those limits, we have to announce to Congress that we are backing our Federal reserve notes with other types of assets What is the likelihood of having to make that sort of announcement?   I am just trying to understand all the implications of this   Yes, it was a seasonal thing, but there was a time of the year when we got very close to exhausting our regular note collateral--I think when we had $9 billion of warehousing on our balance sheet  -135-    1/31-2/1/95   In terms of my own feelings about this, Alan, while I respect your point of view on this, I really have not heard anyone make a case that what we are facing here is some sort of financial crisis in the United States that has systemic implications I think what we are really talking about--when I say we, I am saying that broadly--is providing long-term financing to  another country that has mismanaged its financial affairs If the Treasury wants to do that, that is their prerogative But it is not appropriate for a central bank to participate directly or indirectly in such arrangements, and I think we are setting a very bad precedent Now, I know that technically the way this appears on the surface is that the Treasury is doing it and we are facilitating it But I think the perception is going to be that we are very much a full partner in this  The other thing that concerns me is the use of warehousing arrangements As we all know, we have been criticized in the past when warehousing arrangements were used to facilitate ""normal"" transactions whose purpose was to stabilize dollar exchange markets What we are talking about here is a totally different type of facilitation, much larger-sized This gets back to the second risk that came out in response to Michael Moskow's question I suspect that may subject us to even more criticism inasmuch as Congress and the American people apparently strongly oppose extending credit to Mexico In effect, one could argue that we would be participating in an effort to subvert that will of the public, if you will I do not want to be too dramatic in stating that This could cause a re- evaluation of the institutional structure of the Fed in a very fundamental and broad way   I am not surprised to hear you say that because obviously you would not have gotten involved if--   I understand that and I think people can disagree on these issues I just felt it was important to say that "
5307,1995-03-10," Alan, this is Tom Melzer I would be afraid that if we were participating in something on a major, sustained basis and the conditions weren't right, it might create a perception that this was being done to try to avoid a possible monetary policy response I don't mean to suggest that I think any policy actions are appropriate right now, but such an operation might reinforce that view If that were the case, it would be very negative to the psychology involved   I'm not sure either I'm just saying it is risky business "
5326,1995-03-28," Thanks, Alan My view is that the US economy continues to show strength even though there are now a few signs that the pace of economic activity may be slowing Real GDP grew at a 46 percent rate in the fourth quarter according to the most recent estimate Inventories were a net drag on output growth and domestic demand was strong This combination, which was not apparent in the original advanced GDP report, is a plus for the first quarter since there should be less risk of a quick slowdown due to a quick inventory correction Inventory-based stories of a slowdown have been problematic in any event over the last several quarters, and the inventory-to-sales ratio remains near a historic low  The Eighth District economy remains strong, and at 45 percent, unemployment in major District states remains well below the national average Parts of the District continue to report very tight labor market conditions A recent survey of businesses in the District shows that about as many plan to add employees in the next three months as did at this time a year ago Auto production in the District for the second quarter is projected to be much stronger than in either the fourth quarter or the current quarter Taking these facts together, I view the overall picture on the real side as one of a healthy economy  It is not nearly so easy to be sanguine about the inflation outlook In January and February core inflation averaged about 42 percent, up substantially from the 28 percent rate we saw in 1994 Virtually all major forecasters expect inflation to rise in 1995 The Blue Chip consensus, for example, puts the increase in the CPI at 34 percent in 1995 and 36 percent in 1996 as compared with 26 percent in 1994 Longer-term forecasts of inflation are worrisome from the perspective of this Committee because they indicate that market participants expect inflation at or above its current level at horizons as long as five years A recent University of Michigan survey put inflation expectations at just over 4 percent for 5 to 10 years from now I might add that this troubling figure is actually down from 5 percent late last year This indicates that we are moving in the right direction, but it is clear that few in the marketplace believe our commitment to long-term price stability In this environment, it is particularly important that we ask ourselves what our objectives are Even if we have put a cap on inflation in the 3 to 4 percent range--and I am not sure that that is necessarily clear at this point--we are a long way from our goal of stable prices and the low long-term interest rates that would accompany such an achievement The US government borrowed long term at 4 percent in the late 1950s and the early 1960s when inflation was held to the 0 to 2 percent range in this country The Japanese government can now borrow long term at 4 percent when its inflation rate is comparably low We clearly have a long way to go to establish that kind of credibility again   Alan, in evaluating the current policy stance, as I think you all know, I tend to look at reserve measures and monetary aggregates I think the current policy stance has a chance of capping the recent rise in inflation, albeit probably at a somewhat higher level than we are seeing right now The decline in long-term bond yields gives me some confidence that we can afford to wait and watch for a while As you notice, I said ""chance"" I am not convinced; I would count myself among the agnostics Certainly, looking longer term, I am not at all sure that we have done enough to reduce the trend rate of inflation, and I clearly feel that this 3 to 4 percent inflation range that we may be able to settle for here is much too high  With respect to the outlook for the economy, I personally would not put too much stock in the forecast of an imminent rapid slowdown I think that we could well be surprised by the underlying strength I would associate myself with what Bill McDonough said before in that it seems to me that financial market participants have all rushed to one side of the boat here, and I don't know to what extent comments by Fed officials have led to that My feeling is that market participants are looking at a broad range of indicators and there is much more to their assessment than just Fed statements that have been made In any event, it seems they have all rushed to one side of the boat I think our focus in this Committee ought to be on long-term price stability, not short-run fine-tuning of the real economy That is really what we ought to be thinking about--whether we are on a course that is really going to achieve price stability  The other thing I would say, and there has been surprisingly little mention of it today at least in the context of the policy discussions, is that we have to continue to recognize the constraints put on policy by the weak dollar in foreign exchange markets To the extent that market participants perceive that our actions are not consistent with long-term price stability, then we are courting the possibility of, I think, very severe financial repercussions I have  -45-    3/28/95  never believed that we ought to use policy to try to target a specific exchange rate for the dollar, but I do think we have to recognize at times like this that it can be a very significant constraint not only on what we say but particularly on what we do As I say, I think our focus ought to be on long-term price stability  With respect to the symmetry/asymmetry question, I don't have any strong views about that If the message were that this is asymmetric toward tightening because we think it is more likely we are going to have to tighten more to achieve long-term price stability, I would clearly favor that I could accept a symmetrical directive "
5358,1995-05-23," Thank you, Alan The pace of Eighth District economic activity, while decelerating modestly in some areas, exhibits few signs of a pending slump Unemployment in the major District states remained at 4-1/2 percent in March, well below the national average Parts of the District continue to report tight labor market conditions for both entry-level and skilled workers Many businesses in the District report slowing economic activity, but they generally do not view this as a precursor to a sustained downturn in the near future--very similar to other reports we have heard today Instead, the consensus is for further growth in sales and employment, although at a slower pace than recently experienced New residential construction in the District is below last year's level, but 1994 was a record year in many areas Anecdotal reports support the potential for a revival in housing activity with the recent decline in long-term rates Commercial construction continues to increase at a steady pace as vacancy rates decline and rental rates increase The office vacancy rate in the St Louis area, for instance, has fallen to about  -20-    5/23/95  13 percent, its lowest level in ten years Total commercial and industrial loans outstanding at the largest District banks rose 61 percent between mid-February and mid-April Planned auto production at District plants is contrary to the recent national trends Scheduled second-quarter production of more than 280,000 units represents an increase of more than 3 percent above the number of units scheduled at the time of the last FOMC meeting and is also 3 percent above the number of units produced in the second quarter of 1994 I would associate this with the fact that some popular vehicles, like the Ford Explorer, some minivans, and other models, dominate a lot of the production in our District  Nationally, the economy seems to be slowing further, though there are reasons for optimism over the remainder of 1995 as a number of people pointed out But the central concern of this Committee should be inflation, and the pace of price increases is picking up The annualized growth rate of the CPI was 49 percent in April This index has risen at a 36 percent annual rate since December, up from a 27 percent rate of increase over the last half of 1994 In contrast to the Greenbook, which has CPI inflation peaking in the current quarter, many private forecasters expect inflation to rise throughout 1995 Most worrisome from the perspective of this Committee are longer-term inflation forecasts that indicate that market participants expect inflation at or above its current level for horizons as long as five or ten years So-called low inflation of 3 percent or more is endemic in the present US economy and is being built into exchange rates, long-term interest rates, budget planning, contract negotiations, and economic forecasts We are far from convincing markets of the prospect of moving toward our stated goal of stable prices   I favor ""B"" symmetric as well, Alan I think our focus has to be on pursuing a policy that contains current inflationary pressures and is aimed at making progress toward longer- term price stability I am not, as you know, a great fan of short-run fine-tuning I think we are seeing a slowdown from a nonsustainable rate of growth, and we should not be trying to fine-tune in those circumstances We may have a moderately tight monetary policy, but that is appropriate in view of the tremendous stimulus that took place in 1991 through 1993 The other comment I would make, and we heard some commentary on this issue today, is that any reaction to fiscal policy restraint, certainly any reaction to the prospect of it, is very dangerous Even if we do get some fiscal restraint, I would argue that the best thing monetary policy can do is to provide a stable price backdrop against which the real adjustments that need to take place in that event can occur most effectively "
5384,1995-07-05," Actually, I had a related question I was curious about the same thing Jerry raised Do we end up with an earning asset? Is there a way to earn anything on the SDRs that we hold or is that, in effect, a nonearning asset?  SPEAKER(?) It's nonearning   Mike, I have a question that relates to current activity I have been struck by the fact that nonwithheld income tax payments this April were about $20 billion higher than in each of the two previous Aprils I wondered what your assessment was as to the impact of that on personal consumption expenditures this spring Is that a significant factor in your mind acting as a depressant?   Thanks, Alan As has been noted, there has been a mix of positive and negative indicators of US economic performance recently, and it is not easy to know what such indicators portend for the future It's my opinion, however, that the economy has enjoyed a very balanced expansion since its cyclical trough in March 1991, weathering major changes in federal spending and corporate restructuring Like the Board staff, I am inclined to think that the recent spate of negative indicators reflects a pause in the current cyclical expansion rather than the onset of a recession We are forecasting real GDP growth in the range of 1-1/2 to 2 percent this year, with such growth returning to near its potential in 1996 With an appropriate monetary policy I also believe that inflation could drift down from current levels in 1996, although we would still be a good distance away from price stability On the positive side, the financial indicators are generally looking good The equities market is riding high, and long-term interest rates are down significantly from their peaks of last November Indeed, there are indications that investment spending, including housing, and durable goods may be responding positively to lower long-term interest rates Bank lending is strong, and in the Eighth District loan quality is very high Over the economy as a whole, bank lending is being reflected in an extraordinary increase-in the broad monetary aggregates, which on a longer-term basis are roughly linked to demand growth and inflation There are few signs of structural imbalance The ratio of inventories to final sales remains low; the consumer installment debt delinquency rate is near a 20-year low; and the ratio of debt service to disposable income is well below peak levels reached in the late 1980s    7/5-6/95  Furthermore, the value of the dollar has declined significantly in real terms, so much so that US goods and services must certainly look like bargains in the world market I expect that this will stimulate domestic production later this year and into 1996  Although growth in the Eighth District has slowed, the District economy remains strong Unemployment in District states continues at well under the national average, and employment has continued to grow in both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing District firms producing prefabricated metal buildings, mobile homes, and furniture are experiencing strong demand Perhaps this says something about the durables sector Currently, foreign markets are providing good outlets for the products of many District firms, but sharp increases in import prices are adding to costs In the Eighth District, we see little letup in pressures to raise prices We continue to receive anecdotal evidence that qualified workers are in short supply Most contacts in our District report rising costs and some moderate wage pressures  Given this outlook, I am more concerned about long-run inflation than the prospect of a sustained decline in output CPI inflation accelerated to 3-1/2 percent during the first half of 1995 Such an enormous amount of liquidity was added to the economy in 1991 through 1993 that I remain concerned whether our restrictive policy stance since then has been sufficient to cap inflation and make further progress toward price stability In my opinion, the declines in inflation and inflation expectations have contributed to the current expansion Comparatively low inflation has kept US output competitive in both foreign and domestic markets Moreover, the decline in inflation expectations, which is critically linked to our credibility--the point Al Broaddus was talking about before--has reduced uncertainty, encouraged investment, and enhanced productivity A continuation of the downward trend in long-run inflation is essential for achieving maximum sustainable economic growth   Don, applying the same logic you described with respect to how the 1 to 5 percent range was set for M2, do we have enough confidence about M3--its stability over time and its relationship to M2--to say, if historical relationships obtained, what a comparable range for M3 would be?   Alan, I agree with your concerns about moving the M2 range now and how that might be interpreted I would not  -48-    7/5-6/95  change that range With regard to M3, I am most comfortable with the rationale that Bob Parry just described with respect to taking a look at long-term trends and viewing M3 on a basis consistent with what we have been doing with M2 in recent years That would lead me to favor alternative II for 1995 and alternative I for 1996 I would add that our discussion today points up to me that we are in an increasingly untenable position with respect to how we communicate to Congress our long-term intentions about monetary policy and the need for some sort of nominal anchor I don't expect anything necessarily to come out of what Al has suggested today, but I think we ought to have that as an important topic of discussion well in advance of our February meeting next year We might be thinking about the need to revise our approach for 1996 and perhaps begin to move our time horizon further out   I agree and I felt that way when we talked about this in February The more leadership we exercise in this, the better off we are going to be in terms of the ultimate outcome There are different points of view on this issue, but I think it would be very unfortunate if, for example, we got to a year from now and we were debating how we might adjust the M2 and M3 ranges and never got to this topic Price stability is what a central bank is all about We ought to be quite explicit about that commitment, and we ought to discuss how we might achieve it operationally So, that is very consistent with the sorts of topics that Al is raising Ultimately, I think it would improve our accountability, which would in turn improve our performance and lead to higher economic growth and employment than we otherwise would have achieved Gary Stern made some good points about documenting that case I think that is becoming increasingly urgent, as pointed up by this discussion today, and it is something we have to pursue   Thanks, Alan In my judgment, and I expressed some of this yesterday, the current slowing in the expansion will be followed by a rebound of growth at a rate near the economy's long-term potential In fact, I think the recent evidence suggests, and you mentioned this in your comments, that lower intermediate- and long- term interest rates have in effect put a floor under the housing and auto markets So, at this time my principal concern is really with the long-run inflation trend Trend CPI inflation of 3 percent or higher is reflected in the forecasts, including the Greenbook forecast, and in long-term interest rates In my view trend inflation of 3 percent just isn't good enough With CPI inflation during the first half of 1995 running about 3-1/2 percent at an annual rate and the economy expected to continue to expand at or near its potential, I don't believe the current economic outlook warrants a change in the stance of monetary policy Easing policy at the first sign of economic weakness after a period of what I think we would all agree is unsustainable real growth undermines our credibility and could adversely affect the bond and foreign exchange markets In effect, we would be engaging in short-run fine-tuning under conditions of great uncertainty with respect to the economic outlook Accordingly, my preference would be to maintain the current restrictive policy to ensure that the acceleration in inflation that began last year is capped and to bring trend inflation to a level significantly below 3 percent  Now, having said that, if it is the strong consensus of this group that a 25 basis point cut in the funds rate is warranted, I would not dissent on that even though that is not what I would favor But I would say that if we did that we should make it clear that this action does not reflect a change in our commitment to reduce the trend rate of inflation And, as Bob Parry suggested, we should be prepared to reverse course and allow the funds rate to rise should the evolving situation warrant it Any change in the discount rate at this time or a larger change in the funds rate would be most inappropriate in my view "
5409,1995-08-22," Thanks, Alan As in the nation as a whole, the Eighth District has experienced some slowing relative to 1994 That was expected because the District economy had been growing faster than could be sustained The District unemployment rate was 47 percent in June, holding at about a percentage point below the national figure Recent reports show growth in personal incomes in District states  -17-    8/22/95  centered in the 4 to 5 percent range Job growth has continued, though at a slower pace Conversations with our directors and other District business leaders indicate that the District is generally operating at a high level In fact, forecasts of reduced auto production at the national level are not reflected in the Eighth District The models produced in our District are popular, and the auto companies are expanding capacity Third-quarter motor vehicle production is expected to be 36 percent above the level in the second quarter and 138 percent above the level in the third quarter of last year Loan demand continues to be strong, and District banks have increased loan portfolios by about 15 percent over the last year There has been an increase in the issuance of building permits, suggesting that the District is sharing in the nationwide rebound in the demand for housing Many of the business people I have met have reported pockets of labor shortages, especially for entry-level workers but for some skilled workers as well Nonetheless, as others have mentioned, the labor market information has been mixed On the one hand, there have been some suggestions that wage pressures are continuing to build On the other, there has been a moderate reduction of both overtime and employment of temporary workers  I remain concerned about the outlook for inflation and our inflation credibility When I look at the pattern of inflation expectations--for example, there is a table on CPI inflation expectations in part II of the Greenbook that I think is quite interesting--I see that expectations for future inflation continue to exceed current inflation Even the Administration's mid-session review of the 1996 budget assumes that consumer price inflation will continue in excess of 3 percent through the year 2005 This month the Blue Chip consensus reported expectations that the CPI would rise 33 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, 34 percent in the fourth quarter, and 34 percent in 1996, fourth quarter over fourth quarter It is clear that the prevalent view is that inflation will continue in the 3 to 4 percent range, which is less optimistic than the view expressed by the staff Even the lower bound of a 3 to 4 percent inflation range is certainly not price stability as I see it  I am also worried that we, as well as the financial press and others, are focusing too much on news reports about real economic activity By continually focusing on labor market reports, factory orders, consumer sentiment surveys, and other real series, we undermine our position that the best policy to promote long-term growth and full employment is to achieve and maintain price stability Our words lose their force when we act on uncertain news about real activity in the presence of expectations for inflation as high as they are The decline in bond prices since July 6, which Al mentioned a minute ago, indicates that not everyone expects that the modest acceleration in inflation that has occurred this past year will be capped and that inflation will turn down All said, I am concerned about actual inflation and the high level of inflation expectations that are embedded in forecasts and in longer-term interest rates   Don, first of all I wanted to comment that I really appreciated the remarks you made with respect to the Bluebook I must say that I read the discussion of real rates in the Bluebook and got a headache! I think what really both red me about it is that I view real rates, like any other real variables, as something we can't influence in the long run as well as something that we can't observe So we are describing policy actions in terms of something we can't affect and something we can't see That's why I got the headache Now, there is an easy solution to that get inflation down to zero, keep it there, and we won't have to worry about it We have just cut short rates 25 basis points and have seen long-term nominal rates go up 35 to 40 basis points In that light I was going to note, particularly with regard to a policy option such as alternative A, that it is incomprehensible to me that we somehow could cut short rates again based on our forecast of inflation, which the market doesn't know about, and keep real interest rates in general from rising, let alone foster lower real rates This is very similar to the example you were giving in response to Larry's question The Greenbook inflation forecast is not supported by most other forecasts  -32-    8/22/95  and many surveys of longer-term expectations Real rates, as you suggested in your remarks, are a helpful thing to look at over longer periods of time, but I don't know what to make of the analysis of a short-run policy option based on what would happen to real rates, particularly to real rates across the yield curve   I thought it particularly difficult in the context of our most recent experience to make that argument Let me just leave it there   It's not true in the longer run I get troubled when we start extending that out the yield curve and making judgments as to how it affects the long end of the curve   In terms of the funds rate, yes What troubles me is going out the yield curve and making a general application   Sure   I support it, Alan "
5433,1995-09-26," Thanks, Alan The Eighth District economy continues to grow at a pace largely unchanged from recent reports In general, negative news appears to have been mostly offset by plant expansions, new hiring, and sales gains Reported layoffs from downsizing and plant closings are scattered throughout the District, and such layoffs are somewhat more concentrated in durable goods producers than in other industries But sales at firms in many industries--this is based on anecdotal reports--for instance, prefabricated metal buildings, electric motors, brick manufacturing, and scrap metal, are up on average between 7 and 15 percent so far this year District payroll employment is up about 1-1/2 percent year-to-date, about the same rate of increase as in the nation as a whole The transportation equipment sector is the District's strongest, having grown consistently for nearly two years District automobile production is expected to jump considerably in the months ahead; planned fourth-quarter production is estimated at about 338,000 units, up nearly 29 percent from the second-quarter level That has to do with some new lines that are opening up, particularly for the production of light trucks  A survey of 225 small businesses in the District found that most expect little change in business conditions over the last half of 1995 About 20 percent of the responding firms said they expect to raise prices over the next three months, while less than 3 percent are planning to reduce prices These District price trends mirror the national outlook Private forecasters predict that inflation in 1995, a year of trend growth in real output, will be higher than inflation in 1994, a year of rapid growth in real output Over the next 18 months the most optimistic forecasts, including our own Greenbook, place CPI inflation at its current level, while the more pessimistic forecasts see CPI inflation rising to 4 percent The central concern of this Committee should be progress toward price stability, and there seems to be little prospect that substantial gains will be made anytime in the foreseeable future Inflation forecasts with horizons of five years or more indicate that market participants do not expect inflation to decrease from current levels  On the national level, the economy is recovering from the slowdown in the second quarter Payroll employment jobs have increased at a fair, if uneven, pace over the summer and seem poised to resume a more stable growth path through the autumn One concern in the national outlook is the stance of fiscal policy I would like to associate myself with what Al Broaddus said before and reiterate my view that monetary policy should focus on price stability and not try to offset temporary effects of deficit reduction on aggregate demand The suggestion that the Committee can effectively do more than that is in my view overselling our abilities, given uncertainties about the magnitude and timing of the effects of deficit reduction as well as of our own policy actions  Let me conclude with a few comments on financial indicators Total bank loan growth has been rapid over the last two years and, along with solid growth in M2 since the beginning of 1995, seems to indicate continued strength in the national economy In the Eighth District, total bank loans have been growing at double-digit rates since mid-1994 At the same time in the nation as a whole, total checkable deposits and total reserves, which grew at rapid rates throughout 1992 and 1993, have been subject to a marked runoff since  -23-    9/26/95  the beginning of 1994 In my view, which I think you all know, narrow monetary aggregates such as total reserves and the monetary base adjusted for changes in reserve requirements are important indicators of the stance of monetary policy over longer periods of time However, the adoption by depository institutions of sweep accounts suggests the need to interpret these indicators flexibly in the near term Estimates by the St Louis staff, which are consistent with what is in the Bluebook, suggest that sweep programs could be adopted by depositories holding as much as 3/4 of required reserves and 80 percent of aggregate reserve balances I think it is essential that we continue to monitor these programs because even with all the controversy in interpreting the various monetary aggregates, the provision of an appropriate supply of reserves relative to demand is the core of the implementation of monetary policy   Don, I would like to ask about these sweep accounts--a couple of different aspects One stems from an inquiry that we had just this week from a bank in our District My sense is that knowledge of this is spreading like wildfire through the banking industry, and I think banks are looking to the Fed to take some position on this; they are asking whether the practice is legal and so forth I presume somebody is out there peddling the idea, or the software that supports it, or whatever So, one question would be what can be said about these arrangements and maybe this discussion should be continued later at lunch if that is more appropriate My other question is whether we have the capability to publish data that, without violating any confidences in terms of individual institution data, would give the public a better handle on what is going on Clearly, some people are misinterpreting the stance of monetary policy because they don't have this information   Could it be a phenomenon that's big enough that we need to collect additional data to be able to interpret it correctly?   Alan, I favor ""B"" symmetric as well I view policy as being somewhat restrictive, and I think that is quite appropriate First of all, I think it is a hedge against the possibility that we have not in fact capped inflation in this cycle; I hope we have, but I don't think we know that Secondly and perhaps more importantly, I would like to see the trend rate of inflation move down and certainly more quickly than is evidenced in any of the forecasts that I have seen Perhaps when we see evidence that longer- term inflation expectations in fact are moving down, rather than the flat picture we are looking at now, it might be appropriate to consider an easing, but for credibility reasons I would be very careful not to ease before we saw some evidence along those lines   Alan, in the ten years that I have been directly involved in this process, this has to be the most significant potential institutional development that I have seen come forward Needless to say, from what I have said in the past this bill is something that I would strongly support I think price stability is the appropriate focus for the FOMC and the Federal Reserve more generally It is the one thing we can deliver in the long run That is where we ought to be focused, and if we do it successfully, it is going to enhance the performance of the real economy, and it is going to result in lower longer-term rates  I like the way this bill is structured in terms of articulating the general focus and leaving the details to the central bank Clearly, a lot of work and thinking would have to be done to implement this bill, and it would not be easy, but the structure is quite appropriate in terms of having a direction set by legislation and giving us the opportunity to focus on the details of how to get that done I think a numerical definition of price stability is very important from a credibility point of view  There probably are some things in the language of the bill where we want to consider certain technical modifications In some places, the bill talks about the Board and in other places it talks    9/26/95  about the Board and the FOMC One would have to ask in the context of monetary policy whether some reference to the Reserve Banks needs to be in there as well because of the role of the Reserve Bank boards of directors in setting the discount rate In any event, I think the bill needs consistency in terms of how that sort of thing is described Don Kohn mentioned in his briefing that there was some ambiguity in the bill's language with respect to our taking into account the tradeoff between output and inflation The way I read the language, it implied a tradeoff during the initial transition period That is not an unimportant issue in terms of credibility If that wording is read in effect as giving us latitude to engage in short- term fine-tuning on an ongoing basis, I think that is going to undercut our credibility and will remove some of the value that is inherent in an approach like this  I have just two final thoughts As I said, a lot of work is necessary prior to implementing this legislation I don't disagree with what Bob Parry said about removing the obligation to report on monetary targets, but I think we ought to recognize that if our long- term objective has to do with prices, there is no way around the fact that inflation is a monetary phenomenon We have to focus on what is happening with our balance sheet, how that influences money, and how money relates to inflation There may be implications of a very fundamental nature in terms of how we think about what we do or at least in terms of what we look at in doing it Finally, I agree with what Al Broaddus said with respect to not tying ourselves strictly to this bill We need to think about how we can continue to reap benefits from the course that we have been on and what steps we can take to enhance our credibility further One idea that has been kicked around in this room has to do with longer-run forecasts of inflation There are things like that that I think would be very helpful in communicating our longer-term intentions even in the absence of a bill like this The reason I think this is so important, frankly, is that it is very hard to quibble in a general sense with the performance of monetary policy in the 1980s and the 1990s, but in my opinion that has had everything to do with the people around the table and particularly the kind of leadership we have had It has very little to do with the sort of direction we are given in the institutional structure I guess I view the latter as a very dangerous situation in terms of the potential for the future We could revisit the 1960s and the 1970s very easily with a different perspective in terms of leadership and membership "
5459,1995-11-15," Peter, I would just like to say that I endorse the position you just expressed I think there are a lot of risks associated with that We have to evaluate things as they develop, but I wholeheartedly support what you are saying Ultimately, I think it runs to even broader issues like the independence of the central bank and our commitment to long-term price stability and those sorts of things   Thanks, Alan The good news is that this year's CPI inflation likely will be less than the members of the FOMC forecast in July The acceleration that was widely expected at the beginning of the year has not materialized Although the staff analysis cites temporary decreases in energy prices and a deceleration in medical care costs, it says little about the contribution of monetary factors Last year's slow growth of the narrow and broad monetary aggregates likely moderated this year's inflation On the other hand, I don't consider the current stance of monetary policy as being unduly restrictive Growth of both the broad monetary aggregates and bank credit has accelerated this year If we adjust for sweep accounts, there has been some growth in M1 as well In addition, firms have turned to the capital markets for financing as long-term market yields have fallen and stock prices have risen  The bad news is that neither the staff nor the public apparently sees any deceleration of inflation in sight Respondents to the Philadelphia Fed survey expect CPI inflation to accelerate to 3-1/2 percent in the first half of 1996, roughly comparable to the staff's projection of 33 percent Households in the Michigan survey on average expect inflation to accelerate to about a 4 percent pace next year We should be concerned, I think, when the public expects inflation to accelerate and not to fall further after it has been held below 3 percent for several years in a row It is true that expectations have inched down a bit; we can see that in long rates and in some of the surveys But no one expects inflation to fall to 2 percent or below anytime soon We simply do not have the credibility that at least I think we would like It is important to protect recent gains and to make further progress toward price stability At some point, a statement in that regard with respect to our intentions would help It is a topic we have talked about before  The Eighth District economy, like the nation's, continues to operate at a high level, as growth slows to a sustainable rate Transportation equipment has been exceptionally strong Orders for both military and civilian aircraft have increased District auto production was up 34 percent year-over-year during the third quarter, and it is expected to be up 45 percent during the fourth quarter The exceptional strength in St Louis auto production, as I have mentioned  -33-    11/15/95  before, is due to the particular models built there, mainly light trucks and sports utility vehicles In Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky, the poultry industry continues to expand aggressively Throughout the District, residential construction is picking up and office vacancy rates continue to decline There are some signs of cyclical weakness, however District unemployment rates, although still low by historical standards and below national averages, have risen about 1/2 percentage point on average over the last year Layoffs at large corporations, such as General Electric, are attributed to weak domestic demand for appliances On the other hand, announcements of plant closings by Brown Shoe and Fruit of the Loom, for example, more likely represent structural adjustments than signs of an impending downturn In the banking area, ""unchanged"" is the key word in an Eighth District survey of senior loan officers Loan demand has leveled off after rising sharply all year In fact, at large reporting banks, loans have risen about 11 percent over the last year Although there has been some increase in the consumer loan delinquency rate, it remains well below the level attained before the last recession The poor weather conditions this year have reduced crops and have led to low agricultural stocks, a comment that Mike in particular made, which may well result in markedly higher food prices next year  Nationally, the economy continues to operate at a high level, with growth slowing to its 10-year average rate It is important not to repeat the mistakes of the past It now seems likely that we will get through this business cycle with a peak of inflation well below the 6 percent rate that occurred in 1990 But, frankly, that is a pretty low standard to set for ourselves The mistake made in previous business cycles was to inflate the money supply in a misguided attempt to stimulate growth In every case, fighting the subsequent inflation contributed to recession The outlook for the real economy is optimistic today because inflation has not accelerated The worst thing we could do is to repeat the mistakes of history, most recently in 1986 That is, we should not allow an acceleration of inflation that would require a sharp reversal in policy later on What we should be doing is looking to move the inflation trend lower   Thanks, Alan I favor alternative B I believe it maintains a stance of policy that is somewhat restrictive It is very difficult to define exactly how restrictive, but I think that's quite appropriate given the inflation outlook I would say that looking forward we need to be particularly vigilant with respect to the possibility of rising inflation expectations and inflation For that reason, I strongly prefer a symmetric directive As Al Broaddus and some others have mentioned, asymmetry at this point would signal that we are quite happy with 3 percent inflation and we implicitly define that as our view of price stability I also agree with what Gary Stern said about the importance of how we make decisions going forward and having that discussion with respect to whether we want to reduce inflation systematically or simply act opportunistically  Finally, I think that trying to coordinate our actions with different possibilities on the fiscal front based on how an action might be perceived later is the wrong way to think about the issue We have to make the best call we can today based on the fundamentals as we see them If the fundamentals argue that we should act later, we should worry about managing perceptions at that time I don't hear anybody making that case, but we have to be very careful that we don't justify an action that is not supported by the fundamentals and is based instead on the view that the perception of what we did was better than if we did act on the fundamentals "
5483,1995-12-19," Alan, I have a general question about whether we are going to look at these swap arrangements in any broad and organized fashion I know you have mentioned before and others have said here that, in the foreign exchange markets in which we operate today, these arrangements are of questionable usefulness and ought to be reexamined I don't think we can single out this one with Mexico I think we need to look at all of them together My question is Are there any plans to do that?   Okay Will that involve discussions with counterparties in general about foreign exchange intervention and the support facilities?   The other issue that I think is difficult is that swap lines to developing countries can be troublesome I know that we have North American trade considerations However, as we learned in this case, what was intended for one purpose in effect drags us directly or indirectly into what I would characterize as intermediate- to long-term financing to support debt restructuring I don't think that's our role As I have mentioned before, I think it potentially raises questions about the independence of a central bank   Peter, you mentioned that the bond market was selling off further this morning What is it doing now?   Thanks, Alan I have four general points to make today The first is that the Eighth District economy continues to grow at a moderate pace District retailers expect this holiday season to be somewhat better than last year's About half of District auto dealers report autumn sales levels above those of last year, and to the extent sales have been damped, one often-cited factor has been shortages of popular trucks and mini vans Industry contacts continue to report slow, steady growth, although contractions continue in the apparel, shoe manufacturing, and coal mining industries The pace of residential construction has slowed slightly, but multifamily construction is picking up the slack in some areas Nonresidential construction continues to be a bright spot in many parts of the District Overall loan demand remains healthy with some signs of softening, and District banks continue to post record profits I might mention that a couple of bankers on our board expect a possible mini mortgage refinancing boom to get started early next year There is some evidence of that starting now An informal survey of District contacts reveals that labor problems of various kinds, such as shortages, unqualified applicants, and retention are affecting many businesses Reports of tight labor markets, defined as a shortage of available qualified workers, are concentrated in areas in the southern parts of the District, especially northwest and central Arkansas, northern Mississippi, and western Tennessee Some contacts believe the shortage is so acute now that it is discouraging firms from expanding operations or setting up new operations in the affected areas An added number of firms have begun to import foreign labor to fill positions  My second major point is that the long-term inflation outlook is inconsistent with the Committee's price stability goals The central concern of the FOMC should be progress toward price stability and there seems to be little public confidence that substantial gains on this front will be made anytime in the foreseeable future Some long-term inflation forecasts with horizons of five years or more have indeed been adjusted downward over the last year But generally these forecasts still show that market participants expect inflation at current levels well into the next century One such forecast was released in October by the Blue Chip group Their consensus forecast is for consumer price inflation to average about 32 percent annually through the year 2006 The Livingston Survey of Economists released yesterday predicts a similar 3 percent rate over the same period, while the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers has the same 3 percent figure, according to preliminary December data  -16-    12/19/95  In addition, wage pressures may not remain quiescent over the next year, which is something that I think we all have been puzzled about to some extent given the reported tightness in labor markets for some time The recent settlement with workers at Boeing was, in the view of some of our directors, surprisingly rich As Bob Parry mentioned, it included a lump sum payment of 10 percent in the first year, a 4-1/2 percent lump sum payment in the second year, general wage increases of 3 percent in years three and four, and, I haven't been able to nail this down, but one individual mentioned to me that these general wage increases appeared to be on top of cost-of-living increases I will have to try to nail that down Finally, there was a major reversal on company plans to shift more medical costs to employees They have gone from trying to shift costs on insured health care to the employee to actually paying a substantial bonus if employees opt for HMOs, and they have not shifted any costs to workers on the traditional plans I am afraid that this settlement could be a harbinger of things to come Stubbornly high inflation expectations and possible future wage increases have led me to view the current situation as a window of opportunity Ed Boehne mentioned fluid expectations I think that had to do with the real side I would also say that expectations could be quite fluid with respect to inflation Moves now to place downward pressure on inflation expectations might pay handsome dividends in the future The FOMC, and I agree with what Al Broaddus said a minute ago, should develop a plan to move further toward price stability and offer markets some convincing evidence that we intend to achieve such a goal in a reasonable timeframe I think some specific objective would go a long way in that direction  My third major point is that the national economy seems to be growing near the post-war average Most private forecasters predict stable and sustainable growth in real output through 1997 The Blue Chip group, for example, foresees growth of about 2-1/2 percent through the end of 1996, and a majority of respondents expect growth to continue into 1997 The unemployment rate is low and belies predictions of imminent weakness The index of leading indicators, of course, has been falling through most of 1995, but almost all of this decline is dominated by the changes in the prices of sensitive materials The rate of increase in these materials prices, I think, has merely been tapering off from the very rapid pace set in 1994 and in fact could be interpreted as a positive factor for the economy, not a negative The rally in longer-term bonds is mostly good news for 1996 growth prospects It should help the housing industry as well as business investment and may lead, as I mentioned before, to a new wave of mortgage refinancing  My final point is that recent trends in financial markets seem consistent with continued expansion, which I think is a point Mike made earlier in his briefing Aggregate credit remains readily available even though growth in total bank loans has slowed recently as firms have turned to longer-term capital markets In addition, the growth in M2 since the beginning of 1995 seems consistent with an economy growing at potential The marked runoff in total reserves over the last two years, albeit distorted by the spread of sweep accounts, is a cause for concern On balance, however, growth in the monetary aggregates supports an expectation of continued moderate expansion in nominal GDP Thank you  -17-    12/19/95   Thanks, Alan Not surprisingly I would prefer alternative B because I think we have the opportunity to move inflation and inflation expectations lower in the context of an economy that is continuing to expand generally in line with the 10- year moving average I also feel very strongly that 3 percent inflation expectations are too high On the other hand, I can accept some easing of restraint My quibble is really with its timing and not so much with the direction in which we are moving I think the stance of policy will still be somewhat restrictive with a 25 basis point reduction, and such a reduction could well be consistent with lower inflation I think the risk, and you put your finger on this,  -42-    12/19/95  has to do with how our actions are perceived People could well ask whether we are committed to long-term price stability or preoccupied with short-term considerations relating to the real economy The statement you read that would accompany this action is very significant in terms of not mentioning the real economy In fact, I had a comment on the minutes for the November meeting that I passed on to Don and Norm; we had almost two pages of draft text with respect to the policy decision last time before inflation was mentioned So, no matter what we say in that statement, for a lot of reasons the perception is out there and will be out there that we are moving in part in response to concerns about the real economy I would strongly object to any move greater than 25 basis points now or one that involved a cut in the discount rate for the reasons you cited I agree that an advantage of moving now, though not a reason, is to emphasize the absence of any short-run linkage between monetary policy and fiscal policy negotiations "
5506,1996-01-30," I want to ask Peter about these sweep accounts Looking at the aggregate numbers, the introduction of those accounts accelerated markedly in January Do you have any sense about how far that phenomenon has played out in the banking system? If it continues, what are the longer-term implications with respect to the reserve market? Obviously, reducing required reserves and making up for it by holding excess reserves is self-defeating   Thanks, Alan I have four major points that I want to make today The first is that the Eighth District economy continues to grow at a slow but steady pace Our average unemployment rate stood at 4-1/2 percent in November compared with 56 percent nationally Payroll employment growth in the District outpaced that in the nation during the fall Much of this strength can be attributed to our services sectors Nonetheless, in manufacturing first-quarter auto production in the District is expected to be up substantially from its year-ago level; most of that jump is due to added capacity, primarily in light trucks and recreational vehicles Retailers report that holiday sales were somewhat higher than last year's levels, although the growth rate was below that of last year The number of nonresidential building permits is well above 1994 levels in the District's major metropolitan areas Lenders report generally healthy loan demand and supply conditions, with the exceptions of middle market business lending and consumer auto lending  Turning to the national perspective, my second point is that job creation has moved in line with projections for labor force growth The average monthly gain in nonfarm payroll employment since April has been about 113,000, substantially below the rate of 280,000 per month that we enjoyed from January 1994 through March 1995 But the earlier rapid pace of job creation was unsustainable and widely expected to moderate The more recent pace is consistent with the BLS projected rate of labor force growth of about 1 percent or 110,000 jobs per month In addition, the job gains of November and December were reasonably robust according to this benchmark, and the unemployment rate remains low During the intermeeting period very little other data became available, and it seems to me, as some others have said, that it is difficult to argue that much has changed since  -19-    1/30-31/96  the last meeting with respect to the actual performance of the real economy  My third point, and unfortunately one that I have had to make a number of times, is that virtually no gains were made on inflation during 1995 Consumer price inflation is expected to be about the same for all of 1995 as it was in 1994 For the current year, some analysts suggest that food prices will increase at their fastest pace since 1990 Mike Prell mentioned this, as did Mike Moskow This is consistent with what I am hearing from who heads a major rice and soybean cooperative He has been concerned about the combination of these very low carryover stocks, drought conditions in parts of South America, and what he sees as very strong export demand from the Far East He envisions the potential of some possibly very large feed grain price increases in the course of this year More generally, market participants and professional economic forecasters do not expect lower inflation in the foreseeable future In their January newsletter, the Blue Chip group put CPI inflation at 3 percent through the fourth quarter of 1997 The Greenbook forecast is about the same Longer-term inflation expectations have moderated somewhat, but these forecasts do not indicate any further progress toward price stability Longer-term forecasts still have inflation running at about 3 percent  We will talk more about this tomorrow, but in my view the Committee should develop a plan to move toward price stability and offer markets convincing evidence that it will be achieved in some reasonable time frame One simple and direct way to convey our intentions to market participants would be to announce now the Committee's inflation forecast for, say, each of the next five years In our Humphrey-Hawkins projections, we are asked to assume an appropriate monetary policy, and we prepared our 1996 Humphrey-Hawkins forecast based on that approach toward policy In my view, that would begin with a CPI inflation target of about 2-3/4 percent this year, declining to about 1 percent by the year 2000 Our policy assumption would envision growth in 1996 around the high end of the central tendency ranges for nominal and real GDP and inflation near the low end of the central tendency range for prices  My final point is that, based on financial market behavior and the growth of money and credit in recent months, it is increasingly difficult in my view to argue that monetary policy is restrictive Longer-term bond yields have held their ground since the December meeting, and the relatively low long-term rates should help growth prospects in 1996 by aiding the housing industry, business investment, and mortgage refinancing activity The stock market, of course, continues to set new records on the up side on a daily basis, and credit remains readily available The broad monetary aggregates are growing at the top of the Committee's target ranges I don't mean to suggest that that implies any action; it is just an indicator of where we are Narrower aggregates adjusted for the effects of sweep account activity have been increasing quite rapidly in recent months Financial market expectations of a 50 basis point reduction in the fed funds rate by midyear also incorporate a 3 percent inflation projection for as far as the eye can see If that is not the goal of this Committee, then I think we had better think twice about fulfilling these expectations in the funds market  -20-    1/30-31/96   Alan, I favor Alternative I as well I have felt strongly for a long time that we really ought to set these ranges on the basis of longer-term relationships and that it would send a bad signal to move them at this point Let me quickly make a couple of other observations in this regard First, even though money has not been terribly useful in the short run in terms of gauging the thrust of policy, I don't think we can forget the fact that there has been a relationship in the long run between these broader aggregates and the behavior of inflation I would hate to think that we are a central bank that doesn't think money matters when we set monetary policy That would be a scary proposition, frankly, but there is very little mention of money these days The other thing, and this ties in with what Tom Hoenig said, is that if we start moving the ranges around just because we are expecting different monetary growth, that in effect sends the message that we are going to adjust our monetary targets to accommodate inflation rather than using them as a tool to send a message of where we think long-term money growth has to be to achieve our inflation objective   Alan, I have expressed my views on this topic before, and as you know I think we ought to be moving in the direction of setting longer-term inflation targets I would not disagree with what you said before about the Mack legislation I do not have any information that would suggest that the prospects for passage of the legislation really have been tested, and I can see the merits of waiting to see what will happen to the legislation However, if we were to approach the July meeting with nothing happening and our sense was that the legislation was not going anywhere, then I think we ought to be considering what steps we could take on our own without legislation Their purpose would be to convey more clearly our longer-term objectives and, as Al said, increase our credibility and accountability  As I mentioned yesterday, one step that could be taken in that regard, short of actually setting a target, would be to extend our horizon with respect to inflation forecasts It's ironic that the CBO and OMB put out budget projections with inflation assumptions going out five years They are assuming 3 percent inflation over that horizon In my view, those projections generally tend to have an impact on longer-term inflation expectations, and the very agency that actually influences inflation over time doesn't have anything to say about it Obviously, one could take this to the point where a projection becomes a target There certainly is a relationship We would have to think very carefully about what we were doing, but I would not see any real problem or any impediment to a decision by this Committee to provide forecasts over a longer time horizon If we were forecasting inflation two or three years out, people would realize that that is a time horizon over which we could have some influence, and there might be an expectation that we would deliver on that  To pick up on Cathy's point, and Jerry touched on this a little, I don't put much faith in model projections of inflation Part of the reason is that they do not take credibility into account Nonetheless, I found it interesting to look at the model results in the Bluebook I was fascinated with the examples where it was assumed that shocks raised the equilibrium funds rate by 50 basis points The conclusion, or the underlying assumption, was that a current and future funds rate of 5-1/2 percent was consistent with 3 percent inflation in the long run One could argue that easing the funds rate today would be analytically equivalent to the example in the Bluebook of an upward shock in the equilibrium funds rate of, say, 50 basis points I am not suggesting that anybody who favors some easing has that in mind What is very interesting, if one believes the model output, is that reducing the funds rate does not really put one in an opportunistic school, which is where I think people who would tend to favor that policy course would be likely to place themselves Rather, it actually places them in a deliberate camp to raise inflation The effect in that example, where the real equilibrium funds rate is shocked, is to drive the inflation rate higher; it continues to rise for three years, albeit not by a lot It does not rise above 4 percent in that particular model  -41-    1/30-31/96  We have been at 3 percent inflation for roughly the last four years It is only recently that financial markets have been willing to give us enough credibility so that, in looking at longer-term rates, they build in a premium for inflation and inflation uncertainty that has been reduced to somewhere around the current inflation rate It has taken us four years to achieve that degree of credibility So I see a policy easing move in terms of taking an action that is deliberate in the sense of forcing the inflation rate up I know all things would not be the same, but the Bluebook model suggests that conceivably we could be looking at rising inflation for three years If we keep inflation at the higher level for a further three years, we will have lost a tremendous amount of time in this process of trying to gain inflation credibility So, I thought the Bluebook exercise was useful from that perspective, at least for those who would put weight on these models As I said, I tend not to look at them   Where is a vote when you need it? [Laughter]   Like Cathy, I would favor alternative B I would favor it strongly One of the factors is the Greenbook forecast of rising inflationary pressures in the consumer price arena and also in labor markets and that is consistent with some of the anecdotal evidence Nobody has mentioned it, but we have had PPI increases of 05 percent in each of the last two months So, there is some reason to be concerned about inflation even though I have heard very little  -59-    1/30-31/96  expression of that concern There are some straws in the wind with respect to rising inflationary pressures Secondly, I think it is pretty clear that 3 percent inflation is embedded in long-term expectations, and I think such inflation is too high Third, I am not at all sure that monetary policy is still in a restrictive posture Don Kohn has talked about the difficulty of assessing just what the real equilibrium funds rate is Certainly from the perspective that I have used over time, and this is useful only in longer time frames, the monetary aggregates and the credit markets and so forth are not sending the message that policy is in a restrictive posture For those who want us to be judged by our actions, I think this action says that we are not interested in lowering inflation and inflation expectations The ultimate reaction of higher yields in the bond market over time could be disquieting to those who are concerned about the performance of the economy in the short run I have no way of predicting what is going to happen to long-term interest rates, but it is not outside the realm of reason that over time after markets digest this action we will find that we have not taken a step that will lead toward lower longer-term yields  Lowering the discount rate makes a bad situation worse by underlining this move In my view, there is no reason why the funds rate can't be on top of the discount rate or for that matter go through the discount rate In fact, when one looks at what is going on with these sweep accounts and the way the supply of reserves is shrinking, for us to have a discount rate that creates an incentive to borrow does not make any sense So, I would not reduce the discount rate Thank you   Do you care about consistency with the Greenbook forecast with respect to inflation?   I understand "
5530,1996-03-26," Thanks, Alan The Eighth District economy continues to expand A few contacts noted some softening at the beginning of the year, but many expect a pickup as we move into the second quarter Unemployment rates in District states tended to jump early in the year for weather-related reasons, but Missouri was a notable exception; the state enjoyed a very low unemployment rate of 34 percent in January About 3,400 District workers were laid off because of recent strike activity against General Motors, and unofficially about 800 workers in related industries were affected But looking forward, District auto production at Ford and Chrysler plants is expected to rise 47 percent in the second quarter Loan demand, especially for commercial loans, is still strong in most parts of the District Unseasonably cold weather produced significant damage to winter wheat in southern Illinois and catfish in the Mississippi portion of the District in February [Laughter] It's a big industry!  -14-    3/26/96  Nationally, the economy is displaying some underlying strength The February employment report was more than a simple rebound from a weak January The pace of net job creation was averaging somewhat better than 100,000 per month over the last nine months of 1995 It seems plausible that the January data were depressed by about 300,000 Even if we count 300,000 of the February total as a rebound and add 100,000 for trend growth, the 705,000 February number still looks like a significant upside surprise of about 300,000 jobs Maybe some of that increase will be revised away Retail sales, factory orders, and housing starts also indicate underlying strength  For those who look at the latest developments in the real economy as a trigger for monetary policy actions, I think it is clear that we moved last time without much new data; and when the data came in, they were contrary to what was expected Some here referred to our lowering the federal funds target as buying insurance, but this was not a hedge in any usual sense In fact, we were making a speculative bet on the nature of the incoming data It is a bet that we likely lost now that the economy looks a lot more resilient and also a lot more inflation prone  The press release accompanying the last move compounded the problem in my view by suggesting that the FOMC is complacent about longer-term inflation objectives It read a bit like a victory statement saying in part, ""with price and cost trends already subdued"" when in fact we are still a long way from price stability and Q4/Q4 CPI is projected to rise in 1996 Furthermore, as others have mentioned, some recent data are worrisome, including the employment cost index for total compensation of private industry workers as well as benefits costs, which were discussed at some length in the Greenbook The long-bond yield, as others have mentioned, also has increased more than 50 basis points since the last meeting An important component of that yield, namely, longer-term inflation expectations, is a matter of concern for this Committee As I have stressed before, despite FOMC pronouncements of a commitment to stable prices, market participants and professional economic forecasters do not expect lower inflation in the foreseeable future These expectations are a large part of what is standing in the way of further progress toward price stability The way to influence those expectations is for this Committee to announce a target path for inflation over the next several years that contemplates a reduction from the current 3 percent level In addition, of course, we must take actions consistent with that path An opportunistic approach will buy us no credibility whatsoever nor market behavior that reinforces our efforts to achieve our objectives Thank you   The premium isn't fixed in this case; that is the difference   Alan, I agree with your recommendation I have some concerns, obviously, based on what I have said before It is difficult to evaluate the stance of policy, but I am concerned that it may not even be neutral at this stage--just based on what is happening, for example, with monetary growth rates and some of the factors that Don mentioned I think the current policy stance is inappropriate given the 3 percent inflation expectations In my view, we ought to be in a somewhat restrictive policy stance and be working the rate of inflation down in some orderly fashion But having said that, I don't think it is appropriate for policy to go in one direction at one meeting and in the other direction at the next,  -25-    3/26/96  certainly under the circumstances we have described today We are where we are, and we should stay there for a while and watch But we need to be vigilant so that--I am going to stick with this insurance analogy a little longer--the premium on last meeting's insurance policy in terms of higher inflation expectations does not become onerous That is what I meant before when I said that, in effect, the premium is not fixed There is a cost to it  One other point I wanted to make quickly refers to Don's briefing Don, you made a statement, if I heard it correctly, about the Committee's opportunistic inflation strategy, which implied that the Committee had actually adopted that By default, that may be where we are, but I don't think we ever consciously made a decision about what our inflation strategy ought to be, whether it is deliberate, opportunistic, or whatever I just wanted to make that comment "
5552,1996-05-21," Thanks, Alan The pace of economic activity in the Eighth District appears to have increased modestly since our last meeting For the three months ended in March, District labor markets remained tight The average unemployment rate is below 5 percent, and it has been that low for a large part of the last year and a half Strike activity, which had been quiescent, is again a factor that may impact costs at several large District manufacturing firms On Sunday, a machinists' union at one of St Louis's largest employers authorized a strike that will affect about 7,000 workers directly The contract bargaining strategy in the auto industry is yet to be determined, but negotiations will be getting under way later this year The two largest automotive producers in the District plan to boost second-quarter production by nearly 5 percent above their first- quarter levels Second-quarter production is about 1 percentage point more than had been planned at the time of our March meeting  Residential construction activity in the first quarter was at a relatively high level By contrast, construction contracts point to some prospective weakness in the nonresidential sector, a pattern that despite strong overall capital spending is also observed in the national statistics Loan growth at 11 large District banks has been off somewhat in recent months from the torrid pace of a year earlier This year such loan growth has been dominated by real estate loans Lenders are still very actively seeking borrowers in every category, including consumer borrowers despite some concerns about their creditworthiness According to the senior loan officer survey, consumer loan delinquencies have picked up somewhat more than had been expected over the last six months Nonetheless, the rate spread between securities backed by credit cards and comparable maturity Treasuries has remained very low  The national economic outlook has changed dramatically since January, as we all know, with a rebound in real output growth and inflation Imports also have increased substantially, a possible sign of excess growth in domestic demand One can't dismiss the increase in inflation simply because it reflects mainly higher prices for food and energy I think the Greenbook and comments from Mike Prell support that assessment as well Low levels of agricultural stocks and rising demand for petroleum do not suggest an early reversal of such price pressures Furthermore, the broad monetary aggregates have been growing above target rates and sweep-adjusted Ml growth has been strong By pegging the funds rate at 5-1/4 percent in the face of rising market interest rates--here we are back in the same debate, I guess--we may effectively be validating these price increases The danger is that if price increases are validated by monetary policy, they can become embedded in expectations, particularly in a tight labor market situation On that front, the Greenbook reports that  -18-    5/21/96  wages and salaries shot up at a 46 percent annual rate in the first quarter, the largest increase in 5 years The increase in 1995 was 28 percent Furthermore, according to the Michigan survey--and Mike mentioned this as well--households have raised their inflation expectations for the next 12 months from 4 percent in December to 4-1/2 percent in April to 5 percent in May Looking over the next 5 to 10 years, average expected inflation in this survey is up from 41 percent in April to 48 percent in May These forecasts can be wrong, but in any event the public perceives that inflation risks have increased about a full percentage point this year That matches the increase in long rates since January Thank you   Thanks, Alan I was not very successful when I talked about this insurance policy concept before, but I am going to venture into that territory one more time and then probably leave it at that In my view, we in effect took out an insurance policy in January In retrospect we did not need it, and I think now is the time to cancel and avoid the premium In my view, inflation and inflation expectations have increased I think the stance of policy is neutral at best and, more likely, somewhat stimulative  -31-    5/21/96  Accordingly, with such a policy stance, I think it is unlikely that we can contain inflation at the level where it has been over the last several years In other words, we are likely to lose ground We certainly are very unlikely to make any progress toward price stability The risk of waiting is that the premium on this insurance policy is not a fixed premium It will go up If it turns out that monetary policy is perceived by markets to be out of position in the face of what is happening in the economy and particularly with respect to inflation, it is going to cost a lot more to reverse it later rather than sooner  My preference would be somewhere between ""B"" and ""C"" I would increase the funds rate by 25 basis points and probably accompany that with an increase in the discount rate, although that is a separate matter, obviously   Thanks, Alan I was amused when Don brought this topic up because I was going to suggest something like this, as I and others have done in the past It is a good suggestion in that it represents a starting point for a dialogue about an issue that we need to talk about as a Committee I would view it just as a starting point Ultimately, I think we ought to aim for a longer-run goal with respect to inflation, maybe five years out or something like that, and we ought to communicate that goal to the public I would not expect us to get to that point in this first discussion, but I regard it as very constructive to begin the discussion Jerry Jordan touched on the reasons why it is so important In my opinion, one of the most significant aspects is that, in circumstances like the present, we have inflation expectations that are quite volatile It seems to me that if people were interpreting incoming data against the backdrop of a central bank that had established some longer-term goal for bringing inflation under control, inflation expectations might be less sensitive to the incoming data If ultimately we got to the point of communicating a reasonable goal with respect to inflation over the long term--I don't mean necessarily as a result of the discussion we might have at the July meeting--I think that would increase our credibility, assuming we acted in the appropriate fashion to deliver on that goal In my view we are to some extent paying the price right now for not having such a goal The opportunistic approach we are taking in the fight against inflation to achieve our ultimate objective of price stability is having an adverse effect on our credibility That is reflected in expectations of higher inflation and interest rates People are not certain where we are headed, and they are worried right now that the next change could be more inflation, not less In any event, I applaud Don for putting the idea on the table I would support his proposal "
5576,1996-07-02," Thanks, Alan The pace of economic activity in the Eighth District continues to pick up from the more sluggish levels I mentioned earlier in the year District retailers and auto dealers report sales at or above last year's levels, and most contacts are optimistic about sales prospects over the summer, though there is some concern about consumer debt levels District payroll employment grew at an annual rate of 22 percent for the three months ended in April, slightly below the national rate Nonetheless, unemployment rates in the District remain below the national average The District labor market appears tight Some businesses are coping with a shortage of entry-level workers--for example, in the fast food area--by offering starting bonuses and wages well above the minimum wage Poultry producers in parts of the District continue to attract workers from Mexico There also are growing wage pressures for skilled workers Computer-literate workers in a variety of occupations are in short supply There is also some restiveness on the part of organized labor The strike at McDonnell Douglas by about 6,700 union machinists, which began on June 5, continues though negotiations were restarted last week with the involvement of a mediator The proposed four-year contract--and this is what was originally on the table before the strike--includes a cost-of-living adjustment plus a 2-1/2 percent increase in base salaries during the first year of the contract and 2-1/2 to 3 percent bonus increases during the remainder of the contract So, that contract works out to an annual increase in the range of 5 to 6 percent That Boeing and other companies have been actively wooing striking McDonnell Douglas machinists to leave St Louis is another indication that the market for machinists is tight Whether tight labor markets get reflected further in rising wages and prices remains to be seen, although I suspect they will  District auto output has been unusually strong, and auto makers in the District expect production to be up about 16-1/2 percent in the third quarter over a year earlier There has been a substantial increase in the capacity to produce popular models Nationally, light trucks and autos are selling at a pace unmatched since 1988 A surge in automotive output in the second quarter to meet consumer demand and rebuild inventories is expected to increase real GDP growth by more than a percentage point at an annual rate With respect to inventories generally, the main National Federation of Independent Businesses survey suggests that about one-fifth of District firms want to add to stocks while a slightly smaller fraction of District firms want to reduce them Residential building permits picked up substantially in April in most District metropolitan areas, though builders still expect a slowdown because of recent increases in mortgage rates Loan growth at District banks continues slightly faster than in the nation Finally, crop conditions are better than was expected earlier  With respect to the national economic outlook, we are forecasting continued real growth at essentially the average growth rate of the past ten years in terms of the new chain-weighted measures We are forecasting real growth of about 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent this year and 2 to 3 percent in 1997 We have the  -25-    7/2-3/96  unemployment rate holding in the range of 5-1/2 to 6 percent We do not see a recession over the next year and a half, although I am aware that forecasters generally are not able to tell a boom from a bust 12 months hence Our CPI forecast is for 3 to 3-1/2 percent inflation in 1996, up from 27 percent in 1995 However, assuming that policy moves aggressively toward restraint during the remainder of this year, we believe inflation could move down to the 2 to 3 percent range in 1997 The slowing in inflation that we forecast will not occur if the current inflation gets embedded in expectations, which we see as a growing risk given the accommodative stance of monetary policy  One final comment with respect to the forecast I am concerned about how these forecasts may be interpreted We are asked to prepare forecasts based on what we think an appropriate policy stance would be, although the policy assumptions themselves are not published with the forecast or for that matter even requested If the FOMC consensus happened to be identical to the St Louis forecast of lower inflation in 1997, would the interpretation by the public be that nothing more needs to be done to contain inflation? There is the dilemma On the one hand, if we forecast accelerating inflation assuming no change in the stance of policy, we may make it easier to take appropriate actions to contain it On the other hand, if we forecast decelerating inflation predicated on a tightening of policy, we may make it more difficult in fact to take the necessary actions Either way our credibility could be damaged I think we should make it clear in publishing our forecasts that the outcomes are not independent of policy actions and may in fact presume some tightening actions Having said that, our forecasts of variables that we can influence, namely inflation in future years, are important to markets We ought to use every opportunity to forecast lower inflation in the years ahead and do our best to make such an outcome a reality   Thanks, Alan First of all, consistent with what I have said before, I think our focus ought to be on prices In my view, that is the only thing we really influence in the long run, and that is what our policy ought to be aimed at I agree with what Ed Boehne said; we really are talking about a means to an end Low and stable inflation or price stability, however you want to say it, enables the economy to reach its maximum potential That is our ultimate goal  My inclination would be to take what I perceive might be on the table now as an interim step I think it is fairly easy--and I am basing this on 3 percent core CPI--to get people to buy into the fact that such an inflation rate is too high When I talk to groups, they take notice when I point out to them that a 3 percent rate of inflation cuts the value of the dollar in half in a generation We can make the case that 3 percent inflation is too high and that it is reasonable to move it another notch lower I would characterize that as just another step, and would continue to describe our ultimate goal qualitatively and not quantitatively at this point There may come a time when we are prepared to quantify our ultimate objective, but right now I would view our intermediate objective as just a step along the path to price stability  I think we would have to be explicit about what we were doing In other words, whatever price index we use, we should indicate that we have a particular quantitative objective in mind over a particular timeframe I think such transparency is beneficial in terms of enabling the economy to make the adjustments that need to be made in connection with that objective I suppose that smooth adjustment is dependent to some extent on credibility, and we would have to earn that  This is an objective that we are setting for ourselves, but there is a benefit in my view to being explicit about it In some ways, one could look at an opportunistic approach as somewhat misleading and likely to create uncertainty that does not need to exist Unless we are explicit, people do not realize that we have in mind getting inflation down to a particular level, and suddenly they are dealing with the impact that our actions are having on the economy without prior knowledge of their purpose I do not think that is useful  -60-    7/2-3/96  I also think that taking a step in the direction that I have been describing would be useful to us in that it would force us to do more in the public education arena in terms of explaining to the public the benefits of price stability, however defined, the costs of inflation, and also some of the potential offsets As I have said to you before, Alan, I think we have a big job to do in terms of educating the public, though I believe we are making progress I think people recognize that the kind of business environment they have enjoyed over the last four to five years has a lot to do with relatively low and relatively stable inflation This is a good time to capitalize on that, and I think taking an explicit step on our own and not waiting for legislation would force us to move further down that path  Finally, just a comment on what Larry Meyer had to say about the opportunistic approach and how it works Larry, in my experience, whenever we get to whatever the NAIRU is, people decide it is not really there and it gets revised lower This is true of anything we pick What I worry a little about is the mentality that I see emerg- ing here, namely that we are not going to deal with inflation until we actually see ""the whites of its eyes"" That approach to policy has never served us well in the past, but in effect that is what has been happening We get to what people thought would be the NAIRU, we do not see wage pressures, and we assume that the NAIRU must be lower So it keeps getting revised down At some point, if we are wrong about that and wage pressures hit us when we have not anticipated them, it is going to be much tougher to deal with the practicalities of even containing inflation at 3 percent That concludes what I have to say, Alan Thank you   Alan, I agree with what you have suggested I do not want to prejudge the outcome of this meeting, but it is possible that we will not take any action with regard to our short- run policy In that event, I would not want to take any action with regard to these ranges As you suggested, that might lead people to misconstrue the posture of this Committee with respect to inflation So, I think it makes sense to leave the M2 range unchanged The other thing I would say is that, even though these aggregates have been on the bench for a while, I do not believe we can afford to ignore them totally over longer periods of time One of the problems is that even if we move to some sort of inflation target, we have to be very forward-looking in that regard In other words, our actions probably have their impact on inflation with a one- to two-year lag, and I think monetary aggregates can be very useful interim guides, not from meeting to meeting but over longer periods of time So, I believe there is a policy role for the monetary aggregates once we are sure that velocity relationships have stabilized   Don, when you think in terms of long-term real interest rates, where do you conceptually put the uncertainty premium about inflation? Is that in the real component?   So, if I were comparing a time when a rise in real rates was strictly due to a change in real activity--real supply and demand were the sole contributors to an increase in real rates--I would distinguish between that situation and one where perhaps some of the increase was due to greater uncertainty about future inflation That makes the comparison very difficult   First of all, I think the prospect of rising inflation is the biggest risk we are facing in the economy in the coming months There is no question in my mind about that I also think policy is in an accommodative stance from a number of different perspectives So, I conclude that we ought to move now, and I would be inclined when we do move to do so aggressively By that I mean that I would raise the federal funds rate by 50 basis points, and I would combine that with a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate   Alan, I cannot add anything that has not already been said on the swaps issue I do want to say that I have a lot of sympathy for what Bill McDonough said in terms of how we ought to be thinking about this issue looking forward We ought to focus on making sure that we maintain the US dollar as the principal reserve currency, and we ought to be thinking of vehicles that support that objective That is really how I view what Bill is saying in an environment where we are apt to have larger and larger cross-border settlements and the need for liquidity on relatively short notice The ability to provide the latter would certainly be in our interest People are going to look to us to make sure that dollar settlements throughout the world are in fact made We ought to be thinking in terms of a vehicle that helps facilitate that So, I think our focus ought to be shifted away from supporting foreign exchange interven- tion, and I think swaps are an anachronism in that context in any event We should be moving more toward payments system risk aspects and really supporting the US dollar That is what this ought to be about as we think about the future "
5601,1996-08-20," Thanks, Alan Tight labor markets continue to be the rule in the Eighth District The District unemployment rate was less than 5 percent in both the first and second quarters, the lowest since the 1970s The strike of 6,700 McDonnell Douglas machinists that began June 5 remains unsettled The company has maintained output so far with replacement workers Anecdotal evidence in a survey of more than 200 District enterprises indicates quite persistent wage pressures About one-fifth of the firms surveyed are planning to increase prices in the third quarter and few are planning cuts District automotive output is expected to jump appreciably in the fourth quarter, although much of this increase reflects the boost that is normally associated with the introduction of new models Because of strong demand for models produced in the Eighth District and increased capacity this year, the number of cars and light trucks built in the District by Ford and Chrysler is expected to be 22 percent higher this year than last year  Although the District economy is operating at a high level, a variety of indicators suggests that growth is moderating, which is a picture that we have heard described by a number of people around the table For example, year-to-date growth in District payroll employment lags behind last year's pace An exception is residential construction where employment continues to grow at a vigorous rate and permits are well above year-earlier levels Loan growth at District banks has decelerated from the high rates observed last year, matching the national pattern The most recent Senior Loan Officer Survey suggests that the slowdown may be partly due to a tightening of lending standards On the ag side, crops are in fairly good condition across the District The rice crop is down from a year earlier because land has been diverted to other crops Overall, harvests are expected to be larger than last year, though down from the records of two years ago Nonetheless, District farm income should increase substantially this year because low inventories are holding up prices and federal outlays for farm income and price support programs will be higher over the next few years under the new farm bill  -21-    8/20/96  At the beginning of the year, the Committee took out an insurance policy against the risk of a slowing economy As events have unfolded, the outlook is much better today than it was then Most forecasters see real growth holding close to the long-term trend through 1997 In July, the Committee's central tendency forecast for real GDP was a full half-percentage point above the estimates that we presented in January Because real growth in the second quarter was above trend, forecasters naturally expect some slowing Earlier figures on retail sales and factory orders for July confirm that view There also was a decline in job growth in July and a decline in the index of hours worked It is worth noting, however, that 193,000 new jobs in July, though down from the figures for earlier months, are still well above the growth of the working age population of about 110,000 to 120,000 a month All said, the real economy seems to be in good shape entering the sixth year of the expansion  Whatever the outlook may be for the real economy, we must be concerned about the rising inflation trend This rising trend can be seen in the staff's projections CPI inflation touched its low for the current expansion in 1994, accelerated a little in 1995, and according to the Greenbook, will accelerate a little more in 1996 and yet a little more in 1997 CPI inflation was 3-1/2 percent at an annual rate in the first seven months of 1996, up from 2-1/2 percent over the 12 months of 1995 Last year, we could see signs of falling inflation in August that showed up in the data in the second half This year all of the signs--tight labor markets, the prospect for further increases in food prices, the pending labor negotiations, inflation-jittery financial markets, fairly rapid growth in M2 and in sweep adjusted Ml, and high levels of long-term interest rates relative to current inflation--suggest that inflation pressures are building We have taken a risk this year by failing to respond to the unexpected growth in both output and prices We should not want increasing inflationary pressures to get built into expectations as happened in the late 1970s and again in the late 1980s Absent the kind of inflation credibility that announcement of a firm commitment to price stability would give us, we need a strong response to signs of incipient inflation pressures As I read the Greenbook, these signs are becoming increasingly clear Thank you   Thanks, Alan With respect to the stance of policy, I would say with some conviction that I do not think it is restrictive and quite likely it is accommodative, whether we look at the growth rates of monetary aggregates or a funds rate that has not moved in the face of rising market interest rates I think the risk is that inflation will move higher and perhaps more importantly, it will move higher from a level that I think is already unacceptable We ought to be moving closer to price stability, not moving away from it As a result, I would favor an increase in the funds rate today and, for reasons that have been stated by others, an increase of 50 basis points  Let me just make a couple of other comments quickly I think we are suffering from the fact that we do not have a nominal anchor for monetary policy We do not seem to have a way to make a judgment about what the stance of policy is and relate that to a longer-run inflation outlook As a result, I think we have become excessively  -43-    8/20/96  focused on what is happening with respect to growth as opposed to looking at inflation I think our actions have in fact been asymmetric We have tended to show in our actions in recent months more concern about the prospect of slowing growth than we have about rising inflation, let alone getting inflation lower I think we have gotten away with it so far because a good bit of credibility has been built up over the last 5 or 10 years, and for good reason But if our indicator of the time to move is seeing the whites of inflation's eyes--I have not heard anybody explicitly say that, but I worry about that sometimes--when we get to that point, we will have lost a good bit of credibility and will probably be looking at a very ugly end to this expansion just to contain inflation, as others have said "
5625,1996-09-24," Thanks, Alan Labor markets are tight in the Eighth District according to most contacts The average unemployment rate for Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee was 48 percent in July compared with the national rate of 54 percent for that month and 51 percent in August A major hotel chain that is planning to hire about 2,000 workers in the St Louis area in the coming year has held numerous job fairs and has established a toll free phone number to search for and aid applicants District payroll employment growth, however, has slowed in recent months, but given other developments this may reflect a shortage of workers available to fill positions rather than a decline in labor demand Michael Moskow mentioned something along these lines as well McDonnell Douglas ended the strike with their machinists union during the intermeeting period In the agreement, union workers will receive a 4 percent lump sum bonus this year on top of their normal cost of living increase plus a 2-1/2 percent wage increase next May In addition, retirement benefits were increased more than 24 percent, from $33 to $41 dollars for each year of credited service All told, this settlement represents a substantial increase in worker compensation District retailers that we surveyed reported summer sales increases of up to about 5 percent over the same period last year Auto sales, in contrast, were flat, but District automotive production is expected to enjoy a normal seasonal upswing in the third and fourth quarters and is projected to be up more than 22 percent for the year as a whole Sales of new and existing homes are up in most parts of the District  The national economy is coming off one of its best quarters in recent memory The growth rate of GDP was so fast that it is easy to predict slower growth in the second half of the year With nearly 1/2 million nonfarm payroll jobs created in the first two months of the current quarter, employment growth is more than double the trend pace of labor force growth, and that means further tightening of already tight labor markets Many private-sector forecasts of a slowdown in real output growth in the second half of this year have been incorporating expectations of Fed action--action that has not yet materialized Even if the economy does slow to a trend pace of growth over the remainder of the year, 1996 is going to be a big improvement over 1995 and in my view the downside risks for the real economy are quite low The risks of more inflation, on the other hand, are all on the up side The Board staff predicts faster increases in worker compensation It is forecasting a rise in the employment cost index from 26 percent last year to 33 percent this year and 36 percent in 1997 In 1994 and 1995, CPI inflation was 26 and 27 percent, respectively On a basis consistent with those figures, the Board staff now forecasts 34 percent CPI inflation for both the current year and 1997 Such developments are against the backdrop of money growth near the top end of the Committee's ranges, readily available credit, and a booming equity market  In the absence of any reaction by this Committee in these circumstances, market participants may easily conclude that the ""acceptable"" rate of inflation has moved up This would reinforce inflationary expectations and make our job tougher in the long run We simply cannot afford not to react to the scenario laid out in our inflation forecast  -15-    9/24/96   Thanks, Alan I think there is considerable risk in waiting The economy has enjoyed great benefits from this period of low and stable inflation, particularly given how expectations have been affected I agree with what Don Kohn said earlier--namely, that we should not lose sight of the fact that the credibility of the central bank may have a very significant impact on price behavior right now I have been here a good while, as have many people around this table, and I know how hard it was to earn that credibility It took a long time, even beginning in the mid-1980s when significant progress had already been made in bringing inflation down I really believe that it is a lot harder to gain and keep credibility than it is to give it away It is not an issue as to whether the central bank is credible or not; it is not an ego issue It is an issue with respect to the economy If we are wrong with respect to our judgments on the risks of inflation, the costs to the economy are going to be higher down the road when we try to catch up with a moving train If the central bank takes out insurance against anything, it ought to be against the risk of rising inflation, and I think this is the time to take out an insurance policy So, I would favor an increase in the degree of reserve restraint   Thanks, Alan I want to pursue an issue that Ed Boehne brought up Peter, I understood what you said about how we account for this, but regardless of the accounting, there is an economic exposure Could you give us some idea of our exposure right now with the 12-month maturity limit, given how we typically invest our currency holdings under that limit, versus what the exposure would be if we went to a 10-month duration limit? What would be the actual increased economic exposure if we had, for example, an upward movement in German interest rates of 100 basis points? What would we stand to lose under this new scheme economically, assuming we had to liquidate our holdings right away, versus what we would have lost based on how we historically have invested our currency holdings, at least in recent times?   Yes, that is the question I am asking   The interest earnings offset the capital losses?   Okay   Thanks, Alan I have one question for Peter After looking at this, I would agree with what has been said I think liquidity is the most important objective, and as you said, what we earn on our portfolio does not really matter It is not like the foreign portfolio where there is some tradeoff between liquidity and earnings   That's right The question I have, Peter, relates to the loans of Treasury securities by the Desk to dealers in government obligations if there is a delivery squeeze involving particular issues If we went all the way and at some point got to a ""bills only"" portfolio, would your inability then to lend securities create any significant problems for the functioning of the government securities market?   Okay   Maybe you can get rid of it in the context of this portfolio issue "
5648,1996-11-13," Thanks, Alan Eighth District economic conditions continue to be very good Sales increases, employment gains, and plant expansions are reported far more often than declines and closures Firms recently announcing plans for new facilities include some in the poultry processing, paper products, and package delivery businesses Most firms report inventories at or slightly below desired levels Construction permits for new homes were up recently in more than half of the District's 12 metropolitan areas Two District auto manufacturers, Chrysler and Ford, plan to produce 334,000 cars and light trucks in the fourth quarter, an increase of 152 percent from third-quarter levels Current plans call for first- quarter 1997 production to exceed first-quarter 1996 production by about 27 percent Also, farm income is strong because of generally high prices and good yields  With respect to labor markets, unemployment in several Eighth District states remains near 20-year lows In Missouri, for example, the September unemployment rate was 39 percent, well below the national average and the state's unemployment rate one year ago District payroll employment growth on the other hand was 1-1/2 percent at an annual rate from June through September, somewhat below the national average of 2-1/2 percent Given other developments, this may reflect a shortage of qualified workers to fill positions rather than weak labor demand relative to the nation District labor markets are tight  The national jobs picture is similar For 1996, the average gain in nonfarm payroll employment has been about 209,000 per month or 21 percent at an annual rate, well above the Board staff's longer-run  -15-    11/13/96  trend in labor force growth of about 130,000 workers per month The national unemployment rate, as we all know, was 52 percent for October All in all, labor markets remain robust There has been some moderate wage pressure associated with these tight labor markets The Greenbook notes that the employment cost index increased at 29 percent in the third quarter, up from 26 percent in the third quarter of 1995 Unit labor costs increased at a 4 percent annual rate in the third quarter, about double the rate in the first half of the year  Financial markets have concluded that the slowdown in real GDP growth has reduced the urgency for immediate action by this Committee That may be correct, but the facts are that in each of the last three years, we have managed to achieve fourth-quarter-to-fourth- quarter CPI inflation rates a few tenths under 3 percent This year, on the other hand, CPI inflation will move higher to an estimated 32 percent And forecasts for next year on a consistent basis are higher still, as was mentioned earlier  In short, we are in the process of violating an implicit upper bound on acceptable inflation, which may cause some to conclude that the Committee's tolerance for inflation is rising Furthermore, the current inflation rate is too high in my opinion to allow for maximum efficiency in the US economy But because markets believe we are focused solely on short-run developments in the real economy, there is apparently no rationale for tightening unless inflation moves up markedly, which of course we all know is too late once it occurs In my view, the Committee should develop a plan to move inflation lower and publicize that plan through an announcement of multi-year inflation targets Lack of transparency in policymaking is preventing the Committee from gaining full credibility and is causing market participants to demand compensation for possible inflation surprises in the future While current long-term interest rates on US Treasury debt seem low, they could be lower still if market participants were less worried about inflation making a comeback A clear statement of our objectives and actions consistent with those objectives could help in this regard   Thanks, Alan I do not want to talk about symmetry, so I am going to advocate a modest increase in the funds rate I would be where Al Broaddus came out, a 25 basis point increase My view is basically that CPI inflation has been trending up, that 3 percent inflation is too high, and that the risks are in the direction of higher inflation, at least if it is measured on a consistent basis We should lean against this, and we should do so in the context of making clear our long-term intentions I also think that we should not lull ourselves into thinking that we can in fact predict short-term developments in the real economy and count on these developments to do our job for us, at least on a temporary basis I also agree with what Al Broaddus said about some of the risks down the road Another risk is one that Governor Lindsey pointed to; it relates to evidence of some speculative excesses in financial markets By moving now we might be able to avoid a bigger accident in those markets later "
5674,1996-12-17," In that vein and before multiple interventions on the same day become commonplace, I think it would be helpful to the Committee to see some analysis of that I have not thought about it a lot, but one of the things that worries me a little is the presumption among market participants that we are going to be there, and that creates a disincentive for them to maintain proper operating balances   Overall, I think what you are doing is responsive to developments in the marketplace, and I applaud the steps you are taking So, I am supportive of that One other suggestion I would make, Peter, is that when you talk to the dealers about moving to an earlier time for Desk operations, you might want to telegraph that when our statistical system will support it, you are going to want to go to a still earlier time That will give them an idea of where you ultimately want to get in terms of the timing of the first intervention in the day Thank you   Thanks, Alan The Eighth District economy continues to grow at a steady pace District retailers report that September and October sales were up about 4 percent from a year earlier, and most are expecting a strong holiday season Sales the weekend after Thanksgiving were especially robust Despite a somewhat lackluster autumn, most Eighth District contacts were optimistic about December auto sales District auto and light truck manufacturers have increased their planned production slightly for the fourth quarter of 1996 and the first quarter of 1997, so District production is running above year-earlier levels in autos Payroll employment in the Eighth District rose at an annualized rate of 19 percent from July to October The average unemployment rate remains low at 47 percent The local employment effects resulting from Monsanto's division into two companies are highly uncertain Monsanto plans to eliminate 1,500 to 2,500 of its 28,000 jobs worldwide About 4,600 of its employees  -20-    12/17/96  work at company headquarters in St Louis The employment effects resulting from the Boeing merger with McDonnell Douglas, which is the largest employer in St Louis, are also uncertain Labor markets remain tight around the District Hiring and keeping qualified workers, as a number of others have mentioned, is still a big concern for District companies Materials prices are generally stable to slightly higher Real estate markets are strong in the District, with year-to-date permits levels above 1995 levels Loan demand, particularly for business loans, remains robust, and District banks continue to record high profits with only a slight increase in nonperforming loans Farmers have had an excellent year, with yields generally above average and crop prices comparatively high  At the national level, relatively low inflation in recent years has been good for investment and growth Tight labor markets are reflected in unemployment rates that remain low by historical standards Although real growth has slowed from the rapid second- quarter pace, it remains near our estimate of the sustainable trend-- in the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range This pattern is observed in the labor market as well The average net increase in payroll employment, which was 240,000 per month over the first eight months of the year, slowed to 113,000 over the three months through November That average increase is close to the sustainable growth in the labor force  On a fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter basis, CPI inflation is forecast to be 32 percent in 1996 compared with 27 percent in the prior year Although the 1997 staff forecast has a return to the 27 percent level, more than half of that improvement is due to technical changes in the way the BLS computes the CPI Furthermore, rising average hourly earnings, weak productivity growth, and firm energy prices suggest that there are upside risks to this forecast In any event, the fact of a 1/2-point rise in 1996 inflation may harm our credibility in ways that cannot be repaired by the staff's confidential forecast of a 1997 inflation decline  Our policy report to Congress last February suggested that we would resist pressures that might push inflation above recent trends Economic forecasters have often interpreted our policy as a 3 percent cap on CPI inflation Events in 1996 put us at considerable risk of losing credibility for even that modest goal In my view, we should reaffirm our commitment to resist inflation above 3 percent At the same time, we should continue to emphasize that all we influence in the long run is inflation I personally believe we should go further and announce targets for bringing inflation down over time, but an announcement in February of an intended cap at 3 percent for inflation would be a good start Thank you   Thanks, Alan This is for Ed Boehne and others I do not want them to get too nervous about Al Broaddus and me both ""selling out"" on an earlier view CPI inflation is up 1/2 percentage point this year over last year, and I think the risks are that it could rise further Personally, as I view the incoming information and listen to the comments today, I see the risks of rising inflation as somewhat greater now than they were at the time of the last meeting, not less So, I would favor a modest increase in the degree of reserve restraint  Now, such an increase clearly would catch markets off guard and if we acted, which of course is not going to happen today, we would have to put that action in the context of a long-run inflation objective At this stage I would put it in the context of trying to cap inflation at 3 percent In some sense we should not have to explain that I think markets should have a better idea of what our objectives are The fact that we have not been more explicit about our objectives, I think, is probably the most significant risk to our independence in comparison to other things we worry about I think we are perceived to have much more influence than we really do, and we could deflect that perception if we explained that what we are really focused on is the inflation rate in the long run and that is all we influence  So, I would support what Al has said here with respect to a discussion in February We really need to zero in on this issue and be more explicit about our long-term intentions with respect to inflation Personally, as I think you all know, I would be in favor of laying out a path like Al described, but whatever we can get in terms of being more explicit would be better than the situation that we are in now I do not think we can wait for legislative results that might clarify that I think we have a job to do to educate the public about what our intentions are, and a good starting point is by being more explicit about our objectives Setting our inflation objectives is something we would have to ease into, but I think that it is very important I would like to encourage a discussion in February and maybe some staff work that would lay out some possibilities with respect to things we might do that would take us in that direction "
5699,1997-02-04," Excuse me, Alan When would we release those?   We will go ahead with the new schedule for these minutes?  SPEAKER(?) Yes   Okay   Just to follow up on that question, Peter, we have not made such a  decision for a while, but what would happen if we were to change the degree of reserve restraint?  Given that the banking industry has demonstrated its ability to operate effectively with smaller  and smaller amounts of reserves, do you have any thoughts as to whether a change in reserve  conditions would have any impact in terms of what you would have to do in the reserve markets  to achieve a given federal funds rate effect?   I do not doubt that   As balances have gone down, has anything happened with daylight  overdrafts? Is there any pattern in what we are observing?   Thanks, Alan District economic activity has picked up in the past  few months Auto dealers reported a flat November and December compared with a year ago,  but most expect a pickup in the first half of 1997 District auto production, which benefits from  the popularity of light trucks, is expected to rise 36 percent in the first quarter from its year-ago  level and to rise even more in the second quarter Most District contacts are optimistic about the  near term Many firms have announced plans for expansion, but tight labor markets remain a  problem for many employers, especially in the construction and information technology  industries There are a few reports of rising prices, mainly in the transportation and public  utility sectors where increased energy costs are being passed along to customers  At the national level, the economy is on a relatively balanced growth path With a 47  percent surge in the fourth quarter, the year's real GDP growth came in at a rate of about 3-1/2  percent, well above the 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 percent forecast range that we reported to the Congress a  year ago Momentum from 1996 and the absence of significant imbalances in the economy    2/4-5/97  make us optimistic about the growth outlook for 1997 Our projections are for real growth at  about trend, with a continued upward creep in the CPI by another couple of tenths  Quite apart from Jerry Jordan's letter, I find this semi-annual forecasting exercise  somewhat frustrating and potentially misleading We are asked to assume what would be an  appropriate monetary policy in making our forecast In my view, an appropriate policy would be  one that moves inflation systematically lower over the next several years and one that makes that  objective explicit This approach would certainly affect the inflation outlook for 1998 and 1999  and quite likely for 1997 as well In fact, under such a policy regime our forecast for 1997 CPI  inflation would be considerably lower than the one we actually submitted But if I submitted that  lower number knowing the FOMC has not shown much inclination to pursue the policy regime I  just described, and let us say some other members did as well, what would be the result? The  forecast range and perhaps the central tendency of the forecasts submitted by the members would  be biased downward It would look as if the FOMC as a group is more sanguine about the  inflation outlook than it is in fact I think we need to be concerned about how the public  interprets these forecasts, because they could be used to decipher our implicit inflation  objectives What did the public learn from 1996? In February, we projected CPI inflation in a  2-1/2 to 3 percent range As the year progressed, both output and inflation came in well above  expectations and long-term bond yields rose, yet we took no policy actions Instead, we raised  the CPI inflation forecast in July to a range of 3 to 3-1/4 percent So, what is the message about  our inflation objective? I think one could conclude--I don't say I believe this--that we seem quite  complacent with CPI inflation at or even above 3 percent, which I think is an unfortunate  conclusion In my view a far better approach would be for us to specify our definition of price  stability Presumably, it would be less than 3 percent Some of us had suggested a 0 to 2 percent    2/4-5/97  range, the midpoint of which happens to coincide with the Boskin Commission's estimate of the  upward bias in the CPI Setting such a longer-term objective and a timetable to achieve it would  make our forecasts more meaningful for the public and ourselves Thank you   I was just going to comment, Alan, that I understand what you are  saying on the political side On the other side, it seems fair to say that there is a rather large  uncertainty premium in real rates with respect to future inflation Expectations of 3 percent  inflation seem to be fairly widespread, but my guess is that there is a considerable amount of  uncertainty surrounding those expectations   Yes, I guess that is right I'm talking about surveys; I believe some  of those surveys and economists' projections are based on the CPI But I think there is a fairly  high uncertainty premium and some concern about where we are going with this So, I believe  there are some economic costs associated with our not being more explicit There is a tradeoff    2/4-5/97  between the political risk on the one hand and on the other perhaps some real economic costs  associated with the uncertainty we may cause by not being explicit about--   I understand what you said before about it   In that regard you probably made the most significant point by  suggesting that we ought to start with this by being more explicit among ourselves I do not  anticipate having that discussion in the next half hour or hour but in due course here It may be  something we could pursue in anticipation of the next Humphrey- Hawkins meeting I think that  getting more explicit among ourselves would be a good starting point because I am not sure  everybody is on the same page with respect to where we want to go and how we think we are  going to get there--over what time frame and so forth   I do not mean to suggest that! All I'm saying is that I think it would  be useful if we were more explicit among ourselves with respect to what measures we ought to  be focusing on, where we want to get to with those, and over what time frame I think you said  the same thing You had no problem with our being more explicit with respect to using numbers  internally, but politically you saw a risk in putting out a number to the public   I wasn't worried about that   Alan, I favor adopting the provisional ranges, which is alternative I    2/4-5/97  On the issue you raised about whether there is anything impeding these discussions  or what we could do to foster them, it seems to me that it would be very useful to ask FOMC  staff--Board and Bank staff--to research the issue Tom Hoenig was just talking about Perhaps  they could take a look at the various measures and lay out for us some of the pros and cons of the  measures, indicate what might constitute price stability in their view, and--I don't know if this is  possible--what might constitute price stability in one measure versus another to the extent that  biases can be identified I think that would be a useful starting point in terms of sharpening our  internal focus If we tended to gravitate toward a measure that seemed to make sense to us  internally and we had a clearer idea in our minds as to what would constitute price stability under  that measure, forgetting what the time frames might be or whether we would get there  systematically or opportunistically, that would be a good starting point for a discussion at one of  these meetings   Don, we have had only one issue of inflation indexed bonds, but are  there any preliminary conclusions you could draw from that or is it premature to do so?   Thanks, Alan I favor alternative C or at least something in that  direction, and my reasons remain the same as I have been stating I think inflation is too high,  and I see increasing evidence that inflationary pressures are building, especially in labor markets  Finally, I do not think one can say that the stance of policy is at all restrictive right now; so I  believe some action is called for We clearly are not going to do anything at this meeting, but as  we anticipate a possible move in the future, we might want to think about one that once taken  would leave people in a position where they are uncertain about what the direction of the next  move would be In other words, we are in a much different position than we were last time when  we were in these circumstances, starting at a 3 percent funds rate with a long way to go We  probably are not too far away from where we ought to be, and we should think about doing  enough in one shot so that there is uncertainty about the direction of the next move That might  argue against a modest move as an opening salvo, one that simply would encourage people to  speculate on the next move Once we got enough tightening done the last time, we had a very  beneficial impact on long-term markets In fact, we raised the funds rate by, as I recall, 50 basis  points at one point and actually got a drop in long rates It would be nice to be able to get there  sooner rather than later when and if we do move "
5722,1997-03-25," Thanks, Alan The Eighth District economy continues to operate  at a high level Contacts report little or no change in the growth rate of economic activity in  the past few months and continue to be optimistic about the near term With unemployment    3/25/97  rates well below the national level, labor markets remain tight in much of the District,  especially for construction workers Payroll employment increased at a 23 percent annual  rate for the three months ended in January, a rate not seen since October 1995 and well above  the 1-1/2 percent average rate posted in 1996 Second-quarter District auto production is  expected to be up more than 10 percent from the first-quarter level Early 1997 sales tax  receipts are up substantially in the District from their year-ago levels, suggesting strong  economic activity, particularly at the retail level Residential and commercial construction  activity has stayed relatively strong, although January residential permits dropped from their  year-ago levels in most District metropolitan areas About 120 counties in Arkansas,  Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee have been declared federal disaster areas as a result of the  tornadoes, heavy rains, and flooding that occurred in early March Although reliable  estimates of damage are not yet available, federal disaster assistance is expected to lead to  new home construction by displaced residents That was the experience after the major 1993  floods in the Midwest  At the national level, forecasters see continuing expansion A burst of  consumption growth is expected in the current quarter, which will be the highest quarterly  increase in consumption since the end of 1992 if the staff forecast of 5 percent growth at an  annual rate is realized The run-up in stock prices and the high level of confidence reported  in consumer surveys as well as early reports on retail sales and residential construction  support this conclusion On the one hand, such an outlook suggests that the downside risks  for the economy are limited in the short run On the other, the longer-run inflation outlook is  not so sanguine Despite moderate decreases in PPI and CPI inflation so far in 1997, there is  a heightened concern about an inflationary impulse emanating from observed price increases,    3/25/97  a tight labor market, and a continuing easy credit market In addition, we have seen  anecdotal evidence along the lines of what Bill McDonough mentioned with respect to the  apparently shifting pattern of health care cost increases from a declining to a rising trend that  will no longer tend to offset at least a portion of the wage increases  It does not seem to me that the current stance of monetary policy will mitigate the  inflation impulse that I outlined Growth rates in the broad monetary aggregates, which  conceivably are back on track, are running at or above our announced targets The yield  curve has steepened further, increasing the likelihood that the federal funds rate target is too  low to prevent further acceleration in monetary growth All told, the longer-term inflation  trend may be a lot less favorable than the 3 percent norm of most forecasters My reading of  the economy supports the conclusion that we are at risk of losing the hard-won credibility of  our commitment to hold inflation at 3 percent In the current situation, it is vitally important  that we act to preempt prospective further increases in inflation and thereby avoid the  substantially higher costs of having to do a lot more policy tightening later   Alan, I agree with what you said in terms of the likelihood of  more tightening down the road I think we will need to do more, and I might be inclined to  do more at this point, but I can accept your recommendation "
5744,1997-05-20," Thanks, Alan The Eighth District economy continues to grow  moderately, with firms reporting sales increases and net new hiring Labor markets are  generally tight In March, the unemployment rate in Missouri was 42 percent, the lowest  since 1979 District automotive production by Ford and Chrysler was up 11 percent in the  first quarter from the fourth quarter of 1996 Second-quarter production is expected to  increase another 2 percent Resolution in early May of the Mound Road engine strike in  Detroit put about 2,500 auto workers, who had been out about a month, back on the job  making pickup trucks at Chrysler's St Louis plant March flooding along the Ohio and  Mississippi Rivers and tornadoes in Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kentucky led to about 6,000  claims for unemployment insurance Estimates of total storm damage are sketchy but may  total around $80 million for infrastructure alone  Nationally, real GDP growth in the last four quarters is just over 4 percent,  matching the best performance since 1984 If adjusted for a change in survey methodology,  the April unemployment rate would have been 4-1/2 percent, a level not seen since 1970  What about the future? Recent forecasting records have not been good In October 1996,  many forecasters projected that the economy would grow at an annual rate of less than 2-1/2  percent in the fourth quarter; that, of course, turned out to be well short of the observed rate  of 38 percent In January of this year, many forecasters projected that the economy would  grow at a rate of less than 2-1/2 percent in the first quarter, and that forecast turned out to be    5/20/97  even further short of the observed rate of 56 percent reported so far In the current quarter,  forecasters are again projecting growth at a rate of 2-1/2 percent or less They may be right  this time, but with such a record, it is hard to argue that monetary policy actions should be  based on forecasts of short-run real economic growth  It is essential for us to maintain a longer-term orientation focused on the general  level of prices, which is all that monetary policy ultimately can influence Inflation has been  running at a rate close to 3 percent for the past five years, and it has continued at about that  rate so far in 1997 Thus, I see little reason to believe that the longer-run inflation trend will  decline Looking forward, the risks remain on the upside Broad money and credit have  been growing rapidly, which could easily translate into upward pressure on demand growth  and inflation Because the economy remains so strong, we have an ideal opportunity to take  a longer-term view about appropriate action to temper inflation risks  While sending a message that our intention to cap inflation at 3 percent is  desirable, it is a mistake to give markets the impression that inflation near 3 percent is  consistent with our long-run price stability goal The most recent IMF report on the world  economic outlook posed the question Is inflation outside a range that the country's  authorities consider to be consistent with price stability? According to the IMF report, the  answer for the United States was ""no"" I think the question is a good one and the FOMC  might benefit from discussing it My judgment is that there is less than a percentage point of  bias in the CPI and, accordingly, 2-1/2 to 3 percent inflation is not price stability in spite of  the views that the IMF reports Furthermore, I certainly am uncomfortable with an IMF  forecast of US consumer price inflation in 1997 and 1998 that is higher than that of any  other G-7 country    5/20/97  To clarify our goal, we need to get our inflation measurement straight How can  we answer the question about whether current inflation is consistent with price stability  without being clear about what we are talking about CPI, core CPI, median CPI,  experimental CPI, GDP or PCE price indexes, or something else? We certainly need to be  specific among ourselves if not before the public How should we interpret the current 1997  and 1998 forecasts in the Greenbook of an acceleration in the GDP chain-weighted price  index and the core CPI and a deceleration in the overall consumer price index? Is inflation  accelerating or decelerating?  At our February meeting, there was general agreement on the need to be more  explicit among ourselves about what we mean by price stability what measure to emphasize,  where we want to be with respect to that measure, and ideally a time frame to get there I  hope we can continue that dialogue at our July meeting and sharpen our internal  understanding of our long-term objective   Thanks, Alan I think the inflation risks are on the upside, as I  said before, and I believe it would be prudent to take out some additional insurance now in  the form of a 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate To reemphasize a point that  was made earlier--I know Al Broaddus made it and others probably did as well--we cannot  lose sight of how important our credibility is in assuring the kind of economic climate we  have enjoyed in recent years The confidence that people have that we are going to keep  inflation low and stable is very important, and I see a move in the direction that I am  suggesting as consistent with maintaining that kind of credibility As others have said, if we  are wrong and there are unique circumstances here that would not lead to an imminent  increase in the inflation rate, what would be so bad about moving the inflation rate lower?  We are not at price stability We have some distance to go, and frankly I think exercising  monetary restraint at a time when the economy is strong is more likely to succeed in an  opportunistic sense than doing so in a recession or a recovery This is what is implied by the  so-called opportunistic strategy Even though people would associate me with the deliberate  approach, I think one could characterize a tightening move today as opportunistic    5/20/97  Finally, I do not think that inaction on our part will do anything to stem  speculative behavior If anything, inaction will foster such behavior "
5765,1997-07-01," I have one I agree with the general thrust of the views that have just  been expressed One of the options on the decision tree would be to lower reserve requirements  and increase the deposit base to which they apply It would be exactly in that circumstance that I    7/1-2/97  think the point the Chairman is making would be relevant I just want to make the general  comment that I am glad the staff has undertaken this analysis of the implications and possible  responses to the decline in operating balances I am sure that everyone shares this view We  have to be concerned about excessive volatility in the federal funds rate, but I think some  volatility is actually quite desirable from a market discipline point of view, particularly as  required reserves become a less important driver of the demand for federal funds We really  want institutions to have the incentive to hold appropriate balances to settle transactions, and the  price they would pay in a very stable funds market might not be sufficient to create the kind of  incentives that we would like to see in that process I know that, as market people, this is  something you are well aware of, and we should keep it in mind as we think about these issues   Thanks, Alan The Eighth District economy continues to grow at a  pace consistent with national trends Firms report moderate gains in sales and employment, but  we often hear that concerns over labor availability have put a damper on expansion plans Tight  labor markets are reflected in an average unemployment rate of 46 percent for District states in  April Manpower's employment survey for the third quarter shows increased job opportunities  compared with three months earlier A survey of 223 small businesses in the District revealed  that about 18 percent plan to increase sales prices in the months ahead, while about 3 percent    7/1-2/97  plan to lower prices This is consistent with results from the same survey a year ago  Year-to-date sales tax receipts for District states are running nearly 5 percent ahead of the same  period one year ago Retailers in the District remain optimistic about sales growth in the second  half of 1997 Although results for April and May were mixed, many say that sales growth  generally has been in line with expectations and that current inventories are at desired levels  While loan demand appears to be slowing at District banks, many are still experiencing double-  digit growth rates in their loans on a year-over-year basis Some contacts report more generous  lending terms stemming from stiff competition, which is consistent with the most recent Senior  Loan Officers Survey for the nation as a whole  The national economy is indeed turning in an impressive performance So far in 1997  the economy has created an average of 229,000 nonfarm payroll jobs per month, well above  projected longer-term trends in labor force growth Consumer confidence indices are at high  levels, and manufacturing continues to show strength While retail sales slumped over the last  three months, part of that reflects adjustments to exceptionally strong gains early in the year As  the Greenbook notes, weekly chain store sales data indicate some upturn in June The consumer  price index has increased only 14 percent at an annual rate over the first five months of this year,  down sharply from the 33 percent rate for all of 1996 This favorable inflation news has come  as a surprise relative to most forecasts made last year, as Cathy Minehan noted  The Committee might do well to think about ways these inflation gains could be  locked in If markets had more confidence that the Fed was not satisfied with 3 percent inflation,  longer-term interest rates might fall in line with the news on the CPI As it is, 30-year Treasury  bonds have been trading to yield about 67 to 68 percent in recent sessions, actually up a notch    7/1-2/97  from 66 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996 It appears that markets expect inflation to  rebound later this year, a forecast echoed by the Blue Chip consensus Their expected 1997 CPI  inflation rate is 28 percent as of June 10, followed by a rate of 29 percent in 1998, the same rate  that professional forecasters see over a 10-year horizon Our St Louis forecast, after  incorporating the good news on real growth and inflation for the first quarter of 1997, assumes  the persistence of the underlying forces that have generated sustained real growth at a rate of  about 2-1/2 percent and sustained CPI inflation at a rate of about 2-1/2 to 3 percent With  respect to CPI inflation, we recognize that the experience of the first five months will moderate  measured inflation in 1997, which we expect will come in below that observed in 1996  Nevertheless, like other forecasts, ours is for a bounceback in 1998 to the 3 percent rate that is  entrenched in budgets and long-term interest rates We have assumed in this regard that the  Committee will not adopt a deliberate strategy to achieve price stability over some specified time  period Thank you   Thanks, Alan I, too, want to thank the staff for a good job of  analyzing these issues, and I also appreciate having this matter on the agenda These are topics  that we need to be talking about I see this with a shorter-term focus than you were talking  about, but I feel that we could benefit at the appropriate time by being more clear among  ourselves and eventually with the public about our objectives and by being more transparent    7/1-2/97  regarding what we specifically are trying to accomplish So, I think we need to be looking at and  talking about this sort of thing  From that perspective, some of the things I took away from this analysis included, first  of all, the desirability of focusing on a broad measure of inflation That certainly raises questions  in my mind about the focus that we as an institution have placed on core CPI Even now, some  of the analysis and some of the simulations in the Greenbook focus on core CPI and core PCE,  and I wonder whether these measures are what we ought to be looking at in these longer-term  simulations We probably have created an impression with the public and the financial markets  that core CPI is what we really care about I don't think we need to change that impression in  the near term, but I believe there's a good bit of feeling out there that core CPI is our focus; at  least that is my sense  I thought the insight with respect to rates versus levels was very interesting Clearly,  if we were going to go in this direction, then rather than debating what the ideal index would be  and setting its level, it would simplify things greatly to recognize that the indices move broadly  together over time and to focus on rates, realizing that we are a good distance away from price  stability That might be a good first step I was also interested in the sensitivity analysis with  respect to fluctuations of plus or minus 1 percentage point from a fixed target In general, I feel  that if we go in this direction, we have to be looking at the trend in inflation rather than a point  estimate Probably the way to capture that idea is to think in terms of some range around a  particular rate I thought it was interesting that the plus or minus 1 percentage point that most  people would think about in terms of a reasonable range does not generate larger variations on  the real side in these simulations than those we have experienced In my view, one of the    7/1-2/97  assumptions that one would have to question is the tradeoff between the inflation rate and the  output gap In fact, I suppose one could argue that if we had lower and more stable rates of  inflation, we would also engender more stable output I'm not sure that is implicit in the curve  that the staff has in its chart Finally, and Bob Parry made this point, even after taking account of  the bias, we seem to be a good distance away from where we ultimately need to be to achieve  price stability That is the case no matter which of these measures we look at, even with these 80  percent confidence intervals  In any event, I believe it is very constructive to be talking about this I don't know  when and if the time would be right to go public with something like this I accept your  judgment that now is not the right time But, clearly, if we wanted to move in this direction, we  would have to cut through some of this In other words, we can continue to throw issues in the  air that arguably need to be analyzed before we presumably have enough confidence to go in this  direction So, I have always viewed this sort of thing as having to be imposed from above when  the time is right It is almost like a corporate strategy where a decision is made and is followed  by efforts to figure out how it should be implemented as opposed to wandering around in the  weeds and thinking about all the problems that could come up Clearly, this is not the right time,  but we could study this forever and never be comfortable with all the questions that could be  raised Ultimately, if it is the right thing to do and the time is right, then we have to cut through  the questions and move ahead   Alternative I is all I was going to say On this communications issue,  I think we also have to be careful in terms of how we communicate We use shorthand  internally, but the public has the confused impression that we can affect inflation or we can  affect growth So, we need to talk about inflation in the context of how it prevents the use of real  resources in a way that fosters maximum efficiency and maximum growth We all understand  that, but it involves a certain subtlety We certainly do not want to put ourselves in the position  of having the public think we can directly deliver growth when it is real factors that do that   I'm not sure any change gets us much I worry a little about  reinforcing this idea that we are in a more rigid interest rate targeting regime at the very time we  are thinking about the possibility of some alternative regime, though I know that is a decision for  the longer-term future Secondly, I worry a little about what Jerry Jordan was pointing out  Presumably, we could at times maintain current conditions in reserve markets with an increase or  a decrease in the funds rate We would have to allow for that here, and in the event that might be  quite confusing to describe   Thanks, Alan I would favor alternative C Basically, my rationale  would be that we should be acting to protect against the prospect of a future rise in inflation, if  not to lock in the recent windfall in terms of the decline in inflation we have actually witnessed  Having said that, I recognize the implausibility of acting now when we didn't last month with  arguably a stronger case in terms of current as opposed to forward-looking data But relating  where we are to the discussion we had yesterday, I think the current situation we find ourselves  in demonstrates what I would call the emptiness of an opportunistic disinflation strategy in the  absence of a clear goal The way I look at it, what better time than now to act opportunistically    7/1-2/97  when the economy is strong and the risk of recession is low? It really is inconceivable to me that  we would exercise monetary restraint in or immediately after a recession to achieve lower  inflation Circumstances would conceivably be different now if the public had a clear idea that 3  percent inflation was not price stability in our view I think prudent actions on our part to  achieve a lower rate of inflation would be anticipated and better understood in the context of a  clear price stability objective  I believe it is extremely important that our discussion of yesterday be continued and  broadened, with the ultimate aim of agreeing on a sensible long-term monetary policy objective  and strategy In a sense, our hands are tied right now because we have not been clear in that  regard "
5790,1997-08-19," Alan, I just want to make an observation on another issue for Peter We  are a fairly substantial holder of inflation-indexed Treasury securities in our portfolio, 5 percent of  the outstandings or something like that Looking down the road, as those securities become more  useful as guides to monetary policy in terms of giving us insight into inflation expectations and real  rates, I wonder whether we ought to be investing in that market In other words, if the perception is    8/19/97  that we are a significant enough player to affect how those markets trade, it may undermine the  usefulness of the information I don't expect an answer right now I assume that our purchases  have been on the same basis as they are for any other Treasury securities, but we may want to think  about continuing to acquire those obligations as we go forward, perhaps as they become more  useful to us from an information point of view   That occurred to me   It's a complicated issue, but one that I believe is worth continuing to  think about   Thanks, Alan The Eighth District economy is still growing at a  moderate pace District firms report continued growth in sales and employment, although tight  labor markets throughout the District are a limiting factor Average unemployment, at 44 percent,  remains below the national rate District payroll employment, which earlier had increased much  faster than nationally, grew only 14 percent in the year ending in June compared with 21 percent  for the nation Estimates of District automotive production are down about 4-1/2 percent for the  third quarter and 2 percent for the fourth quarter from high levels a year ago Residential  construction activity also remains below last year's high levels, though some bankers have noted a  pickup in mortgage demand recently Commercial and consumer loan demands are described as    8/19/97  steady In agriculture, crops are in reasonably good condition despite the hot, dry weather that has  prevailed in most of the region, and an above-average harvest is expected in most of the District  Regarding the UPS strike, concerns have been expressed by District contacts about the  long-term ramifications of the strike for future labor market bargaining, including the ongoing UPS  dispute with its pilots and the Teamsters contract with less-than-truck-load carriers, which expires  April 1 next year  The nation seems poised for another year of above-trend economic growth despite the  strike and some slowing in the second quarter Rising real wages, high consumer confidence, and a  recent surge in consumer expenditures, especially for housing and big ticket items, all suggest that  real GDP will continue to grow above trend in the second half of 1997 Although labor markets  have become extremely tight, there is some puzzlement as to why the employment cost index has  been on a downward trend An alternative measure, compensation per hour, has displayed a more  distinct cyclical behavior, slowing to 14 percent for the year ended in the second quarter of 1994  and rebounding to 3-1/2 percent over the last four quarters The compensation per hour measure  picks up changes in labor costs when the composition of the labor force changes as well as cost  increases due to promotions and bonuses that can be missed by the ECI We are hearing an  increasing number of reports from our District contacts about the need for hiring bonuses and other  special compensation arrangements to attract the talent that they require  The broad monetary aggregates continue to grow at or above the upper limits of their  ranges M2 growth, at an annual rate of about 5 percent and given its recent velocity pattern, is  roughly consistent with projected nominal GDP growth The good news on lower inflation in 1997  is welcome, but as we all know it is partly an illusion The low CPI inflation in 1997 reflects the  moderation of energy prices after a surge in 1996 Also, people seem largely unaware of the    8/19/97  technical BLS adjustments that will shave 1/4 percentage point from the 1997 average If this 1/4  point is added to the last 12 months of CPI inflation, the rate is back around 2-3/4 percent, which is  about the average for CPI inflation over the last several years The continued emphasis on the CPI  less food and energy can be misleading in identifying underlying inflation trends Recent research  suggests that the CPI itself is actually a better predictor of future inflation than the ex-food-and-  energy measure If we want to eliminate the month-to-month noise in the data, rather than focusing  on the ex-food-and-energy measures we can simply average CPI inflation over a longer period or  we can look at a measure such as the median CPI The median CPI averaged over three months has  remained around 3 percent at an annual rate over the first seven months of 1997, essentially the  same pattern as in recent years I guess the question is whether that is good enough Until we can  agree on a common yardstick, I don't know how we as a group can ever reach agreement as to  whether we are achieving our objective of price stability That's why I think it is so important that  we continue the discussion on inflation measures that we began at the last meeting  Finally, although we tend to assume that there is not much of a constituency for price  stability, we should not underestimate the cost to our credibility and the potential public backlash if  we permit trend inflation to rise In fact, we might be surprised at how much support there would  be for locking in the lower inflation we have seen this year, in view of how well the economy has  performed under conditions of relatively low and stable inflation Thank you   Could you repeat that, Don? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt   I can accept your recommendation, Alan I will not say much more  other than to express the wish that we had the groundwork in place to lock in these lower inflation  rates I do not think we have It would be an excellent time to act opportunistically, as I have said  before I worry a little about whether there will be a defensible rationale that will permit us to act  before inflation actually starts to rise That is going to be a challenge "
5813,1997-09-30," Thanks, Alan I have little new to report on the Eighth District  economy On balance, economic performance has improved in the third quarter, as we hear has  occurred in other districts Sales exceeded the expectations of many businesses District labor  markets are stretched to the limit in many areas, and that is putting a damper on payroll  employment growth For example, the latest Manpower survey as well as a recent survey of small  businesses in the District show continued strength in labor demand relative to the supply of  qualified workers, resulting in some pressure on wages The market for high-priced homes has  weakened somewhat in the District, but overall residential building has been held back more by  supply than by demand factors District banking data are broadly consistent with an overall  strengthening in activity recently, as reflected in the apparent year-over-year growth in bank loans  at a double-digit pace in the second quarter One problem with this assessment, however, is that the  data exclude what was the District's largest banking institution, now part of another District for  statistical purposes  The outlook for the nation continues to improve The substantial upward shift in the  Greenbook's outlook for economic activity in 1997 is consistent with our view from the Eighth  District Perhaps the most important reason for this good outlook is that inflation and inflation  expectations have declined, facilitating sounder economic decisions and avoiding imbalances that  occurred in past expansions When the recession started in the third quarter of 1990, inflation as  measured by the CPI had accelerated to 7 percent By the first quarter of 1991, the CPI inflation  rate had dropped to 3 percent, and it stayed near that level until recently This year the inflation  rate has dropped to an annual rate of 16 percent through August We should view this  unanticipated development as an opportunity to take a step closer to price stability, a step that  would put our inflation performance much more in line with that of other industrial countries    9/30/97  Longer-term inflation expectations appear to have come down a bit in financial markets  as well, perhaps reflecting the view that we will lock in a rate of inflation lower than 3 percent  However, we have not taken any important steps to do so as yet If anything, and Jerry Jordan  mentioned this in a very clear fashion, monetary policy may be getting more accommodative as  gauged by the growth of money and credit The broad aggregates, M2 and M3, surged in the last  12 weeks and remain above the upper bounds of their target ranges for 1997 We see a similar  surge in the narrow monetary aggregates after adjusting for sweep accounts These indicators of an  expansionary monetary policy stance are consistent with the continued rapid growth in bank credit  we have observed and a readily available supply of loans for both consumers and businesses  The Greenbook is forecasting a substantial acceleration of inflation and a significant  increase in the federal funds rate target in 1998 If such actions are judged by the Committee as  likely to be needed in 1998, then why not adopt a tighter monetary policy stance in 1997? Policy  actions while the economy is robust, as it is now, might be less disruptive than they would be in a  situation where real growth is slowing and inflation is accelerating, as is forecast for next year A  little preventive medicine sooner, which is not a new theme in light of some of the comments made  here today, might avoid such a dilemma later I realize that markets would be surprised by such an  action because we have not laid the groundwork for it We have not been explicit about our  inflation objective If we had been, markets would not be caught completely off guard by monetary  policy actions to preserve the inflation gains we have experienced this year For all intents and  purposes, those gains have brought us to price stability Indeed, markets might react favorably to  such actions since low and stable inflation is sound economic policy Thank you   Thanks, Alan I would prefer alternative C but I could accept your  recommendation The stage setting is probably very important, although I think we need to  recognize that at some point it may be only actions that will get the message across I think, as was  clear in my comments today and earlier, that the odds of our having to act are quite high In  sending a message, I believe it is very important that we focus on the benefits of low inflation and  specifically the benefits of locking in the very low rates of inflation that we have as opposed to the  evils of rising inflation That approach has the potential of playing better, and Bill McDonough had  some good thoughts with respect to your talking about this We cannot come across as taking  credit for the current economy, but we can certainly relate some of our argument to the benefits we  are enjoying today in this economy that is creating a lot of jobs and opportunity "
5836,1997-11-12," Thanks, Alan   Thanks, Alan Peter, on the issue of publishing the standard  deviation data, I have no objection to providing that additional information I think it is probably  a good idea I guess I would be concerned if I thought the Desk were going to use those data as a  measure of its performance and, specifically, if the Desk were to adopt the perspective that a  lower standard deviation in the funds rate indicates better performance I say that because I think  we ought to want the market to act as a form of discipline on those banks that have not properly  provided for their reserve needs, particularly for settlements Some degree of volatility is  desirable from that perspective   Thanks, Alan The economic news from the Eighth District  continues to be remarkably good Business contacts in the District remain very optimistic about  future economic prospects However, tight labor markets are a concern The District's seven-  state unemployment rate, at 46 percent in September, remained below the national average  Payroll employment growth continues to slow, in part because of a shortage of available  workers Payroll employment grew at a 05 percent annual rate in the third quarter, well below  the nation's 23 percent annual rate District banks have been pumping a great deal of liquidity  into the regional economy Commercial and industrial lending has been strong as firms  increasingly have turned to banks to finance investment in inventories and plant and equipment  or to finance mergers and acquisitions Although there has been some slowing in consumer  installment lending, the most recent state sales tax data for the District suggest, on balance,    11/12/97 71  moderate to strong growth in consumer spending Mortgage lending has held up well in the  District, even though overall levels of new residential construction remain below last year's high  levels  The national economy continues to expand at a rate above most estimates of long-run  potential An average of over 230,000 nonfarm payroll jobs per month has been added so far in  1997, a pace well in excess of long-run trends in labor force growth Unemployment has been  low by postwar standards for some time There are signs of mounting wage pressures, including  the $13 increase in average hourly earnings in the manufacturing sector, which brought the pace  of growth there to 7-1/2 percent at an annual rate over the last three months  The third-quarter advance GDP report indicates substantial underlying strength in the  economy Final sales increased at a 5 percent annual rate and personal consumption  expenditures at a 57 percent annual rate in the latest quarter That is more demand pull than the  economy can likely continue to supply Further, we appear poised for a robust fourth quarter,  notwithstanding the turmoil in Southeast Asian currency and equity markets The fundamental  effects on the US economy of these international developments should be small  Good news on inflation and declining inflation expectations have been major factors  in producing the excellent economic performance so far in 1997 Nonetheless, I remain  concerned that some of this year's good news on inflation has been due to factors that may soon  abate Most forecasters expect somewhat higher inflation in 1998 In the postwar era, when  inflation has been lowered and then begins to turn up, it has often turned up quite sharply in the  following 12 months That could happen again, forecasts notwithstanding Rapid M2 growth    11/12/97 72  and even more rapid M3 growth over the past two years suggest that the stance of policy is not  appropriately restrictive to lock in low inflation  The question in my mind is surely when, not whether, inflation will escalate more  rapidly The fundamentals have not changed much since the Chairman's House testimony before  the Committee on the Budget on October 8, which seemingly was made to prepare markets for a  possible tightening If anything, unsettled markets aside, given a high level of demand growth  and accelerating wages, the situation has worsened from an inflation risk standpoint Market  conditions may cause us to defer any action today, but it seems to me that the challenge for  monetary policy could be far greater going into 1998 and beyond if economic growth tapers off  and inflation picks up as expected We may be running out of room for continued deferral in  taking an appropriately anti-inflationary policy stance  Certainly, there have been some opportunities this year and last when the stance of  policy could have been firmed without surprising the markets Yet, it is hard to quibble with  results so far, and inflation is unlikely to rise at the rate it did in 1990 and 1991 But I wonder,  had we been more explicit among ourselves, if not the public, about our objectives, whether we  could have locked in CPI inflation at 2 percent or less when the economy was expanding  strongly In my opinion, it will be very difficult to act opportunistically and lock in lower  inflation in a weaker economy because of pressures to focus monetary policy on the real side,  even if inflation pressures continue to mount We cannot do much about the real economy, but  we can and should use the current opportunity to lower the inflation trend a notch Thank you   Thanks, Alan I favor alternative C, like Al Broaddus, but I could  accept ""B"" on the basis of unsettled market conditions I believe inflation is likely to rise in the  near future as I mentioned in my earlier comments, and I think, as Al does, that there are risks in  waiting So, I believe it is very important that when the Committee becomes convinced that  inflation will rise, it must be prepared to act promptly and forcefully Strong actions like those  taken in 1994 send a message that the FOMC will not tolerate rising inflation In my view, such  actions would encourage markets to build in expectations of permanently lower inflation  Let me close with a longer-term thought expressed in the form of a few questions  What are the FOMC's intentions? Do we like seeing inflation below 2 percent? Does the public  know it? I think, as I have said before, that we ought to be more explicit about our longer-term  objective In that event, it would be much less likely that our actions would be misinterpreted as  being anti-jobs or anti-growth I believe the last five years of relatively low and stable inflation  have demonstrated to businesses and consumers the desirability of relative price stability It  comes back to a comment that Jerry Jordan made about how ""Main Street"" would perhaps be  more supportive of our moving than we might think I also believe that long-term interest rates  likely would be lower because of a reduced inflation risk premium And finally, I think it would    11/12/97 102  probably take less forceful actions to contain inflation and inflation expectations because of  enhanced credibility Thank you "
