285,1977-01-17,"  Thank you very much  Since I haven’t been here for 2-1/2 years, I  would like to give you a fresh viewpoint, but I am rather disappointed to say that I find, as Mr  Volcker does, that there seems to be a reasonable consensus here this morning, and I share that  consensus  I think the Minneapolis view of the economic outlook is remarkably similar to that  projected by the Board’s staff--that alternative B, which essentially is what you’re  recommending with the two modifications you mentioned, is consistent with the projected  economic outlook And that the short-term money market objective, or federal funds objective, is  consistent also with no change, which I think is, for the reasons you have stated, the sort of  prescription to me that we need at this time  So I would certainly support your  recommendations  "
311,1977-02-15,  I think I’d align myself with Governor Wallich  I would adopt  alternative B--which would happen to give us an average growth rate in M1 for this quarter  exactly along the lines of our long range targets--with a slight leaning toward alternative C for  the same reasons that he’s mentioned  And perhaps a raising of the federal funds rate by 1/4 on  the top end of the range   
336,1977-03-15,"  I think I share Mr Balles’ concern as to what our long-range targets are  going to be  I could comment more wisely on our short-range targets if I knew what’s going to  happen perhaps next month, when you review the long-range target  We had a shortfall in the  aggregates in the first quarter of the year, particularly in M1, and if we’re going to make up that  shortfall, perhaps the second quarter is the best time to do it  We might be in a better position to  make it up this time than later on in the year     And that would seem to argue, really, for alternative A  Instead of worrying about the  shortfall in the first quarter of the year--I don’t happen to be worried about that, and I think the  Committee in its wisdom possibly may even lower the long-range targets next month, when I  probably won’t be here  And so I guess I would go along with either alternative B or alternative  C  "
480,1977-08-16,"  Mr Chairman, I think at this point of the meeting, anything that I would  have to say is going to be quite redundant  It’s all been said  I came here prepared to report  alternative C across the board, both aggregates and the funds rate, so we can give confidence for  reasons that have already been stated--namely to get back on target     My confidence has been shaken a little bit by several developments that have come up  here  First of all, the hypothetical new M1 is somewhat comforting to me at least in the last  three months  Secondly, the suggestion that the downward shift in money demand is perhaps  [attenuated] if not actually stopped  The third concern is that it seems that either our seasonal  adjustments are wrong or every three months, by happenstance, we get a bulge in the M1 money  supply  And fourth, there seems to be some doubt as to the virtue of consistency between the  federal funds rate and the monetary aggregates       8/16/77 - 52 -           Nevertheless, I still vote for alternative C, although I would be willing to see the lower  [limits] of both monetary ranges, M1 and M2, lowered somewhat  And in line with Mr  Kimbrel’s suggestion, I think that I would like to see the federal funds range widened somewhat,  perhaps dropped as low as 5-3/4, with an upper end of 6-3/4     On the discount rate, if Mark Willes were here, I know he would recommend at least a 1/4  percent[age point] increase  I think that he might go along with a 1/2 percent[age point] increase  at this time  As has been said, the market is already adjusted to the expected increase  On the  economy, we are somewhat more optimistic in the Ninth District than is the staff  And--although  as an old discount officer I strongly dispute the idea that we change our criteria according to the  phase of the business cycle--I must admit that it’s a good deal easier to administer the discount  window when the discount rate is close to the fed funds rate  And in order to discourage the  temptation for arbitrage, I would be in favor of raising the discount rate at least 1/4 percent[age  point], perhaps 1/2 percent[age point], and I would do it immediately  "
