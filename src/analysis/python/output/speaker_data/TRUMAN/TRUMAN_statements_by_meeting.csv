450,1977-07-19,"  Well, basically, as is often the case in the international area, that is an  oil-related phenomenon     An oil-related phenomenon  You had a big buildup in oil imports in the  first quarter  A combination between that buildup, which was weather related, and Alaskan oil  coming in, which damps down our rate of growth in imports--in fact, reduces it  It’s largely  what gives you that swing between the first and fourth quarter     What brings you back is the end of a sort of honeymoon with Alaskan  oil, where the marginal supply, as the economy grows, starts coming from imports again  Plus,  the [oil] stockpile program  The government stockpile program will add $3 billion to oil imports  currently estimated for 1978      Yes, most of it  Most of it is a swing in the irregularity of it, if I can put  it that way  Yes  "
479,1977-08-16,"  Well, I don’t have the information with me     Well, my general impression--     The Wharton School puts out global capacity utilization indices--      --but the last figures that I saw were only through the last quarter of last  year  At that time, if my memory is correct, capacity utilization figures in this country were  somewhat higher than abroad, but [the figures are] not up to date  The only other figures you  can use [are] figures on how we perform relative to previous peaks in the other major industrial  countries  In that case again--in which we need more updated information--we have gone further  compared to relative previous peaks in industrial production than the other industrial countries       8/16/77 - 20 -           In fact, only one other has reached the previous peak, and on that crude measure, it’s fair, I think,  to generalize  "
505,1977-09-20,"  In answer to your specific question, our investigation of historical  relationships would suggest that a 1 percent increase in the growth of our major industrial  countries--not just western Europe and Canada [but] Japan as well--would add about $3 billion  to $4 billion to our trade position     Yes sir  "
530,1977-10-17,"  [Statement--see Appendix]     Well, on the volume side we do expect, as that first chart shows, some  resumption in growth abroad, or faster growth abroad--something around the 5 percent level in  contrast to the 3 percent level on average this year  So that’s been generating a good deal of the  volume  And the value--I think there’s probably more of an optical illusion than a particularly  rapid increase in the value over that period; it is about the same, maybe a little bit higher, than  we had this past year     Fourth quarter over fourth quarter, we’ve had about a 9 percent increase  in the price of nonagricultural exports     Yes  In fact, the only thing we really have to go on are the growth  projections in the major industrial countries, and there, at least in the past, our equations,     10/17-18/77 - 3 -         somewhat to my surprise, are somewhat more accurate  [Export] projections tend to be  somewhat more accurate and cyclically sensitive, especially for us, than on the import side, at  least as far as accuracy is concerned     Now, the other element which we try to factor in [in] the judgmental basis is the extent to  which demand may pick up in other countries, particularly in the case of the United States and  non-oil developing countries, where there has been a dramatic slowing and some very recent  picking-up of our exports, and that is a question mark  Now, I would not say that if we got a  boom, if I can call it that, in the non-oil developing countries, I would therefore then expect this  to be a much more optimistic outcome  Though I haven’t assumed the boom abroad in non-oil  LDCs, we have assumed some rebound, especially in the Latin American countries, from the low  rates of growth this last year     They didn’t grow very much, that’s right     Judging against the other industrial countries, our price competitiveness  has improved somewhat over the last two years by about 2 percent; and the decline of the dollar,  in this respect in dollar terms, would add another 2 percent  In the parlance of the day, that is a  real exchange rate depreciation  It is not within the realm of any significance, I think, in terms of  gross changes in these kinds of figures     Right  Did I answer your question, or did I not hear the second part?     And consumer price indexes, and wholesale price indexes for  manufacturers     Well, with respect to Japan and Germany, which are the only places  where you really get good price data, their export price data showed less of a rise than their  domestic price data     And ours show the same to a little bit more, right, in our unit value, and  then to the extent you use that [then we have less] deterioration with respect to those countries     Yes, I think that we have already [included] to the extent possible a fairly  heavy demand from Russia and the overstock here starting the first of October  They had come  in [unintelligible] and requested the upping of the ceiling to 15 million tons  Now, it is true that  no one has been able to confirm the orders for that amount  One of the reasons we have a pickup  in volume over the period is that we expect that it will [come from] some more demands from  Russia and from parts of western Europe, where the wetness at the time of the harvest has cut  into certain kinds of grain, and therefore we could stand a little bit more to gain--     I just don’t have the information to judge  I think the 15 million  probably is consistent  The piece that was in the paper, I think it was down to 205 million tons  during harvest--that was, in fact, what we were using as a basis for projecting     I think, on the first point, we tried to put together an estimate of how  much the recent or current trade restrictions by the US might affect imports, and I think an  optimistic number on the high side would be $1 billion, and probably the true number is  something more like $500 million     How much higher our imports would be in the absence of the kinds of  recent--over the last year or so--measures to restrict our imports     No we had not, we had not  We have enough trouble dealing with things  we think we know something about rather than that  To the extent you have this lower growth in  steel, for whatever reason, and that would not have been [unintelligible]  It is true that, over the  recent months, the growth has leveled off--particularly the Japanese  Whether they say it or not,  it seems clear from the data that Japanese steel exports to us have been very much held down,  and growth is coming from western Europe this year rather than from other countries  But we  have not factored in anything     No, no new measures     We have been assuming--and there’s some basis for it but not  much--[that it] will rise by 5 percent over the course of 1978  So it rises approximately from the  $1344 per barrel in the fourth quarter of this year to $1411 in the fourth quarter of next year   That is roughly in line with the rate of inflation--stays constant in real terms     The six big, the big six countries, Germany and--     We’ve used this trade weighted     No, I, it’s only a guess  Yours may be a judgment, mine’s a guess  I’ll  agree that you’re not going to see much--   "
583,1977-12-19,"  Right, Mr Chairman  As of this morning, since the last Committee  meeting, the change on our weighted average is 3-1/2 percent I think “more than 3 percent”  captures it  It might be more than that now  "
600,1978-01-05,"  Actually, if Mr Pardee is there, the Desk at New York probably--      Yes, sir  Mr Chairman, yesterday--      Well, as you know, Mr Chairman, since the early fall, the end of  September, there has been fairly continuous pressure on the dollar, bringing the dollar’s decline, on  a weighted-average basis--at least through today--to close to 10 percent  Much of that decline, as  you know, was against the Swiss franc, the yen, the British pound, and the mark The decline has  been general  Now, in the last several months, net intervention by foreign central banks has been  something over $12 billion       Over the entire year it was close to $35 billion       It was $6-1/2 billion in October, about $36 billion in November and  another $36 billion in December  That’s about $12 billion to $13 billion       It was $13-1/2 billion for the fourth quarter compared with $10 billion in  the third quarter; it was $4 billion and $6 billion in the first two quarters of the year       1/5/78 2 "
624,1978-01-17,"  [Statement--see Appendix]      Well, that of course is one of the uncertainties  So far, we’ve seen an   increase in official financing in the last three quarters or so  Certainly, one of the questions is if  such official financing does cease--or ceases to be on the same scale--will private financing be  available at an unchanged or a rising or falling exchange rate?  Looking at the capital account  transactions for the past and into the future, it does seem possible that such would be the case  But,  I don’t think we have any assurance that it will       Right  I tried to insert that--      Right, I agree      Agnosticism      Well, most of that improvement has come since the end of September, and   that’s a little too [recent]       1/17/78             2    Well, the standard results that the Board staff uses suggest that in general   you get a small response to the depreciation on the trade balance four quarters out  That would  suggest that you’d have to wait until close to the end of this year before you would get a positive  response, and you have an initial negative response, most of which would be occurring under the  normal pattern in the current quarter [to] the third quarter  The price adjustment is quite quick; the  quantity response is just more delayed and, therefore, the trade balance initially--       Right      No, one of the reasons why, compared with last month, the staff projection   shows a flattening out of the trade deficit--but only one of the reasons--is the depreciation of the  dollar that we have had over the last three or four months  But, on balance, that might subtract $1  or $2 billion from the trade deficit at the end of this year  Most of that [improvement], if it all came  and if history is any guide, would come in 1979       The trade aspects of the agreement itself--leaving aside the aggregate   demand aspects, which could be substantial if they’re successful, though one has some skepticism  [about that]--shouldn’t be too significant directly in an aggregate sense  For example, [the  Japanese] promised to reduce tariffs by 10 percent on $2 billion worth of imports  That’s all a  volume pass-through, and you’re talking about $200 million, which is not very much  On the other  hand, I think there’s probably more significance in the fact that there was an agreement--and some  foreign producers necessarily are going to hesitate, one would think--to push rapidly further  penetration of the US market over the next year because they have seen what can happen       The data that we have on that are first of all not very good to begin with   whenever we do get them, and second they’re in part delayed  The evidence that we have--a little  bit from the third quarter and for the first two months of the fourth quarter--suggests that in the  areas where we don’t have data, essentially trade, they will probably be negative in the fourth  quarter  We do have data on trade and bank-reported capital flows of security transactions, so  where we don’t have data on those kinds of transactions--corporate financial transactions--there are  reporting errors and omissions  Errors and omissions went negative in the third quarter and it     1/17/78             3  appears that they will probably also be negative in the fourth quarter, which suggests that they’ve  been running substantially positive--that there have been some [shifts in] leads and lags in pressure  on the dollar  But it’s [only] suggestive       Yes, that’s what I said      Well, the simplest way to explain it, I think, Mr Chairman, is this  If you   have an importer, for example, who has to make payment in foreign currency for something he has  imported and he thinks that the dollar is going to decline further, he accelerates that payment He  makes it today--borrowing dollars here maybe--rather than tomorrow  It’s for economic reasons   That’s a lead    "
649,1978-02-28,"  I think, Mr Chairman, that you=re right  Though in particular in the   German case, as Governor Wallich was commenting, I think the deceleration, if any, is       2/28/78           17  imperceptible relative to the United States  But for most of the weaker countries, there has been a  sharp deceleration in their rates of monetary expansion    "
688,1978-03-21,"  Mr Chairman, I think it should not be called a net limit  Everybody is   using “limit” as shorthand  It is not a net limit; it is a limit on the change in the open position  It’s  a measurement of the open position done exactly the way banks do it to measure their exposure   One should not, I think, confuse the gross limits that we are talking about in terms of these kinds of  transactions with the open position limit, which is a question of the System’s exposure  It’s a quite  different animal  I think that is essentially the point that you were trying to make, Governor  Wallich, of why it’s difficult to capture the points that you’re concerned about with respect to the     3/21/78              13  gross and at the same time trying to use the open position limit to control the System’s exposure in  transactions  Those are quite different animals       The Treasury doesn’t hold any foreign currency; it would be hard to   warehouse any      It was reinstituted the same time we were discussing this German balance   agreement  There has been a warehousing provision in the foreign currency authorization since  1963  When we cleaned up the authorization, although the power to warehouse remains in the  authorization, the explicit numbers associated with the warehousing were removed  And therefore,  at that time, in light of the sterling balances, an agreement was negotiated  Twelve months ago,  there was this exchange of letters, but it was not intended to be anything more than a confirmation  of what had been practiced now for 15 years     "
712,1978-04-18,"  Well, let’s see--about $90 million     4/18/78             4       It is a relatively small amount        I think we were talking about the whole $16 billion that was outstanding at  the time of the March announcements       Could I just make one point?       I’ll try not to be too defensive  One of the reasons why we made the  exchange rate forecast we did is that it is our belief that, for the market in general, expectations  about the trade balance are similar to some of the views around this table if not [more optimistic],  ie, a smaller deficit  Therefore, to the extent the forecast of the trade balance is accurate, then that  will force a very large division in expectations  The number, I think, is less important than the  view that this forecast is very different from what is expected and, therefore, we are likely to get  further pressure    "
804,1978-07-18,"  Well, in my understanding, the key word in that [communiqué] that was  circulated to you was “approximately”--25 billion barrels a day by approximately 1985  Now, 25  million barrels a day is a current estimate of what the full energy program will give you in terms of  savings  Of course, you also have to worry about where you would be otherwise, which is helpful   So it assumes the full 5-piece energy bill, which is consistent with this forecast   On the other  hand, it does have the word “approximately” in there  I gather--and all the press reports suggest  this--that although the President would very much like either to get his fifth piece or go to  something else he has a political problem in that area  And he’s not quite clear how he would bring  that about and has not asserted anything precisely in that area  But the reference in the  communiqué is broadly consistent with what we have  So it could be consistent conceivably at its  lower bounds with the absence of the COET, which I guess will give you a little bit of help on  inflation  But it’s not intended to be [unintelligible]      "
829,1978-08-15,"  The Treasury is doing it for their own purposes       We think it could be as much as 38       That's right, I think, Mr Chairman       Mr Chairman, I’d note as a matter of fact to Chuck that the Japanese  already are doing that type of import program       I just didn't want others to be misled, thinking that the Japanese weren't  when they in fact are       These are eurodollar borrowings--borrowings by banks from the  eurodollar market    "
881,1978-10-17,"  In fact, Alan, I think it's possible that the way it would be worked out  technically is that the interest rate differential might end up accruing to the ESF  So that in fact  would improve its position because of the technical way it would be arranged to be handled  [unintelligible] forward       Well, I did, but it may have been so parenthetical that it wasn't entirely  clear  I keyed off from the third quarter to try to keep it in that framework  Our best guess is that  you've had through the third quarter of this year about 3-3/4 percent--or 3-1/2 to 4 if you want to  use the range--real growth abroad  We expect that to continue; we don't expect an acceleration, on  average, abroad but we expect a continuation from the very low levels that we had going into this  year on the growth side  Meanwhile, our growth has come down somewhat so you get the  convergence--in fact a crossing in that dimension  I would say, though, that you don't get enough  of a convergence; it’s not going back to the historical relationship where the growth abroad  averaged maybe 2 percentage points higher than the growth in the United States      On the price side, which I covered in the first chart, the dotted lines there [show] the relative  CPIs  The fact is that this year--or again the year ending in the third quarter--there’s been quite a  difference  On average we estimate that ending in the third quarter you’ve had about a 5-3/4  percent annual rate of price increase abroad in these ten major countries, as contrasted with 7-3/4  percent in the same period for the United States  It’s a difference of approximately 2 percentage  points  Next year you see that the red line continues down but at a lower slope  That reflects the  fact that although our inflation performance is about the same, at least on average--slightly lower  on this third quarter-to-third quarter basis--the inflation rate abroad is expected to come up       10/17/78 12             somewhat, to something in the 6-1/2 percent range  That's because of the UK and Japan,  primarily  What I've tried to suggest by way of convergence is that there is a gradual convergence   The growth rates seem to be crossing and [the spread between] inflation rates seems to be  narrowing  If the markets in fact are looking for a restoration of slower inflation here than abroad,  then the tunnel is longer--if I can put it that way--than [by] 1979       Well, there's a long and technical debate about that and we have in the  October Bulletin an article coming out on that subject  As far as the United States is concerned, the  various measures show approximately the same thing  One of the problems [relates to] unit labor  costs and export unit values  For unit labor costs, we only have data through the first quarter of this  year; for export prices we only have data through the second quarter of the year  So it gets a little  difficult to compare  But, on average, the story that is told by the various price indexes for the  United States is the same  So wholesale prices of manufacturers, for example, show instead of  approximately a 15 percent real change in the exchange rate something like a 14 percent real  change in the exchange rate  For the United States it doesn't essentially make much difference  An  aside--the monetarists, if I may put it that way, would argue the CPI is exactly what should be used,  not traded good prices       It's a little bit sad to count [on]  I think you're right [about] the oil, and  there are other dollar-denominated international commodities  The fact that the dollar has gone  down has made them cheaper in foreign currencies, especially in Japan but in the UK and a  number of other countries as well, and has helped their performance this past year  And our  forecast of some pickup in inflation abroad is in part dependent upon the fact that we also are  assuming or projecting--choose your own word--that the dollar will stabilize  That means they will  lose that positive benefit       Yes  On this round we have not done that  We have in the past on some  similar things--essentially the impact of oil price increases on foreign prices [or] inflation rates and  they are, of course, significant    "
929,1978-12-19,"  Well, I think it’s fair to say there’s a possibility it might improve, but the  consensus of the staff here was that the dollar would be about where it was--and in fact the  Greenbook was written in the early part of last week       Before this, so that suggests that there would be some improvement  certainly from current levels  In fact, as far as the staff when we do this forecasting, it’s sometimes  helpful to use a number rather than words as we do in the Greenbook  So that tends to include a  range of plus or minus 2 percent  Again, I think the consensus, for what it’s worth, is that there  would be some improvement--maybe even a 4 to 5 percent improvement from where we are today       Well, you reminded me of something that I didn’t say  The other thing  we had not included was the OPEC price rise  For the year as a whole, that has very little effect  compared to what we’ve been assuming before  We’ve estimated now maybe 3/4 of a billion  dollars for the year as a whole  However, it adds to the current account deficit of the United States,  we would think, about $2 billion at the end of 1979  That means that the pattern we’ll have  throughout the year is going to be that we may have some sort of initial improvement and then it’s  going to be flatter than we expected  And, in terms of what Scott was just mentioning, that does     12/19/78          3    not suggest that you are going to have the kind of dramatic improvement that was embodied in the  Greenbook forecast  Now, as far as the impact on the United States versus the rest of the world, the  fact is that our oil bill per se is approximately twice as large as that of any other country         No, not relative to the GNP, but in terms of the oil bill  So the figures-- that $2 billion is the largest number that’s around  While it is true that we have a lower dependence  on imported oil than Japan or Germany, we have a large overall oil bill and, therefore, any increase  will add to the psychologically important [dollar amounts]    "
1000,1979-04-17," Mr Chairman, it would be the currencies that  the Desk is now authorized to hold, ie the currencies of our swap  partners   CHAIRMFLN MILLER They are all listed here It’s a limited  list of about 10 or 12--    It‘s [14]    I'm not saying we'd hold them all but--  "
1045,1979-05-22," The improved balance of payments position does  give us encouragement, as Gretchen has pointed out But our feeling  is that we probably have some ways to go The United States current  account position still is in deficit in a world where Japan, Germany,  and Switzerland still have--[though it's1 less substantial--a surplus  So the feeling is that under current conditions we probably need a  surplus to be out of the woods That's the first point The second  point is that we need the exchange rate adjustment to be maintained in  order to get us there As you know, our staff forecast does show a  current account surplus beginning in the first half of 1980  [Another] point though, as Gretchen mentioned, is that inflation rates  have come up abroad on average Taking a longer-term perspective and  putting that together with our forecast, inflation rates abroad are  still below ours on average and are expected to be below ours over the  forecast period In those conditions a stable dollar in nominal terms  will in fact mean some real appreciation So too much more of that  would tend to make the market think we would not quite get there in  terms of adjustment For what it's worth, the forecast for the dollar  as [implied by] the forward rate would suggest a 1 to 2 percent  depreciation over the next year or so So we are in some sense more  optimistic than that reading of the market    Where in fact the price of the local currency  has gone up much more [than the dollar]    I was going to answer that in part, President  Mayo The forecast went to bed a little over ten days ago or so, and  in the Greenbook we had forecast a fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter  increase of 23-1/2 percent on the OPEC market for crude adjusted,  compared with a little under 21 percent in the previous [Greenbook]  The announcements have come out since the Greenbook forecast was  finalized, so essentially [what has happened] in the last week would  add another 1 percent [or maybe a little less] to that    Well, to the extent that we've kept track of the  increase in the surcharge, which we've tried to do, [that is our  estimate]  "
1064,1979-06-27," Yes, they were just released at 230 pm For those who did not see  them, the census basis monthly trade deficit for May was reported at around $25 billion as  compared with $22 billion, rounded, for April The two months together show a deficit of about  $28 billion at an annual rate as compared with the first-quarter rate of $21 billion That is in  contrast with some of the other evidence that the trade balance is moving a bit in the other  direction Nevertheless, as for the outlook--given what Jerry has said--we would expect an  improvement to resume    No, they have not They’ve gone into special session  "
1088,1979-07-11," Well, I think 1 agree that the first impression  of the market, if you didn‘t adjust [the M1 range], would be negative  and that could lead to [unintelligible] basically because they‘re  looking for what comes across the ticker first    Mr Chairman, in preparation for the meeting, I  checked with the Treasury Department on two points One was whether     7 / 1 1 \ 7 9  -53-   they had been approached to increase their swap line They have not  been approached,   in a conversation  down there Their reaction on the question of whether there is  political interest--and I only checked with Treasury--was that there  probably would be some political interest on this side but it’s not  clear at the moment whether this is the right time to put it in the  pot So their advice was to hold off, to indicate that even if there  was positive sentiment on the Committee we might not make a final  decision today    The Treasury was not pushing us I asked the  political questions since they’re a little closer to those I did not  check with the State Department on this case  "
1158,1979-08-14," Mr Chairman, that's what we had thought Something would go into the Policy Record In the past, there has usually been a sentence of explanation I would think, without having heard the Committee's discussion, that it would say something about at the request of the Bank of Mexico and in light of expanding financial relations--that side of it   Mr Chairman, just to clarify one point Under normal procedures we would make an announcement of the increase right away, or within a couple of days, once it is worked out with the Mexicans That announcement would say nothing about the vote The vote would come out in the Policy Record, which would be published in mid-September I might say that's right before the [two] Presidents meet The vote would come out then   We would like to believe that the net export projection is slightly more firmly held than the inventory projection The facts may not be so right It is true in the net exports area that we are now dealing with a $600 billion total--and it's made up of factors which move in very different directions and have different futures--so that the range of error on the net export projection can be quite large if we look out as long as six quarters I'm pretty comfortable, though, with this projection as it now stands The oil situation is rather straightforward, based on the assumptions that we have And the question might be how responsive imports will be to slow growth in the United States We have put in a fairly modest downturn in real imports in connection with this; it could in fact be larger On the export side, things look fairly good--carrying through to the middle of next year--as long as growth is reasonable, given the recent growth in major industrial countries The question I think [arises] in the latter part of 1980, when we do expect a considerable slowdown; if that is more [severe], then clearly exports will fall off less In terms of the global numbers, the one area of particular uncertainty has to do with service income, which gets fed into these projections There has been a dramatic increase in service income in the last quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year We basically have not extrapolated that increase but we have a further modest buildup from the current level Now, we have been fooled by statistical flukes in those series, so the numbers could be off, but in the basic merchandise trade area, I'm pretty comfortable [with our projection] I would say that the swing in nominal terms that we have here is much less than that in so-called real terms It's an area of strength but not a great deal of strength "
1187,1979-09-18," We also have [for] the third quarter an increase  in the import prices--because of the oil price increase--which has a  depressing effect on the measured GNP deflator in the third quarter  so some of the third quarter ""lowness,"" if I might put it that way, is  in the deflator itself; we don't see so much in the fixed weight, PCE  measure  "
1200,1979-10-05," Since the last meeting of the Committee, we have  two pieces of information on the external side One was the August  trade data, which came in somewhat better than the staff had  anticipated the other was the full data on the second-quarter current  account transactions, which showed higher net service receipts than we  had anticipated This has led us to adjust our outlook somewhat in a  positive direction but not dramatically The dollar is down about 2  percent on average since the Committee meeting and down about the same  against the mark This week, however, the weighted average value of  the dollar has risen about 3/4 percent and again about the same  against the mark The chief impetus to the dollar's appreciation has  been the developing expectations among market agents that a new series  of measures to support the dollar's value would be announced during or  after this week's meetings in Belgrade The price of gold, as you may  know, has moved quite erratically--particularly this week It rose to  a high of $448 per ounce in New York but this morning it was fixed in  London--the first fix--at $36750 Rumors of stepped up official  sales of gold in the future have been one of the factors contributing  to the break in the price  "
1266,1979-11-20," [Statement--see Appendix]    We are assuming that some of it has already  been taken and essentially that we're going to get a 20 percent  increase in December    That's for oil imports Our actual oil import  prices are reflecting the higher spot prices that are now occurring  and there will be a convergence--spot prices will come down So we're  getting in the oil import prices in this quarter, as we had even last  quarter, essentially the anticipation of the oil price increase  reflected in the spot market    This last quarter we have a $23/bsrrel  assumption for the import price But that's very much higher than the  official posted prices, let me say, of the OPEC countries even with  the increase that they've had, because of spot--    Well, the price goes up at about a 10 percent  annual rate after the first part of the year    We're assuming 20 percent    It would be minus about $15 billion    The improvement between the two years, rather  than being $14 billion, is approximately $8 billion So you still  have the significant improvement in the level no matter which way you  calculate it   M R   KICHLINE [Statement--see Appendix]   M R   COLDWELL Jim, suppose your presumption is incorrect--  that both you and Ted have misgauged [the oil price outlookl--and the  OPEC price goes up something like 40 percent     11/20/79 -8 -     Yes We have marked it down quite remarkably  We essentially have real growth over the next four quarters of 1-1/2  percent, which is slow growth Only in one of the major countries do  we have what we call a recession, or negative growth But we have  [economic activity in] all the major countries dropping down--  essentially growing at half the rate over the next four quarters that     11/20/79 -9-   they had over the previous four quarters And the last four quarters  have been affected to some extent by the oil prices in 1979 So we  have a sluggish outlook abroad And the improvement in the current  account or the trade balance is very small in terms of volume I  don’t think there is much increase in the volume of exports from here  on in But the fact is--if I may put it this way--that if our prices  are going to go up 10 percent, that means we’re going to get something  like a 12 or 13 percent increase in the value of exports at a time  when the value of our imports stagnates That’s where we get the  improvement in the--    Well, that was some time ago A forecast of 3  percent was reasonable at the beginning of the year    It is at the point at which it may be somewhat  arbitrary [whether we call it a small positive or small negative]  Sluggish growth is the way I’d say it   M S   TEETERS So the possibility does exist that we could  get a worldwide recession?    Yes, and if you add in the United States with  our forecasts--[unintelligible] others which are less pessimistic, let  me put it that way--growth for the QECD area, including the United  States, is about zero It’s minus 1-112 percent here and plus 1-1/2  percent there; and we’re about half or 40 percent of the total, so  it’s essentially zero    Well, in the rest of the world, other major  industrial countries--with the exception of the oil crisis--have not  had recessions in the postwar period They‘ve had growth recessions,  but they’ve not had negative growth or recessions S o  there is really  no comparable experience with the exception of the United Kingdom    Henry, let me correct you on that Our  forecasts are lower than the OECD forecasts in large part because they  essentially were dealing with our old oil price assumption of no  increase in the real price of oil in 1980 So we have a very  different outlook Their forecast is close to 2 percent for the same  G-10 countries, whereas ours is close to 1-112 percent     11 / 2 0 / 7 9 -10-    True, but I would comment that within the US  government, for example, people are only now in the process of  focusing on the implications of the [outlook for] oil prices And I  think the same is true for most other countries’ forecasts; they have  not looked at their official forecasts since July They‘re now  looking at them and when they finish, I think they will end up with a  much more bearish picture than they had a few weeks ago That’s  somewhat of a hypothesis but I think that‘s what is happening It’s  fair to say that that is the process that we went through over the  last four weeks    Yes But the point is, as Jim explained, some  prices move with imported oil and some prices move partially with  imported oil, and one has to add all those things up  "
1295,1980-01-08," It was a story that came out yesterday afternoon, I think, when you were probably still on the plane, Scott And the Desk reported at that time, although it was on the ticker in the morning yesterday, that there had been no effect on the market The nature of the story, as I heard it, was that some Arabian official had said that eventually they probably would have to go to [a basket of currencies] or something along those lines, which would suggest a change in the Saudi's position on that particular issue But it is probably fair to say that they have been talking about it for so long that it has been fairly well discounted Even the psychological effect, in terms of diversification, may not have been a factor in the market yesterday, according to the Desk   That's the story we got yesterday We've heard that before   We volunteered to delete it in this case   To answer Chuck's question When this lender of last resort issue was being discussed 5 years ago there were some items, especially with regard to consortia banks, that were left fuzzy Governor Wallich's notes are more explicit on the fuzzy part but because of the fuzziness there may be some disagreement [It conveys more] than the public knows; they sense it but they don't know it That and the fact that views are directly attributed in those notes is the reason we felt it was wise and consistent with previous procedures to delete it "
1323,1980-02-04, The Swiss have just a point or two 
1386,1980-04-22," Well, the dollar has had some ups and downs However, for the last 18 months, or in fact since shortly after the November 1st program, the dollar on average has not moved It has moved in a band of about 5 percentage points on average and our projections have been more or less within that same range As far as your second question is concerned, about whether that's the best we can do, my feeling and the staff's feeling is that there are a number of conflicting forces at the moment On the one hand, we have the prospect of interest rates coming down; that's something that the market looks at very closely, in part because that's the cost of money That's a different phenomenon than the monetary aggregate targets, which are a function of what is going to happen to inflation and the economy over a longer term I would differ with Scott in that I think the market believes and has appreciated the fact that our trade and current account positions are relatively good and will continue to be relatively good, partly because of what our domestic projection is, and that should tend to give some strength to the dollar So, it's really those two conflicting forces that lead us in some sense to a projection that the dollar will remain in the range it has been for the last year or so As far as the technical side of the projection is concerned, we did in fact raise it from 885 to 90, but that's a relatively small difference It's in the same range where it has been for the last 18 months or more   Well, as we said in the presentation to the Committee in February, it's not clear how the international credit problems will impact on the dollar per se or on the US economy There is a feedback between the policies that are adopted by other major oil importing countries in this framework [in terms of their effect] on the dollar and the international credit situation So, if Japan and Germany and the United States, for example, decide that they    4/22/80  do not want to sustain the kinds of current account deficits that everybody seems to be projecting at least for this year and next year, then we could have problems It's not clear how it would impact on the dollar, but the impact on banks and the financial system could be quite severe   Yes, exports of coins were something over $2 billion at an annual rate in January and February   Well, we don't have volume figures for it; and in fact, we never will That is one of the problems in putting together the first-quarter GNP numbers The price increase clearly is some of it, as well as other random factors in terms of when the exports actually take place But the two together, and they will never be unscrambled in the statistics, gave us a big increase in the fourth quarter   It so happens that we had a lot of silver exports and that they were very high priced in that period, which results in a big increase in nonagricultural exports in that period I don't think it goes beyond that The price has since come down, so even if we have a normal level of exports, we are going to get lower nonagricultural exports   That's how it's recorded on the statistics; that's the only information I have   And 5 percent productivity [growth] "

1498,1980-07-09," Not until September of next year   Yes   Treasury balances are $2+ billion in marks, not including their swap balances, and $12 billion in Swiss francs   In the swaps? They've only used about $1 billion, so we have about $6 billion left   Governor Teeters, of the $30 billion, we have $20 billion worth of resources [in] notes [and] currencies now available And there's a net plus, in some sense, in the unused portion of the $10 billion Carter notes, which in round numbers is $4 billion That's the answer, I think, to the question you asked   A year from September only one comes due and there's another one [due] in December I think the total amount is about $15 billion   I think President Solomon overstated the figures somewhat If you correct for both sides, as both the inflows and the outflows are counted on that basis, the difference is about $15 billion   Yes Last year, in fact, the adjustment on the reinvested earnings was $145 billion or something like that   I'd make several points We are definitely assuming that [other countries] will have a slowdown [We expect real GNP] growth to go from approximately 4 percent in the last two years, 1978 and 1979, to 1 percent To some extent zero is an artificial number in this context; indeed, the same forces will be operating on them, including higher energy prices On the other hand, as shown in the second [international] chart called ""Activity Ratio,"" they also didn't expand as rapidly, so they in some sense are in a less strongly pronounced cyclical position than we are As I said, for two of the countries we are expecting what one would classify as a recession this year Those basically are the answers I would give you  As far as exporting our recession, clearly [our economic performance] has some impact on them but it's easy to exaggerate that effect these days We are [relatively] less important in the world economy In fact, we now account for under 20 percent of world trade whereas a number of years ago we were a third of world trade There's less feedback effect on the rest of the world, with probably two important exceptions One is Canada, which had negative growth in the first quarter--2 percent at an annual rate And their statistics are looking just like ours, with housing starts falling out of bed and so forth and so on There's Japan, too The automobile situation suggests--[unintelligible] other factors determining it--that there may be a little less of an impact on Japan than one would normally expect because of the continued demand for small cars   Yes, but we may be going through the same phenomena I've asked the staff about that We're worried about that with a nine-month lag, right? In general, we've been forecasting a slowdown in every [Greenbook] and we haven't seen it yet in the numbers After real growth in the first quarter on the order of 3 percent, depending on how you cut the numbers--which is a healthy annual rate--we estimate that the G-10 countries will get something like 1 percent growth for the year That means growth is going to have be something very close to zero on average [over the final three quarters] "
1630,1980-11-18," I am not sure about our trading partners per se The market in general tends to have a somewhat smaller [estimate of our] current account surplus in 1981 than we do The OECD has a forecast for our current account surplus for 1981 in the $12 billion range as compared with the staff's $18 billion Now, I would consider those in the same ball park, but we tend to be a little higher than the consensus that I am aware of   We have yen and Swiss francs, too, at the moment   We wouldn't get the capital inflow without the intervention I agree with your point, but the capital inflow is facilitated by--   That's because the official intervention is the outflow counterpart to the private inflow   If you believe--and some people do and some people don't--that the forward interest rate is the expected future spot rate and has something to do with purchasing power parity, as Governor Wallich mentioned, and things like the longer-term outlook for a country's current account and so forth, then the fact that the forward rate has moved over this period could be interpreted as suggesting that expectations of inflation in the United States [relative to abroad] have moved up over this period That would be one story I am not sure, personally, whether one would want to put a lot of weight on that particular story But that is a possible and plausible interpretation of why there was an increase in the divergence between the spot and [forward rates]   There hasn't been any objection on the House side to date There was just one question   Yes The Treasury staff talked to people on the House side and they have not stirred up any objection   The Swiss don't have a range and the French don't have a range   There was a year in between when they didn't try at all "
1712,1980-12-18," Not necessarily, unless you want it, Mr Chairman Do you want to do this before we do the regular report?   No, the limit is $5 billion and they are up to $3 billion   Yes   Yes   They appear on our balance sheet as our holdings, but there is an off-balance sheet item which is a forward sale of the foreign currencies back to the Treasury   We get the yield for whatever rate is in the swap agreement   Yes, I suppose   Well, it depends on what [form] they are in They are in a double-swap, double-forward so that they are earning about 7-1/2 percent now, or something like that, versus Treasury securities   Well, it does affect our profits but as against the alternative of the Treasury holding them, it all washes out   Yes, [unintelligible] are up against the limit at present   Oh yes, they have said so every time   The policy record shows the change in the limits, and the System's annual statement at least indicates the amount that is warehoused as well as the sum of the holdings that are covered by these forward transactions   Well, plus what they could hold outright on their own   We have provided to the Committee--it's in the pile in front of you--an update of Table 1 from the paper we had circulated As Scott just said, the [Federal Reserve] System has $14 billion in German marks, as shown in the first line, and a total [of all currencies] of $21 billion The Treasury has a total of $88 billion, of which $57 billion is in DM, which covers their Carter note issues [with an excess of] about $500 million The grand total is almost $11 billion One could in principle set off against the DM holdings or all the holdings the fact that some of these funds were raised, in addition to [sales of] Carter note issues, through sales of SDRs and drawings on the Fund They gave up those assets in return for DM and we haven't reconstituted those holdings in either form That would show, at least as far as marks are concerned, that the Treasury and the United States would be somewhat negative, by about $1 billion, as shown in the bottom line of the first column And the net comes out approximately at zero on that basis I'd be glad to answer any questions   Well, they can't repay the IMF because it was a reserve [tranche] drawing And the way rules go, that is never repaid    12/18-19/80  except in the form of further dollar drawings Not only is there no obligation, there is no possibility of repaying to reduce your [unintelligible], increase your [unintelligible]   [The reserve tranches] are set up that way But on the SDR sales, they could do it, and it has been talked about from time to time I'm sure President Solomon can tell you about taking some marks or some of these other currencies and buying SDRs from a country We talked in the spring about buying back some of the SDRs we had sold to the Japanese, for example, when they were going through that phase   That has to do with the relationship between the Treasury's general fund and the Exchange Stabilization Fund The general fund drew from the IMF and sold the currencies to the Exchange Stabilization Fund; [the latter has incurred as] a counter-entry a liability to the general fund And [to the extent] that gets repaid, that in fact marks up the balance sheet of the ESF That's one of the reasons it's so big now   As other countries draw dollars out of the fund, that calls on the credit line of the Treasury [for] advances of funds And on an annual basis, they settle up with the ESF At that point, the Treasury has to provide dollars to the Exchange Stabilization Fund So that's one of the contingent liabilities that the ESF still has   Oh yes, that is the point Because we drew in super-gold tranches--or what used to be called super-gold tranches-- that is why we don't have to repay   It's all called the reserve tranche now Gold, as you know, was downgraded in the Articles  SPEAKER(?) Its price went up   It's all called the reserve tranche now   Well, what used to be called the gold tranche and the super-gold tranche are both called the reserve tranche   No, no    12/18-19/80   Let me try to explain it In the authorization the limit on the open position in principle is symmetric, so we could be so much in debt or hold so much in the way of balances That's what the authorization limits And the procedural instructions govern how much that can change between meetings or certain time periods as we move up to that overall limit that is set in the authorization by the Committee   No, I haven't gotten to the informal limit What I referred to in the paper as informal limits are limits that have been established within the authorization, within this overall limit which is now $8 billion, to govern in particular our holdings of balances But they have been updated and codified on the basis of understandings rather than votes because in some sense--   This Committee by consensus The Committee did it at its last meeting and the meeting before that   The logic is that you had a formal vote on the overall limit [specified in the authorization]   They are in the paper   Yes   Well, it's on table 5; the peak was about $8-1/2 billion, and for--   It's on table 5 in the paper About two years ago in December, we were at $8-1/2 billion--that was cumulative intervention--and that was simply all debt, although some of it was financed by Carter notes   It's [column] five   No, minuses are buying and pluses are sales   No, I'm sorry, it's $58 billion Excuse me, I was reading the wrong column There is nothing like being helpful! The peak was $58 billion   Now, the $84 billion was last October So it's $84 and $58--   Well, that analysis is based on the assumption that the forward rate does not move; then anything can happen As we've sketched out in the paper, depending on where the change comes from, if there's a shift in the market's sentiment in favor of the dollar, if anything that'll tend to push the exchange rate up and we would see, absent anything else, interest rates [come] down If we intervene under those circumstances, [unintelligible] can sterilize intervention both here and abroad, and let the forward rate move around, if anything interest rates would be higher than they otherwise would be because some of the pressure that would come from that demand for dollar-denominated assets would be taken out of the market by supplying them     Well, there are two dimensions of the SDR Thinking of SDR in terms of diversification, one could invest, rather than just in DM, in SDR deposits denominated in marks That is the diversified investment We could run those up and run those down, and the effect would be a form of multicurrency intervention We could buy DM or we could go to the market and convert those DM into a SDR denominated deposit and we would then cover some of our exchange risks We may worry about the investment side of things after--   True   That was written in the old memo that was attached [to the current one] That was in the period right after the Carter notes issue There were stories in the market that the United States was building up foreign currency reserves and that was being seen as a signal at that time of weakness in the general movement to a multi-currency reserve system   Yes, even we were diversifying We were getting that from the market That was a reflection of that   Well, we've gone down that road and that [view] probably was going on But it doesn't deny, once you go down that road, that the argument that building a war chest might add to [unintelligible] isn't valid But the signal we were giving in that period is, I think, itself probably--   Mr Chairman, if you want a suggestion, it is a little hard on the Desk to have all these individual currency limits One approach might be to do away with them and add things up a little differently You could add $1 billion or whatever you wanted and deal with an overall limit as to what the understandings are about and what's available in diversification That might simplify the accounting in New York I don't know whether that's right or wrong   $8 billion   Yes, I would assume so You would raise the total from $2 billion to $3 billion and then the DM limit would be going from $1-1/2 billion to $2-1/2 billion  -23-    12/18-19/80   For the United States   The reason for the yen being separate, as was explained in the paper, was that the last time around on this, in 1979, we were contemplating buying a lot of yen to help the Japanese It turned out that we didn't do that But [the yen limit] was set up outside [the total informal limit] at that time   We could do that, but then the limit is pretty tight on yen if you ever want to buy any more because you have this, in effect, limit of $500 million [on other currencies]   No   The $5 billion rough order of magnitude originally came from the amount of Carter notes that they have outstanding In fact, [the Treasury] wanted more than that The notion was that as they reconstituted those DM, which they can't absorb into the ESF, they would warehouse them So that's how we got to the $5 billion that exists now Other kinds of claims, as the Chairman said, happened in the past--like claims on the ESF where they might want to help out a country or something like that through their own lending They might not--   Well, it's all in the public--   It is in the public record in those terms, relating to warehousing on the one hand to help out the ESF in general when it gets into emergency situations And the $5 billion limit is related loosely to that but explicitly to the Treasury's obligations   There's $2 billion left   They do hold quite a lot of DM for their own account, obviously They have, for whatever [reason], balances of $88 billion of which-- "
1741,1981-02-02," Well, the thought there is what was referred to as ""a perverse elasticity"" The work that we've done on that suggests that there is not That was something that was looked at as we were redefining the aggregates to see whether there was a sufficiently perverse elasticity It's possible that there is some, but that has not been found yet   The average is $38   Right Most of it we get, as I said, in the first part of the year So, we will be essentially at that point by midyear   They didn't say that in advance   They probably still have about 2 million foreign workers in Germany, the more permanent ones  -147-    2/2-3/81   Around that or somewhat less than that The peak in these numbers that I have here was 2-1/2 million in '73 "
1787,1981-03-31," Generally in the past--   Yes Generally in the past, until after the early 1970s, the Treasury didn't have substantial balances of its own So, most of the intervention was for the Federal Reserve account exclusively, both in terms of building up very tiny balances and in terms of all drawings on the swap lines   Well, the study was actually done in connection with the special System objectives for the calendar year 1979 [The intent] was to encourage economists within the System to look again at the floating exchange rate regime and how it had been functioning Although there was some talk of encouraging staffs at the various Banks and the Board to identify a broad range of issues, there wasn't an attempt, as is often true in such a case, to arrive at a single conclusion The result was that a large numbers of papers--I think numbering in the 40s--were prepared by various people, and they were summarized in the paper that was circulated to you earlier this year One important section of that paper, in this context, had to do with the question of exchange rate determination I would argue from an economic point of view that one has to resolve that issue in one's mind before one resolves questions about the effectiveness of intervention I think it's fair to say, based on the paper--and in fact the concluding section says this--that the jury is still out in the sense that it is not entirely clear in purely economic terms what the effectiveness of intervention would be You will find, though, among economists within the System, that both views are supported And there are lengthy articulations of what assumptions they make about the substitutability of assets denominated in different currencies The paper was put together by Jeff Shafer and Joanna Gray and Mike Keran and was in a form a little different than often is done; it was issued subsequently as a discussion paper by the Board staff But it might be instructive In fact, one of the reasons why we put together the paper was that it did present a reasonable review or survey on these topics without trying to come to a detailed conclusion   Mr Chairman, before the actions in January, there were some suggestions--   Well, part of the changes are just a cleaning up The one issue that the Committee might want to discuss is the question you have asked the staff to address of whether we should now incorporate the informal limits on System [foreign currency] balances into the formal instruments We looked at the question and we suggested a way in which that could be done, but we also suggested that, on balance, we didn't think it was a good idea Therefore, we recommended that any formal limit with respect to the System's overall open position be the limit that now exists And in that connection, we suggested as a technical adjustment that the two numbers that now  -6-    3/31/81  appear in the authorization--one number is a footnote and one number is in the text, with the one [in the footnote] being eight times the size of the other--be combined to one number in the text and that the footnote be dropped Assuming the Committee accepts the proposition that the informal limits be retained, we suggested that we might be able to simplify the presentation of those informal limits so that there's one overall number with three subnumbers rather than the--   The memorandum from the Secretary is dated March 24th The first recommendation, on the first page, is that the formal limit on the overall open position be encompassed in the limit [noted in the text] The second recommendation, on page 2, is that the number be moved from the footnote to the text Those are the substantive recommendations   But it's in a footnote, and the number in the text is $1 billion   That's earth-shaking, I know!   It's $32 billion as I remember   Right But the substantive proposal with respect to your charge to the staff was not to incorporate the informal limits into the formal documents That may require a positive decision, too, or a negative decision   Yes   They don't appear anywhere; that's the issue that we addressed They appear in the notes or the records of the Desk [and the Secretariat], which I think is the proper way to do it, after having listened to the informed discussion of the Committee   That is listed on page 3 of the memorandum We would suggest that the informal limit, as the Desk has it, be set at $4-1/4 billion, with sublimits of up to $2-3/4 billion in marks, $1 billion in yen, and $1/2 billion in all other currencies That would just mean that subsequently, if the Committee in its discussion said that it wanted to raise those informal limits, any time it raised one of the three components that would automatically raise the total It would save some time; it's a somewhat simplified procedure   Yes, they are part of the basic recommendation   It is an alternative, which we do not recommend   The authorization   Right   That is the number that is now published Both the $1 billion in the text and the $8 billion in the footnote are now published So, nothing is changed   It was raised, I think, by $2 or $3 billion in December of 1978 and that limit has been there ever since We never got there, but we came close   No   The reason for the proposal that that language be deleted is that when this document was last thoroughly overhauled, there was an express authorization with respect to the old Swiss franc debt And the express authorization said to treat that debt, which was part of the open position, outside of the $1 billion limit That was the reason for the language that we now suggest be deleted It's not that we're trying to reduce your flexibility   Well, in December of '78, [our open position] went up to $5-1/2 billion at the end of year   I think it had previously been $5 billion and it was raised by enough so that, during that environment, the Committee wouldn't have to adjust it every three weeks   Well, in effect, yes, we've been doing it that way That was the source of the confusion during the discussion in December, though, and that's why we suggested that we change it this way The only thing that has been changed recently has been the mark total But since we had an overall limit, every time $1/2 billion or  -10-    3/31/81  $1 billion was added to the mark total we had to push everything else up, especially since we were holding, and still are holding, about $250 million worth of all the other currencies   Right, but it would be separately--   As Gretchen said, in marks we have $2566 million, or almost $26 billion We have $399 million of yen, and $260 million of everything else   No, it's $257 million or something like that of Swiss francs and the rest of it is--   We, the United States, do; we, the System, do not   The United States has $13 billion It's $14 billion, using the historical rates, of which we have $250 million   Actually, my figures are absent the $744 million we sold yesterday My figures don't include that   Right, in paragraph 3 Paragraph 5 deals with the fact that we now have a broader range of things that we invest in Paragraph 6 reflects the fact that we no longer send out a daily call to the members of the Subcommittee To reduce paperwork some time ago we combined that with the 230 call that goes to all members of the Committee along with the Manager's regular reports   We have had this agreement, the current one, formally since January 1977 The limit on warehousing foreign currencies for the Treasury and the Exchange Stabilization Fund is now $5 billion The total that is now in use under that arrangement is a little over $4 billion The Treasury would just as soon renew the authority They may well be using some of those balances over the  -12-    3/31/81  course of the next year to repay some of the Carter notes that come due over the period   No change "
1852,1981-05-18," I think that's right That's the way the procedures have worked in the past in the long run   [We look at the pressures] on both sides When the Italian swap line was raised to $2 billion in '74, if I remember correctly, it was largely to help them out under the circumstances In fact, as I remember, they made some drawings And the Mexicans have also been a case where they wanted an increase to show, as the Swedes did last year, solidarity   The British and the Italians and the Mexicans are cases where the shoe has been on the other foot "
1889,1981-07-06," Yes, from the average of the second quarter It's a decline of 4 percent from where we are now   It depends on what you define as a collapse The dollar today is 109 on this weighted average we use We have it at the end of next year at 100 Is a 9 percent decline a collapse or not? That is the first proposition, the trade weighted dollar The second proposition, after this correction, is that when we try to run it out and see what happens beyond 1982, the current account deficit essentially stabilizes at the $25 to $30 billion dollar range That's not $50 billion but it is a very large deficit But it does stabilize under that scenario; it doesn't get worse Those, I think, are consistent with the kinds of numbers that President Solomon was describing It is describing a process, though perhaps not as far as others might think it would go If the dollar moves [down] sooner, then we are not going to get quite as large a deficit, but we might have more--   Probably something like that   A 20 percent decline would take it into the 190s   First, Carter bonds are due at the end of this month And the answer to the second question is that we have about $58 billion over and above the Carter bonds   Not all of it We have $58 billion over and above the Carter bonds, $36 billion of which is in DM That's it "
1954,1981-10-05," No, they are not an Article VIII country; they are not part of the consultation in the EMS and they're not part of the VIII group So that's their distinctive--   They're not Article VIII   That's right And is not a convertible currency in that sense   Well, they haven't given up the right to have [exchange controls]   Some of which are [now] Article VIII countries, like whom we turned down in '67 solely on that ground There are also who might think that they were on the right side   Primarily on the Article VIII grounds of 1967; but subsequently they've become part of our [unintelligible] article "
1979,1981-11-17," The change was made last year for all the cases where we would draw at the foreign rate When we did it for the Germans, we did it for all of them The problem was that not all the countries were ready to come forward with a rate at that time, so the swaps for those cases were rewritten to say ""an appropriate domestic rate"" which in our case--   Well, that was eliminated, too   That has all been put on a symmetrical basis On the one hand, it's on a symmetrical basis; on the other hand, the interest rate was adjusted at the same time   Mr Chairman, I think you're remembering the risk-sharing, and that is what was dropped in all the cases The substitution that was made was that we would at the same time take--   For the five that we had drawn upon in the post- 1973 period, they had a provision that they would share the risk on our drawing That was the-- "
2009,1981-12-21,"  My memory is that he said there was   12/21-22/81 -2-         disagreement among the banks  He presented a view which said that  [the FAC members] suspect this [nonintervention policy] has something  to do with [the market unsettlement] but there are banks that have  other views  That is also my memory of the written report that they  made to the Board at the time       Most of the interest started to be in arrears on March 26   Okay   The picture is broadly similar to what we have seen here in the sense that the economies abroad have been growing, although it has been small positive growth It has been quite modest on average over the last several quarters There have been some signs of a bottoming out There were increases in the United Kingdom after a very sharp decline; and the German GNP number that came in for the third quarter, just released today finally on a seasonally adjusted basis that one could understand, shows essentially zero growth rather than negative [as it was] in the second quarter So, there are some signs of a bottoming out, though I think we have marked down the extent to which we see real positive growth in this quarter We expect at best only a modest rate of acceleration in the course of 1982, reaching something on the order of 2-1/2 percent on average as I recall for the last half of 1982 That is hardly a very robust performance, when you factor in Japan, which in the past, even in the first oil-shock environment, has had a fairly good growth rate relative to the rest of us  Generally speaking, unemployment is expected to continue to rise abroad; and there may be some improvement--maybe a percentage point or a little more--on the price side but not any rapid expansion One place where we have seen some shift in policies, or at least in that direction relative to everybody else, is France, where a somewhat rapid pickup is expected in both prices and real growth I might comment that Japan in particular seems to be a serious problem They had about 4 percent growth this year, which looks good from our perspective, but even the official authorities are not looking for too much next year, which clearly is one of the things that is causing the problem on the external side, the current account side They just have very weak domestic demands, and that combined with the decline in international commodity prices--imports are weighted in that direction --is part of the reason why the number on their current account position looks so astronomical Although that might moderate somewhat, it is likely to stay up in that range unless Japan experiences a dramatic rebound, which no one at the moment is particularly projecting  -17-    12/21-22/81   It has not improved, particularly over the recent period The CPI in the second half of the year has been running in the 11 to 12 percent range; it had come down to a plateau and backed up It actually got down almost to 10 percent on a year- over-year basis and backed up a bit as the pound weakened in the summer So they are about back to where they started when Mrs Thatcher came into power   Oh, I don't know It is something astronomical, off my chart here I think it has been occurring since the end of 1979   I think there are two major reasons One is that they found themselves burned badly in the past by excessive stimulation, or they feel they have been burned badly And they had two rounds of rapid inflation--less the second time but it still was worse than they expected--in the yen as you may recall in early 1980 when it went to 260 yen per dollar, which was as ridiculous a level in some sense as the level of the mark in August And that was partly an inflation phenomenon The second reason is just that they have this maybe well deserved fear of fiscal deficits, and the stimulus to domestic demand one might expect would come from the fiscal side They have taken some cautious steps on the monetary side though in terms of the mix of policy, everything else being equal, that tends to be a little negative from external perspectives But their fear is of their large budget deficit, which they see problems in financing; they continue to have troubles with banks in Japan in placing their longer- term debt The banks have been gradually backing-off from this sort of short placement system that they have run for years and that has led to caution in fiscal policy Now they have a new budget in the process of being formulated; and from the indications I've seen, it may be a little less contractionary than the rhetoric suggests They are talking about expenditure increases in nominal terms on the order of 6 to 6-1/2 percent, which does show some slight positive increase in real terms But the rhetoric is going to be in the direction of continued fiscal restraint   That is right They have already exceeded the 1974-75 peaks, partly with the help of the United Kingdom But all the countries have generally higher [unemployment now]   They had gradually declining interest rates; that is the thing that has helped   We could have copies of those charts circulated to the Committee tomorrow "
2036,1982-02-01," I don't know My memory is that it's about--   We're putting in about-- Let's see, I do have that figure  -14-    2/1-2/82 -15-   Well, it was moved up, I think, to 1/4 million barrels a day If you hold on a minute, I'll tell you what they did last year, at least Last year it was 340,000 barrels per day on average And that was high relative to the previous periods We have in the forecast something only on the order of a little over 100,000 barrels per day They put a lot in over the last three quarters   The rate of fill has gone down I think that is one of those things that is locked up in the budget financing situation with Mr Stockman It's no more certain than some of these other factors   120 billion?   As of the middle of 1980, it was 91 million barrels and they've been putting more in at the rate of about 100,000 [per day]--I'd have to multiply that out--for the past two years   Maybe the Secretary can correct me, but in the past we haven't dealt with this in terms of a formal vote "
2062,1982-03-29," No, next week   They were supposed to have paid it off as of Friday but there's a newspaper report, which I think is correct, that there never has been complete agreement among the banks about exactly what has to be paid The reports I have seen suggested that there was some scope for double-counting, which seems to have been reduced Interestingly enough, most of the reports of leaders of the banking consortium on the other side of the Atlantic have suggested that it would be signed on April 6, which is next Tuesday And then the question is What happens next?   That just completes the rescheduling of the private debt for 1981 The problem had been to bring the 1981 interest payments current Now, of course, we are 3 months into 1982, so it might lead to some questions as to whether this is an artificial gain   The first 2 months of the year were before the devaluation "
2113,1982-06-30," [Statement--see Appendix]   No, they didn't They got it when they arrived   1 percent   $300 million at the minimum, but it could be as high as $400 or $500 million   Yes   It's $21-1/2 billion   It's traditional, Mr Chairman, if you want to do it this way, to note that the approval is conditioned on Sam's negotiations being successful Maybe that's implicit    6/30-7/1/82 -31-   A folder fell off the chair   It hasn't passed their parliament yet   Well, as they reinforce the notion that they would stick to this guideline of a budget deficit of no more than [3] percent of GNP-- They had said that before and [appear] to take it a little more seriously now, but the jury is still out on whether the government--I'm speaking of the government as a whole--will be able to or want to stick to that guideline There is the question as well of whether, in a country like France which has been running for a few years a budget deficit of 1 percent of GNP, that number is really viable in terms of--   It certainly is a necessary step, but whether it's enough to-- "
2155,1982-08-24," It says ""It is understood that the Government of Mexico is seeking to reach agreement on the program from the IMF by September 15 and it is further understood that it is the mutual expectation of the Bank of Mexico and the System that the last one- third of the funds available on the swap arrangement would not be drawn until the Bank and the management of the Fund have reached agreement on Mexico's economic stabilization program"" So, the last one-third of the whole package and the timing of the BIS third tranche is linked to their essentially having reached agreement in principle with the Fund   Mike was just on the phone with them   A billion and a quarter dollars   They accepted that proposition--using the one- year Treasury bill rate on the yield basis off the constant maturity series that we publish   Plus   $35 billion   [Unintelligible]   No, not yet   Yes We just confirmed that [date]   Yes, they do intend to do that As a matter of fact we saw the draft last night They would have it as part of the package   You might just want to confirm that the payout doesn't require a formal vote; the payout would be under this schedule and over a period of time in parallel with the others You don't want to have to act every time "
2194,1982-10-05, $12 billion 
2220,1982-11-16," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, as was noted earlier, it has moved down a little and may be coming [down more] But the staff, at least at the Board, has pretty much run out of what I might call good reasons on that And, not satisfied by the staff, I've noticed that several people we've had in here--the Board [staff] having been exhausted-- were asked the same question One clear factor seems to be the uncertainty and the safe-haven arguments There is something there; how much one can't say That kind of argument is very difficult to measure in terms of how important it is Another factor is this recent phenomenon, as Sam mentioned, that there does seem to be a sense in the market that even though US interest rates have moved down, foreign interest rates, even if they didn't move down in this period, are expected to move down further We saw some of that phenomenon in the market yesterday when there were reports that British interest rates were going to drop very dramatically over the next six months; that knocked down the pound quite markedly against the dollar and other currencies at that time So, there is a sense in which there is a decoupling of interest rate policy [whereby rates coming down in] other countries at the same time our interest rates are coming down has led to some marking up [of the dollar] One thing that we do sometimes lose sight of is the fact that our inflation performance has been better than expected and better relatively than expected All three together suggest that the dollar in a sense is not quite as high as we think it is "
2247,1982-12-20," I don't really have a good answer to your question The one area where we may know a bit more than is incorporated in other forecasts is on the agricultural side That's an area over recent months where we have lopped $2 or $3 billion off the current trade and, therefore, the current account forecast Another factor is that we have been making an explicit provision for the weakness in the developing countries, which is hard to do, and therefore we have a somewhat weaker export picture than many of the private forecasters have A third area, which is related to that, is on the services side, where we also think that there will be an impact explicitly from Mexico of $1 billion or more That will reduce service [unintelligible] from Mexico, which is nontrivial, since their investments are so large there Putting those all together gives us a round number of about $50 billion in contrast to the private forecasts which are now on the order of $20-some billion or something like that I might add that that $25 billion or so is well within the standard  -55-    12/20-21/82  error of forecasting when we're dealing with numbers that are as large as they are these days   Well, it's hard to calculate what a standard error is in these cases, but we're talking about the difference between two numbers with a gross total of over $1 [trillion]   Minus 20 In terms of our weighted average, it was around 120 yesterday I think the direction is more important in terms of the forecast than the extent We have assumed it will go down to about 103, so that's about 15 percent   Well, the mark will go down probably somewhat more than that--by about 20 percent If the average goes down 15 percent, the mark presumably would have to go down more than that   I said 15 percent for the average   Well, that would be a 10 percent or 15 percent adjustment Then we are not going to get as much [of a weighted decline in] the dollar; if you want to [extend the forecast] into 1984, you're not going to have as much of a current account adjustment  -56-    12/20-21/82   In the longer run, there's always a question on those kinds of calculations as to whether to treat the exchange rate as an exogenous variable, which I think one can't But treating it as an exogenous variable, a 10 percent decline gives you something on the order, eventually, of a 1-1/2 percent increase in the price level in two years or so   Right So, as I said the other day, it's not a net [adjustment], because in some sense we haven't yet had a lot of the impact from the appreciation of the dollar that we have experienced for most of 1982   Anything over $200 million does   Gold tranche, reserve tranche   That's the bridging At the end of the year that exposure would be $19 billion   Without taking account of the fact that some of the money will be repaying some of their arrears   Well, maybe, six months   Sure,   The issue is       They have, for example, $2 billion that they owe to the general fund   Nor will Brazil  -65-    12/20-21/82   Not the Treasury   An eventual action, Mike   What about that proposal on the eventual workout? If there were an eventual workout way down the road, if the BIS wasn't paid, then that could also be done on the basis of   But we need not even have a swap agreement in that case I think that's what Mike was saying   $17 billion is what we came up with   That is a popular and widespread misconception The IMF has in fact been essentially doing that for several years now, basically because the Fund cannot provide enough money by itself in many cases to cover what--as Governor Teeters was remarking--is a reasonable adjustment program in the first year, especially if allowance is made for a country bank getting out They will not present a program to the Board which says that there is this big financing gap "
2299,1983-02-08," A month ago I think I would have told you that some decline in US dollar interest rates might do it And then we've had this marking up The major [factor] that we have been pointing to for the past year or so, or half year anyhow, is the prospect that the already large current account deficits that we are projecting would be even larger if we didn't have the dollar depreciation and that as a result that would just tend to be unsustainable in terms of the rest of the world absorbing that amount of net claims on the United States over a relatively short period And the prospect is that [the deficits] will continue That, I think, is essentially what you have to consider--plus some washing out of the safe haven argument that was more dominant the last part of the year   On the interest rate side I provided a chart On the inflation side we think we'll be doing a little better, [which would] build up the attractiveness of US assets These forecasts aren't that scientific or precise but, if anything, we would conclude that we might get more in the way of interest rate declines abroad than is implicit in the Bluebook forecast, which does suggest that relative real interest rates are going to be higher We think, if anything, they'd move somewhat higher in the United States which is why, as I said in my concluding remarks, one might argue that there might be something more in terms of financing that would come out of the private capital flows than one could really see in the historical data That's the basis on which one might argue against [a dollar decline] That people would be willing to continue to acquire claims on the United States or acquire dollar-denominated claims to such an extent that we would not get the decline in the dollar in 1983 that we're projecting and the much larger current account deficit and drag on US GNP on the export side associated with that If you took the dollar as it was and kept it at that fourth-quarter level, which is the bottom line of that chart, that [equates to] about 13 or 14 percent of GNP at the end of 1984 That is a large component, essentially, of the difference between the growth rates that we have in the staff forecasts for 1983 and 1984 "
2324,1983-03-28," The Authorization would have to be changed   Well, except in exigent [circumstances]   I think the answer to your question, Governor Partee, is that an addition to that list of 14 currencies has to be authorized by the full Committee To the extent that the procedural instructions, which relate to the day-to-day operations of the Desk, [address this], there are some provisions such that if the full Committee can't be consulted there's a way of continuing to do business But I think, as common sense would suggest, that would be only in cases in which we had ongoing operations and not something that we were starting fresh   No The procedural instructions call for activation of the swap by the Subcommittee if it's [less than] 15 percent of the arrangement or $200 million So, as a matter of the Committee's procedures, that's what is called for In most recent cases that I remember when the foreign country was activating the swap, as a matter of practice, the full Committee has been consulted   On holdings, Mr Chairman, the last time around on that the Committee maintained the overall limit of $8 billion   We have not made those limits public  SPEAKER(?) Even to the Committee?   They are not in these documents   They aren't in the documents that were circulated to the Committee   They were determined in a decision by the Committee the last time this was reviewed, which I think was last May   Yes   It's $5 billion, actually   I think it was increased to $5 billion the last time   $502 million   There is the limit in the Authorization, though, for an overall open position of $8 billion, which the Committee set And that is what appears here in paragraph 1(d) in the Authorization The Committee has chosen to set limits on balances in these currencies informally in the way in which Norm and I together with Sam have described That limit is $5 billion, with the sublimits of $35 billion in marks, $1 billion in yen, and $500 million in all other currencies In the case of the yen, we hold roughly $500 million in yen balances and, therefore, there's $500 million to go   No, these are not the currencies that are held against Carter bonds   Mr Chairman, the remainder being warehoused is entirely in marks and it's just under $11 billion The timing of that warehousing agreement is such that it will be used to pay off remaining Carter notes--Governor Teeters, this is where the Carter notes come in--in May and June   May and July of this year And then we would have no more [foreign currency holdings] actively warehoused with the Treasury On the other hand, it seemed to us and the Treasury, given their activities in other currencies--ones we'd just as soon not hold --and the fact that they do hold a certain amount of marks and Swiss francs and yen in addition to what they've already warehoused, that to the extent the Exchange Stabilization Fund might get into a liquidity bind it made sense to maintain this facility for that purpose   We keep the earnings   No   It's the Treasury's foreign currency but the--   The warehousing takes the form of a spot sale and a forward purchase, flat So, they sell us 100 marks and we sell them back 100 marks, except that the 100 marks have earned some interest in the meantime   We keep it in our balances   As marks   No, we pay them off in marks   No, we take the earnings into our portfolio The principal is where the--   Well, among other things, yes   No Again, the only currencies that the System Account could hold would be the 14 that are on that list   Even for the Treasury, except by a separate authorization of the Committee In contrast to other operations the Treasury has with us, like the SDR monetization, this is not an automatic facility It's at our discretion as to whether we agree about the liquidity conditions or the circumstances If we deem that the circumstances so deserve, they can activate the facility So, we have to agree to the circumstances   We manage it; we have some for the Treasury anyhow It's through the Treasury account at the New York Bank that we would manage the investments   As I remember, the report is agnostic or somewhat ambivalent on this point [as is] the US government itself I was amused to hear President Solomon's response to that because I think when he was once [wearing] another hat he argued--and we did too--that interest on dollars that foreigners accumulate should be put into the markets Now, I think you can argue the economics of the issue on either side Likewise, the question of whether it's intervention can be argued on either side My purist colleagues would say that that is indeed intervention since the interest changes the net asset position in foreign currencies   Right   Right   You might look at it just as that we've diversified further    3/28-29/83   No, we want a stronger yen   The total is $300 million and something, and most of that is in Swiss francs   October was the last time    3/28-29/83   Governor Teeters, we hold at purchase price, which is what these balances are carried at, $296 million of Swiss francs and only about $20 million in currencies other than Swiss francs I don't have [a list of] all the others but it's only about $20 million   As a matter of procedure, normally in recent years when we have intervened, the proceeds have been shared with the Treasury in any case The limit on actual intervention is twice that much    3/28-29/83   Yes, I think that's what the Chairman's arithmetic was The $500 million plus [$250] million is $750 million and times two it's $1-1/2 billion   The study, as far as the studiers are concerned, has been completed Our lords and masters have not had a [unintelligible] It is actually going to be at the end of April that they are going to have a meeting on the subject   Yes   Not between the two quarters, though   We are assuming that the trade deficit this year, Mr Solomon, will be on the order of $35 billion dollars   Excuse me The current account is $35 billion and the trade deficit--that's a wrong number here--is about $65 billion They are rising by $20 billion approximately next year   Both   I'm not sure what else you would have in mind  -24-    3/28-29/83   As far as GNP, that's largely it--well, the exchange rate too, and prices Price is more generally in international trade prices   Most outside forecasts, although there are some in the range that we're in, tend to be in the $20 billion range for the current account I misspoke again, excuse me The [trade] account forecasts tend to be in the $20 billion range There are some that are as high as ours   Well, the fourth quarter in fact was a $24 billion current account deficit; we had forecast somewhat higher, I think, but not more than $2 or $3 billion dollars higher than that for the fourth quarter   It was $24 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, at an annual rate At one point we had forecast somewhat higher--I think $25 or $26 billion--for the fourth quarter of last year The figure that came out was a bit lower What came out was a little higher than even we had forecast at the last meeting   [If the] third stage is dropped   Oh, it's more than 100 percent   It depends on which number I use as a base Exports to Mexico in the fourth quarter of last year were at an annual rate of $68 billion dollars and in the fourth quarter of 1981 they were at an annual rate of $176 billion So it's more than $10 billion   More than one-half   That is possible, yes   I was thinking that probably the right number is 50 percent of the imports of a year ago The first quarter a year ago our exports to Mexico were $15 billion So, something on the order of $7-1/2 billion at annual rate is probably right   Slightly   Well, the fourth quarter had October, November, and December in it I'm almost surprised that they were in [unintelligible] in the fourth quarter of last year  SPEAKER(?) Financed?   We financed $700 million in that quarter; half of it would have been CCC-related in the fourth quarter of last year   I don't have that with me here as such, but for other developing countries our exports dropped by $3 billion on the same fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter basis   $3 billion   Exports to Mexico were essentially financially constrained; they weren't letting in anything in that period   They probably were somewhat more in the first quarter than they were in the fourth quarter "
2360,1983-05-24," They have another drawing on the Fund at that time too It's about $12 billion over and above what they have [unintelligible] in the meantime   I wasn't sure how to interpret that report In fact, I was told the report indicated that they were cutting back not in Latin America but in other parts of the world, including North America [Unintelligible] it's relatively small A 25 percent cut isn't going [unintelligible] It applies to new lending but I think that includes rollovers, so it includes as new lending what would in effect replace loans that have matured on the bank's books Put against the context of the fact that new lending to developing countries in 1982 meant [decreases] in lending--[loans to] developing countries in 1982 dropped by 50 percent--that cut is a pretty modest cut That comforts me   I'd say right up front, Mr Guffey, that there is clearly room for some skepticism about that element of the forecast We are forecasting for the year a current account deficit of $35 billion, which would be more than twice the rate we've ever had before, and by the end of the year a current account deficit of $60 billion, which would be four times the [highest] annual rate we've ever had before And our sense is that the market will look at numbers of that sort, which will start coming out in the latter part of the year, with trade deficits of over $70 billion per month at an annual rate, and say that that will be unsustainable and that there will have to be some corrections We do not predicate this on much, by the way, in terms of trade in the United States falling relative to abroad or otherwise One can argue that these kinds of forecasts, while they are high relative to market forecasts and to conventional forecasts, are not out of the range of what people talk about The Administration has relatively similar forecasts and they have more or less made them public Our sense in talking to people in the market, although they know that some economists are forecasting these numbers, is that they're not going to react to them until they in some sense see them And as Sam noted in his report, the fact that the current account moved back not toward zero but something like $7 billion at an annual rate from something over $20 billion in the second half of 1982, largely because of oil which in many respects is a spurious factor, is one reason why the dollar at least in the short run has stayed quite strong That factor has, if anything, moved in the other direction in the short run I would make one other comment Much of the change in net exports in the second quarter is the resumption of oil imports and, in fact, the two surprising things about the first quarter were the decline in oil imports, which we obviously did not fully anticipate, and the remarkable growth in non-oil imports If you look at those numbers, which are really big numbers--and [sparked] by oil, which dropped to $20 billion at an annual rate--if anything, the outlook that we have now is more pessimistic for the current account than it was two months ago    5/24/83   Well, if you talk to traders, they say ""Of course, our economists are forecasting X, Y, and Z (and those tend to be numbers that are smaller than ours) but I never listen to our economists anyhow""   Between the first quarter and the fourth quarter? Twenty-five billion or so Of the increase from [$313] to [$373] billion, a little less than half of that is oil, which is a rebound The price is there You just add them up, price-adjusted a little lower than you would [otherwise] think in the second half But most of it is a rebound in quantity as we had a mild winter and in addition they were running down inventory, if you believe the API number that reports a rebounding already in April   Foreign purchases of US Treasury securities in volume at present are quite small, although they have been larger than usual recently They were almost $6-1/2 billion net last year and in fact they were about $3 billion net in the first quarter of this year   For the last year we had an $8 billion current account deficit and that's a coincidence But in the second half of the year when that turned into a $20 billion current account deficit, annual rate, we had some weakening of the dollar I started out my answer to President Guffey by saying that obviously there is room for skepticism on this point The other side, though, as you said Governor Partee, is that if the dollar doesn't go down, then everything else being equal [unintelligible] the growth forecast will be considerably less ebullient than we have it now, by something on the order of 1/2 percent, as Jerry said in his briefing   That's primarily only in Canada   Only in the United Kingdom is there an interest return on Ml The other countries don't have that "
2397,1983-07-12," Yes, because that's the effect of the price change We have a [terms of] trade loss, so the import prices rise much more rapidly than the export prices That's why imports are larger to begin with So in real terms the net export position improves in 1984, as shown in Jerry's figures, but in nominal terms it gets worse because of the terms of trade loss The latter adds to our    7/12-13/83  nominal current account dollar deficit; it doesn't add to our net exports   It's 15 percent by the end of 1984   No, they are stable in nominal terms, as I mentioned Essentially, the assumption underlying the forecast is that oil prices will be unchanged throughout the projection [period]; we have built in a small adjustment for the very slight rise of something like 50 cents a barrel from currently recorded figures, but that [reflects] a tightening of spot [prices]   That's the reason why we had that alternative chart there   Payment of interest on them? "
2423,1983-08-23," Yes, that's right The total for all currencies is $3 billion at current rates and $4 billion at historical rates   No, those are the Treasury's losses    8/23/83   The Federal Reserve has about $830 million in unrealized losses at the moment, if you want to call it that But unrealized losses of the Treasury are about $900 million   It depends a bit on what you-- You get the same results as Steve's--   It's a question of how you break into the circle If you think the current account deficit to some extent has been pushed by fiscal policy or an increase in aggregate demand in the United States, then to the extent that you can open as opposed to not being able to open up a current account deficit, in effect the saving that comes in does damp the rise in interest rates that a given impetus to domestic demands would give you in a closed economy context That's a slightly different way of putting the same point that Steve was making, though you obviously know, Mr Chairman, that one has to say where one is going to start the circle "
2451,1983-10-04," Well, you might want to separate the question about what will happen as a natural course of events as distinguished from what might happen I was, in fact, sitting here asking myself a slightly different question What if the dollar declines more rapidly than we now anticipate in the forecast? That would tend to have an expansionary effect on the economy just because aggregate demand goes up Once you get the impact of that larger decline on the current account, you are going to get an increase in aggregate demand in the economy And through that mechanism alone, leaving aside the direct effect on prices, you're going to have some inflationary push You might argue from that standpoint that there would be an induced increase in the average level of interest rates coming from the higher level of nominal income Now, there is always the timing problem The dollar initially falls and there's not going to be any change in the short run in the current account So, whatever the net capital inflow is going to be, for a period the lags that most economists think are there will continue to be there It might have some compositional effects Whether it would take the form of flows through banks or inflows through the flow of funds, I'm not quite sure Whether the intervention and purchase of government securities in itself through different channels will affect the general level of interest rates is a more difficult question to answer   Whenever we're asked the question from Congress we tend to say no I guess what you're saying is that there is a tendency for some magnitudes to rise more rapidly than others Most of the research would suggest, at least for the United States, that    10/4/83  the exchange rate is not an argument in the demand for money equation, so you have trouble getting it into there Now, whether you get an effect from the nature of the flow, I think Mr Axilrod might say that it would tend to be washed out by the operations of the Desk   Well, as we said yesterday, Governor Teeters, it depends a lot on what you assume as you go out [in time] about how growth is proceeding here and abroad If we continue with growth here at or above the average rate abroad, which is consistent with many forecasts, then you have to catch up with that That's basically the reason why that 15 percent depreciation doesn't give us much more than stabilization as we go out But if we return to a more normal--what one might perceive to be more normal--cyclical position, it would involve probably having faster growth in foreign countries than here Then we would need less of a further depreciation in order to bring the current account deficit down substantially   We just got a revision in the German industrial production figure, which was adjusted in July It went down not 09 but 28 percent That's a--   In the United Kingdom, the action yesterday to drop interest rates by about 1/2 percentage point when their monetary aggregates are above target is interpreted as meaning that they, too, were seeing things weaker than they had hoped And France and Italy have adjustment problems So, there's not much over there   It's a little more than that, probably "
2481,1983-11-14," It's 2-1/2 percent on average and it's a little higher than that in the rest of the world   Right It is likely reduced by about 03 throughout the period as a result of the slower growth in the United States So, it's a little under 3 percent on the baseline projection, which is basically the staff forecast, and it's a little closer to 25 or 26 percent after you take account of the impact of the United States on the rest of the world   In terms of the aggregate demand impact, you mean? Well, it would have an impact just like any other demand shift It would give you a higher level of aggregate demand and in that sense it would put you on a different point on the given--   That's precisely correct, I think Let me just make two points to President Solomon One is that to the extent that we have built into the baseline projection some depreciation of the dollar before price stability, essentially, I would view it as part of the process by which we got the dollar very strong to build up the big current account deficit And in fact we don't have much more built into there than is necessary to keep the current account deficit in the current range So, therefore, it is possible that it could go further, as Mr Stockton mentioned when he talked about other exogenous factors--exogenous being outside what we currently predicted--being part of the process But in some sense that is part of paying the price for the good luck on the dollar or the appreciation of the dollar that we had gotten earlier which had accelerated the short-run process of the disinflation But once it reverses itself, the lag comes through the system and we will get much more I would regard this projection as in some sense neutral or agnostic to the extent that it doesn't involve a very big further buildup in the current account That's true of the baseline and of the projection Similarly, it doesn't involve so much correction of the value of the dollar; it has as given a relatively moderate growth in the rest of the world such that you get a big improvement in the current account over a period And in that sense I would say that it's somewhat agnostic in the way it takes--   The particular point is that by achieving a better outcome in 1988 [unintelligible] defined this way to the extent that a different fiscal/monetary [policy] mix over this period gives you higher interest rates, a higher dollar, or a larger current account deficit So, likewise, it might be if you look beyond 1988 that you would go backwards and have a correction of that process You would have to work harder just as we are now in terms of a correction if you felt that that kind of current account deficit would not be sustainable for an extended period of time So, you would have to pay a price later for that   [Statement--see Appendix]   There were dissents on the other side of the [unintelligible] I think they are realizing that this is not a short-term problem, and that leads to increasing concerns among the more thoughtful banks, I think, in terms of considering how it will work out over a medium-term rather than a more short-term set of operations   Yes, they can   There's a reasonable chance that in Argentina's case there will be enough disbursements so that interest will be current on the public sector debt through the end of September, which would obviate, for the moment, the 90 days requirement   I think there may be a consensus but not an agreement   Bolivia   There have been some of those, I think, in the big conglomerate cases I don't know how widespread it is; I think it's fairly limited   Mr Bradfield still thinks it can be improved He believes in this [unintelligible]   Which I'm not responsible for! I'm only responsible for the raw material!   They were up in the third quarter and the mix was high They are going down and, therefore, we get a larger deflator--more negative "
2509,1983-12-19," The answer to President Boehne's original question is that there certainly are other examples We have the Japanese at the moment They have had a very strong current account and a relatively weak [currency]--at least relative to the dollar experience We've had the British experience I'm not sure exactly which way the British current account [is going now], but certainly in the early Thatcher days sterling was very strong and the current account was pretty good because of oil But it was a period when the currency was moving in an unsustainable direction in the absence of [unintelligible] of the current account It subsequently has reversed "
2535,1984-01-30," Part of the point here is that the dollar's earlier rise brings forward some of the price pressures in the wage/price dynamics that we would get later So, therefore, just the fact that you have those price pressures tends arithmetically to hold down some of the prices in the short run and removal of that gives you somewhat of an uptick That's why, at least measured off the consumer price index, you get that tilting up   There is a lag before you get the total impact Well over half of the impact is seen as an instantaneous adjustment or in the first four quarters The total impact would go out further; more than three quarters to 80 percent of it would occur by the end of two years   That's right That's partly shown in this lower panel You can barely see it, but there is a little pushing together and the dollar stays up as the impact wears off    1/30-31/84   There are two factors First of all we're averaging For the low inflation countries we have basically the same kind of phenomenon that we have for the United States--that as the economy picks up, you get some upward pressure on prices moderated by the fact that on our full projection their exchange rates are appreciating So, for the forecast period you get about a 1/2 percent rise in the year-over-year inflation rate for Germany and Japan and Switzerland and countries like that That is combined with some further downward pressure for Italy and France and Belgium where inflation has been above average and they still are following more austere policies in general   The difference is between the level and the rate of change The 1/2 percent ""bonus"" that I referred to in the middle panel of that chart corresponds to a 1-1/2 percent change in the level, given the 10 percent decline in the dollar over a period of time The reason you get a fairly constant contribution is that the difference between those two lines in the upper chart is about the same There is a rather constant process; every year in this three- year period we got about a 10 to 15 percent appreciation of the dollar So, the first-year effect, the second-year effect, and the third-year effect are all coming in together; once one faded out another one came together So you get about 1/2 percent a year of the three-year effect   Yes, about that   The depreciation is 17 percent over eight quarters--two years  prices?  Inflation The answer to the question, Governor Wallich--   That's right It is true that when we've done these kinds of experiments, for the foreign countries there is a larger impact per unit exchange rate change than in the United States largely because of the dollar oil price effect That suggests, at least in the forecast, that the pickup in demand is correspondingly higher to hold the prices down   Well, rather stable   On an historical basis unemployment would be rising because if you believe, as most people still do, that potential is rising at something like 3 percent abroad and they don't get there it should be rising On the other hand, they had been growing at less than that rate in 1983 and in some of the faster-growing countries the unemployment rate has come down That may reflect different changes in work sharing and that kind of thing going on in the labor market That's why I hedged my projection about what will be happening on unemployment   Well, Mr Prell has that too, as a matter of fact To answer Mr Solomon's question These forecasts are more consistent than they ever have been in the past   Interest rates do go up a bit, as I mentioned and as Jim mentioned in his assumptions In some sense, in the general equilibrium nature of this whole forecast, that is associated with the decline of the dollar, which helps to push up nominal demand in this period   That is one of the reasons I presented the two alternatives in the bottom part of that chart One has the dollar continuing to go up; the other one is a scenario in which it is falling out of bed Our view is that eventually $100 billion current account deficits are going to be generating more in the way of net claims on the United States and [the question is whether] the rest of the world, with safe haven factors and so forth and so on, would willingly want to hold [such claims] at unchanged to say nothing of rising exchange rates; and that would produce an adjustment [in dollar exchange rates] In fact, a number of foreign countries--I point to Germany as an example--have too long and to their dismay, I think,  -12-    1/30-31/84  assumed that their currency was always going to rise and, therefore, built into the price projections a kind of inflation bonus Eventually some portion of that inflation bonus has to be repaid, and I think that's the essence of the story Whether it will be of this magnitude--a 17 percent decline--and over this forecast period [is uncertain] Although we continue to forecast it, I obviously am modest about its probability, given the [experience of] the last 18 months   Everybody has his own technique, but the way I tend to think about it is more to have interest rates coming out of the rise in nominal GNP--higher prices and at least for a while higher GNP coming from more exports and lower imports in real terms And that pushes up the interest rates rather than the actual foreign sales of securities, which would tend to bring that pressure forward in time more than what you're talking about   If you look at the structural deficit, Governor Wallich, the change shown on the first chart is about the same size-- at least for the calendar year [or the] fiscal year--as the change in the current account deficit And in that sense in fact all of it is going into the foreign sector "
2563,1984-03-26," Fortunately, since we do the forecasting for that purpose on the basis of quarterly averaging, it allows us to smooth out some factors The chart show forecast was based on projections from the fourth quarter of 1983 through the end of the projection period and we had particular numbers for the intervening quarters just because we do that for the convenience of it In fact, we had felt that the dollar was going to stay up longer than we have in this forecast although we have left the projection mostly the same for the balance of the period--going out after the third quarter of this year So it is the same for the fourth quarter of 1984 and the fourth quarter of 1985 For the first and second quarters we moved it down just slightly, from 131 to 130 on average for the first quarter and 129 or something like that to 126 or so for the second quarter, because it looked like interest rates, if anything, could have firmed a bit--and also because we have been burned so badly, if I may put it that way, as you alluded to President Boehne We had felt that it might be some time before the cumulative effects of the current account would begin to show through; in fact, they have come in somewhat sooner and stronger than we had implicitly projected at that time   It was the 13th   They are [not] paying the interest They have been paying some of their trade arrears, which in some cases involves payments to banks   It's something like $9-1/2 billion for US banks out of the $25 billion   Our investigation, Mr Chairman, suggests that not all banks would automatically in all cases back out the fourth quarter [accrued interest] under those circumstances It's not explicitly required by the instructions It's an acceptable practice   They don't always That's the form in which they often would take out the fourth-quarter [accrued interest] if they were doing the fourth quarter But at least my information suggests that they don't always do that in all cases They do stop accruing after 90 days but the previous period in some cases--   That's right That's the so-called acceptable way of doing it to deduct it against loan loss reserves and then replenish the loan loss reserves to that extent That, in effect,  -27-    3/26-27/84  takes the income hit in the first quarter But in some cases, I understand, banks have declined to do that--or their internal accounting people have chosen not to do that "
2588,1984-05-21," They formally have only extended their arrangements through the end of this month   But the Latin people who currently have their money involved indicated in public when they announced their own 30- day extension through the end of May that they would be inclined to permit a further extension So, although the Treasury formally has a deadline and they might even want to keep to it, they are somewhat boxed in by the Latins   The Argentineans have put forward a proposal to the banks to deal with June 30 It involves the activation of the residual amount of their medium-term loan which was negotiated last year, use of a substantial amount of their own reserves, and repayment of the bridge loan done last year and this little $100 million piece that they have left over Essentially, they would be using $350 million of their own reserves and $150 million left over from the arrangements that were done last year So, they have offered to the banks already--I'm [oversimplifying] it now--arrangements which by    5/21-22/84  June 30, if they had a letter of intent with the Fund and all the paperwork had been done, would bring things up to April again   There are a few things in there that make that package unattractive to the banks and for the moment they have turned it down But I, at least, consider it a positive step that in terms of the general negotiations they are thinking ahead They are 6 weeks ahead of where they were last quarter, if I may put it that way   I don't know whether it's in fact happening but, of course, they can move out of US banks and stay in dollars They can go into Treasury securities as well   I made one contact on that subject Our embassy--I'll leave you to judge the quality of the information-- regards the statement put out by the Mexicans, Argentineans, Brazilians, and the Columbians saying that they plan to get together, initially on the level of finance ministers and foreign ministers and then subsequently perhaps at the head of state level, as a relatively moderate response under the circumstances The text of some of that as picked up in the newspapers suggested that there was talk about protectionism and concerns like that rather than a confrontational framework One never can tell once it gets to the politicians--if it is raised to the level of high politics--what will transpire It reflects I think both the sense of frustration of these countries about recent events as well as a feeling--which we've been picking up since the conference last spring when we hosted the Latin Americans up in Boston--that the countries are being picked off one by one by the industrial countries and their banks So they have a sense of wanting to exchange notes from time to time about what is being done to them "
2616,1984-07-16," It would be about 1 percentage point off the four quarters of 1985 It would make very little difference for 1984 at this point but about 1 percentage point for 1985   If we held it steady   Well, in '85 we have 15 percent [unintelligible] the first year    7/16-17/84   It's not the deflator [where the decline would be] a little less because of the offsetting effect [of rising import prices] This would be the CPE [deflator] or the consumer price index   We're projecting it to happen slowly but it's likely to happen by fits and starts If you look at the chart on the dollar's rise, you see that it proceeded by fits and starts; so if and when it should ever start to decline, we might well see something like that trend line but find some jagged moves going down as we have had some jagged moves going up In fact, we started one just after the last chart show   There may be some [effect], but I would not expect it to be substantial basically because most people could get into dollar-denominated assets on a tax-free basis already and there didn't have to be a withholding tax move in order to change that My assumption would be that most major portfolios in the world already were into essentially tax-exempt dollar-denominated assets, so we would not get a move from nondollar- to dollar-denominated assets because of a change in the tax There might be some marginal effect Some people are pointing to Japanese pension funds as one area where the fact that there was withholding tax [was a factor] and they may have a preference for safer US market-oriented instruments Therefore, there might be a slight change in the portfolio between yen and dollars But in general I think it would be unlikely   We'll fool you next time!   First installment!   [Unintelligible]   There are only two features, I think, to the dollar's role Its rise has helped to hold down inflation, and even if it stops rising the rate of inflation has been suppressed because of the dollar's rise Then if it should decline, as we believe it eventually will, we will pay back some of the dividends that we had collected One of the problems--and it's been seen in other countries --is that you start assuming that the underlying rate of inflation is the rate of inflation that's associated with a continuously rising currency and then that leads to some distortion in and of itself in the way macro policy operates Then once you get to the point--I'm thinking particularly of Germany--where you come down the other side of that mountain, that creates its own problems Everybody has been amused at the constant 15 percent [dollar decline we have forecast]; it is obviously a somewhat notional figure--less precise than some of the other imprecise numbers in our forecast But I think it is partly motivated by the view that eventually we will have not only a [cessation] of this benefit but a rolling back of some of it And it's better, at least in terms of thinking about what the correct underlying rate of inflation might be and in trying to forecast the rate even though the short-run favorable developments on the inflation side might be continuing because of the dollar's value   President Morris is saying that if the dollar goes down, somehow we need even higher interest rates in order to prevent it from going down faster   But the point is that in the last 12 months they have over-invested in the United States or in dollar-denominated assets or the dollar wouldn't have appreciated by 15 percent or so It's no more illogical that the dollar would go down slightly in this interest rate forecast than that the dollar would go up with a doubling of the current account deficit   They do the same thing, Henry Of course, the Administration also does it, but for reasons on the political [side] They do it for reasons of sensitivity--the same reason the Chairman cited, if I may put it that way   I was just doing some calculations this morning, Mr Chairman, which indicate that the dollar in June was only 8 percent above its peak   It's 8 percent above where it was in November of 1982, which in the way these things go I'm not sure is much of an appreciation anyhow It happens that November '82 was the peak; it was the trough of the recession Recently it hit another peak but the peaks have not been that far apart It has been more level, I think, over the period despite [unintelligible], in part buoyed by the rise in interest rates   Yes Slightly above, if I may correct you, on Japan, but below elsewhere "
2642,1984-08-21," They certainly show up earlier, but Jim is certainly correct If you had [a dollar decline of] 15 percent for the fourth quarter of the year--which is not what we're projecting--by the fourth quarter of next year you would only have half of the price effects of that And if you spread out that 15 percent decline over the next 5 quarters, then you're really talking about having a relatively small component of the price effects of the dollar [decline] In fact, we have nominal import prices going up over the 4 quarters in 1985 by about 14 percent, so even there we don't have all this coming through, with lags and so forth, until after the projection period   That's Jim's point "
2691,1984-11-07," It sticks in my mind that troop payments were somewhat less than $100 million a month That would be somewhat more than $1 billion just on that score alone in a calendar year and then they would have a couple of hundred million in income   May I just correct one comment on the forecast? I don't want to dispute the basic thrust of your argument, but on the import side we have identified a couple of areas--textiles and steel-- where it is pretty clear that there was a buildup in imports in anticipation of trade policy actions that did occur and are going to,  -15-    11/7/84  at a minimum, put us back toward the trend of where those imports were relative to GNP It is partly because we have taken out that small piece--$2-1/2 billion in 1972 dollars--which is not trivial in terms of the numbers we are looking at It's 2 or 2-1/2 percent, essentially, in current dollars We have taken that piece out and allowed some payback of it so that we get the absolutely flat picture that you so accurately described So we do have a continued rise in imports at least to the middle of next year absent that factor, which tells us the dollar's depreciation, putative depreciation, takes effect But the reason you get the picture in the Greenbook is largely because we have that offsetting payback in the short run on imports   No, that's right   No, no--   Well, but the basic story is correct Third- quarter [imports] of goods were something around $100 billion 1972 dollars, which is close to $20 billion higher than it was a year ago [Unintelligible] another $3 or $4 billion in goods because you have oil in there over the forecast period So, imports of services decline somewhat and that gives you the flat number on a GNP basis "
2716,1984-12-17," Well, it depends obviously on when it occurs If it occurred sooner, then you'd get more of it in the 12-month period than if it occurred later   Approximately the same way   I can't remember the number exactly It's $125 billion on average for the year and approximately the same on the current account   Well, yes, on average   Our current account at the end of the year goes to $140 billion On President Boehne's comment In aggregate terms I think the hardest thing to predict is the lag structure of the [effects of] exchange rate changes Most equations do say that there is some lag in this, which I think one could say is a manifestation of exactly that phenomenon, even assuming some absorption of an exchange rate [change] in foreign profit margins One way to interpret lags in these equations is that it's not until the exchange rate has gone down or up and stayed there that you get the impact of those exchange rate changes on real trade flows And it is for that reason that one can be quite skeptical about the precise timing for any given exchange rate change--even a permanent exchange rate change--or how fast it would show through There are equations around--in fact the Commerce Department uses a technique where they assume that almost all of the adjustment comes in a very short period of time And that's what led them at one point to make very much more optimistic assumptions in their projections on the current account and the trade balance than we were making at that time because they assumed that there was nothing left in the pipeline With a forecast of the type that we have--just an 8 percent decline against the background of a 12 percent increase last year--in some sense you have more in the pipeline than you're making up So it's necessarily the case, at least on the exchange rate side, that you will have some net negative impact most of the year just with the [unintelligible] exchange rate adjustment of the type we would--   There are some components of that in the price forecast, though less than last time, as Jim said, and also in the real forecast to the extent that interest rate projections are somehow related to the demand-for-money equations  -28-    12/17-18/84 -29- "
2731,1985-01-18," I think we both do Why doesn't Sam do both, and then we will only listen to one voice "
2758,1985-02-12," On the dollar, taking not the fourth-quarter level but the estimate for the first quarter--which is a good deal lower than we are now--as the jumping-off point, we don't get too much direct impact on either real GNP or prices from an unchanged dollar, since that [decline] is behind us In the 3rd quarter, we get 02 down in each and then next year we would get a larger impact of twice that magnitude--an additional 04   But the share this past year was about 25 percent   Share of the total "
2831,1985-07-09," It is in fact somewhat less It is an annual rate of something like 4 percent over the four quarters of 1985 and about 9 percent as it [unintelligible] over the four quarters of 1986   But it is the combination of the dollar--   We assume that only half of the depreciation shows through, in and of itself, to the level of inflation Looked at another way you have an 8 percent decline of the dollar but only 4 percent added on to inflation   But on a quarterly rate [basis] it is about a 2 to 2-1/2 percent rate   2 percent of GNP   We're presuming we'll get some of this out of agriculture as well   Not necessarily on quantity, but you might get something on price That will help you too "
2857,1985-08-20," Maybe not! One contributing factor clearly is that there is going to be less demand here That certainly will be one factor slowing down the rate of increase in imports It is also true that the rest of the world, while not booming, will be growing somewhat faster than we will We feel that the export level was depressed, perhaps somewhat artificially, in the second quarter and that it should pick up some I think that we have put in a relatively conservative--well, maybe ""agnostic"" would be a better way of putting it--trajectory for non-oil imports Those imports in real terms had been running somewhat higher than the historical relationships would predict It is not clear to what extent that is associated with structural changes in the world economy or with responses to exchange rates, which are not picked up by historical relationships As the dollar has declined, and assuming it will continue to decline somewhat, we have chosen not to reverse that In that sense we have been agnostic Now, you could also say that we have not been so pessimistic as to believe that the phenomenon is going to increase in magnitude Basically what we have on the import side is that imports are being driven by the slower growth in the United States and the    8/20/85  decline in the value of the dollar, some of which has occurred already but much of which--basically for the projection period--is ahead of us It is clear that there is considerable uncertainty in these numbers, as Jim indicated and as we have indicated before, because among other things they have been bouncing around quite a lot I certainly wouldn't rule out the possibility that imports in particular could rise substantially faster than we have forecast In fact, we have the imports in real terms continuing to rise marginally through the early part of 1986 It is also true that if they did rise more rapidly, everything else including demand being the same, then production obviously would be lower On the other hand, to the extent that we may have been too conservative or shouldn't have been agnostic, or to the extent that more push comes from the exchange rate than we have built into the forecast, things could go somewhat the other way There is some potential possibility that a sharper decline in the dollar, or a faster response to that, could produce more in the way of a cutback earlier than we have put into the forecast We don't have anything really happening until early 1986 in quantitative terms   Yes, but you get quantity effects that begin to show through within a quarter or so   Yes, but again, you have to go four quarters in order to get half of the effects and a couple of years before you get all of them There is considerable difficulty in knowing how to interpret the first quarter phenomenon where the dollar went far up and came back down How much in the way of imports were discouraged during that period or weren't discouraged during that period? That is one of the conundrums involved here Should you throw out that exchange rate [move] as basically not affecting anybody's decisions? Or should you include it? If you include it, then you would say that you were going to have the lagged effect of the first quarter in some sense feeding on through the remainder of the year Since we're forced to fall back on more or less historical relationships, we have built some of that in I think we could argue that a conservative approach to putting the forecast together can be justified on a micro or disaggregated level to the extent that we have had and will continue to have higher imports of Japanese automobiles in this new full year and that will work somewhat in the other direction   Yes It depends on how you think capacity would be going otherwise But it is clear that demand depends on what else is going on   We have done a crude calculation that would suggest on one scenario that, in fact, we would be over 100 percent on the capacity utilization index, if--   A little more than that   You'd have less consumption   Yes, but that's with no give   That is simply the counterpart to your [85] percent "
2882,1985-10-01," Down about 12 percent   From now on out I think that really is an accident   Another way of looking at it, as Jim said, is that this forecast is built on the assumption that in the 4th quarter of 1986 the dollar will be 5 percent lower than in the last forecast And most of that downward adjustment occurred between the time of the August meeting and today   I have a paper here to look at With much hesitation, we have run estimates--with the help of models, rules of thumbs, judgments--and looked at what would happen if we had a 40 percent decline in the dollar over a very short period--18 months, roughly   Yes, 40 [The specific number] doesn't matter; basically, it's a very large decline over a short period of time And then we looked at where the economy would be three years later-- another 18 months after this decline had happened We looked at two extreme assumptions one was that you don't change money growth, or at least what the models tell you money growth is; and the other was that you don't let interest rates change In the first case the models tend to tell you that the nominal GNP won't change at all   Let interest rates go up; take it on interest rates   That's an extreme   The level of real GNP, while it may go up initially, comes back down as the interest rates--   Right But the composition changes because gross domestic purchases go down by about 5 percent That is about enough to change--well, it gives you $140 billion on the current account and essentially wipes out the current account deficit So, gross GNP is unchanged, gross domestic purchases go down by about 5 percent, making--   From what they would otherwise have been, yes sir   And the price level goes up by 7 percent  SPEAKER(?) Seven?   Above what it would have gone up At the other extreme, real GNP goes up by around 10 percent compared to what it otherwise would be Gross domestic purchases, since you have a sympathetic effect from the addition to net exports, go up above what they otherwise would be Capacity utilization you might not believe that goes up by 6 percentage points The unemployment rate drops by a somewhat unbelievable 3 percentage points The consumer price level goes up a total of 12 percentage points Governor Partee commented that he didn't believe that number would be so small; I think I agree with him And because you have these sympathetic--or unsympathetic-- income effects, you get half as much mileage on the current account deficit   They go up initially, as Steve was commenting earlier, but then they come back down as they begin to bite or constrain the economy I think at the peak these exercises generated [rate increases of] something like 500 or 600 basis points "
2907,1985-11-04," I think that's the right answer; that's my reaction as well We do have some increase In fact the percentage change on the export side we have is an increase of 7 percent in real terms for goods and services and 9 percent for goods alone The import side is essentially flat or a very small decline--less than a percent in the imports in goods and a small increase in services, which would depend on more debt So it's basically in line with what we have tended to say--this is the same question about the price question on the other side If you don't think prices are going to change as much as some people argue, then import prices aren't going to reflect it as quickly or as fully as with past exchange rate changes It also follows that you shouldn't get the response to the exchange rate changes as fully or as fast as in the past So the two things are sometimes linked together We have tended a little toward the conservative side on prices for various reasons, at least in the short run Until we know what is underway, we feel we shouldn't put a large number in the forecast Therefore, we also don't have a large number on the other, [real, side]; it's somewhat attenuated But I think it's not far from what we believe is historical experience, given the quality of information on trade data at this point, which is not very good   Well, I think that's a pretty big kick 9 percent    11/4-5/85   That's essentially a delayed reaction to the very steep decline because from here on out we have a gradual move "
2932,1985-12-16," $1-1/2 billion   Well, most of these countries do not have the kind of short-term instruments that are available in the United States--Treasury bills that you can invest in--except for Switzerland, which has a small amount Neither Germany nor Japan has a Treasury    12/16-17/85  bill market in the sense of a short-term government paper market such as we are used to in the United States As a consequence, we  the deposit facility of the BIS, which essentially goes into the Euro-market   Contrary to the good news you hear, our outlook for the industrial countries as a group in 1986 is that [growth] will be on average the same as it has been this year Western Europe may be a bit stronger; I assume the stories you particularly are referring to have come out of Germany on this score But Japan is expected to be substantially weaker, and we ship much more to Japan than we do to Germany So, on balance, we're looking for something in the 2-1/2 to 3 percent growth, fourth quarter over fourth quarter, for these countries, which is about what we think they had in 1985 It is, as this year, somewhat faster than the growth in the United States And in that sense, it is redressing the balance of the previous three years when we were growing faster than they were But we don't think we're getting any substantial additional stimulus from that source Our forecast for the German economy itself is at the upper end of the range of the forecasts that one finds coming out of Germany--3 percent year over year and 2-1/2 percent fourth quarter over fourth quarter I think it's the other way around, [2-1/2] percent year over year and 3 percent fourth quarter over fourth quarter That is basically at the upper end of the range of the German official and private forecasts   On the oil price side, the OPEC announcement came sufficiently late that we did not change the forecast that we had before So this $2 a barrel, roughly, further decline in the price of oil is basically predicated on the assumption that the pressure that is built on supply is coming from non-OPEC sources It assumes, and there is a lot if uncertainty in this area, that OPEC will be trying to produce essentially in '86 what they produced this year in oil terms--16 million barrels a day It's a little uncertain what they mean by fair market share in this context If, contrary to that assumption, we had them trying to produce more, then we would have more oil price decline than we had built in Because of the timing as well the uncertainty we haven't put in an additional oil-price decline because of an interpretation of what OPEC did   On average, for the industrial countries you get about the same impact You'd have maybe a bit more positive impact from Japan and Germany, but you'd have an offset in Canada and the UK and those countries that are oil producers So, on average, you would get about the same order of magnitude in those countries as a group as you get in the United States with a $4 to $5 dollar [per barrel] cut "
2957,1986-02-11," One view used to be that higher [oil] prices helped the dollar because the people who were accumulating assets had a stronger preference for dollar-denominated assets in terms of accumulating wealth One argument would be that you could run that view now in reverse and say that that would be one explanation for the dollar's weakness Given the fact that most of those countries have been decumulating assets for a fairly substantial period of time-- several years now--that argument probably has less weight than it would otherwise That asset preference argument probably has less weight than if the oil price decline over the last several years had happened all at once   We are projecting very low rates for both those countries 1-1/2 percent for Japan; and 09 percent, if you want to be inappropriately precise, for Germany   With a $20 oil price That doesn't take quite as much off, as I explained, because there are high taxes So, although the dollar component of it helps, the fact that they halve the [rate] of consumer price--   Well, one percent for the year measured from the fourth quarter over the fourth quarter is the number I have Obviously, within anybody's forecasting range, that could mean that in a given quarter there could well be a negative number For other European countries like the Netherlands and Switzerland we also have less than 2 percent   Little change, I think is a fair [description], or maybe some slight drifting down of interest rates We have not made any abrupt assumption of change; for the average of these countries it's maybe something like 50 basis points over the forecasting period   Well, in some sense, the fact is that their inflation rate is coming down more than ours and interest rates are not coming down as much as ours In fact, implicit in this forecast is that real interest rates will be going up slightly in those countries Depending on what you think is going to happen to real interest rates here, that could be viewed as somewhat negative to the dollar   I am just saying that if Germany cuts its inflation rate from last year to this year in half--by 100 basis points or more--and you don't think German interest rates are going to [decline] by 100 basis points, then that would tend to depreciate the dollar or appreciate the yen--I mean the deutschemark I had the wrong currency there!   This is zero So those are year-over-year changes; anything above those--   In fact, on this index there's about a 6 percent increase against the lows in the summer Now, this is a broader index because it includes food, particularly coffee, than just an industrial supplies index The industrial supplies index, instead of this positive number here, shows something on the order of a 3 percent decline   I think the answer is yes, in some In fact, when we started to put this forecast together we were inclined to have a somewhat more [upbeat] outlook in the non-OPEC developing countries than is shown in this chart By looking at such considerations as the    2/11-12/86  oil price and how that might affect them and some of the uncertainties that might be associated with that, we were led to scale back somewhat; it was sort of a netting factor that we wanted to put in there The Baker countries themselves, which include Mexico and several OPEC countries like Venezuela, Ecuador, and Nigeria, on balance, are hurt by lower oil prices We have maybe something like $7 billion, based on the price decline, built into this forecast It is also true, however, that the decline of the dollar does, on balance, tend to help these countries To the extent that they have followed flexible exchange rate policies, their exchange rates more often than not are biased toward the dollar, or [move] relative to the dollar That's especially true in Latin America A number of them-- Brazil is a good example--are gaining in competitiveness vis-a-vis the other industrial countries, as we do Korea is another example You may have seen a lot of stories about that how the rising yen has put Japan at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis Korea Well, Korea is one of these non-OPEC developing countries; therefore, you might expect that, to some extent, to give them a somewhat better picture   This is certainly a non-collapse scenario   Again, that's partly because these charts are done on a year-over-year basis; that reflects the fact that the first half of 1985 was so weak In fact, looking across the 1986 patterns, we do not see the kind of increase that is presently [unintelligible] while this decline in the first half of this year from the last half of 1985 has assumed some fairly large shipments; and that's basically    2/11-12/86  the explanation for the dip shown in the second half of 1986 I wanted to be consistent in the numbers used, but in this case I think it generated more in the way of wiggles for the agricultural picture than our forecast suggests is likely to be going on   But consumer prices will be--   Not entirely; that's the problem A large fraction of it has been shifted--or will be shifted in the context of this arrangement--at the bank's option Many of the European banks have switched back into their own currencies   It depends on whether you think the dollar is going to decline more or less rapidly than the interest rate differential   Its weight is multi-lateral, so it's less than its weight in our trade I think I'm supporting your point, Mr Forrestal   I think they're a little higher than that   They're a touch above 6 percent   They are 4-1/2 percent "
2982,1986-04-01," It's partly just in recognition of the fact that the dollar had already reached a lower level than we were projecting at the time of the last Greenbook The other part of it is that, with the lower interest rates, we felt that it made more sense to assume somewhat more depreciation   Most of that, or half of that, we've already had   [Another] 5 percent In 1987 the level at the end of the forecast period is roughly 10 percent lower than we had [in the last Greenbook]   The posted prices, I think, are a little less than that now; my understanding is they are in the $15 or $16 range Mike says $12-$15 That's not the spot price but the price at which the large companies will buy   Much lower, if you had that   No, closer to 3 percent   And that's one of the problems One reason why the trade balance as a whole doesn't improve faster is because we have growth pretty much as fast here, especially in the second half, as we have abroad   As far as the dollar is concerned, in our forecast for 1986 we're assuming it doesn't have an impact in 1986 on what you're looking at now   The way we think about these things--   What we're seeing in the second half of this year is what we normally have in terms of the dollar, because there's no further decline I think this time--at least the magnitude is very small; you will see some maybe It's in 1987, as Jim mentioned, that the effects of the [further depreciation]--   Also, the oil prices stop going down, so you have that kind of effect "
3007,1986-05-20," I think the question, Mr Chairman, is whether a resumption of downward pressure on the dollar is expected   My best guess on Japan is something like 2 percent at an annual rate--very low, and maybe something about the same order of magnitude, say, 1 to 2 percent in Germany In both countries there were declines in industrial production in the first quarter   On the assumption that the nontraded goods component of the GNP continued to expand   I would think in both cases it is   Well, it's short of what their expectations were; there's increasing evidence from--   Well, on the fiscal policy side, certainly, although it depends on what you crank in for Gramm-Rudman But in both of those countries we're seeing a continuing move toward fiscal restraint, a continuation of a 4- or 5-year trend On the monetary side, for Germany in any case, they are substantially above their monetary growth [objective] They were aiming for 5-1/2 percent in April and it was a little above 8 percent That's one of the things that Sam referred to that they are concerned about and one of the things conditioned to their position in the EMS, which is restraining them from providing more stimulus on the monetary side It's a little hard to read the monetary part in the short run [in Japan] The Japanese really have moved toward a more expansionary monetary posture over the course of the first five months of this year   Their monetary growth dipped down in April, but they too have been a bit concerned about the excessive monetary growth   Well, for most of the period up until very recently they were following a very tight monetary policy largely directed at keeping the yen from depreciating too much; there was a lot of pressure on them not to ease monetary policy because that would cause the yen to depreciate   Well, there is some talk that if it comes in low and the government does poorly in the elections in the second week of June--the second Sunday in June, I guess--that there might be some easing on the fiscal side I think that has a low probability, but it is a possibility, I think   Well, I've been told that there are some modest fiscal expansionary measures--public works projects and so forth and so on They have a national election in January and the implications of this June election are that they have enough time to move--to ease a bit to stimulate the economy if they're concerned--which I think is a very big ""if"" One of the problems in interpreting those election results, as Sam mentioned, is that they are going to be contaminated by Chernobyl So there would be less of a mandate than one might want in the circumstances   We are expecting, with the help of some growth abroad and the lagged effects of exchange rate change, to see a rather pronounced impact in terms of slowing of imports Imports will continue to rise in nominal terms and we expect a rise in exports, so I think as far as the--   Just in terms of the trade balance itself, we have nominal imports rising at a 12-1/2 percent annual rate over the four quarters of 1986 and nonagricultural exports rising at a 12-1/2 percent annual rate over the four quarters of this year We had a 16 percent annual rate, we think, in the first quarter So the balance is somewhat lower, 3 percent a quarter For non-petroleum imports, we are looking for small declines--maybe in the 2 to 4 percent annual rate range for the balance of the year   In nonagricultural, non-oil, imports On the oil side, we had a big drop in the first quarter and we will get quite a big snapback for three reasons one, just the variability of the numbers and the big drop in the first quarter when they were rebuilding; second, gasoline and energy consumption are going up; and third, domestic production is going down So there is quite a push on the quantity side of the import side in the short run--less in the way of a nominal trade balance than we would have--   It is very hard to estimate these things I'll look it up and will give you at least an accurate estimate We have something on the order of several hundred--I am not sure whether it is [unintelligible]--   It's a forecast We have domestic production going down by 300,000 barrels a day over the four quarters of 1986    5/20/86  already in the notion of what these countries are able to do And I think we have to begin to look more at this impact [unintelligible] But the possible pressures that may occur in some countries, including the [major] ones--not from one year to the next but over several years--could begin to [present a different] and more difficult picture of these outcomes   Well, there are quite a lot The production data lag, but there is a large amount of anecdotal information about the shutting of stripper wells, which account for some 80,000 barrels a day of total production in the United States   The estimates range from [unintelligible] When you say something like 50 barrels a day at $15 a barrel-- "
3032,1986-07-08," That figure is more than just the [intervention by the] Japanese; it includes all of the industrialized countries   That includes everybody; it includes the Europeans--the French purchases and the Norwegian   We have looked at that quite carefully in putting together this forecast In the past we focused on the major industrial countries' currencies because, in general, the other currencies moved with them enough that it didn't make that much difference What has happened since early 1985 is that the dollar has depreciated a lot against [the currencies of] major industrial countries and depreciated [less] against [the currencies of] the developing countries as a group--less so against Asian countries and against Latin American countries, but with a big weight going in there    7/8-9/86  for Mexico In the forecast, therefore, we have deliberately tried to adjust that out, in terms of slowing the rate of decline that normal models--based upon just industrial countries' currencies--would tell us regarding how much import volume would or would not respond We also tried to adjust that out on the export side It's pretty difficult Quite frankly, we don't have enough experience to do that But we have given the size of the exchange rate change against industrial countries' currencies a lot of adjustment in the forecast, trying to take account of this factor as well as somewhat related issues like how fast prices change and how fast we get a response [unintelligible] That's one of the reasons why we get such fairly modest numbers; you may have noticed the numbers I quoted are quite modest [unintelligible] relative to what you might have thought   That clearly is a factor and I think we have taken that into account We haven't done, and I am not sure one can do, a close analysis of the [various] imports--to the extent, for example, that Korea is different from India in terms of what it can produce and [unintelligible] imports There is an offset that I think one ought to recognize It also is true that Korea is not going to build up big surpluses To the extent that it is exporting more to the United States and the rest of the world, it also is importing more; and to the extent that we are also exporting to the Korean market we have a competitive advantage vis-a-vis Japan on exports, including the amount of raw materials and that kind of thing, which is nontrivial, that we traditionally have [unintelligible]   It will come later But eventually we are going to gain somewhat in operating in some of these Third World markets from the fact that we have depreciated vis-a-vis Japan and Germany In fact, you can see the other side of what seems to be a block in Latin America and Asia with the dollar's appreciation As the dollar moved up against all of those currencies we lost   The response is that for the G-10 countries as a whole the difference between QIV inflation rates is 27 percent versus 29 percent Now, the chart here is a little exaggerated because the higher inflation countries continue to go the other way and are left out of the chart Switzerland, for example, goes down next year and is left out; [unintelligible] is left out of here So you have a very small effect and that is coming from the fact that oil prices stop going down and the exchange rate--although the dollar continues to depreciate, it's not at a 30 percent annual rate   It is something like an 8 percent annual rate, so that is what [unintelligible] I don't--   I have quoted you the wrong set of numbers--the GNP numbers It goes up, but one of the points is that for the G-10 as a whole--Sweden is at 4 percent this year and goes down and Belgium comes in a little high relative to Europe, going up about 03 percent --it's a relatively small average drop You have a bigger effect in Japan and Germany partly because those currencies have moved a lot and the move was relatively large compared to the other currencies The only point I would make is that the change is small relative to the change in the United States; [the numbers are] 21 and 29 percent in the G-10 [versus 14] and 39 percent in the United States   It's the relative change that I think is more important   Well, wages are continuing to go up and there are other factors   You are multiplying--halving the dollar price of oil and that times a 30 percent drop in the price of the dollar [unintelligible]   Yes   But say that oil prices go down by 8 percent or greater, say, 10 percent Last year they had gone down about 50 or 60 percent   Yes, but other prices are going up   But the year-over-year consumer inflation rates in these countries are still positive and you can ask the same question even with price effects [unintelligible] It has to do with the other components in the price index   [Unintelligible] I would agree with that What transactions took place were [unintelligible] response to what was going on as the dollar was moving up That's one of the reasons for the continuation of the effect You count the negative effects on export and import volume as they lag through the system; at the same time, you begin to add on the positive impact and we don't begin to get much positive impact for a while Look at it the other way The dollar started depreciating on this particular index from, call it 90 in the fourth quarter of 1980, and it is now at 110 So it has gone from 90 to 150 plus back down to 110; that suggests that there is a lot of appreciation that has not been wiped out It's debatable whether it needs to be wiped out completely anyhow, but it is clear that the dollar has still appreciated relative to what was on average the last [unintelligible]   [Unintelligible] never appreciate that much "
3057,1986-08-19," It's short of the Senate bill     Actually, Mr Chairman, I think the does not include all of the nonusable reserves So that may be an underestimate of the total reserves   They include silver and a few things like that, but- -    8/19/86   It's around $60 billion to the public sector and another $15 billion to the private sector   It was   We did check, Mr Chairman, and in that particular case it was a general provision about working down the exposure to troubled debtors and that was as far as the letter went The bank was choosing to apply this particular [interpretation]  -10-    8/19/86   I should say that the GNP numbers that were put out, which show some downward revisions on the export side and an upward revision in real terms on the import side, were in line with what we had guessed--based upon the preliminary numbers on the trade side that are still not available [in final form] for the second quarter So, although the revision was downward on the overall situation, both components of it are consistent with how we have been reading the incoming numbers The forecast for the external sector is basically contingent upon two factors One relates to the exchange rate effects, which have been slow so far in coming They have not yet come through in terms of showing much effect on slowing the growth of non-oil imports or speeding the growth in the volume of nonagricultural exports [We believe] that we will in due course begin to see those effects; and the anecdotal information, from what I have seen, is consistent with that We're now getting some stories of firms moving from the category of ""we're eager to compete"" to ""we're beginning to get some orders in the fall"" from that The other important factor is that we are assuming that the lull in growth in the first quarter in other major industrial countries, at least as far as Europe is concerned, will be replaced by faster, though not exuberant, growth over the next six quarters A third factor, which we may not have taken into account quite as much, is that in the last several quarters with the Mexican situation we have lost exports and increased imports because they have moved [down] their exchange rate over the past year against the dollar; the rate had gotten out of line again, essentially since July of 1985 They also have lost income The two things together have had an impact on our trade with Mexico, which is one [unintelligible], if anything, we should at least be reducing in emphasis   We're assuming a further moderate decline, at least on the scale that we've seen over the past 17 months or so now  -22-    8/19/86  So, the dollar declines at roughly a 10 percent annual rate through the end of the forecast period Given the lags in these relationships, though, most of that decline will not affect the nominal value of the trade balance; in fact, we even have [forecast] an adverse affect on it As a consequence of that--you're quoting GNP numbers I guess--the trade balance [deficit] itself goes from the $150 billion range where we are now to only about $130 billion in the fourth quarter of 1987, just--   The $82-1/2 billion that Governor Heller quoted   Net exports on a real basis   Well, in fact, we have tried to make an allowance for that in the forecast That's one of the reasons why we have not gone with traditional model estimates as our basic forecast; we adjusted the G-10 [index] in putting the forecast together I might add that I have a table here of our forecast and 8 other forecasts of the current account for 1987 and of the 9 forecasts listed on this table we have the largest deficit at $135 billion; the lowest is $98 billion Now, there are price and quantity effects involved; so we may be too pessimistic on the price side and too optimistic on the quantity side The two together, in any case, would produce for us a much higher current account deficit than anybody else who is represented in this listing   We have We had built in a drop in exports of the agricultural sector in the first and second quarters in anticipation of that program That is one basis for the modest increase we have, which is on the order of $2 or $3 billion in 1982 dollars, in our agricultural exports over the period   I heard that same report They were talking about something like $3,000 on a--   The report said that a car you could buy for $12,000 here you could buy for $9,000 in Canada, which was something like a 25 percent markup here The Canadian dollar has not depreciated 25 percent   So, it sounds like they started out with a differential pricing policy that has come home to haunt them It seems to me a segment of the market--   There was a joint agreement so that the trading, at least at the dealer level or the manufacturing level, is free between both parts and cars   Then they resell them in both markets; they are sold in both markets and they have different prices, not just a lower price in Canada So, a large number now have sanctions   Their trade deficit is beginning to increase Their trade surplus is declining; the current account is increasing   It's 68   It has gotten some strength but net, on balance, it's down against the dollar "
3084,1986-09-23," President Morris, research done by people here does suggests that in econometric terms you get more of an explanation of the dollar's movement from real long-rate differentials, as the Chairman commented, than short rates But they don't explain very much of the total So, although by themselves they seem to provide more [of the explanation] over the longer term than [do short rates], it's not decisive It is one of the factors, but presumably not the only one    9/23/86   You get more of that, Governor Wallich That's presumably what you're trying to pick up with the so-called econometric exercises But I don't think they are very useful in explaining wiggles from discount rate changes You need other things   President Horn, there is a proposal by the Taiwanese to apply US trade legislation in reverse For countries with which they had big trade surpluses they would cut the tariffs on imports rather than seek a depreciation or appreciation of the currency That has not had any effect; it's one manifestation of this kind of pressure   We don't regard Taiwan as a country [unintelligible] this large surplus, [unintelligible]   Yes, indirectly   Monetary [effect]   Yes, but it doesn't have an effect on bank reserves within Germany   Well, it's certainly yet to be known, but we anticipate the second quarter will continue at the rate the Chairman has expressed which, depending upon which numbers you use, is either 8 or 14 percent at an annual rate But on average, we don't see much difference from the trend that they've had over the past couple of years of something under 3 percent If anything, we see some tailing off as we get into 1987   I agree that the July data were disturbing In fact, as far as the trade balance itself, the trade deficit in the third quarter would be larger than in the second quarter, which was essentially unchanged from the first In terms of GNP accounts, however, two things are operating One is the deflation; prices are rising for imports and in some sense that's taking back, so quantities are not rising as rapidly On the other hand, when you're going through the trade numbers to the GNP accounts, there's about $3 billion at an annual rate that's accounted for by gold Gold comes out of trade, both imports and exports, when it goes into GNP accounts The negative swing is because of what's been going on in gold trade going from second quarter to third quarter; that swing isn't reflected at all in the GNP accounts So I think it's fair to say that while we don't know what the revised figures will be when they come out at the end of this month they could well show worse numbers for July than the preliminary estimates Our sense is that those are odd numbers and we are assuming they will be offset in part by August and September in the trade balance   I think Jim summarized our sense of a lack of confirming evidence   On the other hand, to the extent that other aspects of the forecast are beginning to fall into place we had hoped that this one, too, would turn--   But, President Boykin, we don't say this is our forecast for the weighted average dollar and put that into an equation and ignore the rest of the world So, just because we use that as an indicator of where the dollar is going does not mean that we have ignored in this forecast the fact that the Taiwanese or the Korean [currencies] have not been depreciating appreciably against the dollar We have gone back and looked at this more carefully over the last several months and, in fact, I am much more comfortable than I was before--at least to the extent that history can be any guide in these matters--that in the forecast we have adequately taken account    9/23/86  of the lack of depreciation against the fixed [exchange rates of certain countries] in the judgmental adjustments that we have been making Before, when we went back and looked at it, the whole scientific evidence suggested that, if anything, we were going too far in the direction of slowing down [the adjustment] for that reason rather than not far enough So there is something in the forecast that takes account of the lack of depreciation against those currencies explicitly, and it is based upon scientific evidence as well, if you want to call it that Now, we have a big problem in terms of how we forecast what's going to happen to those currencies Basically what we have assumed is that they would maintain their value in real terms against the US dollar So there would be no net real appreciation or depreciation versus those currencies, on balance Given the fact that we're dealing with some countries who have rather severe debt problems, that may or may not be appropriate On the other hand, we have enough trouble doing the forecasting we do So there is an explicit assumption, essentially, about both the behavior of those currencies and economies and an assumption about the course of their exchange rates in our forecast [unintelligible]   A touch, yes   No, this forecast basically is the same as the previous one   No, the exchange rate forecast for once didn't change at all just because we have the growth down by a tenth, or two tenths if you combine the two years This would tend to give us a little more depressing effects on exports, as you suggested Basically, the order of magnitude would be about the same as the last time As for the impact on the overall forecast, on balance, I think we took a little out of the 6-quarter change from where we were last time "
3109,1986-11-05," But the wages were really set, basically, before the prices went down And so real wages on this [unintelligible] economy That's one of the questions whether or how long this recovery is going to be sustained The basic wage bargains were set before they had experienced the effects of lower oil prices and [unintelligible] and the exchange rate change and prices came down   Some of that was deliberate, too Last fall, in fact, the government was talking of wages as a way to--   On the consumer price level there are three channels the direct impact from higher prices, the indirect effects of competing goods, and then some allowance for aggregate demand    11/5/86  effects We used to say that the rule of thumb was that something like a 10 percent decline in the dollar on the G-10 index would give you, after three years, something like a 1-1/2 percent increase in the level of the CPI But the work that we have looked at recently suggests that it may be a little less than that--perhaps something in the 1 to 1-1/2 percent range One of the reasons it is less relates to the same phenomenon that we have debates about--what is the right index? The prices of some imports--especially to the extent that they are imports from countries against which the dollar is not falling-- will not be rising as rapidly as the others It is through that differential effect, however, that you are essentially going to change the distribution of trade As far as the general question about [prices] feeding through, ultimately you have to get some prices up in order to get some consumers or importers to change the way they are doing business And in that sense there is both good news and bad news in the price increases that now seem to be coming along The good news is certainly that the process that should lead the decision- makers to look elsewhere--maybe at home--to satisfy their needs is starting So far there is certainly some evidence of slowing in the rate of growth in the volume of imports I might also add one small footnote on the BIS figures that came out on Friday that Mike referred to the revisions show a higher increase in import prices than the numbers that were incorporated in the GNP figures that were released earlier in the month That would suggest that for a given value of imports you would get less quantity, ceteris paribus   Mr Chairman, our sense is that the September trade numbers that were released, the so-called statistical month- [end] numbers, were probably better than the underlying trend So that means that for the sum of these months--October, November, and December--we're going to get some very much worse numbers If you look at the raw data--not the nice leading indicators President Morris has cited--they are a little peculiar because the export numbers are not particularly good In fact, most of the improvement in the August and September numbers is in the import side where, although we're expecting a slowdown, we're not expecting a drop off    11/5/86   Half of that is oil Half of what's going on in this fourth quarter is oil   Yes, but if we had to redo the forecast with the numbers that now exist the third quarter would look better The fourth quarter might not be changed much   And that's based just on the fact that it looks like we've got some lower imports--that we're probably going to get negative numbers, or not so big numbers, on the import side in the fourth quarter Exports are beginning to come in a lot more, as Mike mentioned On the current import side our sense is that the monthly number ends up getting built into the quarterly GNP numbers and then you're stuck with them for--   Yes   Yes, their exports are down The last couple of months the volume has actually picked up a bit, but I think that may be shipping When volumes are down, then--   The last couple of months they have done a little better, but basically they are down   Well, in dollar terms [unintelligible] "
3132,1986-12-15," The latest measures didn't include any new indexation In fact, they took off [unintelligible]   Well, they changed the taxation of certain deposits so you didn't get taxed on inflation--on a portion of the interest rate Look at that as just not taxing the inflation portion of the interest base Taxation limited [unintelligible]   [Statement--see Appendix]  SPEAKER(?) Ted, one question Maybe I misunderstood you when you spoke of the third-quarter net export number being $151 billion In the Greenbook, I believe--oh, the trade deficit I beg your pardon   That is a very difficult question to answer I can really only answer within the context of the way we think about these things The way we put this together it has quite a significant impact on the forecast--not on the export side itself, because there the price lags and the quantity lags are longer and, in some sense, we have already constrained that forecast to be less ebullient than one would think would come from the current pace of exchange rate changes But you get a faster move on the import side; you would get more and more import growth if things stayed unchanged And you get a quite    12/15-16/86  rapid impact on gross investment income from abroad; we still get a considerable amount of investment income from abroad and that gets translated very directly into higher dollar value In the way we put together our deflators and price indexes, you get quite a rapid increase from a 10 percent depreciation over this period   On the import side The bottom line, if I remember correctly, is that if you kept things at the current level maybe about two-thirds of the improvement would go away   Actually, we have had it at a little above 5 percent   That's right   I think, on net, things would deteriorate   Right I would emphasize, in answer to Governor Johnson's question, that there are a number of ways to view this--that honest men and women get different results from essentially the same set of initial conditions, including what might or might not be in the pipeline That is partly just a function of the fact that you have so much relative price change already If you thought imports were going to be much more responsive to the price change you have already had, and you stopped the depreciation where it is, then you are going to get significant improvement on the real side And you would likely get an improvement on the nominal side because, essentially, you have had most of the price change and the quantity change, by hypothesis, coming down a lot But as I said, to get the $28 billion that Jim mentioned earlier we stabilized things at the fourth-quarter level, and we get, in real terms, about $21 billion About $12 billion of that is on the trade side and $9 billion is on the services side--most of it from higher real imports   Not built into that scenario    12/15-16/86   In running that kind of experiment, we didn't change the--   They were lower; US interest rates probably fell You still earn more--   The question is How does the lower interest rate affect our net payments? It affects how much we receive in interest payments And [unintelligible] stocks are such that a lower interest rate--leaving aside dividends and those kinds of things-- [unintelligible] still gives you less net receipts   Well, just on the international side, as I said, most of that $9 billion at an annual rate does add up to corporate profits; it is real At least in the accounting it is a consequence of exchange rate changes Those numbers are very large   If I may correct myself, Governor Angell An increase in interest rates would deteriorate the current account [Unintelligible] on balance that way Now, on the GNP net exports-- because you net out government interest payments--it would go the other way   That is the conclusion that we have come to   This is in the real [balance] It would be less than that amount of deterioration on the imports, on the net current side, because you don't have the right [unintelligible]   In retrospect it would be 06 percent   Two-thirds of that, or a little more than half of that, is the oil About $15 billion of that reflects the change in the fourth quarter in the volume of oil from the high level We have different sources of preliminary data for November, too, and we are more confident about that number than about some of the others   A lot of it is based upon two assumptions one is that the oil imports will behave this way; and the other has to do    12/15-16/86  with what is or is not picked up in the national income accounts on counterpart inventory Such a very little amount was picked up that we could find [unintelligible] in the third quarter, assuming that we treat it symmetrically in the fourth quarter Much of it is oil; a small part of it is non-oil imports And agricultural exports have been quite strong Again, we have both October [data] and some other information on November agricultural exports; it seems [unintelligible] special factors which are not carrying through that expansion in the forecast period But we have had a $4 billion annual rate of increase in ag exports, which largely [reflects] Japanese purchases, and then some continued improvement on the [non-ag] export side   Well, there's another factor too To the extent--   There has been a lot of discussion about import prices and I share the skepticism, both ways, that has been expressed on that But to the extent that you get import prices moving more rapidly you would then have a direct impact in terms of statistical aggregate demand, because real GNP presumably would also accelerate in the process of import substitution that Governor Heller spoke of So there is a direct link there even with the [unintelligible] of inventory   Moving both at the same time is built in this four-quarter time period--   Well, [unintelligible] you're right about how the rest of the world is behaving Your words about the rest of the world suggested an even soggier picture; that too could affect the base prices and then you don't have the given exchange rate change Whatever you want to assume about [unintelligible] could be less-- "
3156,1987-02-10," [Statement--see Appendix] Mr Prell will now continue our presentation   Some time ago we looked at one part of that question--whether anyone ever had a turnaround of this magnitude We found a number of examples of countries that had turnarounds in a space of 3 to 5 years of 3 percent or more of GNP So that is not unheard of The question is whether we would have for the forecast period as much of a turnaround as we have projected here In fact, a passing allusion to that is 1978, which was shown on the first chart In 1978 and 1979, as a share of GNP, there were slightly larger swings Basically, from the first quarter of 1978 to the first quarter of 1979 there was an improvement of something like 1-1/3 percent of the GNP And we have essentially 1 percent over several quarters In that sense, we have less of an improvement stretched out over a slightly longer period However, I think it is fair to say that we had a more conducive external environment in those periods Both abroad and in the developing countries, particularly, [growth] was much more rapid in the late 1970s than we are seeing at the moment That certainly is one reason why we had to scale back our projections somewhat The other factor I would mention is that in putting projections like this together we look at what various    2/10-11/87  historical equations tell us, and maybe because we are a little gun- shy, we have chosen not to go with what the straight econometric equations tell us in terms of how much of an improvement we would have over this period That's for a number of reasons, some of which I think everybody knows, including the fact that we are coming back from such a strong position The third point I would make relates to whether this is disappointing I guess in some sense it is disappointing But as I look back at the forecast that we gave a year ago, the forecast for the US current account for last year, given all the conditions, was reasonably close to what we came out with Maybe people hoped there would be more of a turnaround, but I don't think the staff forecast as a whole was substantially outside any normal range of error in terms of 1986   We would have another $20 billion in real net exports over this period if we went with historical equations for the volume of nonagricultural exports As anybody who has done this knows, all equations have errors and it is partly a function of what you do with the errors that happened in the most recent period There has been some error in the most recent period, and in putting the forecast together we have chosen, implicitly, to increase rather than to reduce its size That's partly because, given the relatively soggy environment in the rest of the world, we feel that there are limits on the rates at which US exporters can penetrate some of those markets Looking back at it--and with the big qualification that the fourth- quarter numbers are still partly estimated--I think it is clear that there was a substantial improvement in our nonagricultural exports in 1986 That's something that was borne out in the Reserve Bank surveys and also by the statistics   Well, we have it coming on import substitution in the sense that we have a still growing economy In fact, in some sense you want to look at the production side, not the demand side Production is growing at 2-1/2 percent, and normally that would be associated with an increase in imports of 2-1/2 percent or more over the course of the next two years We essentially have none of that So the substitution effect comes, in some sense, against a two-year 6 percent import growth that otherwise would be there That is quite a large number, but we are not looking for an actual decline   [Unintelligible]   Well, most of the action in this area comes from Korea and Taiwan They have already begun depreciating slightly for the last three or four months And basically, that's what we have built into this forecast They depreciate by 5 to 6 percent in real terms while some of the Latin American countries, essentially Brazil and Mexico, [unintelligible] percent over the two-year period, [unintelligible]   Forecast of the dollar   The red line is the forecast of the dollar  -12-    2/10-11/87   The interest rate differentials?   We have long-term interest rates in the United States that are trending up slightly over the forecast period in nominal terms and real coming down slightly now And that is about offset by the differential in inflation over the period Essentially, you have the same midpoint, which is about 3/4 of a percent there   Basically, it will be flat That's one of the reasons why I didn't put it in the chart   Economists argue about whether negative real interest rates cause depreciation If you have a lagged structural model, I think you would argue that they probably do At some point, however, it implies that you are going to have appreciation In this context, I think it would be a negative factor, on balance The major point is that, while we think there will be at least continuing downward pressure on the dollar, the current account will not move fast enough as some combination of market participants and market [unintelligible] think is necessary   We have more [unintelligible] As a matter of fact, we have it going the other way   In some sense you can see it in the next chart where you have the Economist Index of all commodities You have essentially [unintelligible] over the last couple of years; prices have been flat in dollar terms So likewise, in the oil case, you had a combination of a declining dollar price and it's magnified by the exchange rate   No, I would say net of oil, probably our inflation improvement is not as good Because if all of the other commodity prices were fixed in dollars, and the dollar was declining  -13-    2/10-11/87  against deutschemarks, yen, and so forth, and you take oil out, you have [unintelligible]   There are three things to say One is that the statistics do not show much in the way of net Japanese purchases of Treasury securities over the past year The statistics may be wrong, but they do not show it Secondly, as I commented and as I think was implicit in what Sam was saying earlier, even if they buy them you don't know what else they are doing and to what extent they are selling them As to the question of whether there is going to be enough foreign investment in the United States over the next two years, I think it's a question of the price at which that investment takes place Investment is going to be made in the United States They don't have much choice The question is what combination of interest rates or exchange rates brings that forth If the Japanese want to invest abroad but insist on protecting themselves, then basically they are saying [unintelligible] They have to place yen- denominated investments abroad and someone is going to have to take the other side of that currency position If there are not enough people to take that at the current exchange rates, the rates are going to go lower That's how I think of the model   That's the other point that came up in my conversation with Governor Johnson In some sense, the closer you are to the bottom the more attractive it is to buy In fact, the expectation of appreciation makes it look cheap now   The discount rate is above the postal rate, I think   There has been some responsiveness   Fine, if you can define it "
3181,1987-03-31," Fiscal policy area; we are not in monetary policy  SPEAKER(?) Sam, would you care to speculate at what level of the yen you would think Japanese investors might begin to sell off dollar assets--143, 142?   The reason for that reference, President Guffey, was based on a little history; it was to guard against circumstances in which there was so-called manipulation of exchange rates That was why we might be more aggressive The other point, of course, is that this [directive] has been in existence since 1976 and has covered periods in the past similar to the one we had in the last few days   We make it up, I think, in the short run in two areas When we do the forecast we take a look at some of the factors that go into it Although the effect of the lower growth abroad would be less growth in nonagricultural exports, we also look at prices of those exports Those we had moving up a bit more than we thought was comfortable and, as a result, we tended to offset the price effect on the volume [Unintelligible] lower Looking back over the last 6 months or so, since last July, there has been a substantial decline in [the outlook for] industrial countries; we have 3/4 percent lower level of real GNP at the end of this year than we had last July There you see it more clearly; essentially, the growth effect is quite pronounced There you get another offset because the dollar has been much lower Looking at it from their side, those two [factors] also go together The dollar was about 6 or 8 percent lower than we were thinking it would be last July It's projected to be 6 or 8 percent lower at the end of this forecast period We have gotten a lot of the movement actually [earlier] in the period, so that has had a slight offsetting effect on--   Well, I think it's part of the same [story] Part of the answer to your question about the reasons why growth is weaker abroad is that the dollar has been lower The direct effect of that in the first approximation is neutral [Unintelligible] means weaker net exports, if you want to put it that way The secondary effects, where you get into the big discussion you were just having with Mike but view it from the other side of the pond, [depend on] whether you have the kind of offsetting automatic stabilizers that come along with higher real [income] on the one hand, or on the other  -13-    3/31/87  hand the negative impact on investment intentions and that kind of activity and [economic] activity in general If you have nominal targets for your fiscal policy, for example, and inflation comes in lower, then in fact you might find that [government spending] would get better There could be an offset That tends not to be the case It tends to be a taking of those benefits into the [fiscal] position and lower prices in the fiscal situation give you less of an automatic [stabilizer effect] The third factor, looking back to last July, is that we were cautious about a forecast too strong in terms of exports The models were saying exports were going to be very [strong], so we tended to judgmentally adjust that down because we didn't at that point see much evidence Now, in the second half of the year, the evidence was that US net exports were doing quite well; so, although we still have damped down our [projected] rate of increase in export volume relative to what standing historical relationships might produce, we have damped it somewhat less than we had done before Again, that's one of the factors that is viewed from the side of the trade [balance] as shown on the lower growth [abroad]   Well, these factors net essentially This [unintelligible] but my sense is that clearly it does seem to be strongly negative in both Germany and Japan The investment [is negative], which is one reason why things are being marked out The other factor is that in [Japan and] Germany they both were looking for growth in [exports] this year, and it doesn't look like it's going to be there Maybe it shouldn't even have been there, but they were looking for it The other problem, basically, is the extent to which policy is used to [cushion these effects] We talked about this some earlier [whether] these countries tend to push [policy] given the change in the exchange rates or to respond in terms of supporting the adjustment process, if you want to put it that way The adjustment process coming on the external side may be going along faster than otherwise [anticipated] and that's [negative] In neither Germany nor Japan do you have a sense that policy is out ahead of the adjustment process; it's being forced by the exchange rate [change] Sam Cross noted that in Germany monetary policy is [unchanged] although there is a small [chance of] adjustment in the latter part of the year; fiscal policy adjustment is going to come in January 1988 And in Japan [policy] is paralyzed What little they might be prepared to do, they have essentially been paralyzed by the [political] process And as a result, any fiscal [policy action] or lack thereof that is likely to come along in Japan is not going to be here for another 3 months longer, later than one might have thought it was going to come last December   We didn't really have it in hand in time to put it into the forecast Even with it in hand, we would have to [factor in prospects for] retaliation The other issue is how long it would last even [unintelligible] We did not want to let them have a strong pricing effect, because essentially they are saying [""x""] equals a  -14-    3/31/87  certain amount of supply of imports that are just not going to be there anymore Essentially, it's a question of what the price [response is]; it's going to be [unintelligible] but it's not 100 percent higher; it's [a function of] whatever you think is the [elasticity of the] supply curve absent Japanese suppliers and that's probably not terribly steep   Well, there would be some upward pressure, but not [too large], assuming that the measures are taken and they are permanent and there is no retaliation I think the big risk, which seems to be what the financial markets were reacting to yesterday, is that this could get out of hand There is certainly some risk that it could get out of hand   The list of products is $900 million worth of potential tariffs--various consumer electronic products and those types of things   There is $900 million on the list; $300 million will be chosen and they might choose this side [of that figure] There are two pieces of it $135 million of third market effects and $165 million of Japanese market effects They could choose to do one and not the other   [Unintelligible] was called with the agricultural trade--   That's absolutely the motivation The question is whether, rather than knocking down the barriers, they respond by pushing them higher Then we have [unintelligible] If I had to guess, I would think it's going to move in the direction of the [unintelligible] may not come down $300 million but they might come down [unintelligible] worth and you won't get the retaliation But there is certainly some risk that things will go the other way   Both of those economies are large relative to [their neighbors]--Germany with respect to Europe and Japan with respect to the Far East In fact, in terms of the world economy, the Far East has been one of the brighter spots in terms of overall performance I would think that the issue of negative numbers is not so important The point basically is [not] whether growth is above or below zero; the point is that growth in these countries, which is [unintelligible] at this stage [is slowing], partly because [unintelligible] lagging behind Two percent growth in these countries at a time when non-US [growth rates] are very modest and one was hoping for something like 3 percent--that is 1/3 of the way to zero   We have 1 percent [fourth-quarter to fourth- quarter] for Germany; we have 2 percent for the G-10 countries as a whole  SPEAKER(?) Ted, I recently saw a chart that I think you produced that showed a comparison of the growth of real GNP and domestic demand in Japan It was surprising to me, and also very dramatic, that their domestic demand was growing at a rate twice that of GNP, I think   All of these countries have had quite good growth in domestic demand The problem and the puzzle is--and we looked at this before the February chart show because I was puzzled as to when [unintelligible]--we didn't seem to see corresponding things I would say as professionally as we could [figure out] the numbers as to basically what happened in 1986, there seemed to be a counterpart with the developing countries--the oil and non-oil producing developing countries--in 1986 rather than the United States OPEC pumped a lot more oil last year and the price went down We all bought it Their price went down and they cut back on their [imports] Of course, then the terms of trade were going against other developing countries, [not] like Japan So domestic demand has [generally] been holding up reasonably well, but the overall level also has been on a downtrend and that's-- "
3214,1987-05-19," You are right, sir   Definitely, and Italy   Yes "
3240,1987-07-07," Governor Johnson, I'd note that most of this deterioration in the current account in the staff forecast is in the non-trade current account items It is true that there's a slight deterioration in the trade balance, which is based on one month, but it's essentially flat--   That's right But the current account number for the second quarter isn't going to appear until September--even assuming that we are right   I would say that April was somewhat over- interpreted--that is, as listed in the forecast That [deficit] number on a balance-of-payments basis was something like [an annual rate of] $140 billion and we have a little over $150 billion for the quarter as a whole We think that May and June will be not as good as April, but not dramatically different in terms of the monthly figures But to the extent that the market has been extrapolating the trend as the numbers came down in February, March, and April, even a leveling off [in the trade deficit] might produce some degree of disappointment   Well, I think the answer to your question is not terribly robust As that chart that I referred to shows, for those countries the growth is in the 2 percent range, on average Growth in domestic demand is somewhat faster The current situation presents a somewhat mixed picture Germany, after a very weak first quarter, which was partly a seasonal weakness that is not seasonally adjusted [in the statistics], seems to have moved quite rapidly in the first couple of months of the second quarter, according to the available data Unfortunately, Germany has shown more strength in their external accounts than one might want to see from our perspective Japan, on the other hand, had a better first quarter and things seem to have become a little soggier in the second quarter However, they have put in place the fiscal package that was announced just after the last FOMC meeting, and that was somewhat more than we had expected That has led us to boost our forecast of growth in Japan for this year and next year So, we have real growth in the 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent range in that country and in the 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent range in Germany The somewhat prolonged slowdown in growth in Germany does seem to be having some effects on the rest of western Europe I think the projection for France also has been marked down in recent months The only country in western Europe that seems to be doing quite well is the United Kingdom It all depends on how you read these things, but that in part seems to reflect a boost from the depreciation of the pound last year and the somewhat easier fiscal policy--they wouldn't describe it that way--that they seem to have gone into this year We do see some drop-off in growth in 1988, in part reflecting the fact    7/7/87  that the economy has recovered this year And as far as Canada is concerned, we see things largely dependent on [unintelligible]; so you find growth in the 2 percent area next year On balance, it's not much of a favorable picture and [there's] not much scope or willingness to foster very much [further growth] We have built into the forecast some further downward adjustment in the interest rates in these countries, though I would say it's quite modest, presumably triggered by a discount [rate cut] or [unintelligible] some exchange market pressures to bring that about Aside from the Japanese fiscal package, which we assume will pass before the [unintelligible] go into effect, and the German tax cut that comes in the first quarter of next year, we really have no other major policy that--   Yes, and that has deteriorated noticeably but not in demand for right now Since April, for example, we have [been projecting] a deterioration in the current account next year of roughly $4 billion for the [unintelligible] of the developing countries That reflects the influence of somewhat weaker growth in the industrial world and somewhat higher interest rates and slightly better commodity prices, on average, at least relative to early April where the [unintelligible] occur But that effect has been negative-- much of it coming from interest rate assumptions Now, that's not enough to upset the apple cart, but it could rebalance the apples in the cart   It depends a bit on what else goes along with that, in particular whether the dollar leveling off and presumably a little less inflationary pressure would lead to the same kind of interest rate projection or trend or a somewhat easier one But, an obviously easier one needs to result in more gain on income In terms of where you would be in the fourth quarter of next year, it would mean roughly between $20 and $30 billion, depending on which assumption you make on the real net export side And it would be maybe between $5 and $10 billion on the current account side by the end of the projection period to keep GNP unchanged In the worst case, using the higher number in terms of losses, if you keep GNP unchanged and you get the $10 billion and $30 billion (nominal and real)--if you essentially let the tighter policy show through--given the passage of the exchange rate pressures, you would lose a half percentage point or so on the level of GNP You'll get $5 to $10 billion off--   First, I think the answer to that question, and then you can ask Mike of course, is that domestic demand in these countries is growing faster--by 1/2 percentage point or more--than production in these countries And it is the difference between domestic demand and production that is absorbing the net imports It is generated not so much by relative income effects because of growth but price effects To put it more clearly, it's the other side of the gap we had in the early 1980s between domestic demand and production, against a background in which domestic demand will be growing more  -17-    7/7/87  slowly There is less help from income effects; [we're] relying to a considerable extent on the price effects that produce increases in exports And as I noted, one particular problem in that area has to do with the role of protectionism, in a generalized sense, in weakening the link between relevant price changes and foreign exchange Of course, part of the protectionism thrust comes from a ""soggy"" or not terribly dynamic world economy   First of all, the growth we are anticipating over this forecast period is not much different than we've had over the past four quarters, and we have only a slightly faster pace for growth of non-agricultural exports, as we are all aware So we're not relying a lot on that further pickup in the rate of increase of our non-agricultural exports   I believe that we're better off, in some sense, than if they had chosen for their own reasons not to accelerate the tax cut in Germany and not to adopt the fiscal stimulus in the case of Japan But that's not enough to boost the overall level of production in those countries; in fact, as I've commented, looking out into 1988 we now see domestic demand slowing a bit further   I share your nervousness   All I was trying to suggest was that that's a reason why we don't have prices going up There was some further secular decline in US production and the leveling off of some of the production in other non-OPEC sources of supply like the North Seas But there was at the same time [unintelligible] on the production side of the equation ex OPEC And given some growth in GNP and production around the world--it's not bulging but it adds to demand, with the elasticity of something between 3/4 and 1 percent So the question is whether that differential is going to be absorbed by the substantial excess capacity in OPEC, in particular in the Middle East, abstracting from military installations [unintelligible] If it's going to be absorbed by Saudi Arabia increasing its revenues by increasing production--which it clearly has the scope to do if it wants to--that is one scenario What happens to [unintelligible] in that way to stabilize prices and to not cause the kind of run-up in prices that would bring a presumption of exploration around the world in non-OPEC  -21-    7/7/87  sources of supply That is another scenario--a small gradual increase of 1 million barrels a day roughly in the demand for OPEC oil, which could easily be accommodated by OPEC itself   So far it's down something like 600,000 barrels a day The numbers are not great on this And we have another couple of hundred built into the forecast   Yes, of about $20 billion   One of the problems is that these statements are in nominal terms If you look at the real terms you get a somewhat different picture because the real adjustment on the external side is--   Right, but the resource allocation implications of the reallocation exercise are more difficult, in some sense, on the financial side They do get more reshuffling [unintelligible] side "
3265,1987-08-18," I don't have anything to add to Mr Cross' comments   In nominal terms, you have a slight weakness We are expecting, after all, that in the translation that you go through, we will end up later this month with a trade balance for the second quarter which is essentially the same, in nominal terms, as we had in the first quarter But you would still have some small improvement in the second quarter in real terms on top of improvements in both the first quarter and the fourth quarter [of last year] Basically, the effect of the sustained period of exchange rate depreciation that we have had, despite the slower growth abroad which you quite correctly point to, is now giving an added boost; in fact, it's striking something off   That is correct   In the third quarter, we think we're going to have this special effect with the oil--   Beyond that, we expect essentially the same forecast as this time--most of it accounted for by the exchange rate depreciation, taking account of the weak growth abroad   Governor Seger, we have not raised our oil price assumption for next year; in fact, it's the same one we had in February So, in some sense, you have to have some drawback in order for our forecast to be correct Obviously, there are some risks we were talking about the risk that the OPEC agreement that they made late last year would fall apart and that--   Well, that's one of the reasons why you're damned if you do, and damned if you don't; it's one of the reasons why    8/18/87  we had essentially stuck with an assumption that was close to what they were targeting six or eight months ago What will come out over this forecast period, not certainly that there was cheating among-- The real issue has to do with the behavior of the key producers in the Gulf region--[whether] Saudi Arabia, just as it is now producing more oil, will cut back sufficiently to sustain the price at something like $18 a barrel One of the factors which is [unintelligible] production over this period more than is necessary to take off being driven by the stockpiling   In the short run, I think it's going to be the other way "
3289,1987-09-22," I don't think that should govern [unintelligible] If you look at outside forecasts that go into detail on real exports you will [not] find that much difference between [unintelligible] and exports over the forecast horizon from ours Generally, they do show very substantial declines over the period DRI, for example, has something very close, almost shockingly close, to what we have    9/22/87 -6-   Well, the truth of the matter is, President Boehne, that there are some examples where this has been successful A lot of them come from the early 1980s and, of course, during that period where you had essentially [slow growth of] GNP without going through a recession--that is essentially the question you are asking-- in a relatively short period of time There are several examples in    9/22/87  the early 1980s and, of course, those were [unintelligible] The other side of the equation, which you mentioned, is faster growth in the rest of the world, which was then the United States And there are some other examples We did look at this record about 18 months ago and that is basically what it showed   Germany and Japan [unintelligible] We tend to forget that they had deficits in the late 1970s and at the beginning of the 1980s They moved from small deficits to very large surpluses One feature of the forecast is that, while we don't have a recession in a GNP sense built in, we do have relatively slow growth in domestic demand In fact, we have a quite dramatic slowing of domestic demand built into this forecast In some sense, as Peter was saying earlier in answer to your question, that's part of the process--the process that makes room for this external adjustment in an environment in which growth of production as a whole is kept relatively high but domestic demand growth is low   It depends a bit, I think, on what else is going on at the same time Much of the impetus to net exports from the dollar, at least as far as this forecast horizon goes, is what is already in train Less than half of the increase next year in net exports is directly traceable to a further projected dollar decline But, presumably, if you didn't have the dollar decline, then you wouldn't have the same kind of pressures on interest rates So you would have less pressures in the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy So you have some compensation in terms of the economy's operation as a whole which, in turn, would tend to feed back again on the net exports, so you would have less improvement in net exports too But, there is a certain sense of [unintelligible] that is basically the way we think about this   Under that scenario, maybe instead of a $50 billion change in net exports you would have something like $20-$25 billion So you would have less than 1 percent of GNP in this forecast, and that's well within the error Mike put it that way in the overall forecast   If I remember, it was just about 100; maybe I'm off by a few points The non-oil price deflator was running about 1003 in the second quarter   Well, you would get some impact, I guess, from that   I don't know about extraordinary; maybe some of the comments earlier suggested that One problem is that, to the extent you get this going on, you're producing things which, of course, you're shipping abroad; and you don't see it showing up in consumption and things like that And that is part of the adjustment that President Boehne was talking about You are not going through a recession actually, but you are going through a much slower growth in [economic] welfare, as measured in current consumption   Their long-term rates essentially rose during that period   Their long-term real interest rates rose during that period "
3346,1987-12-15," With respect to the Canadians, part of what you said is certainly correct they had a longer time period They didn't adjust [each year]; they didn't always go from fourth quarter to fourth quarter   That is correct They abandoned the target partly for exchange rate reasons, because it was so sensitive, but there also was the conflict between the relationship of the monetary aggregates to the economy relative to what they were [unintelligible] the exchange rates The main reason they abandoned it was because the relationship between the aggregates and nominal GNP broke down for financial deregulation reasons And, in fact--   Well, for a long period of time They abandoned it in 1982, five years ago I don't know if they can go back, particularly to something like an M2 target, because they have this financial deregulation in mind to play with It is true that they had a somewhat longer horizon, though I don't think you described it exactly the way--   They had different base points And sometimes they extended the targets longer into a year, until they changed the base, and then they went back and picked up a new base I think it would be rather difficult for us to do that, given the structure of Humphrey-Hawkins; I suppose it might be more difficult to do it for Humphrey-Hawkins Also, the base period could be varied--like taking the base in the second quarter and projecting up to the end of 1988 That would put you partly in the Canadian-Japanese [unintelligible]   We have taken a look at this question recently in trying to get a better handle on domestic production costs and how they have been moving in some of these countries over the last several years The work that we've done suggests that there probably has been more saving on domestic production costs than aggregate measures of prices in some of these countries would suggest That, in turn, would suggest that there has been less of a [decline in] profit margins than a 50 percent decline in the dollar would lead one to think initially, though all things working together do produce the results that you'd like, President Boehne As a consequence, we have had less price increase and less decrease in quantity on the import side, though most of the aggregate equations have price elasticities that are close to 1 So, in terms of the trade balance and what you have to finance, it washes out You get less price and, therefore, you get less quantity adjustment Anyhow, the mix is a little different As far as our forecast is concerned, partly based upon these considerations and perhaps some reluctance to project these trends in the future, as well as some factors like the rise in commodity prices, which have increased more over the last eighteen months than over the previous eighteen months, we have projected a much more rapid rise in import prices in the forecast period than we've had to date   My sense is that the forecasts, essentially, [unintelligible] If anything, the prognostications are for an increasing rate of decline Last year you might have seen something projected in the 3 to 5 percent range; now you frequently are seeing it built into the international component of a blue chip business They are talking about an expected 10 percent decline through the end of 1988, or whatever point they set, whereas a year ago they were saying in the 5 percent range Forecasters were wrong about the turning point If anything, in that part of the market they are projecting a more rapid decline than they had been before by maybe--   The rate of decline against the G-10 countries is something on the order of 1 or 2 percent over the next year If you look at just the yen market, it's on the order of three or four percent So that's not anything like this Essentially, that's where we have been for the last 2-1/2 years   A little less than 10 percent against the yen   Including the question of [unintelligible], the closest thing to getting legislation without legislation [Unintelligible] that Taiwan in particular enjoys, [unintelligible] all the events you have cited [unintelligible] legislation   [Unintelligible] Mr Volcker's speech   President Black, President Hoskins' question is that if the intervention has no effect, then the switching from dollars to DM also has no effect, other than the effect on psychology Essentially, if it doesn't work, it doesn't work   Well, Governor Seger, as Mike said, most of the disappointment was on the nonagricultural export side The press was disappointed by the imports, and if there was a surprise it was in the oil That seems to build up imports of products, which seem to fall into the inventories, and I could tell a better story [unintelligible] statistical effect in the first half of 1988 The surprise was on the side of the nonagricultural exports and if that's a true indication of the trend, then obviously they are much weaker than the outlook that we have [unintelligible] I don't think there's anything in the anecdotal evidence that suggests that month is anything other than a fluke; but if the next two months of the quarter begin to look like October, then I would be worried about the outlook   Well, we think we will have something close to $40 billion or a bit less in nonagricultural exports, in 1982 dollars, over the four quarters of 1987; and we have a little more in [our forecast for] next year In percentage terms it is slightly less, but with a higher base it's essentially the same pattern of growth as over the four quarters of 1987 Now, there are people who have forecasts that are much more optimistic than ours We have tried to be a bit conservative That's not to say that we can't have a boom in exports, but not an explosive pattern And the forecast, while it probably is off by several billion dollars one way or the other, is a reasonable projection, I think I am much more comfortable about making the forecast for the four quarters of 1988 than I was a year ago when I was making a similar forecast for the four quarters of 1987   Essentially, we have had nonagricultural exports right on--plus or minus a few billion dollars--since the beginning of the year   There was some slight offset in GNP terms but where we have been wrong has been on the nominal import side because we haven't had the price, we haven't had the quantity trade balances [unintelligible] We've had more imports; therefore, the statistical GNP has been not quite what we thought it would  -51-    12/15-16/87   We went back maybe about $4 or $5 billion Now again, part of that is in oil [Unintelligible] because consumption picked up on that side; and on the export side, if you don't take the [unintelligible] out of production, the exports going into inventories might drop by a billion dollars, in 1982 dollars, in the fourth quarter; so we have [net exports] going down from $185 billion to $13 to $14-1/2 billion GNP [basis]--   Mr Chairman, the one thing I want to say about this is that it's got 1 percent more growth abroad than any foreign official is prepared to target   And, if you put their growth not at 3-1/2 percent, but at 1-1/2 to 2 percent--which has been the experience so far--then I think you get a very different set of scenarios "
3357,1988-01-05," To put it the other way around, Mr Chairman, if the Committee were to tighten policy because of what's going on in the foreign exchange market, then that fact would have to be reflected in the discussion in the policy record, as has been the case in the past So, I think people who are knowledgeable about our procedures would know that the absence of any statement that there was any tightening because of the dollar would be left with the interpretation that there wasn't That's essentially the status quo That's certainly the way it was done, for example, in September The September action--that that tightening was, in part, associated with the conditions in late August in the foreign exchange market--was clearly acknowledged in the policy record "
3381,1988-02-09," Yes, [unintelligible]   Well, I think it's puzzling If you ask the Germans why they're high, they say that German savers won't accept interest rates that are lower than 6 percent because they assume that the long-term inflation rate will be much higher than it is currently No matter how you talk your way around that, that's the answer you get back And it is true that even during the last year, or a couple of years, when [market] interest rates have come down, [rates] have stayed above 6 percent In fact, this series that we used here slightly understates the movements in rates, because it's an average of all longer-term or under ten-year public authority issues And some of it is much less than ten years in maturity So we have some sluggishness in that series For example, for the ten-year bonds they have outstanding, the rate is above 6 percent, about 6-1/4 percent It has come down a bit more than that series itself showed recently, but it is still very high And other than the savings story, some people would point to some critical imperfections and cartelization of the financial markets in Germany; but it's not much of an explanation   Well, it's a little less than 10 percent, depending where you start out from    2/9-10/88   Yes, but a lot of that you had by the time of the December 22 Greenbook So the change from the average in January is under 10 percent That is, in fact, one of the reasons why we presented the last chart here with this middle panel on it So you'd not think somehow the dollar is really the problem, the way we set it up was to say, this is what the impact would be--you wouldn't see very much difference for 1988 But at a minimum, as I said in my comments, if the dollar is not going to go down, you're not going to get much difference [as may be seen] from that chart And [if] everybody seems happy with the current account deficit, as we have it, then they're probably going to have less than we thought Then looking forward to 1989, you might want to have an easier monetary policy--that's what that chart was designed to deal with--where the stronger dollar is brought about not by any difference in the policy assumption but by what the staff sometimes calls a levitation It's a risky business forecasting exchange rates, and we have to make some sort of assumption I find it more useful to make an assumption that eventually more price adjustment will have to take place But there's no reason why it is essential, within the time frame of the forecast, for a lot of adjustment to be in the pipeline If the world could stand still why [unintelligible] places we are? That's one of the reasons why we have, on the one hand ""more moderate"" as we have sometimes said in the past, [unintelligible] On the other hand, we presented this alternative scenario for the four quarters   Well, that forecast is only slightly different from the one for this year And the ""export boom"" itself is only, essentially, the same as we had in 1987   Apart from Japan, it doesn't seem to have helped   To give you an example, I think one number we came up with was something like $2 billion plus If we spread that out over the four quarters, lets say, of 1988, it's well within the noise factor on the monthly trade numbers So it may be there; in some sense, it is built into the forecast because we have a lower level of imports in general--that's part of the cost of production But, in the first half of the year, based on what we know now, it's not going to show up decisively in the import numbers And, therefore, we are not going to set off a mini-cycle in the rest of the world   Well, I wouldn't want to suggest that the difference between 2 percent growth and zero wouldn't have an effect on our forecast It would be something on the order of [unintelligible] If you had 1 percent lower growth throughout this period in G-10 countries, we would say it could produce something like $13 billion, at an annual rate, lower growth of exports in the fourth quarter of 1989 That would be next year against this year That would have a considerable impact on the forecast That's relatively small, but it would be noticeable in terms of our output, especially to the extent that in some sense you have so much external stimulus-- one thing that the forecast itself doesn't completely recognize In a sense we have export-led growth here, and some of the income out of that is being driven by that growth, and so you have multiplier effects   Yes The problem, as with many of these series, was that the series got to be so bad and unrelated to anything that you thought they were predicting There was a big powwow--in the early '80s, I think--to figure out what to do with them The advice of the staff at the time was either improve them or throw them out  SPEAKER(?) They did the latter?   [Yes]   It was one of those series that just did not have enough--  -22-    2/9-10/88 "
3405,1988-03-29," The question is whether institutions themselves would be supporting the dollar in this period, since it also affects the institutions--not just the ones that are accepting the 15% rule but the ones that are on a mark-to-market basis [unintelligible] particular interest    3/29/88   It may affect the general institutions a lot more across the board   This is an impressive movement with a [unintelligible] for the large banks  SPEAKER(?) Right   In fact, they have been progressively tightening over the last several months and this [unintelligible] they've obviously done their [unintelligible] this is one more out of about 3 or 4 now this seems to have been [unintelligible]   Yes, the research has been done--much of it here--and some of it was in the report on intervention that was done multilaterally The actual report on intervention was done by [the G- 7 central banks and finance ministers] and suggested that sterilized intervention may be effective in the short run but was not likely to have lasting effects We do end up somewhat tied into a semantic problem, in that it's a little hard to say there was $100 billion or $150 billion of intervention last year and it had no effect whatsoever I think that the thrust of the research might say that it had some effect, but it's on the whole--small [unintelligible]   [Statement--see Appendix]   In the forecast, where we have a decline in the dollar at an annual rate of a little less than 10 percent occurring smoothly over the forecast period, that's not a big factor, vis-a-vis an absolutely stable dollar, because half of it comes after the first part of 1989 Remember now, inflation is a little higher than it was earlier With a situation in which you have something like a 10 percent decline in the first quarter of 1988, the rule of thumb-- taking into account feedback effects, such as a damping in demand abroad and increased demand here--would say that that would add 2 to 3 percent to the level of goods output in the fourth quarter of next year Goods output is now running $16 trillion in 1982 dollars It's a nontrivial amount, but most of it is in 1989 But that's the aggregate amount; it's certainly true that you could well get severe pressures in particular industries   Roughly, yes   It would be investment   Yes Right "
3451,1988-06-29," I think you're right The first part of the period and before the last meeting they were moving the other way,   And they moved back over the short and long ends in the last couple of weeks   To some [extent] that's a reaction of the market--the other side of what's going on in the exchange market It's difficult to disentangle the movement that's essentially the [unintelligible] from the exchange rate expectations   We're just distinguishing between the period up to the Summit, if you want to put it that way--during which there was a gradual movement--and what came after that, whether kicked off by the Summit communique or other factors or sort of a general sense of reassessing these factors and what they implied for longer-term trends But we've had the phenomenon of short covering, and that in itself could--   We have these informal limits of 12--    6/29-30/88   $12 billion, but because the evidence--   They could work--   There are also [unintelligible], of course, the Committee's Procedural Instructions, which limit the amount of operations within daily and--   It works on both sides   Actually, Governor Angell, I think implicitly in his report Sam said that, because there was a growing sense of exchange rate stability during the first part of the period [Funds] were, therefore, then moved into the higher interest rate currencies This is consistent with your proposition--if there was exchange rate stability it [unintelligible] shift from pressure on one or more rates You would expect to see some adjustment in interest rates and that's simply what Sam is saying in response to President Parry's question and yours The question is how firmly held those expectations are and how long they're going to be sustained   No, I think it's down a little, to 4 percent   I think you're probably right as far as December is concerned You may remember that October, November, December had a considerable decline in it So from the December level you're probably right, but from the aggregate in the fourth quarter--   Annual rate   Oh, it's 11 or 12 percent "
3492,1988-08-16," Mr Chairman, in the Jurgensen report, it's fair to say that group did not really examine closely, in a statistical sense, the effectiveness of intervention in the framework that President Corrigan is putting forward In fact, it concluded that in the very short run there was some case for the effectiveness of intervention, and that I think is close to what President Corrigan has said is a testable proposition That's about all you can say Translating that in terms of the early 1980s, and the notion that some central banks then had--and even now have--a practice of being in the market in order to constantly provide a sense of two-way risk [unintelligible] The Bank of Canada, for example, follows a strategy of that type And from time-to-time the Bank of England has done it, although not recently And that was recognized as one motivation for intervention that was different from a motivation designed to alter the medium-term course of exchange rates And I think President    8/16/88  Corrigan is now commenting on the merits--saying that in some situations, there might be a case for intervention, even recognizing that in terms of altering the medium-term course of exchange rates, a sterilized intervention is likely to be singularly ineffective   I will cover that in the next--   Well yes, I think to some extent it was because, as I mentioned, we were encouraged by what we had seen in the first half of this year So, given that, along with other anecdotes and so forth and so on, we have carried a bit more of that through to the second half of the year And, in effect, that attenuates some of the effect of the dollar alone on the forecast So we scaled it back a little bit on the basis of an assessment of what the appreciation to date has achieved for us, or how much it's going to achieve for us   That's right   It could also be a little more I must say you try to put it down and--   Essentially, they are very close, [even] with the revision Although the June number is ""bad"", the May revision was quite large and in fact if anything, the two together were a little better than we expected in our forecast They were a little worse than what was implicit in the GNP numbers But it translates to something like maybe a 10th or two at an annual rate on the second- quarter real GNP So that's not going to change anything And both components pretty much matched up with what we suspected   Yes The number would be exact I think that number, if I may put it that way, had less impact on us than normal I wouldn't--   For the monetary policy side, we have interest rates abroad rising at about half the amount that they do here over the forecast period   Yes, that's right So, that may be between 1/2 and 3/4 of a percentage point on short-term rates abroad over the forecast period On the fiscal policy side, we don't have anything built in of a particularly stimulative nature in any of those countries As you know, there's a slight expectation that fiscal policy in Germany will be coming in tighter in this forecast horizon "
3518,1988-09-20," There's only two things to say about the model over the forecast period One is that in talking about trade these days, we have found that you have to sort out the effects of business machinery on both the import and export sides On the export side in the model, we may be slightly more--well, actually, not even that much more--optimistic than the models we use Taking the second quarter as a base, we have improvement of $40 billion in the volume of non- agricultural, non-business machine exports; and the model that we use has just improvement of $36 billion So, the order of magnitude is quite small on that side and I think it's roughly the same on the non- petroleum volume It's about the same in terms of the changes that we produce The other thing that's going on is that, starting from the second quarter of 1989, you get improvement on the volume side in the agricultural exports--which gives you a boost in this period when we total these figures That's a special factor   We don't have a lot of optimism In part, the optimism that we have is built into the level that has been associated with the first half of this year We have to acknowledge that perhaps the first half has performed better than the models would produce for the year And we had chosen not to take [unintelligible] In that sense you have maybe more of a catch up with the [unintelligible] the first half of the year To say one more thing On the import side, we have increasingly tried to relate business machinery, which is quantitatively very important in GNP terms, to the forecast for business fixed investment in general So that's driven in large part by that forecast and our assessment of a large portion of that [unintelligible] is sort of how the world markets for computers seem to be developing [unintelligible]   Well, we didn't The official forecasts have been revised up; they lagged way behind the data We have not changed our forecast In fact, this morning the Japanese GNP number came out for the second quarter, which shows a decline of 39 percent at an annual rate; That is largely statistical We had built in a decline of 2 percent at an annual rate So that's a [unintelligible] Our sense is that, if anything--although we have about the same outlook over the six quarters of the forecast--it is at a materially subdued rate relative to what we've seen And that's largely because we have a tighter monetary policy picture for most of these countries, and most of the countries are moving in the direction of fiscal restraint Germany, the UK, and Japan are basically moving in the direction of    9/20/88  fiscal restraint over the forecast period And then you have that tightening monetary policy move   That's largely a function of the capital gains effects You had net capital gains in the current accounts--I don't remember these numbers, but on the order of plus $15 billion--last year because as the dollar declined you had a favorable valuation effect on foreign investments And this year, with the dollar appreciation, we are estimating a loss of $4 billion The swing is essentially $20 billion in capital gains for this year versus last year And that swing is what generates the investment income Next year, with a much milder decline of the dollar--although we have a smaller positive factor--the swing is not nearly so important There are some other special factors this year, including the fact there has been a tax ruling on foreign investments in the United States that requires them to report them as income deferred tax liabilities That will generate a reported increase in income this year, and that's already in the third quarter And that shows up as an outflow last year and will reverse [unintelligible] a bit next year when you get a positive net effect And that's the main--   You said there were two questions   The decline in the dollar is fairly gradual over the course of 1989 There's very little effect--essentially zero--in terms of the forecast of the real economy coming from that factor It will begin to have an effect as you go off into 1990 Even the forecast of the dollar that we have using conventional models You can have essentially an improvement in the trade balance falling out as you go into early 1990 if you just stop the exchange rate where it would be in the fourth quarter of 1989 If you stopped it where it is today, we would fall out earlier That's something in the trade balance of around $100 billion, depending on what happens to growth differentials--if things turn around and begin to deteriorate, or if our growth is approximately the same as that of the rest of the    9/20/88  industrial world But the forecast itself is not heavily dependent in this time horizon on the course of the dollar   Maybe I ought to do that The forecast for the dollar is largely driven by the view that ultimately you have to have substantially smaller trade and current account deficits than we have now The exchange rate adjustment will be part of what brings that about We don't have any strong view about when we're going to get it, but it would be over the next five years, say So in building the forecast we have tended to put in a moderate decline in the dollar as a background factor, which does not have a big role in the short run but it is the direction of where we think the pressure is going to be, as I said in my answer to the question from Governor Seger In producing the forecast we tried to, in some sense, trim that longer- term view by what our assumptions about monetary policy here and others [unintelligible] Over the past several meetings of the Committee we have tended to adjust up our forecast of the dollar; we have less of a decline in the dollar cumulatively over the period for basically two reasons One is that the trade performance has been better than we--and I think a lot of people--expected Therefore, in some sense, the amount of adjustment you need in this process is less So you don't have to build much into the medium-term framework We have moved the dollar up because the presumed stance of monetary policy has been somewhat tighter But over this immediate horizon, we have the dollar flat, essentially, over the balance of this year That is associated with a view that there's a perception of policy as being tighter But as we move into 1989, there inevitably will be some slowing in the pace of current account adjustments from what we've had over the past three or four quarters, and we would expect to get some reemerging pressures on the dollar despite the increase in the interest rates that we have had We have tried in a very crude way to talk about what it would take to stabilize the dollar, and it is a difficult question to answer convincingly--as I explained in the first part of my answer--if you view the dollar's course as being driven by medium-term factors But the answer comes out somewhat like the answer to Governor Angell's question That you need more than monetary restraint in the short run [unintelligible] the dollar "
3534,1988-10-17," Well, I plan, Mr Chairman, not to go into all the details [See Appendix for an outline of Mr Truman's remarks, which were not transcribed]   Next year?   The new Mexican administration is not looking for very much growth next year; maybe things will pick up in the second half of the year--something on the order of 1 to 2 percent at most   Maybe the Vice Chairman of the Board would like to comment on the monetary policy, but the measures that were announced on Saturday are ones that are to be implemented by this current administration--on both the fiscal side and the privatization side and with respect to monetary policy   I should emphasize that in the second part of this agreement  And I would hope that members of the Committee would please keep it to themselves, so to speak But that part of it, as the Board's Vice Chairman said, is only if they fail in holding the exchange rate; only then would the second part come in   I think you can be confident that if it fails there will have to be a rise in interest rates, too, at least in the short run   Well, in addition they face, potentially, a very large further shift in their terms of trade   A normal way to deal with that--   The disbursement of the bridge loan would depend upon having in place the appropriate loan arrangements--the appropriate loan of the World Bank and the IMF to bridge to There would be no disbursements on the bridge, at a minimum, until there was agreement on that That stage of agreement is, I think, a little open at this time, and that would be subsequently negotiated But essentially it [would be an] agreement that, yes, Mexico would qualify for compensatory financing That might be done serially--in sequence Or they might qualify for one of three structural loans, one a structural adjustment loan, and two large sectoral adjustment loans from the World Bank   No, that's different; you may be remembering Argentina These are three new loans; they've had a program over the last two years of so-called structural adjustment loans But these would be three new loans that they are in process now of negotiating One is a structural adjustment loan addressed broadly at macroeconomic policy and deregulation; the others are an industrial restructuring loan and a public enterprise loan, both dealing with reforms in the public enterprise sector   A representative of the new president--I should have mentioned this earlier--the senior economic advisor to the new president was a participant at the meeting In that sense, you have a little more commitment to the process than you would if he wasn't participating at the meeting And he was on the phone several times to New York   Well, the first-phase budget cuts and the privatization program are essentially under the control of the outgoing government You'd probably have a document which details the privatization program--what stages some of them are in, or bids that have already been let, and some of them in process of development, and so forth and so on And the monetary policy is under the control, so to speak, of the finance ministry and the central bank until the first of December   Well, I'll let the Chairman comment on the last question The two places where the Federal Reserve appears in this press release are in the first sentence and the last sentence The first sentence is, ""The US Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve welcome the economic measures recently announced by the Government of Mexico""--that's the four points that I described about the fiscal policy action, privatization, the tighter monetary policy, and the applications to the Fund for compensatory drawings I should emphasize on that last point that the importance of that is that it forces the Mexican authorities to enter into conversations about other policy actions extending into 1989 that the Fund feels are appropriate    10/17/88  to their circumstances The last sentence, with explicit reference to the Federal Reserve, says ""Accordingly, the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve are prepared to develop a short-term bridge loan of up to $35 billion, depending on the development of loan programs by Mexico with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund"" And that was the question that I guess Governor Heller asked about the staging of all this and the ""depending on"" clause  As far as the precedents for the Federal Reserve's being involved in these kinds of operations, there are some--in large part because we do have, and have had for 20 years, a swap line with the Bank of Mexico On previous occasions like this, the Federal Reserve has participated alongside the Treasury Department in providing this type of short-term financial support to Mexico We did it in 1976; we did it in 1982-83; we did it in 1986; and it's proposed that we should do it now It is my personal view that these things have normally been relatively successful, though that clearly depends on one's standards of success   As soon as we finish this meeting, assuming [the Committee's view] is positive, it would be released by the Treasury Department Are you planning on [releasing] it?    10/17/88   And Joe Coyne will release it here as well [See Appendix for a copy of the press release issued]   We will do that   Not at this stage If, and this depends a lot on the future course of oil prices and whether this works and so forth, if you get involved in a full blown IMF program, then there would have to be--or one would expect there to be--a bank financing package along side that If things do stabilize both in terms of the Mexican economy and the oil price and they merely go forward, which they will in any case with these World Bank loans, it is contemplated that there would be some parallel lending of a modest size that would go along with that over the next two or three years, but not a big jumbo loan in the next several months   Their usable reserves are something between at the moment And their total reserves are  about larger than that I think the chances of catching the shorts off guard is primarily through the announcement effect that's been mentioned earlier and the monetary policy actions that are expected to follow up on that this week And to the extent that their government, both the outgoing government and--based on the speech last night--the incoming government, convey a notion of following through, then there's some chance that the situation will stabilize   Some of these operations are financed through debt-for-equity swaps Some of them are in the pipeline now They have not approved any new ones in the last year or so, though there is talk of their reopening that program in a mild way But I would expect that some of these do involve debt-for-equity swap operations in one form or another "
3560,1988-11-01," I think the international understandings-- whether the authorities will consider intervention--in fact are part of the framework for international economic cooperation that is designed to deal with common international problems And there is a considerable [range of] views about how large those problems are and what the price [unintelligible] to be and how effective some various [approaches] are in doing so But as the major industrial countries [unintelligible] of the growth-driven process try to deal with large imbalances [unintelligible] this process of intervention that we've been involved in will be as noticed as [unintelligible] to the exchange rates over the various parts of that But the price to this Committee seems to be the more risky case in saying you don't know better, or if you don't know then you can't concentrate or think about it, is the risk that comes along with the accusations of [benign neglect] about US policy in the past And you're just watchful In fact, you'd probably argue that if we are going to solve our financial problems, we're going to have to do so on our own   You do, but both arguments are indivisible, when put that way in terms of economics It is true that if the economy is weaker, interest rates go down or may go down and lower the attractiveness of the dollar But it also is true that if the economy is weaker, then the economy can absorb more aggregate demand [stemming from a] depreciation So if it were economists who were trading [in the exchange markets], let me put it that way, then [unintelligible] and it may not even be convincing or have anything to do with what we're doing But at the same time, it would tend to be a motivating force in correcting the trade balance   Thank you, Mr Chairman I'll try to be brief Basically, I have three points The first is about developments in the last two weeks or so Over the 11 business days since the announcement of the willingness of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury to develop a short-term bridge loan for Mexico's economic policies, Now, that compares with over the previous two weeks In the first week, in fact, oil prices remained relatively firm, and short-term interest rates were pushed up by 200 basis points to 45-1/2 percent Last week oil prices eased, interest rates were left unchanged, and so indeed  and I guess we would not be surprised if interest rates rose after today's auction  The second point has to do with where we stand on the documentation for this proposed bridge loan It is assumed in our review with the Bank of Mexico and the Mexican government that it will involve, as we now envisage the situation, a new special System swap arrangement for $1-1/4 billion on which various amounts would be drawn successively I would describe successive [drawings] as bridging to various IMF drawings in advance of payments for oil for the strategic petroleum reserve and World Bank loans Those drawings would [not] be made until the sources of repayment were reasonably assured And each would go on to--, be made on a new swap line with the Exchange  -18-    11/1/88  Stabilization Fund of the same size The remaining $1 billion of the arrangement would use the existing Federal Reserve and ESF swap lines and  We expect to have the technical details fully agreed in a couple of weeks at which time we would ask the Committee for its formal concurrence of those arrangements  The last point would be that Normand Bernard sent out to the Committee a paper by Ives Maroni on Mexico's economic situation and prospects I hope it was informative, and I'd be glad to respond to any questions   Well, I'm trying to be optimistic about it It's a guess The General Counsel is nodding 'yes' and he's--   On the first point, there was some activity in advance; and we, the Federal Reserve, have had a swap line with the Bank of Mexico since 1967 In fact, over that 20-year period the Bank of Mexico frequently has turned to us for short-term bridges and swap drawings, whatever you want to call them The reasons for that swap line have something to do with the financial, political, and economic interaction between our two countries   No Well, traditionally the swap network was a Federal Reserve operation It is true that the Treasury has a swap line too, but in every case going back at least as long as I've been here these operations have been joint and/or the Federal Reserve has has been in there alone in some smaller, less dramatic circumstances, We have increased the swap line to show support, to allow them to borrow over an election period, whatever it might be, to provide some degree of financial support On the second point, I think it's particularly difficult to generalize about bridge loans At the broadest level, this operation is not any different from any of the other ones that we've been involved in over the last six years We have identified a means of repayment of our swap; and once that's identified, we are reasonably sure that we are going to get repaid  -19-    -20-  The issue which I think is found in the press was more in the context of loans that Mexico may receive from the World Bank than a full-fledged IMF program That issue really turns on a judgment as to how serious Mexico's current economic problems are, which I would argue in turn depends on one's forecast for oil prices If oil prices go down a lot, Mexico is going to have to take another strong dose of adjustment to another terms-of-trade shock And that necessarily is going to involve a full-fledged IMF program If oil prices stay where they are or go up some from where they are, it's less clear that they will need the kind of international financial support that is associated with IMF programs, and they more appropriately can look to further longer-term, development-oriented financing that comes out of World Bank loans So, it's a question of how you see Mexico and its economic situation with regard to the extent to which the particular financing or bridging is oriented more toward the Fund or more toward the World Bank   I think it probably has been less Capital flight is very difficult to identify even ex post, much less while it's going on As far as we can tell,  some private sector entities in Mexico have various kinds of arrangements by which as of certain dates they can obtain dollars from the Bank of Mexico and they have the option to do so And they have opted in the last couple of weeks, especially last week to make use of those options In a number of cases they have been using them either to go out and retire some of their own debt at a discount, which you may want to call capital flight, or to invest in something, or to buy Mexican public-sector international debt which they are using themselves for their participation in some    11/1/88  of the privatization efforts that have been going on in association with this general effort Those are part of the debt-equity swap--if you want to put it that way--mechanism And as far as we can tell, most of the [official] sales of dollars over this period--the last week--seem to be associated with those kinds of operations rather than a sort of a run on the peso The general financial market conditions have been quite calm That has been confirmed by  and the Treasury attache Nevertheless,   Well, I've seen it   I think the answer is that one can't completely tell, and I'm not sure exactly how that would modify our behavior under that You were speaking of the behavior of the US government in general The behavior under these circumstances--, all I can say is that what I have read and picked up in the last month or so suggests that (a) there was certainly a high level of uncertainty; clearly, that was one of the things, along with declining oil prices, contributing to the problems that they first approached us on But (b) my sense is that the efforts to, or the probability attached to, sort of destabilization has lessened somewhat Basically, I'm basing that on an assessment that the [unintelligible] has said the immediate candidate for president seems to be having difficulty organizing a coalition because essentially his opposition has combined a group on the left and a group on the right against a [unintelligible] center treaty faction And despite his efforts and obvious popular appeal, the efforts can carry through the kinds of demonstrations that were held during the summer [and] immediately after that seemed to have died down somewhat That's not to say that I wouldn't expect some attempt to disrupt or show dissatisfaction at the time of the inauguration on the 1st of December In fact, I would be flabbergasted if that did not happen, but I don't think anybody feels that this is life threatening, if I can put it that way, at this stage   And Denmark   [Statement--see Appendix]   Yes First, let me say this is an area where we feel so nervous we call it an assumption and try to have some rationale behind the assumption The assumption that they'll stay around the current level or maybe rebound after [the OPEC meeting to] $13 a barrel is based upon an assumption that they will be able to restrain production of crude petroleum to slightly under 20 million barrels per day   From the current 21 million plus that they're at now If indeed they fail to do that, and say they were at or above 21 plus, then you could have a drop in oil prices down below $10 a barrel, roughly that order of magnitude  [Coffee break] "
3597,1988-12-13," Yes, sir   No, I'll do it, for whatever it's worth   Yes, I do have something to read from   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, as you may remember the way we construct the export orders from those series is to use the staff forecast So if the staff forecast is wrong, then export orders are wrong Essentially, the division between domestic orders and exports orders is derived from the staff forecast   That's why I said that it seems to me that although these data may well be used by those who think there's going to be a stalling--if you want to put it that way--in the adjustment process, it seems to me that it's a little premature to argue that case I might add that shipments of large aircraft in October were about double last year's, and that is one factor that we are expecting through the forecast horizon to give us some boost to the overall level of exports; that's one area where orders have been strong and they have long delivery-lead times and so in looking out it looks like you're going to have a continued boost to exports as a whole from that source   No, they were both revised by about the same amount  -19-    12/13-14/88   Well, revised from--   $1067 from $1046 billion   $106 billion   The answer to the last part of your question is we find it hard enough to try and come up with ""forecasts"" of an exchange rate that we don't try to put a dynamic in   I think there is a risk in that, since in the staff forecast the trade balance improvement essentially levels off in 1989 That is to some extent exaggerated by the impact of the somewhat higher oil prices that come in So, there's a little bit more improvement ex-oil in the forecast The market presumably will look through that part of the forecast that we have in the total numbers But as I think we mentioned in the Greenbook, it does strike me that if you wanted to fine tune things you might feel that this stalling, if you want to put it that way, or partial stalling in process could lead to pressures on the exchange markets in the short run as the markets adjust to that Factors behind this essentially are two One is the strength of the dollar this year and the other is the fact that, at least in our forecast, we have a slowing of growth abroad in 1989 which should give us less [impetus?] from that standpoint In 1990, the forecast gains from essentially the cumulative effects of the relatively small appreciation of the dollar that's in the forecast and a slowdown in US demand  -20-    12/13-14/88   Well, if I were to guess, I would guess that way I think it would also depend on what else is going on at the same time If you have a slowdown in the trade adjustment but progress--whatever that means--or perceptible progress on the budget deficit, that might strengthen the dollar If the US economy seems to be slowing down a bit, that might also tend to offset some of the effects of an adjustment to somewhat disappointing trade numbers But I think a lot depends on what else is going on at the same time   On that particular point, we have an increase in rates abroad, but not on the same order of magnitude--maybe half or a little bit less than half of the increase we have for the US So you do have interest rate differentials moving in favor of the dollar And as you know, there is I think in this area [a question of?] how much is enough, if you want to put it that way I think it's a matter on which science doesn't provide us much guidance One reason why we tended in this forecast to slow the rate of depreciation of the dollar relative to the overall contour that we had in the previous Greenbook was in fact the recognition that somewhat higher rates of interest that occur in this forecast, at least in the short end and the same kind of stuff for the long end, tend to damp the tendency for the dollar to depreciate; the depreciation we would argue would be much larger in the absence of that We have the effect in the forecast The question is whether we have it calibrated right Some would argue, as you know, that a forecast like this for interest rates would bring about even more in the way of stability of the dollar than we have [unintelligible]   We have a fairly sharp decline in the rate of increase in demand abroad--down to something like 2-1/2 percent from the somewhat over 3 percent rate on average for the G-10 countries this year That is one factor affecting things the other way Now, I think you have two scenarios You have the scenario of 1988 where you had a relative increase in US interest rates on balance through the year and approximate dollar stability On the other hand, you also had 1987, where you had a relative increase in US interest rates and a fairly sharp dollar decline over the period So, I don't think science, if I can put it that way, [unintelligible]   No, there was a relative increase in US interest rates over that period But the issue I think really is where the market in some sense expects the equilibrium for the external accounts is, looking out to the long run I don't think there's a strong--; you have views all over the map, from some saying the current account has to go to zero to ones who say we can live with a current account of $100 billion or so I guess what has driven the staff forecast for exchange rates for a number of years now has been the view that it's not going to have to be one way or the other--that the current account while not necessarily having to go to zero is not going to be a deficit of $100 billion, which strikes us as a fairly big number to finance, and so forth and so on And I think then the issue is the tradeoff between how much of that comes through price effects and how much comes through income effects, and to what extent somewhat higher interest rates in this country will work against the sort of underlying forces which are tending to drive some of this adjustment through price effects The best we can do is to provide some rough thinking on the matter without a lot of precision, because I don't think there's a lot of precision here Now, what we basically have built into this forecast is a 6 percent decline of the dollar from roughly where it is today at an annual rate That translates to somewhat less than 4 percent in real terms That's a relatively modest decline by the standards of recent years The rationale for the modest decline is the fact that we do have US interest rates moving higher And it may be that you'll get another 1988 in 1989 as a result of this kind of forecast At least on our modest equations, or whatever you want to call them, you're going to get a somewhat different outcome on the external account, and that is in fact where the [uncertainty?] is; you might as well call it that, too I mean there are some forces in the economy also coming from the decline of the dollar; perhaps you would have less impetus in 1989 and also in 1990   Yes, that's certainly our impression of what we have seen There have been some stories at some point in some areas,  -22-    12/13-14/88  but the few areas where there seem to have been capacity constraints seem to have eased off a touch since last spring I confess we haven't been systematic in collecting information on that, but I've seen some   Well, as I've said, 13 percent rates of growth in value terms are not anything to sneeze about We don't actually use the MPS model for this kind of relationship, so I'm not quite sure I can articulate-- And that model has for quite a long time tended to give a different picture for the external accounts than used directly in this process One big issue has to do with how you treat computers, and whether you sort out computers from your equations We have recently found it necessary in our forecasting to do that and then we sort of independently have to estimate what we think can happen to computers That is one area where we have trimmed back the forecast relative to where it was a couple of Greenbooks ago Excluding computers from our model, given the kind of equations that we have, we would have in fact slightly stronger volumes of computer exports [implied] from equations that we are currently using I mean, that difference--between 8, 8-1/2, or 9--that's the sort of thing, looking at the fourth-quarter changes We are roughly consistent with that Some of the slowdown does come from the total--   That certainly is also a defensible scenario that you will get less exchange rate adjustment in 1989 despite the slowdown in trade adjustment and more in 1990 if it appeared that the economy was itself slowing down and you were having some lessening of price pressures That's one of the reasons why we end up straight lining it If you get too fancy--  -23-    12/13-14/88   Yes, it's possible   It's difficult to run these forecasts when you have different assumptions, but based on our conversation over the weekend, we did run a forecast in which nothing changed except the exchange rate path Now, just as you may ask how do you get the exchange rate change, you can also ask how you get nothing changing but the rate But for whatever it's worth, what we get on the current account under that scenario would be essentially no change in the current account, essentially flat at about a rate in the $110, $120 billion range However, we do continue to get improvement, but at a smaller rate, on the trade side And you essentially are in the situation in which the trade improvement just offsets the deterioration coming from the interaction of the higher deficits themselves and the higher interest rates which tends to deteriorate the current account So, you get some trade balance movement over that period, but you would not get any current account movement   Well, as I said--   Well, maybe we might emphasize one of the basic rationales for much of the forecast, which is this view that we have of the Committee's view about what it wants to do with inflation Now, it also is true that we've done this with a modest exchange rate change and some degree of continuing progress--as a result of that in the real exchange rate change--in the trade and current accounts, obviously Now, if you could change that equation a little bit so that you didn't have an exchange rate change, it's also true that in some sense you'd have a more favorable inflation outlook over this period because you wouldn't have quite the kind of [inflationary] pressure coming from the new exchange rate change over the forecast period In that sense, there is a connection between the two parts of the forecast Whether we got the balance right either on the domestic side or the domestic-external side I think we need to be humble about But the exchange rate change in and of itself--the one that's built in here--does bring you, if you want to put it that way, further improvement on the external side and not runaway inflation So, in that sense you're not bumping capacity constraints That's partly because the rest of the economy is squeezed to the extent that you allow the external economy adjustment to continue   Well, I guess you could look at this forecast that we have and argue that you worry about how much of an adjustment there is in 1989 for various reasons, as the Chairman discussed earlier But, actually, if you look at the total adjustment on the external side over the period where the trade balance essentially declines by $45 billion and the current account declines by about another $30 billion so that you're down to a $70--$80 billion dollar range for those two by the end of 1990, that I think is not an unattractive situation   Among other things, you could even argue that at that point the system could self-finance, if you want to put it that way, without needing added inducements Also, once you get the trade balance down a bit, you don't have this great discrepancy between exports and imports The growth differentials [unintelligible] but still have it working there, but not on the same order of magnitude as when imports were over three times the size of exports for a while   Well, this year in fact they've done better--or worse if you wanted to put it that way   That's right We are assuming that there will be a continuing depreciation vis-a-vis those currencies but at about half the 4 percent rate in real terms to more like 2 percent in real terms   Well, I think one can distinguish between running a recession, which doesn't really buy you very much because you come out of the recession [at a lower] level of income and later come back to the same level of income as before, so you've just bought us a lower financial cost of imports during that interval I would think between that case and essentially the case that's implicit in the forecast here, which is that the slowdown in growth is essentially a device that is consistent with slowing the rate of growth from something like 3/4 to 1 percentage point above what we think is growth potential to something more consistent with growth potential, and in the meantime dipping down below [potential] That is, I think different, and you get something from essentially that percentage point, or a little bit more, lower growth than what you had with the economy running along at 1/2 percent [higher] growth   Well, an honest-to-goodness recession would help in the short run But I think when you come out of the recession and you get back to where you start from, it's not clear to me in terms of the external accounts themselves that you really have bought yourself very much If you want to prolong the recession for an extended period of time, then you might get something   [Unintelligible] For those countries who have IMF programs, the modification of the compensatory and contingency financing facility, as it's now called, essentially allows them to build an adjustment factor into the size of financing they get from the Fund for rises in interest rates It does provide more of a cushion in this area than a year or so ago But the rise in interest rates no doubt will be an excuse used by those who want to take an unorthodox approach to these matters On the other hand, a number of the representatives of these countries have also argued that they want to make sure that the North gets its house in order so that they can [not?] have it both ways   Well, I only know what I read in the newspapers, which suggested that they are exploring various options, none of which struck me as particularly novel in terms of the things that they like to protect, facilities or various [unintelligible]   Well, my understanding of that meeting was that, although it is fair to say that these countries have been comparing notes fairly actively over the last several years, they were even more actively comparing notes [this time] There is no desire on the part of each country to lock itself into the strategy of the other [unintelligible]   Well, on the other side, we have a rise in the trade and current account deficits of the Baker 15 countries, if you want to put it that way, and they were forecast largely because of the rise in interest rates--though in some sense the interest rate rise is not that much different from what we've had before It has not been  -29-    12/13-14/88  changed that much, and the issue is whether those larger deficits can be financed If they can be financed through official or private channels, then the rise in interest rates in and of itself is not enough, it seems to me, to spark a conflagration Lots of things could spark a conflagration, and if one occurs there will be a number of suspects, as Sam Cross said   Yes, it would be a shock but I would think that the implications are likely to be less than they were 3 years ago and 6 years ago Depending on how one classifies Brazil, for example, you have 45 percent of these countries--assuming Brazil has not been paying interest in the sense that the banks have not been taking in income for 2 years now but just now are able to do so In that sense, you have for the Baker 15 countries about 40 percent of the bank debt of countries that have not been paying service in terms of interest Taking Brazil out, it's more like 18 percent But in some sense, the shock of giving up another 25 percent of that or 30 percent of that, if you want to put it that way, leaving just a handful of countries like Columbia and Uruguay etc, I think the shock would be there but it's not going to have a major impact It's a risk, there's no doubt that it's a risk, but if you're looking for things to change the climate of opinion, as Mike was saying earlier, that certainly is one of the ones that could do so   If I may join Mike, one of the problems this time is that this forecast normally would go to 1990 in February and would be done in conjunction with a chart show We thought we were doing the Committee a favor, if I can put it that way, by adding 1990 in December rather than waiting until February   And the task of doing that and combining alternatives with it would be more difficult than otherwise   We would intend when we go to 1990 in February, as we've always have done in the 15 years that I have sat around this table, to have alternatives in the chart show   Can I just correct something which I said before--and I'm sure no one on the Committee remembers what I said-- but I have now looked at the trade numbers in a little more detail, and I want to correct one thing that I indicated I think I said that non-agricultural exports had declined between September and October, and looking at the numbers a little more closely, I apparently had not adjusted for the fact that there was a rise in aircraft shipments And if you include that, non-agricultural exports in fact rose or were essentially unchanged between September and October   And non-aircraft, right Also, there is a slight rise in those exports from their average for the third quarter "
3624,1989-02-07," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, in that case, of course, you would get more current account improvement, a better performance of prices, and a little less--about 1/4 percent per year less--GNP growth   Oh, the difference I think is about 02 percent a year for both years, 1989 [and 1990]   I think their magic is that with this slightly higher money growth they have had a lower level of [inflation] on average to begin with more recently--with a few important exceptions like the United Kingdom--and we are projecting a tightening of monetary policy in those countries Also, for this two-year period, not including 1990, they get some benefit from the depreciation of the dollar that we're assuming in the forecast relative to their present underlying level of inflation In addition, these, are year-over-year comparisons, and they would be coming off these artificial factors    2/7-8/89  that in 1989 tend to boost the price level up in Germany and Japan Therefore, the year-over-year comparison exaggerates the decline   Right, because it [unintelligible] it more than exports There's no doubt about that [faster] growth abroad does boost the growth of exports in this period I might add--   That's right, but that's by assumption To the extent that you get more exports, the easing of monetary policy required to keep the US growth path on the same line is less; so that's part of this compensated--   To the extent that's correct--that without the dollar's decline there is more growth abroad--that by itself has a partial effect in that it generates more exports   Growth [abroad] itself does generate more exports To the extent that that produces more demand for US goods, the experiment offsets that by having less monetary expansion in the United States to compensate for the exports that would otherwise be there   Well, in fact, it puts the two factors together, Governor Heller   The growth of exports is lower in this forecast even though income abroad is higher because they gain more on the price side than they lose on the income side   Yes Prices are actually washed out In fact, probably a better way of thinking of it is that the level of real exports is lower in the alternative than in the base line because that improved price competitiveness has a greater effect on exports than the gain in faster growth abroad   No   A partial effect of higher income is to put exports up A partial effect of a stronger dollar is to put exports down The net effect is negative for exports   Sorry for the confusion   The actual increase is not as much as implied for--   Over the entire 8 quarters it's 13 percent in nominal terms, 10 percent in real terms   Well, a little more in the second year because the first quarter is gone   And they will be weaker "
3649,1989-03-28," Governor Seger, this is one of the [unintelligible] to President Hoskin's comment This is one of the asymmetries in the international financial system today Other countries--   Small countries can buy yen or sell yen But for big countries like the United States and Germany and Japan their actions in this area are guided by different understandings, if you want to put it that way, about when one does it for the reasons that Sam mentioned If Canada buys yen, or even if the UK buys yen, that's not the same thing as our buying yen or the Bank of Japan buying yen Now, the other point--   That's right   The other point is that there are certain understandings about the point at which intervention becomes more favorably regarded But as far as the yen is concerned we're far away from that point   Well, but they weren't down at the 6 percent level They have a wider band   Italy has a much broader band   One of the problems is that even if they want to move the D-mark [vis-a-vis] the Danish kroner that would raise questions about what else they would do within the EMS It seems hard to do since there is this strong desire, especially between the Germans and the French, not to do anything for who knows how long By [their suppressing] all this, it may be like the US attitude toward sterling in the late 1960s   [Statement--see Appendix]   I don't think we have much improvement in the second half   Yes, but some of the changes have to do with special factors in the last quarter of 1988 when there was a deterioration, some of which was caused by a surge in oil imports and  -13-    3/28/89  probably a surge in nonoil imports associated with the buildup in [inventories] So, you take that out and that's where much of the improvement comes on the trade side in the first half of the year   What?   What I mean is that while there is a small improvement in there most of it is a bounceback from the fourth quarter on the trade side   And there is a small adjustment in the--   No, because we think that there still is some effect in the pipeline from the delayed effects of the dollar decline and we have built some of that in there So that's consistent with the models and the equations that we use in terms of those effects And then we add on the special factors like oil and agriculture--to the extent that there's a rebound this year in agricultural exports in real terms, in comparison to the flat performance last year--and that's what gives you some of the improvement   I've always felt there's a lot of uncertainty That may be because I've been closer to it But I think that Mike sends me his gospel truth and he's always right   That is what it is basically As you know and others who have looked at it know, the equations for exchange rates just barely qualify as equations in the statistical relationships--  -14-    3/28/89   Well, as we get over this peak and the economy softens a bit--this is basically what Governor Johnson was commenting on in terms of the Bluechip forecast--we have US rates coming down in 1990 and coming down relative to rates abroad No matter what model you put that through, that gives you essentially a differential effect It could differ with regard to how much you get in the short run on the one side But the changing effect comes from the change in the influence of the interest rate differential on the exchange rate In a sense we pushed aside the fact that you get very little improvement in nominal terms over this period And we are assuming, maybe based in some sense on recent experience, that the market will continue to finance us about--   Well, it clearly works in that direction, though it all depends a bit on what one thinks the current meeting will produce for the balance of 1989 I have not seen any reports that suggest that the Saudis will step up production because of their fiscal situation or that they do not need to step up their production because prices have moved up Posted prices have not moved to the same degree as spot prices, although--   But they have some long-term contracts It depends on how those contracts are written; that's right It works in that direction One of the favorable factors has been the supply disruptions in Qatar; that has tightened the supply side And in some sense there has been a spillover to the price the Saudis are getting We have a small step-up in production in the second half of the year built into this Our guess is that they decided to accept the prices coming down on the assumption that there will be a modest increase--a couple hundred thousand barrels a day--in OPEC production in general in the second half of the year That's not a big deal A small increase, on that order of magnitude, is built into what we have and if you parse that out among all the producers-- "
3675,1989-05-16," President Hoskins, certainly their action in April to raise interest rates, which Sam reported on, was triggered in part by the continued rapid growth [above] their targets And certainly the Bank of Japan, while maybe not excessively concerned about monetary growth per se, would be delighted--if I might put it that way--to raise interest rates What will they do? In both cases, as far as the central bank is concerned, there is a concern about [unintelligible] monetary growth, inflation, and so forth   Well, I don't know about that   The last time we did this was after the Louvre Accord; we raised it by $3-1/2 billion when we had, in fact, less leeway than we have today So if you want to look at it in that perspective it gives you quite a lot of leeway [unintelligible] giving your [Foreign Currency] Subcommittee some opportunity to revisit the issue from time-to-time   Unless we should go into debt "
3717,1989-07-05," There were similar arrangements that we used in the early 1970s   To my knowledge Congress has never raised any questions about it It was established more or less permanently in the late 1970s when the Treasury issued Carter bonds and they wanted to simply [make permanent] that limit and wanted to monetize the Carter bonds; so we held them from that point It was carefully examined by the Committee at that time and [the decision] was made public; since then we've continued the arrangement It is reviewed at the March organizational meeting   No, the $5 billion limit is a limit that the FOMC imposed   No I took your comment to mean that a limit is imposed by Congress in that the balance sheet of the ESF is in some sense controlled by Congress It was last voted on by Congress I think in the 1930s but implicitly also, I guess, when they voted on the SDR [amendment to the IMF Articles]   Because there is a practical limit on the [Fund], which is the size of their balance sheet They have dollars that were originally acquired at the time gold was--   The dollar amount was set up in the Exchange Stabilization Fund then; it has been used periodically for a variety of things and they also hold US SDRs Congress did review this issue in the context of the approval of the SDRs In the first amendment to the [Articles of] Agreement in the late 1960s, they authorized the ESF to transfer to the Federal Reserve SDR certificates which, in effect, allows them to monetize those SDRs In that sense, they again reviewed that source of the ESF funding itself But that's the last time I know of that it was formally reviewed   It is true, as the Chairman commented, that until the late 1970s, all the foreign exchange held by the United States--what little we had--was held by the Federal Reserve So this issue didn't come up in that context The Treasury didn't get into the holding of foreign exchange balances except with respect to their own lending operations until the late 1970s   No, it's at historical rates   Governor Angell, Sam does make a regular report on Desk operations [public] every three months It's not as if the operations are--   Governor Angell, we're doing it at the best price but within the limit If you want to take your rule to the limit--if [buying at the best price] was the objective--then we should have been talking up the dollar for weeks and then Sam could have gone in and bought the foreign exchange cheap The objective was not to minimize the price at which we picked up yen and DM balances; for better or for worse, it was to limit the rise of the dollar That doesn't necessarily always mean picking up the [best price]; you can't have it both ways   It's about 9 times the $11 billion; so, about $90 billion   Oh, but that--   Mr Chairman, it is fair to say--and maybe this is a flimsy excuse, President Hoskins--that the reason there is a limit in the Authorization is precisely for the concerns that you are raising I think you realize you're asking for a systematic rather than a routine basis Historically, the limit was in there because we were concerned about the other side; we were building up exposures historically because we were drawing down--   We were running into debt in periods when it wasn't clear how we were going to bail ourselves out of this process But it was put into the Authorization--and that was a conscious move on the part of the FOMC at the time--asymmetrically because the exposure was to find out whether we were net long or net short And it was intended so that the Committee could be concerned about these things Now, on the Chairman's second question, we have done a staff analysis in a research paper here that was issued recently which does suggest that, at least on the financial risk side of things, our intervention has been profitable I agree with the Chairman; I don't think that's the major issue here But that is one of the concerns   The worst of all possible worlds would be to give the Treasury the authority to dictate to the Federal Reserve to do it for its own account Then the Federal Reserve would have no influence over the amount of sterilized intervention that took place Only the monetary policy operations will offset it   And the next step would be not to use monetary policy operations to offset it   [Statement--see Appendix]   One way to think about it, Governor Johnson, is that the change of the dollar's forecast--at least over the four quarters of 1989 as now projected--is 12 percent If you think that somehow the market has changed its assumption by that much, that's considerable; they don't have to even see that They can see future implications, for both inflation directly and for aggregate demand, that are going to come from a stronger dollar over that period-- especially if you go back near the turn of the year, or November- December, when we were still dealing with a situation in which the dollar was quite soggy And to the extent that the market at that time was projecting, as we were, a continued decline in the dollar-- which under the conditions of relatively full employment we were going to have to accommodate, if you want to put it that way, by restraining other elements of demand--that was the strength that was then in the system The dollar turned around and added to that whole process restraint that wasn't in our forecast; but in some sense, it certainly wasn't in the markets' forecast either So, you have this key change in expectations, which had [effects on the] performance of the economy and on the outlook   The dollar has dropped by 2 percent or so since yesterday  -13-    7/5-6/89   That, interacting with the economy and Friday's reports, right?   Did they get their money back? "
3744,1989-08-22," Mr Chairman, we circulated a memo, which I hope was self explanatory, relating to the provision of a certain amount of bridge financing to Mexico in connection with the Mexican agreement in principle with commercial banks on July 23 It's a total amount of $2 billion a billion dollar's worth would be a multilateral facility of which the US share would be $250 million split equally between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury; the second billion dollar facility would essentially draw upon existing swap lines--our $700 million swap line and the Treasury's $300 million line for the full $1 billion--  The other half of it would draw, after the multilateral facility, on disbursements from the Fund and the World Bank As outlined in the memo, there is a small anticipated shortfall--on the order of $86 million--of the full $1-1/2 billion that would be paid out of Mexico's reserves; or, if they somehow couldn't draw any other monies after the 15th of February, we could [if necessary] obtain repayment from proceeds of sales of oil as we have done in the past The proposal here is to approve a special swap arrangement for the $125 million--a one-time only arrangement that would be drawn on once and then on repayment would expire The proposal is also to delegate formal    8/22/89  approval of that to the Chairman, and also to delegate to the Chairman the approval of the drawings once they [are requested] The reason for the lag is that there is a desire to have a certain linkage--I think that was the phrase you used, President Corrigan--between this facility as a whole and the consummation of the term sheet between the Mexicans and the bank advisory committee So, it is conceivable that that never will happen, in which case we wouldn't want to have this on the record, so to speak That's why we have suggested this procedure in the first place; normally, when we activate these things, Norm would send out a telegram asking for the Committee's concurrence We thought it would be just as easy to get your concurrence in advance, assuming none of the terms changed   Yes   Well, [that would occur] when it was activated Our intention would be for the Committee to act to delegate this decision to the Chairman And when he acts and implements the decision, then it would go on the record But if this whole thing fell apart in the meantime, between now and your next Committee meeting, it would not [go on the record]   That's right I've been told by the authorities that that's a reasonable procedure to follow   Legal--that is, the General Counsel   We have done this before We used this same procedure for the same reason in 1982 when we made an arrangement with Mexico; we weren't sure that the conditions would be such as to need this arrangement If you want to do it the other way, you can approve the swap line [increase] and then explain in the policy record that because the conditions never were met we never [implemented it] I don't have a strong [view on a] way of doing it We had done it the other way in the past, and that's why we proposed this arrangement    8/22/89   That is what we intended The other parties are doing essentially the same thing The BIS, while it has gotten agreement of all the central banks, is not going to tell the New York Fed that it is in agreement to its part until everything is ready to go So we're all on the same procedure   It's up to the Committee what they want to do If it's never implemented, one might argue that you would not want to publish it But you do it either way you want   Well, unless everything falls apart; that's the only other contingency   That's right There is another feature here--if they get everything done by the first of September they will then announce a bigger number for their reserves on the first of September I think it's also partly the cosmetics of the number When we looked at  That's how the structure was negotiated in July   Mr Chairman, for staff purposes could we clarify that the contingency was established--that this was an authorization of the special swap but also concurrence [on the delegation to the Chairman] of the activation? We will let you know when it happens Otherwise we tend to send out a notice [requesting Committee action] One of my housekeeping concerns is that this might happen around the Labor Day weekend when people aren't even around So do we take it that all is encompassed in that action? Is that how people interpret it? Or do you want to have another round?   I think the motion was to authorize the special swap arrangement, with its activation subject to the Chairman's satisfaction that the understandings have been met and to concur in the activation of the two arrangements, again subject to the understandings being met That would be the easiest   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, first the answer is the add factors; we have reestimated our equations in any case You are right that there is a problem because it creates a gap between '85 and '86 and you have a discontinuity here In answer to your question about what we would    8/22/89  do, we either would try to smooth it or [unintelligible] back Normally, they take these things back   For some reason they didn't do it this time because they ran out of resources   Yes   I don't know about inventories It may have been [just] this particular area; what they did essentially was add new information that they collected on these exports and imports of various services that they didn't have [information on] before They may have felt that they couldn't quite figure out how they wanted to feather it into the past So, it's more than a correction of past numbers; it was [brand new] information   Yes, we put them right in We've discussed that here with the Board and to some extent that's good news It is good news in the sense that the base on which we forecast our exports is that much higher and one might even argue that some of these services, which are education and medical services and travel, are ones that have rather high income elasticities Therefore, the overall elasticities might be a little boosted by this   It was moved out   That's right, I guess Yes, to some extent, that's right   Well, presumably, the relatively good trade numbers and the current account revisions certainly have been factors --I would say largely the factors--that underlie the strength of the dollar we have seen so far this year It's certainly positive in that direction One might argue that if you want equilibrium, whatever you thought the current account had to get to, the revisions suggest that you need less exchange rate change ultimately to get there I would accept that But most of the models have this characteristic, and they may be wrong, that at unchanged exchange rates with approximately a slightly lower growth here [than] abroad you're going to have a widening of the current account I think the only issue is how much The models differ and actually ours is modest, I think, by the standards of most of them And we have goosed up, if you want to put it that way, the thing considerably   I'm quite modest about the nature of the underlying projection of the dollar, and that's one of the reasons why in our presentation Mike and I agreed that we should give you some sense of what difference it makes I certainly don't mean to suggest it's a sure thing that this degree of deterioration is going to generate that much decline or that adding $15 billion more to it is going to mean that the end is near I can't give you any assurance We have the feeling that ultimately maybe it's like the budget deficit ultimately a somewhat lower percentage of GNP is going to have to be imported What the time pattern of that will be and how much of it takes the form of pure exchange rate adjustment and other factors as it gets there is up for grabs  -22-    8/22/89   Well, the fact of the matter is that we knew these [revisions] would come In fact, the Federal Reserve [unintelligible] instigated this with Commerce Department five years ago to start looking at some of these things As far as I know there aren't any more in the pipeline So it's found money and it does change the base, as I said earlier; but I don't think there's any real chance that we're going to revise away a $100 billion current account deficit   If you put these numbers together, it's financeable but the problem is the level of our debt You're worried about the base in all these numbers but it comes to something like 40 percent of GNP That's where the steady state is And that is a big number It is as big as any major industrial country has had [except] Australia and Canada And Australia and Canada have the advantage, I think, basically that their capital intensive exploitation of--   If you play it out, the $100 billion current account deficit as a percent of GNP would, assuming a steady state and making all kinds of assumptions about the growth rates and so forth and so on, you get something like 40 percent of GNP   Net external debt as a percent of GNP Now if you're worried about the base--and that's a big number--my feeling is somehow that probably we're not going to get there   That's right    8/22/89   [Unintelligible]   No, I don't think it's very much smaller "
3769,1989-10-03," Absolutely   They have done it on several other issues   They did it on debt strategy, so it's clear that the same man who did it to us on the debt strategy could; I don't think there's any doubt that he wouldn't do it on this one And the trade issue is the gut issue in Congress   No   There is some I think the Canadians have some differences of view within the central bank   Maybe the General Counsel can speak to this, but isn't the issue here that he has done his job within the guidelines and the Committee is ratifying the transactions?   Virgil [Mattingly] is nodding   Yes, but he does [operate under] certain procedures in the Authorization and Directive and the question is whether he followed the guidelines and procedures   I understand that   The issue is whether the transactions have been carried out consistent with the Authorization and the Directive; it's the same thing as for the domestic operations   Okay, then you're fine ""Ratified"" is the word that is used in the minutes   I'm not quite sure what it means; maybe we can get the lawyers to write us a memo   2-3/4  -36-    10/3/89 "
3785,1989-10-17," Well, given the gyrations of these data, it's not outside the realm of normal expectations We don't have the details yet but I don't think it's likely, in and of itself, to give us a bigger trade deficit for the third quarter than we had been anticipating We had anticipated that it would be essentially unchanged between the second and third quarters If we did a straight extrapolation, it would be going from $110 billion to $118 billion, but that's a rather mechanical approach There was an increase in the carryover, which is what caused the revision in the July number; to the extent that that goes back to a more normal number, you'll have the opposite revision in August when the September number comes out So, there's a bit of fluff in the number, if I can put it that way "
3818,1989-11-14," The Desk did operate [in sterling], but--   That was before the last meeting, in early--    11/14/89   Yes I think that's one of the factors, as you said, underlying its remarkable resilience in some sense, despite the fact that we've had this [move in the differentials] So, I think it's fair to say that the last couple of days' movement in the German interest rates has been more a German phenomenon, perhaps associated with a market interpretation of what's going to happen to Bundesbank policy three to six months out in light of all this This is pretty much what's going on with real interest rates in that context-- although there is a bit of a difference between nominal and real interest rates in this process If you think in the short run that there's going to be some inflationary impact from this--and I think most people would--even given the longer-run positive aspects, you could then say that eventually the Bundesbank will lean against this, at least in nominal terms though maybe not in real terms We may just be seeing that; and that's a slightly different phenomenon than what might just be driving their--   Yes, it has to be true   Well, Sam went through it They have gone [up] by 350 basis points since April and the dollar is stronger than it was then So, you've got to say that something has changed in terms of expectations for the future The qualification that Sam put in there [relates to] how people also think they can get out if they need to   Well, the dollar's depreciation relative to oil prices [is a factor] Its impact over the last year on our producer prices--and recently it has gone the other way--has been magnified by the fact that the price of oil has gone up more rapidly than dollar prices have gone up [Unintelligible] came through into the producer prices   Well, the Committee may want to take it--   Presidents [may] argue against it, but it is true that the task force was targeted to finish its work by the end of March [If you wait] a month we'll have more--   There is much work [to be done]; it's partly a result of that, but--   [Statement--see Appendix]   The dollar forecast error offset the interest rate forecast error  SPEAKER(?) Right   That's the first approximation   Of course, it was done without the September numbers and our guess is that the September numbers will move it somewhat in the other direction but not a lot One of the factors is the oil [developments] that I mentioned There is a big bulge in non- oil imports; and remember, this is the opposite--like a barrel of oil is valued in 1982 dollars So it has a big impact on the GNP accounts Cutting through those two factors, I think it is--   Well, on the factor income side I would say we have no information That was not up [in] our forecast And we stubbornly think that they probably overdid it--or underdid it, if you want to put it that way I say that with some trepidation, since they do make up the numbers--   Well--   We don't have a good story Periodically, we try to discuss that with them and we have not gotten a very good story out of it   It could conceivably have something to do with the loan loss reserves that were taken by banks and that kind of thing Conceivably, they may have attributed some of that-- I don't know how they treat that   Or something like that Conceivably, that's one of the factors That has been one of the factors before but they haven't [told us] They push these things around, so that may be one of the areas where they have done that They also have tended sometimes to fudge, but one factor in particular for the third quarter that we tried to take account of is the fact that developing countries may stop [servicing their debt], but there weren't any particular factors of that sort in this period   Yes   As I said, first of all, we had some of this built into our forecast for Germany because there already had been in the early part of the year a marked increase in the flow of migration to West Germany So, some of this is built in on both sides But obviously, in the last couple of weeks (a) things have gotten more so and (b) things have gotten fuzzier in terms of the total overall magnitude But it is clear that there is going to be more demand in the economy in the short run--by that I mean in 1990 and 1991--than we otherwise would have had And that will tend to put short-run upward pressure on prices and so forth and so on Germany is an important market and, of course, it has multiplier effects in Europe But [East] Germany's exports are 4 percent of total German exports So it's not big; it's not West Germany, in any case And as I said, presumably that pressure, given the current state of the German economy, will be met to some extent by Bundesbank policy, at least I think, in terms of the dollar [being] somewhat higher than it otherwise would be Again, there is some question about what happens to real rates assuming that we [unintelligible] for them The other aspect is that it has not been decided yet what they are going to do on the fiscal side I understand that there is at least talk in Germany about having a special tax to finance this sort of thing So, a lot of these expenditures are transfer payments--for transportation, or publicly subsidized construction in the housing area, and so forth It's a little hard to shape the whole macroeconomic situation until one is more certain about the overall dimensions and the overall thrust of macropolicy I think that's one of the reasons why the Bundesbank itself is not going to rule [that] out ahead of time-- because they don't know to what extent there will be fiscal policy offsets to this situation "
3847,1989-12-18," [Statement--see Appendix]   It's about $6 billion less than what's in the Greenbook   Right   Well, let me make two comments One is that the October numbers did have a big downward adjustment in aircraft shipments relative to the previous month   The second is that some of the export sales--and this maybe only speaks to part of the problem--had to do with the timing of shipments [rather than how] the workers were scheduled So in that period there are two questions To what extent are they being exported rather than sold domestically relative to the average experience? And to what extent do they come out of inventories? That is the question you were addressing   Well, they have stayed up The total of large aircraft was $102 billion; that's down $600 million from the previous month but it's up in fact from the early part of the year So it's not that they weren't continuing--   Assuming the report [made it] to the BEA?   As we measured it yesterday   You mean higher interest rates?   Higher interest rates?   Well, yes, but it depends on whether you had [forecast] foreign demand right to begin with And as far as this year was concerned, it's fair to say that we didn't We have growth in the G-10 countries on average in 1989 at 34 percent, a percentage point higher now than we did in February at the time of the chart show And we have the same growth rate, essentially, for next year so that the average level of economic activity is substantially higher than we had it before So to some extent, the interest rate response to that in trying to [damp] down the recovery, [unintelligible] which is certainly that it had an effect on income and demand And therefore, in some sense [economic activity] would be less than otherwise But I think if you put the two things together, on balance, you have continuing strong growth on the income side plus this exchange rate--   Yes, and I'm not sure to what extent In fact, I guess you could even argue the other way around If you looked at  -68-    12/18-19/89  models and you looked at the kind of interest rate differential changes that we've seen so far this year you could argue that the dollar should be much lower than it is--that the change in the dollar should be much greater than we've had since June or something like that So in some sense we undershot those kinds of weak relationships that we shouldn't rely on   The point I was making is that it is really only a question of timing Over the last three forecasts going from July of this year to the end of the forecast period the net change in the dollar that we've assumed or projected has been the same And in that period to some extent we've raised growth abroad and at the same time we've also raised interest rates a bit However, it seems that we have had some of it sooner than this [straight] line projection that we've assumed Therefore, as Mike and I have said, you move some of it exogenously We didn't fine tune the forecast [to that extent] so some of the real side and price effects, which under the original forecast would have come in 1992, will have moved into the forecast [for 1991] I'm not sure I'm answering your question but--   A little of that is lower interest rates, I might add   Yes In goods we may be off by a percentage point; the rest of it I think is--   Sure Do you mean the services side?   But, as Mike said, the real projection is approximately the same   And the question is whether-- Well, it is slightly differently distributed "
3871,1990-02-06," Well, several things One point is that inflation in Germany and Japan, of course, is lower than the average that is shown there, so that--   But the relevant interest rates adjusted for inflation, at least the way we've done it, are the ones in Chart 15 where real interest rates in the United States are below those abroad And that is, I think, the question As we've calculated those real interest rates, there is some weight given to the forecast going forward and, equally I might add, to what has happened over the past year and a half To the extent that we have overestimated the decline of inflation abroad, we have overestimated the level of real interest rates in those countries Now, a lot of the decline comes from Canada and the United Kingdom, two economies that have moved into a fairly weak aggregate demand condition Our projection is that, much as in the United States but sooner, that will begin to have an impact on the inflation situation The other part of the decline is more of a statistical artifact and has to do with the fact that a couple of these countries--Germany and Japan are two in particular--had a somewhat artificial boosting of CPI numbers last year, which is going    2/6-7/90  to be wiped out this year So, you have had either an understatement of real interest rates this year or an overstatement of real interest rates next year depending on what you want to say about that As I said in my presentation of the forecast, the decline of the dollar in this period is hardly precipitous and does not have a dramatic impact on the forecast on balance It has some impact on the 1991 level of activity and prices and so forth But in and of itself, given the level of the dollar where it is today, it has relatively little impact on the forecast for 1990   Natural gas belongs on the other side of the table   Absolutely That's what I meant when I said to Governor Johnson that to some extent the higher real interest rates today reflect our assumption that inflation will be lower tomorrow in the foreign countries As Mike was saying, there is a certain circularity in that construction The historical series gives you an actual centered forecast   Well, that's a possibility As I said, we are assuming that inflation will be lower Now, if you add another percentage point to foreign inflation relative to our forecast and keep oil unchanged, then that differential is going to drop from 150 basis points to 50 basis points [Unintelligible] absolutely And there may be an expectational element built into that   I don't know much more than what is in the paper I think several things are going on here One is that the political forces are seeking to do something--as political forces tend to do, if I may put it that way I think the Bundesbank's resistance to that, which I gather is shared by financial people in Bonn as well, is that this is dealing with the symptoms rather than the cause You can't automatically exchange--well, you can do it--but you can't exchange x number of East German marks for West German marks and then say that the world has changed and we'll all go on The question is What comes next? You haven't done anything just through the currency exchange   Moreover, it may make things worse in terms of the workings of the economy The resistance from the Bundesbank comes primarily from the view that--I'm repeating myself--doing this is dealing with the symptoms rather than the causes On the other side, I would agree with your analysis that it is not so much the conversion in and of itself [that is a problem], because I've seen calculations that if all the [East German] currency were converted into West German marks, there would not be a big change in the level of the money supply   Well, it's something like 3 percent, which is trivial in the sense of what you're dealing with, because it makes some sense to have a new transactions currency There may be concern, looking down the road, that there may be more to it than that If you  -44-    2/6-7/90  think of what adjustments have to made, initially it would be straightforward Everybody's wages would be changed If [the exchange ratio] were 3 to 1 and you were being paid x GDR marks per hour, you would now be paid a third of that per hour in West German marks And that probably won't work Moreover, the price levels presumably would adjust up to West German prices And that's why it won't work Then you might get the secondary impact on the Bundesbank [unintelligible] inflate And I would argue that you are right--that one would be looking ahead, under those circumstances, to a more inflationary Bundesbank policy and would end up tending to think that the deutschemark ought to depreciate rather than appreciate So, the deutschemark probably was responding to what is happening in Moscow, with all the fighting and discussion that has been going on between [unintelligible] An interesting fact--and this is based really on one conversation--is that the East German financial people whom  met with yesterday agree on this point They agree that this conversion, without doing anything else, is likely just to make things worse rather than better, even in this period running up--   Well, that does happen   Mr Chairman, do you want to say a little, or maybe I can say it, about how we plan to run that meeting? The task force report on System foreign currency operations is--   March, right   The report is due at that time and we plan to get the associated papers to you, I hope, 10 days to 2 weeks in advance of that meeting Given your conference afterwards, we decided the best way to try to handle this would be to start at 900 am and, especially if we finish [the Committee's regular business] at 1200 noon, then run through the last hour and into the lunch period to discuss the task force papers that are being presented to you in that order We figured foreign exchange goes better over tuna fish than ""A,"" ""B,"" and ""C""   My understanding from talking to Ted Allison is that they are a little flexible about whether the planning meeting starts at 230 or 300 pm It would be whenever the discussion--   Oh, yes Actually, drafts are already in the Reserve Banks  -55-    2/6-7/90   We will polish them up and get them out to you They are rather thick, I fear to say, but I think actually they're relatively accessible We tried hard to make them accessible and we will try to get them out to you in an orderly manner and have a very brief summary--a reader's guide for them   If I'm not mistaken, there are 11   It is part of the Committee meeting   Well, from whenever you finish the main part of your meeting "
3899,1990-03-27," [Statement--see Appendix]   We're assuming from now on, [after] the first quarter, that the dollar will decline on average about 3 percent   For the rest of the forecast period--taking account of the adjustment through the first quarter, which still is negative And that compares with 5 percent in the last forecast Then you adjust for the higher inflation abroad and that's where I sort of got the 1/2 percent   I think so The major focus of our analysis has been on the German situation   Basically, as far as the rest of Eastern Europe is concerned, we took the general level of exports of those countries with the United States and added on $1 billion or something like that by the end of the forecast period just to get some sense of where one would be going in the future But I agree with you that in the short run we could have some negative impacts It's a little hard to factor all these things in because each country is moving at a different [pace] In Poland, on the one hand, although things seem to have gone downhill in terms of domestic production, they have gotten, as a  -10-    3/27/90  consequence of the changes there, a great amount of increased access to foreign exchange How that nets out in terms of their hard currency current account position and potentially demand from us and other countries is a little harder to estimate And, of course, the oil question, which is in fact a negative impact in the forecast [unintelligible] oil price It's one manifestation of [unintelligible]   I'm not sure what I hope, actually, at this stage! I think there are three points One, which is the basic story, is that we had some improvement--and I'm excluding capital gains and losses--in the current account in the last quarter of last year That was $1 billion at an annual rate and some further improvement is projected there We had the view that although this external adjustment problem is shrinking that the general adjustment problem would tend to weigh on the dollar And we have essentially adjusted in light of the stronger [interest] rates We moved from a  -12-    3/27/90  modest weight to 60 percent of the weight or something like that I don't think there's any magic in this; it certainly is possible that the dollar could be unchanged over this period It wouldn't make much difference in terms of the immediate forecast because most of the effect of the exchange rates, at least in the context of the forecast and how we put these things together, is the adjustment from the middle of last year--that part moving through the pipeline So, one would take maybe 3 off the growth of GNP over this period if the dollar were unchanged from the first-quarter average levels and maybe $3 or $4 billion off the current account level, if you believe the way this black box works on these things The one point I should mention is that to the extent that the dollar's nominal strength were associated with [higher] inflation abroad, then in real terms you would be in about the same place If inflation went to 6 percent in the major industrial countries on average and the dollar was unchanged, or if it [depreciate] by 3 percent relative to where we are now, in terms of the way things worked out that would be about the same The [depreciation] essentially would offset the inflation abroad So, one needs to set that partly aside That's the best I can do We've been wrong before and no doubt we'll be wrong again-- which way I'm not sure   Well, we don't even try to do it over a short period of time One factor that hasn't been focused on very much is that the current account adjustment in Japan has been quite impressive in dollar terms A piece of that is the J-curve But they've had about a $30 billion adjustment over 3 years in that current account position So that's 40 percent, essentially--on the same order of magnitude that we've had, if you want to put it that way Part of it is the J-curve; part of ours last year also was the J-curve effect Some of that is going on but there are some questions about how that's going to play out You could even tell yourself a story that the current account adjustment is going more rapidly in size in Japan overall--   --and that it continues here overall and, therefore, the expected level of the yen/dollar rate in the future is [unintelligible] Now, that certainly is possible There are a number of people who worry about the fact that we could get ourselves in a situation in which the US current account position is in balance, however one wants to define that, and the Japanese current account position is in balance and we would be stuck with this large continuing imbalance in the [bilateral] trade balance And that, I think, bothers some people for a variety of reasons But it is something that can't be ruled out   [Unintelligible] uses lesser or bigger weights In fact we use two weighting systems On the import side we tend to use import weights and on the export side we tend to use multilateral weights We have looked at multilateral weights in the models in terms of whether changes in the weighting system give you much difference and the answer is ""no,"" even though Governor Seger is correct that they are ancient weights that haven't changed that much over time Obviously, the weakness of the yen is affecting the outcome and we tried to take that into account On the other hand, the strength until very recently of the DM and other European currencies, and the Canadian dollar for that matter, is on the other side We have a lot of trade with Canada and they have a huge current account deficit at the moment They do even up Whether we have gotten the balance right in terms of these aggregates is obviously an open question   It is in the forecasting process   17 percent at an annual rate   The average of the fourth quarter of '89, which was 97 plus, to the average of the first quarter which is [93 on our index]   But there clearly is room for a different scenario, a more rapid inflation scenario, and that's why I put that forward as a risk As the staff usually does on these things, we sort of bend part way in that direction in putting together the overall forecast, but not all the way To the extent that we get both more inflation and more economic activity than we've built in, we are going to get more corrections on the current account In addition to the real versus nominal split, we would get more in terms of just the adjustment process and the dollar could well appreciate This is not a very finely-tuned point [estimate of the] deficit There is another point, which your first comment illustrates, that I think should be emphasized Again, it can be viewed in two directions Given the fact that the dollar has been in this channel--a wide channel, but a channel--for three years now, one might argue that the current account performance has been remarkably good Indeed, in the last year or so it has been much better than most models would have predicted   Yes The US current account position is doing much better than [predicted] We were saying a year ago that with the dollar staying where it was the current account was going to  -16-    3/27/90  deteriorate and it has not Now, you were saying that indeed a process is going on here which is outside of the exchange rate, however you want to weigh the process; or you could say that we have the [weights] all wrong and somehow the past will catch up with us It is an area of uncertainty in terms of the whole outlook   But if it's on the inflation side, I don't think it will affect the basic forecast very much   Okay And if it's because of prospects for economic activity, then presumably that will help us And one question is To what extent is this featured appropriately in the 18- month forecast?   Oh, I think you'd get some considerable--   It would depend a bit on the timeframe of all this and what kind of music went along with it, if I may put it that way, and as Don has already said on what the reaction was abroad But if you take what policies are abroad [now], my feeling is that you could get 3 or 4 percent, anyhow, on the dollar in the short run Then, as other things came into play that might be sustained or move the other way It would be affected by what goes on later But I think you could get quite a lot of movement at this juncture, if the funds rate went up that much in the short run   [Statement--see Appendix]   Just to come back to the collateral issue, since it has been raised twice now It was a self-denying ordinance that the Board imposed on itself, given the circumstances as they existed in the early 1980s And I suspect that the proposition that you--   You'd have to change your policy The question is whether you--   It tends to be associated with one or two people in Congress at least one of whom, Ron Paul, is not there anymore It was also associated with concern and confusion in the outbreak of the debt crisis and the misuse of that power to bail out Brazil, Mexico, or any of your favorite or nonfavorite LDCs It is not currently an issue I'm not saying that it wouldn't be noted--   If the circumstances were such that the Congress felt that the dollar should go up and we were excessively buying foreign exchange--which I think is what you're talking about--it would become an issue That is correct Generally the bias in Congress has been the other way, however   May I come back to one point that Mr Johnson raised? We did look at this question of volatility, which is related to the sterilization; it's the very last three or four pages in the book In fact, much to my surprise, we did not find a correlation between interest rate volatility and the scale of our intervention whether we were in the market in a moderate way or a big way The volatility of interest rates, whether long or short, seems to be the same I was surprised because in some sense it was a biased test I  -52-    3/27/90  would have suspected that [unintelligible] in the market because there were certain other things going on It's not a strong test, but there isn't [a correlation]   There seems to have been less confusion than I would have thought   That's their loss   Just to give my answer to your question, I think one thing that needs to be recognized is--and I don't think the situation in 1989 was any different, quite frankly, from the situation in 1978 in this regard--that there is a desire if you're sitting where the Treasury is to think that you have another instrument, a very strong instrument And in the more recent period that has been complemented by the sense that they have an additional dimension of that instrument that's associated with something called the G-7 process They see that as an instrument of dealing with a trade problem, which could be viewed either in terms of short-run policy or in protectionist terms or a longer-run build up of liabilities [unintelligible] of the United States that will bankrupt our children or grandchildren   In fact, the Chairman recently asked Charles [Dallara] why he was concerned and that was the answer he gave   They see it as a device, I would argue, that gives them another degree of freedom I don't want to get into a debate with President Corrigan about what the technical literature says on this matter, but the Treasury officials certainly are on the side that says that intervention is and has been and can be and should be--certainly should be--effective And if it is over the longer term, then they have a tool to deal with the problem that they see, the perceived problem I don't think it's any more complicated than that We were in exactly the same situation in the 1978-79 period   If it's a problem, it's a smaller problem I think that's all the Chairman is saying   If it's going to be a problem, it's either a $500 billion problem or a trillion dollar problem   That's a different question   I would agree with what I think Sam said here implicitly and what President Corrigan said earlier The Treasury recognizes--all Treasuries, if I may put it that way, have recognized --that they need the stature of the Federal Reserve or the central bank behind them and that it is not in their interest to go to international meetings, whether it's G-7 or G-10 or G-22, at loggerheads with the central bank The Japanese are proving that today   So, therefore, they feel that they're better off keeping peace in the family; it's not any more complicated than that   Was it a crime, to use your word, in the 1960s when we were partners with the Treasury in protecting our gold stock by getting back into this business and creating the swap network? Now, some people will read history and will say that it was a mistake of policy to--   The world was very different   But I don't think that the motivations of the Treasury and ourselves [yesterday] in terms of working together to deal with what was perceived as a common problem or common threat are any different than their motivations to work with us today I don't think they have any ulterior motives It's not in their interest to do so   But I think it's fair to say that the Treasury does not know--and no one else, I think, outside this room essentially knows--that we have gone through this exercise and that the timing was of a nature that these two practically came together We did not think it was in the System's interest to communicate with the Treasury that we have planned all along to have a big pow-wow on all this and, therefore, we're holding up [our participation] So, in that sense it was technical; it seemed appropriate under the circumstances, including the uncomfortableness that has been building over the last six months, to say that we would pull out and re-examine this and would come back and tell them where we [stand] after the meeting At least that's my--   I think that's what the Chairman--   No, they used the profits from gold sales   Yes  -73-    3/27/90   A lot of things that we do have never been tested before   I don't want to play lawyer here but it does strike me that there was one act of Congress that created the Exchange Stabilization Fund and gave it some capital Okay? And [that was] 50 some years ago and since then there have been no appropriations In fact, the appropriations in the meantime have taken some of that capital away and given it to the IMF It was used to pay for our IMF subscription Subsequently, [Congress] did give it capital in the sense that they assigned the holdings of SDRs to the Exchange Stabilization Fund and at the same time, after a big tussle with the Federal Reserve, authorized the Exchange Stabilization Fund to be able to sell us SDR certificates So, they already created one area in which they can expand the balance sheet of the Exchange Stabilization Fund   And the gold certificates   Yes, but that seems to me--   Yes, but the warehousing is public, the Shadow Open Market Committee notwithstanding It was public at the time that they passed the Monetary Control Act Just because the Shadow Open Market Committee can't look up in the policy record and see when the [amounts] have been changed, they have been changed It's part of the policy actions of the Committee In fact, it dates back 28 years It strikes me that the notion that the warehousing is a flimsy legal reed just doesn't [wash] A different question, which I think the Chairman has addressed, is the risk to the United States of these large balances; that is a separate issue It certainly is one that the Treasury Secretary as the chief financial officer of the United States ought to address in that capacity And indeed, the Chairman has said that he plans to raise that even more forcefully than he has in the past   The current system really is not that We were the reserve currency; the dollar is regarded as that in a certain sense, but the current monetary system is not built on the Bretton Woods system where the rest of the world is obligated to defend the dollar That's not true anymore   Well, I can only speak for the last 15 years When you first did this operation in the late '70s, in 1976-77 in connection with sterling balances, in the second and third sterling balances agreement there was a maturity on the arrangement When we came to the point where the Carter bonds had been issued and the issue was how the Treasury was going to hold those proceeds, which initially were being held pending intervention and later were held pending  -77-    3/27/90  repayment since the Carter bonds were 3 or 3-1/2 year notes, the Committee eliminated that restriction So at the moment there is not that kind of restriction Speaking only from what I've heard in this discussion one component of resuming the discussions with the Treasury would be the question of dealing with the warehousing sooner rather than later And presumably if that were the desire of the Committee, warehousing of foreign currencies would be dealt with before other foreign currencies would be dealt with So, if you used foreign exchange--as has been done in the past--to pay our next increase of IMF quotas, it would come out of the warehouse if that were the choice of the Treasury And we would certainly have the grounds on which to insist on it We even have the grounds to insist that they redeem SDR certificates; that's written into the legislation We can't force them but we do have the grounds because there is the legislative history on that point So, it's the same type of issue But at the moment there is no maturity I'm not even sure it makes any sense to have any maturity unless you wanted to approach the Treasury and say ""Okay, $45 billion is too much and we want to get rid of $10 billion over the next 10 months"" We could no doubt work out a program in which we did that I'm not sure it would make much sense, but we could do that   It was taken away when it didn't make sense in the context of the Carter bonds   So you could argue, if you wanted to raise this general question with Congress in a nonconfrontational way, that that in one sense does give you the basis to raise this question The Chairman of the Board made this promise in 19--whatever it was--  SPEAKER(?) 1982  -78-    3/27/90   --in 1982 in connection with [unintelligible] The circumstances have changed; these are why the circumstances have changed; and this is what we're now going to do That invites the Congress to decide whether they're serious about the collateral issue, which was not a matter of law but rather a matter of procedure, including Governor Angell's warehousing   Well, it's on our balance sheets   Right   It doesn't matter which way it's done the way we do it   The Committee has to take a separate vote to warehouse Argentine australs   Yes   It's up to them; they may ask for less   If I may be allowed to advise you in public, Mr Chairman I would suggest that since the [G-7] meeting is going to be held very shortly, on April 7, if there is anything even remotely substantive, you might want to have a telephone conference at least to report on the G-7 meeting   We'll have Norm call everybody up and say there is nothing [substantive to report] "
3956,1990-07-02," [Statement--see Appendix]   Politics   Our sense is that they would resist something above 4 percent but that for a period of time they will tolerate something in the high 3s That's part of the forecast And, as I said, they may [unintelligible] more, in which case the forecast [unintelligible] "
3981,1990-08-21," [Statement--see Appendix]   I wouldn't want to overinterpret the information, but the current Canadian experience is that they have had slow growth for an extended period of time, not a recession, and their consumer price inflation has begun to bend down The year-over-year rate has declined by about 1/2 percentage point They have been helped, if you want to put it that way, by a depreciating dollar I'm not sure how accurate that [linkage] is, but it is an example where a basic strategy that is essentially the same--maybe a little more so--seems to be producing some results along those lines   They've been at it for, depending on how you count these things, about a year and a half or so   Yes, a little longer They've had slower growth; they have come down from a higher growth [rate] to [unintelligible] So in some sense there has been more deceleration of growth in the period and their unemployment began to turn up in about the early part of this year   Well, as I said, I don't want to overinterpret this It is generally accepted that they have a much less flexible economy than ours and, therefore, their natural rate of unemployment should be higher Their market mobility and so forth is tighter and they have complicated laws; that is one explanation for why they started out with a somewhat higher inflation rate   Yes As Dave said, we assumed essentially a shortfall of 4-1/4 million barrels a day from Iraq and Kuwait And then we assumed an offset of 2-1/4 million barrels a day Partly just    8/21/90  because we felt it was useful to write down figures so we could in some sense check our assumptions--and I emphasize assumptions--later on against the realities, we assumed 1-1/2 million barrels a day in Saudi Arabia, [300,000] barrels a day in Venezuela and 200,000 barrels each, I think, in UAE and Nigeria just to spread it around   No, 50 basis points   Well, in order to achieve this real GNP target, the model made us, if I can put it that way, reduce the funds rate by 50 basis points in the third quarter That was sustained and then gradually the gap between that and the baseline [unintelligible] I should emphasize [unintelligible] we're dealing in a quarterly model, so we moved Iraq back to [30 million barrels per day] in some sense   Obviously, the neutrality of oil prices is a feature of the model Whether or not it's a feature of history, at least it's captured by the model And there's no particular theoretical reason why that necessarily has to prevail at least to the degree it has; maybe it [unintelligible] As far as the model goes, you're correct that there are not forward-looking expectations in the model, though it's not quite clear to me in this world with which we are dealing what you would ground forward-looking expectations on because you have to have expectations about, among other things, the oil price scenario itself And, as has been discussed, that could go a variety of different ways When we ran the simulations, we did adopt at least, again as a mechanical feature, slightly different monetary policy assumptions abroad And that does produce some depreciation of the dollar and gives us some impetus to consumer price inflation from that source So it does wash through this way; you don't get a very dramatic impact As I tried to lay out our judgment about policy responses, I'm not so sure that other than in Japan we are going to get any particularly pronounced policy responses I think it is true that the market is expecting a more--and I should underline ""a more""--vigorous resistance to inflationary impulses from the Bundesbank at this time Our judgment is that the market is wrong or maybe overdoing it And in some sense, that's what we built into the forecast To the extent that we do get more [policy restraint] abroad, then we would have a more vigorous resistance to the inflationary impulses from higher oil prices I think that would manifest itself in the first instance in exchange rates, and that clearly is a risk to the forecast   Well, I think the point you're getting to is that if you drove that process far enough, that would be one interpretation It might even be minor But in the 1970s process it would result in circumstances in which, although in the short run the mechanics of the model would generate lower real interest rates and so forth and so on, in the longer run you would have a higher built-in level of inflation and all the associated dislocations that we believe underlie that So it could get us on a higher plateau of inflation [and a lower] long-run potential of the economy under those circumstances [than we] would assume, even though in the short run it might have stimulative effects as Mike described   So it's relatively optimistic because, as Dave said and as President Boehne's question implied earlier, in some sense the fundamental forecast accepts that the amount of slack that's built in the underlying forecast--given no further shocks from further oil price increases--is enough to begin to bend down inflation But it's postponed and it's at a higher level   Well, there are some nonlinearities involved in this, but in that range the models will tell you that you would get proportionally the same kinds of responses or a little more Instead of losing 1/2 percentage point of growth, we would lose another 1 percentage point plus of growth over the next four quarters--at least abstracting from the dislocation effects, which I would argue and I think you would argue probably would be there So, the models would suggest that a $35 oil price rather than a $25 oil price for a sustained period is going to cut another percentage point or more off of growth And given the level of growth that we have, that would put us near zero or below We all know that when we make up numbers, a smooth forecast will show something like zero but that probably is going to mean several quarters of negatives--on that order of magnitude   Well, that's one of the conditional dimensions of the forecast We're reasonably comfortable, given the particular oil price scenario that is built in here In the baseline scenario we think there would be a spurt in inflation, some reduction in growth, and some reduction in exports in the short run--over the next several quarters But then these economies--at least the continental European economies and Japan--in general would be relatively robust There is still the phenomenon of rebuilding in eastern Europe and East Germany that is driving those economies and it should help sustain exports,  -14-    8/21/90  In Japan in particular, as I mentioned in my presentation, there has been quite a lot of rise in short-term nominal interest rates, so they call it monetary restraint and as always there's a question of calibrating the extent that that is going to bring about adjustments And the big drop in the stock market in Japan [unintelligible] as well So I suppose we could see--it's not outside the realm of possibilities--half the growth that we now expect in Japan That would have some implications for the forecast But I think it's no more uncertain than anything else that we put before you in this export [unintelligible] policy "

4046,1990-10-02," There are really three factors there The answer is that we can't give you too many assurances, obviously, for  -12-    10/2/90  the reason that you cited We have the same [uncertain] oil situation here There are some short-term effects built in, which cause this low that's going to look like [unintelligible] As a short-term factor, we took account of the fact that we're not going to ship any more grain to Iraq right away but that the grain will go somewhere else as we get into 1991 So, that tends to give you a short-term decline that magnifies the bounceback Then in the fourth quarter to the first quarter, with the negative growth in the United States, imports are held down So that gives you an arithmetic effect as far as net exports are concerned Then, as we get further out into the forecast, the lower dollar that has come about over the last year tends to give a boost to exports as well as to hold down imports The growth assumption that's in here has been marked down somewhat from recent forecasts; it was marked down last time and it was marked down this time consistent with the effects that we have in the US economy And we have quite slow growth built in, as the Chairman mentioned earlier, for Canada and the United Kingdom, for example; we have negative growth in those two countries On the other hand, we have some resumption of growth next year, especially in Canada So, that does give a boost in that direction We also have a somewhat rosier outlook--or let me say a less negative outlook--for Latin America in 1991, which gives us a boost to [exports] Those are the big factors   Which one is which?   Well, I think you would get a reaction with ""A,"" quite pronounced, if you get it all done at once With the two-step process the way Don described, you might get a reaction with the second step, depending on what the circumstances were at that time As Sam said earlier and Don suggested, I think there is something built into the market at this time Sam, you may want to comment again in light of what has been said We probably would get some adjustment In some sense there was an adjustment yesterday, essentially anticipatory The exchange market came back a little today; I think the adjustment may have been overdone   Falling out of bed? "
4070,1990-11-13," The [current] limit is $10 billion and the [potential] limit actually voted by the Committee is $15 billion   President Forrestal, you probably have seen it, but you've seen it more in the exchange rates than in the interest rates   Although Japan is still running a current account surplus, it is a lot smaller, so there's less financing going to come, net, from that country anyhow So, some of that is going to come out in various pieces But to the extent you have some [unintelligible] factors, you're going to find it both in interest rates--and there may be special reasons why you don't see it in the Treasury bill market--and also in the foreign exchange markets   The Board [unintelligible] required authority There was some in place because your Bank and a couple of others used it as I remember The Board declared that it would not do so    11/13/90   No, it came up because we were using Swiss francs   Yes   It is true that during that period there were problems with the Mexican peso, but in the particular cases in which [foreign currencies] were used we were using Swiss francs The Board said at the time that it would not do so again except under a determination of unusual and exigent circumstances So, there's an S letter out governing the use of collateral and that would have to be changed   The greenback would go to a premium then   [Statement--see Appendix]   Implicitly, I think the assumption is that the war would be short and would have, as Mike said, relatively minor impacts on the production side The other scenario, which I think is also broadly consistent with the oil price assumption but doesn't have quite the same broader psychological impacts, would be just a stalemate And under those circumstances we could have much higher prices That is, with oil prices that are consistent with existing supply and demand relations you would find a gradual erosion in oil prices You can even argue that that's what has happened to some extent over the past several weeks I don't want to push these data too much, but we've had some of both scenarios So, it's fair to say that this is not a ""long war forecast,"" if you want to put it that way   And it is essentially the drop in the dollar that has occurred between the forecasts   Well, the models, such as they are, don't help very much in this area The quantitative history does say 50 basis points on the funds rate is not going to do much more than 1 or 2 percentage points at most on the dollar What the Bluebook was trying to point to is that there are things that are [beyond the] model In some sense we haven't had much change in interest rates since July We had an 11-1/2 percent drop in the dollar So, it really is a question of how much more of that there is in the pipeline As you know from dealing with economists these days, there are two views One would be the market view that Sam put forward that things are very fragile and [the dollar] could move quite far and quite quickly The other view, as Sam also said, is a sense that has been partly articulated that authorities might take action But one could even say--I'm putting words in his mouth that he didn't actually say--that there's a sense that the dollar has moved a long way down and, therefore, has created more of an upside potential   I think what the Bluebook was trying to point out was that there is no significant risk! [Laughter]   With another quarter point you're going to get some [dollar movement], and we saw that over the last several days-- though, as always, these observations over the last 10 days or so are contaminated with things like the Bundesbank moves or other events that happened in the world But I would say that with another quarter point the dollar would move down marginally because it is already mostly discounted "
4108,1990-12-18," Yes, the action to renew them was endorsed by the Committee at the last meeting   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, it could be You may have noticed that last year we had a similar aberration in October, so I think there are some misplaced seasonal factors at work in these data Obviously, if we had to go back and do the forecast given the data we have as of this morning, we might have a somewhat smaller swing However, much of this swing is coming from the oil phenomenon and we have pretty good data going through the early part of December on that I might note that the oil number that's on the table there is higher than we had projected both in quantity and value, but that is largely because we found some oil in the New York harbor that hadn't been included in previous months If you strip that out, you have a sharp drop-off in    12/18/90  the quantity of oil, which will be stripped out in the GNP account, and a sharp drop-off in the volume of oil imports, which get valued at 1982 prices So, that's going to have a big statistical impact in the current quarter   Sure   Every category was actually up; there is no one particular thing to point to Automobiles were up substantially and that may be the luxury car phenomenon Other consumer goods also were up substantially, but capital goods were up too "
4241,1991-06-10," I'd like to comment after Mike does   I think the only point to be made on the external side is that the data that have come in on the trade side, which are quite old, are consistent with what we had expected The March data came in after the May FOMC meeting and were consistent with what we had expected On growth abroad, the German number that was announced last week was stronger than we expected, but we think it had some special features so that it doesn't suggest more strength than we anticipated There may be marginal easing and a deeper recession in Canada than we had expected and a later turnaround The other factor, of course, in terms of the outlook, is this relatively strong dollar, which has persisted since the last Committee meeting As Sam said, if it persists, it does imply that we probably would take the external sector more as a negative than as essentially neutral, which was the view in the last Greenbook forecast "
4246,1991-06-24," It had been announced The President announced his proposal in December and Baker had it in his speech last week   Thursday   Friday   Well, we also will realize a small profit   That's right, Sam I thought I had understood something different as well, but they may have some other way of doing their accounting   We mark-to-market every month; in fact, those losses, if you want to put it that way, have already been [taken] "
4269,1991-07-02," They told us this morning close of business tomorrow   Our understanding is that when the Bundesbank releases its statement at the close of business on Wednesday, they will say that their gross assets and liabilities have been reduced because of an exchange with a foreign monetary authority When the statement of the System comes out, given that hint, the market will then presumably be able to put it together as to what monetary authority is involved We and the Treasury have worked out--   --a general statement just saying ""Yes, the US and German authorities have agreed to reduce their holdings, have been working on this for some time, and have come to a mutually agreed off-market transaction""   It's not intended to provide information on the whole [agreement involving] 10 billion [DM] but essentially what has at that point impacted on the balance sheet   Well, that would be much later The System's monthly statement is only published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin   US reserves are released about two weeks after the end of each month But that combines the valuation adjustments of all kinds of other things, so it's not--   Well, in mid-July that will show what is on the balance sheets as of the end of June   The United States foreign exchange reserves, including Federal Reserve holdings, are shown valued at market   President Hoskins, I think there are two other considerations One is that the arrangement, while it reduces our position by about $33 billion, pertains to a forward transaction, and only the first chunk of that has been done So, I think there's a risk that until the full operation is completed you will confuse the market by lowering the limit in anticipation of what is in the contract but has not been put out Secondly, as far as the warehousing is concerned, the Committee did consider that in February and the amount that has been warehoused has not yet been changed since then Sam and I both in our conversations with the Treasury have told them that we think it's important, as this unfolds and they get the actual dollars, to reduce the warehousing and to bring that down substantially by the end of the year So, the beginning of next year, when we have completed this operation, would seem to me the reasonable time to consider whether the Committee wants to change the limits   [Statement--see Appendix]   Mike had two quarters!  -24-    7/2-3/91 -25-   This phrase, if my memory is correct, has been in the directive since about the middle of the 1970s And it was--   Well, I'm not so sure about that There have been several rounds in which we tried either to define it or to refine it to a greater degree My memory of listening to the Committee on this point is that they always ended up saying it's a way of suggesting that international dimensions of policy are not completely irrelevant to the Committee's deliberations If you want to look for substance, that's what it is "
4311,1991-08-20," Well, viewing the forecast as a whole, it is not an assumption that is part of the projection process It is endogenous to our outlook for interest rates here, which is where we start from, our outlook for interest rates abroad, and what else is going on in the forecast The MPS model has a slightly different exchange rate equation than most others, none of which does very well these days Basically, since the forecast for interest rates is flat here and flat abroad, the unchanged dollar, at least [to the extent it is] driven by interest rates, is consistent with that To the extent that one wants to add in some view of what is happening in the current account, which some other equations do--that's a feature that has tended to do very poorly in the models recently--the fact is that the current account is continuing to be in the negative It is quite modest, at least taking the judgmental forecast Again, I don't think you can find any particular downward pressure on the dollar from that "
4385,1991-11-05," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, we have incorporated into the forecast a dollar at essentially the level that we have today, though there always are uncertainties, as Gretchen has said, about how that will end up playing out in terms of the fundamental competitiveness and perceptions thereof and, therefore, export sales and import purchases So, there is certainly some looseness to the translation between the exchange rate and everything else that goes along with it and the net export picture And, of course, there is some uncertainty on both sides--on the up side as well as on the down side as far as growth abroad is concerned We have a modest expansion abroad; it would certainly be easy to sketch out a scenario that is weaker than that It's also possible to sketch out a scenario that is stronger either in its own right or to some extent stimulated by maybe a somewhat stronger picture here than we or others are currently thinking about But there's some [uncertainty] on both sides, I'd say "
4429,1991-12-17," [Statement--see Appendix]   One other aspect of this is that on the trade in computers, which is subject to the same kind of influences, it does seem that there has been a structural shift Our trade in the computer area, broadly defined, is such that essentially we now have balanced trade We've gone from a situation in which we had a slight surplus in this [area] to balanced trade That seems to be associated largely with the change in the structure of the market whereby mainframes and so forth are being de-emphasized and peripherals, software, and other computer processing [equipment] are being emphasized more [These categories] are those that tend to come in from abroad and [they are subject to] all kinds of relocation decisions and so forth and so on We have vaguely adjusted to that process as it seems to have unfolded over the course of 1991, and we see no basis for [assuming] it will change Therefore, we have in some sense a stronger import component to computer-related demands than we had built into our forecast before "
4466,1992-02-04," We would recommend that you approve the Foreign Currency Authorization, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the Procedural Instructions as they now stand With respect to the warehousing authority, as we discussed at earlier meetings of the Committee last year, the warehousing agreement with the Treasury on behalf of the Exchange Stabilization Fund and the Treasury's general fund is subject to annual review You have received a memorandum from me on this subject To summarize that memorandum, the amount of DM warehoused has been reduced from a peak of $9 billion in March of 1990 to the current $2 billion And with the prospect of a further reduction in the near term to zero, it would seem appropriate to us to reduce the size of the arrangement from the current $10 billion to the more historically normal level of $5 billion; that level prevailed from 1978 to 1989 Therefore, I recommended a renewal of that size and Bill McDonough concurs with that recommendation  I would note three points First, if the Exchange Stabilization Fund repurchases the remaining $2 billion, as we assume and expect it will, its dollar position will be relatively low, so we might have to reverse that later Secondly, the Treasury has expressed some anxiety that conditions could change such that they might want to warehouse more than $5 billion In staff conversations with the Treasury, we noted that the size of the arrangement has been increased in the past and we assured them that the Committee is prepared to consider any reasonable request for changes in the future Lastly, Bill McDonough and I have told the Treasury that once the $2 billion is repurchased, the terms of the arrangement should be adjusted marginally to conform more closely to market practice In the future, the forward ""leg"" would be at a forward market rate rather than being flat This seems more sensible It basically equalizes our interest returns and our foregone earnings The Treasury staff has agreed in principle to this change and has agreed that it is appropriate to make the change not in the middle of an arrangement but once we've gotten it cleaned away I'd be pleased to answer any questions   One additional point This had been discussed at least in principle the day before in the context of a strong dollar--the dollar having gone up The ambiguity came when we had the market that we had on Friday On our part we felt that since the dollar was backing off, the Treasury probably would no longer be interested [in intervening] But they turned out to be interested and we had to confront the question of whether to go along; we felt that on balance it was better to go along   Late April   Most German interest rates were down over the period since early January   Yes, the models will give you a higher income elasticity However, a statistical test in which we essentially re- estimated the elasticities suggested that those elasticities have come down over time pretty much like the [actual behavior] and are closer to an elasticity of one on both the export and import sides Therefore, we have in the forecast a relatively modest pickup in the real [import] component    2/4-5/92   In general imports have been performing throughout the last several years at a lower level than we had anticipated And those two things together plus the other factor, which [has been] important for a number of years, led us to put in a small adjustment [unintelligible]   Well, I think you're right in making that inference; there probably is some degree to which we have a natural convergence of these things at least on the inflation side After we    2/4-5/92  put all this together, we noticed that several of the 1992 numbers on that chart are at 30 percent I think that reflected a reluctance to put ""2"" [as the first] number On the growth side, it seems to me that there is a convergence, but the movement is from different directions Germany and Japan essentially are moving down and the weaker economies are moving up [in their respective growth rates] In some sense that reflects the fact that a period in which we've had quite a lot of divergence in the experience and the needs of the different G-7 countries is coming to an end, though we end up with a forecast in which certainly for the United Kingdom and Canada growth still remains pretty weak relative to potential As far as the exchange rates are concerned, to the extent that we do have both this convergence on the inflation side and less divergence in terms of certain short-run macroeconomic policy needs, it would seem to me that we're likely to have less shocks, if you want to put it that way, coming from abrupt shifts in policy over this period I suppose the one set of question marks associated with this is that we're in a period, taking the two-year period as a whole, in which we have not only here but abroad--in Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Japan--a lot of elections If you put that all together, we could have some political shocks In the case of the United Kingdom, I don't think we will see a fundamentally different policy even if the Tories should lose because Labor is as committed to staying in the ERM as the conservatives are and that is going to constrain monetary policy Plus they think things are so bad that they would undertake once and for all to make exchange rate adjustments It's uncertain what that may mean in terms of macro policy And on the fiscal side they may move from a situation in which they have quite a lot of room to maneuver to one in which they really don't have that much anymore; but they're pretty much boxed in, even if there is a change in governments   Well, I think there are two factors One is the question as to relative distortion that you want to focus on I guess a priori my view would be that in some sense the relative distortion would be larger in the major industrial countries abroad than it is here We probably spend more time purifying our CPI than do some of the other industrial countries, which biases [their estimates] in the other direction Moreover, just in the short run, we have a phenomenon because what we use here are consumer price indexes There are cases for using other price indexes It's like everything else There's nothing perfect It depends on what you are trying to prove Certainly, in the short run, we have had a situation where there have been a number of shocks to the consumer price level abroad These are the result in the last couple of years of excise tax increases and things like that for example, [goods and services] tax in Canada, the [value added] tax in the United Kingdom, etc So, the foreign price level, in a truly competitive sense, is probably somewhat inflated relative to the CPI measures And that goes back for the last couple of years   I think that's a possibility We looked at it a couple of months ago [and] we were not convinced that it was as understated as you suspect it may be "
4515,1992-03-31," I think the other distinction, President Jordan, between the period 20 years ago and today is that 20 years ago the operations took place without the concurrence or even the knowledge of the U S monetary authorities In this case we're moving  to the BIS with the Bundesbank's knowledge  So, it's folded into their monetary policy and they have the capacity to offset the temporary effects  The other side of it is that   The balances moved to the BIS   President McTeer, as the Chairman said, two years ago we did have an investigation, if I can put it that way, of this matter Maybe I've been derelict, but I have provided the new governors with a copy of that study and, if the new presidents would like a copy of that document, they can get it if it's not already in their Banks I think it will be useful as background to this matter The simple point is that the System has independent legal authority to operate and we have set procedures that have been in place and reviewed periodically over the last thirty years We have the ability to make our own choices about whether we operate with the Treasury or not In fact, as Bill has described, this last period very clearly    3/31/92  illustrates the usefulness both of having our independent authority and of using it from time to time because it serves in my opinion to improve the overall character of the policy decision   There is a directive that is approved by this Committee at least once a year   The Committee will remember--those of you who were here--that at the last meeting the Committee voted to reduce the size of the Treasury warehousing facility from $10 billion to $5 billion, a level at which it had been for most of the last 15 years As the Chairman said, in the aftermath of that decision there was an exchange of letters between Treasury Secretary Brady and the Chairman As I noted at the last meeting, this reduction from $10 billion to $5 billion caused a certain amount of anxiety at the Treasury There was concern or nervousness about whether the Exchange Stabilization Fund, which remained pretty [fully invested] on the foreign exchange side relative to the dollar side, would be available to carry out other vital functions Secretary Brady wrote to the Chairman expressing his concerns to this effect The Chairman replied making three basic points One was that he could contemplate a wide variety of circumstances in which he would strongly support an increase [in the size of the warehousing facility] Secondly, he expressed his confidence that the Committee would give full, careful, and expeditious consideration to any reasonable proposal in that regard [Lastly,] he said he could not guarantee in advance what the Committee might do with such a proposal On the second point, just to clear everything up, we mentioned to the Committee last time that it was our hope and expectation that the Treasury would unwind the remaining $2 billion of DM that they had warehoused with the System And they are planning to do that; they are ready to do that effective on Thursday So, the facility will be wound down to zero effective as of that date [Secretary's note Copies of the letters referred to by Mr Truman are appended to this transcript]   [Statement--see Appendix]   I'm not sure what you assume about rates abroad, but on the interest rate side we have essentially the same [amount] of decline in long rates We're assuming that ultimately the Germans will get things under control and bond rates will drift down as well, though maybe not quite with the same timing as US rates, by about 50 basis points over the projection period   And that includes Japan, though the timing might be a little different for German and Japanese rates   Well, it all depends on the model Exchange rate models that use longer real interest rates essentially produce an unchanged dollar using these rates   Yes, an unchanged dollar, given our inflation forecast and given our interest rate forecast We mentioned in the Greenbook that there is one qualification that one might introduce here and that is the issue of what is expected either here or abroad One can tease out of some of this yield curve information and certainly out of T-bill futures a view of US interest rates that is different than Mr Prell's, if I can put it that way And to the extent that Mr Prell's true view becomes clear to the markets, one might argue that that would put downward pressure on the dollar I think the only question is whether there is an analogous error of judgment about interest rates abroad So, there is some downward risk coming from that disconnected light at the end of the tunnel that he referred to "
4540,1992-05-19, Bill is using dollar equivalent figures and combined Treasury/Federal Reserve figures That's at current exchange rates 
4566,1992-06-30," It may be, Governor Lindsey, that one of the reasons is that the conventional measures of purchasing power parity for the DM and the yen are so far from where [exchange] rates have been for so long--210 for DM, 190 for the yen--that they've lost their credibility as a benchmark even for such considerations Still, we can imagine [tolerating]--if you want to put it that way--exchange rates at that level, and the associated current account deficits that go along with that Now, that's one man's reaction to your question I have been struck by the work that McKinnon has done at Stanford on this Two or more years ago there was some suggestion that we could get back [to PPP] and, therefore, there was a lot of attention given to that issue But with the dollar essentially [disconnected from any anchor] on a purchasing power parity [basis] for such a long period of time, it has lost its [relevance] and we should not use the word ""anchor""   The Europeans are somewhat divided The French I think will go along with anything, but the rest of the Europeans will not My sense from my own conversations with Treasury staff, unless their views have changed in the last several days, is that they are not thinking of a deal, but one can never be quite sure when one is dealing with the United States Treasury   On the OPEC side, there is a considerable debate in the market as to exactly what Saudi Arabia's position is There was a runup when the market thought [the Saudis] were shifting their position, and then it backed down somewhat when uncertainty was introduced We have predicated our forecast on the assumption that they haven't shifted their position on market share That is because they have been increasing their productive capacity and it would seem to be a waste of money to increase productive capacity if they weren't going to use it And we have Iraq coming in three months later than we had before, so that's a negative factor This forecast of a drop in oil prices from the current spot rate is essentially the same as in the futures market It is a bit more optimistic but the optimism is on the order of 50 or 75 cents a barrel So, for better or worse, it's essentially consistent with the market forecast, which for obvious reasons is taking the same view, and that leads us to [a forecast of] a little more of a drop-back   No, most of it is due to economic activity The dollar, although it has moved around and is at the low end of where it has been, doesn't stay there It may be wrong in the forecast per se because it has been up and down for the past year What I meant to say was that, in comparing the two halves of 1993, the relative [widening] of the gaps between the red and the blacks bars is a function of the lower level of the dollar as a secondary effect that plays out   It's on the order of 1-1/2 percent, though we have this level because we're picking up additional factors on capacity utilization [unintelligible] and that pushes up the [unintelligible] end of the income elasticity on the import side "
4601,1992-08-18," In fact, Mr Chairman, it's interesting that in that tortured history, going back to the early 1960s [when] the Treasury agreed to the interpretation of the Federal Reserve Act made at that time, they did not assert that all we did had to meet with the approval or the control of the Treasury We understood at that time the need for cooperation, but that was not an element of the debate in the early 1960s From time to time, there have been some discussions on that point, but it has never been asserted as far as I know that as a legal matter the Treasury had the power to order us what to do with our own portfolio   I agree 100 percent with Mr Corrigan that we don't have the power, at least as a technical matter, to operate on our own We'd be foolish to do so And the [Committee's] directive under which all these operations [are conducted] does require us to operate in close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the Treasury and, as appropriate, with other monetary authorities, for the reasons that President Corrigan just articulated "
4626,1992-10-06," President Jordan, two points seem to need to be added here One is that in the second phase--the September phase of all this--I at least detected from my own contacts that there was essentially no pressure on us from the other Europeans to operate We did not have the same thing going in August So, they too were not looking for us to get involved in Europe On the last point, I think it's worthwhile sharing with the Committee the current attitude of the Treasury, which was that they were not interested in sharing the operation with Sweden That's why you are about to approve the entire $400 million So, there is a certain reluctance there It is my judgment, certainly, that these are not the right circumstances to put that issue squarely to the Treasury It is probably better to wait until things settle down   In many respects, given the magnitudes that Bill described, which are unprecedented in terms of anything I've heard of  [unintelligible], I think they have been remarkably successful--so remarkably successful in fact that they had already put the markets back in a position in which they were net short of funds at the end of the maintenance period last week, which is one of the ways the Germans were able to stabilize the situation In talking to people at the Bundesbank--though every person one talks to probably would give a different answer on that question--my impression is that at a very technical level they have been able to force some changes in their own operating procedures, but nothing like the price system to [unintelligible] instruments But they have been quite successful in the first round However, there's a big dispute within the Bundesbank that goes back decades about whether one can fully sterilize any of these operations The only way I could understand it is that if you have large capital flows, it is not clear that you could return the liability side of the central bank's balance sheet to its status quo ante But it's not clear with that and the same interest rates that you have changes in the demand for money that will give you different money supply numbers, a change in the multipliers, or whatever you want to call it There's a lot of dispute within the Bundesbank itself about whether one can truly sterilize the [effect on the] money supply That's at a different level, I think   [Statement--see Appendix]   I think most of the surprises are in the computer area If you strip out computers and look at nominal imports, our standard equations are not--   --doing any worse than they were before, if I may put it that way So, when you take out computers, other imports have not gone up The real surprise has been in computers which seems to be [a mystery] First of all, no one has a good model about what drives computer imports at this stage What seems to be going on is that there are a lot of applications with more power, but they are at the low end of the technological scale and that's where we are relatively import intensive At the higher end of the technological scale we are export intensive As a result we have a situation in which the computer trade balance is reversed And even assuming exports and imports now grow at the same rate, we would have a widening of that gap   We cooperate with R&S on this, and our sense from contacts we had after the Greenbook went to print was that the very rapid rate that we already had in the forecast might underestimate what is going on   That certainly is possible, though I will make two comments One is that over the last decade the Commerce Department has dramatically improved its collection of data in this area Moreover, we do see a dramatic upward trend in our exports of services of all kinds Now, the question you're asking basically is whether we're picking up as much of it as we should be The answer may be that the statistical system probably is lagging behind somewhat That's one of the reasons why, as I commented at the end [of my remarks], the services component of exports of goods and services is growing in the forecast even while the goods side of it is shrinking   As I said, I think it is unappreciated that, as opposed to the 1970s, one of the big impacts of the weaker dollar--not where it has been but where it has gone--has been the income effect as growth picked up in the rest of the world   Income differentials are less so that foreign travel, which is generally a luxury good anyhow, is cheaper and easier for people to do So, there are two things together Coming to see the Grand Canyon or Fisherman's Wharf or whatever is a big deal and it's cheaper and easier, and it affects the--   It does affect the GNP, I think   Right   If it's accurately measured, it's in the services area   Right   I take your point; I actually was trying to have it both ways, if I may put it that way It depends on what question you're asking I would separate it into two parts One relates to what has been going on with respect to the yen, where the dollar has been weaker But given the size of the Japanese current account  -12-    10/6/92  surplus, it's difficult to imagine that the dollar isn't going to have to move down against the yen at least in the near term It is difficult to believe anything else is right for that particular problem  On the European side, the normal historical pattern back in the 1980s when we had more frequent realignments in the EMS and ERM was for the dollar basically to be unchanged on average following [the realignments] because the mark was going up and the franc was going down The market in some sense is simply thinking in terms of competitiveness They had the dollar unchanged And the fact that the dollar has come up on average in the face of all this is something that should be noted because, among other reasons, in terms of thinking about the outlook it is a real appreciation and it has a damping effect It comes back to this question of how we live in this new ERM [era] They jumped in the canoe and we have for some period questioned whether they would toss us into the lake So, I think it is not irrelevant that the dollar is down relative to its level at the time of the last FOMC meeting by 3 or 4 pfennigs against the mark but up 3 or 4 pfennigs from the low of 138 So, in that sense we have a bit to go; there is a cushion there, it seems to me, before we really are breaking new territory on the part of the European currencies  I would put the yen on the side But, the important point that you're emphasizing--and I agree with it--is that the markets, as we saw yesterday, seem to be extraordinarily jittery One needs to recognize that fact And whether this is the right time to log another action, which may or may not be fully discounted in the markets, I think is a question   That's a very difficult question   I think that's right In some sense this is the position we were in at the beginning of September when we had the bad employment report Do you disrupt the market more by disappointing it relative to its expectations or do you disrupt it more by giving it  -16-    10/6/92  what it expects, assuming we have [assessed] the expectations right? We can guess, but our guess is not perfect I'd just add one point from a rest-of-the-world perspective It's one thing if we were just running our own situation But one of the problems, which makes this a little different, is the uncertainty that has been generated by the European situation and the fact that that has not played itself out in all its political as well as economic dimensions That does seem to me to add one small note of caution I don't think it is decisive, but to the extent that Federal Reserve easing at this point disappoints Mr Sapin again, he may have to cut off a few more heads [unintelligible] go forward But I think that goes with the territory That would be basically my response, but it is a possibility "
4653,1992-11-17," Well, I don't think one can exclude it Our outlook has been decidedly less optimistic than the IMF's or the OECD's for that matter Certainly in the case of Japan we see essentially no growth--a bit above zero--through the middle of next year For Germany we are a little more optimistic than some of the forecasts we now see coming out of Germany itself, though it may be that we have assumed that the Bundesbank might do a bit more in the meantime But I think [the possibility] is difficult to dismiss; a one standard deviation in the negative direction gives you a quite gloomy outlook in this situation We obviously don't have a lot of positive information suggesting that a turn is coming, and I think you're absolutely right that the feedback effects of a period of European stagnation on top of what they've just gone through in terms of trade relations and so forth could be quite disruptive not directly to economic activity but to the [economic] environment and, therefore, real activity Japan, of course, continues to be a question mark The Nikkei came down below 16,000 though it's back into that range, which makes things a little dicey They seem not to be making much progress   They included some of those, but in the public versions some parts of those reports were edited down   Well, the Secretary of the FOMC made us hew to a [strict] standard about what we left in and what we left out But you're right, there was still some lively material   It just so happens that we actually have two documents--a summary and a background document--that we did several years ago With one exception, I think it's mostly current It may not answer all your questions but it will give you quite a lot of background on what other central banks do; I'll distribute that after the meeting is over   I would have given them to you but I didn't want to disrupt the meeting "
4689,1992-12-22," Well, I didn't want to tell too many secrets in this temple!   What happens in the Census data is that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is treated as a foreign country [Laughter] And when a real foreign country takes some of the gold out of New York and ships it abroad, it counts first as imports and then as exports However, the import side is not picked up in the Census data So there you get the export side of it   That's because you haven't been filling out your import documents!   And in the balance of payments accounts it also counts as an import, so it washes out   And sometimes when they sell the gold, it might be sold into the United States, so it should count as an import It doesn't necessarily always show up as an export   Essentially, it's linear If you want to say the cutback in growth is approximately half of what we built into that worst case scenario, the impact on US growth would be roughly half I do think that memo in a way indicates that the worst case scenario is more probable in 1993 than in 1994 just because, with the passage of time, we are going to get more in the way of positive policy responses than one would expect, although it becomes increasingly possible to have two bad years as it is to have one I was surprised at that, too, but the basic reason why we get a bigger impact than one might intuitively have thought stems from two factors One is the dollar appreciation; that is quite substantial and it has a big impact, which one doesn't normally associate with this kind of    12/22/92  scenario on a sustained basis Secondly, with income elasticity, generally when you get above 1 you get a multiplication effect; things begin to add up   Yes, our forecast is somewhat weaker than the recent OECD forecast and the IMF forecast released today that I heard on National Public Radio That is partly because we forecast more often and have a faster turnaround in this process   Yes, though I think on balance for all of them including the staff [unintelligible] the US story--although it fluctuated up and down within a relatively narrow range over the last 12 months--has been their most accurate forecast, whatever consensus one wants to take The one that has been the most [unintelligible] has been Canada Whereas the Canadians, if you go back 12 months, for obvious reasons were looking for a faster pickup in the first half of this year than they actually had, that was one of the factors that weighed on their marking things down [unintelligible]    12/22/92   The other factor--I hesitate to mention it--is the appreciation of the dollar, which is partly a function of what is going on with US real rates and partly what we assume is going on with foreign real rates That's the major factor in the attenuation of growth on the external side, the net exports side, in 1994 The appreciation building over a two-year period begins to have effects It's like a tightening in monetary policy, [resulting in] weaker growth in the short run The stronger dollar affects '94 predominantly   But those could be short-circuited, too I'll give an example in a European context--maybe it's a far-fetched example One could argue that in Germany, given what they've set in motion, if they don't ease short-term interest rates, it essentially would be using policy against the natural lubricating forces in the economy So, if policy is too tight for any extended period of time, ultimately maybe the economy could adjust to sustained high levels of short-term interest rates of 8 percent or 9 percent, but you'd have to tell a very complicated story about how you got to that-- "
4730,1993-02-02," Mr Chairman, there are four items to consider the Foreign Currency Authorization, the Foreign Currency Directive, the Procedural Instructions, and the related agreement to warehouse foreign currencies for the United States Treasury There is a technical change proposed for the Foreign Currency Authorization and the Procedural Instructions concerning the change of the structure of the management of the System Open Market Account and the new positions of Manager and Deputy Managers I will be glad to answer any questions   We thought that the Committee ought to be aware of the fact that Congressman Gonzalez in one of his January 19th letters raised a number of somewhat garbled questions about the swap network, foreign currency operations, and in particular the purchases of the Mexican peso, all of which have been done in connection with swap operations completely covered by foreign operations He asked us to provide material to him covering the history of these arrangements going back to the beginning of time or pretty close to it--1962 We are in the process of doing that Almost all of what we're going to provide involves documents that are already in the public record in the form of the Managers' reports and excerpts from the FOMC policy records with regard to the Mexican swap arrangements and how they have evolved since 1967   I might comment that we don't always position our holdings as if we were maximizing the [return] in our portfolio in a short-run sense That's not the way the Domestic Desk runs its operations If you were a private citizen, you might choose something else   I think you're right in what you're referring to, but I think the ex-post analysis would be equally difficult since we don't really know until we've liquidated [our position]   Well, as far as NAFTA is concerned, we are assuming that it will be passed and put into force; if it isn't, that would be a negative factor on our forecast coming through Mexico As far as the Uruguay rounds are concerned, we have made no assumptions because we convinced ourselves that in the 1993-94 period it is irrelevant, if I can put it that way, in terms of its trade expansion impact That's not to say, though, that the failure of the Uruguay rounds in some form, or rather the wrong kind of failure, couldn't be a disaster looking out a little further As far as other trade measures are concerned, we have not taken explicit account of those-- maybe we should have--partly because of our feeling that developments like this steel dumping and so forth and so on, although they are politically sensitive in both the domestic and international dimensions, are not sufficiently important quantitatively to have a major macro-economic influence on the forecast The other reason is that, while there is considerable scope for those kinds of actions, they have long time tables on them And most other forms of action are precluded by international agreement, so there are some constraints So, we could have further dumping cases; but if they were all filed tomorrow, we wouldn't get them implemented until late in the year, so that would have a relatively small--   But the total amount of trade imports that are affected by that is $3 billion   There is considerable dispute on that point I've noticed articles in the newspapers and some commentary from President Keehn, based on his contacts in the market, that the producers are looking forward to this $3 billion, which is a non- trivial increase in sales, and the opportunity to raise prices behind those dumping markets On the other hand, the economists' argument is that there are a lot of other producers in this world and quite a lot of competition around the margin from other US industries That would suggest that the [prospects] of steel prices going up by the 15 or 20 percent average margins being plotted here are pretty unlikely In any case, in thinking about all this there are enough uncertainties that we decided not to take explicit account of it   Well, the error has to do with the pricing of capital goods imports They put two large price increases in the fourth quarter through an error That would feed through to give you a lower increase in the prices of imports, which contracts GDP and gives a slightly higher overall deflator everything else equal   If we presume that their assumptions about the nominal value of capital goods imports are unchanged, it would increase the real value of capital goods imports and would subtract one or two billion dollars from real GDP in the fourth quarter   No, but one has to understand that there's a big error band around what they assume It could be wiped out completely by other changes That's all I'm trying to say   We have some reading material for the Committee that we will pass out This is what was promised in the last line of the memorandum that Don circulated It relates to the last item on the agenda [concerning the release of confidential FOMC information and covers announcement practices] and organizational structures of major foreign central banks If you have insomnia tonight, you can read some of this  [Meeting recessed]  -31-    2/2-3/93  February 3, 1993--Morning Session "
4821,1993-07-06," President Boehne, I think there are two points to be made on this One is that, clearly, the Administration has not gotten itself into the position of saying they don't want the yen to appreciate further That's going too far in terms of all the irons they have in the fire So, they are somewhat exposed inevitably But, for example, when they lifted one of the veils--I guess that's the right way to put it--around the proposals for this framework discussion, they had already who were involved that [unintelligible] I was told one story about [someone] who got up to answer a question at the press conference; the question was not on the yen but he gave the yen answer as part of this discussion So, I think at least  to try to keep it out [unintelligible] Obviously, the central players--   That includes the measure for parts excluding tires We figured that was what people counted too much! "
4870,1993-09-21," [Statement--see Appendix] That concludes our presentations   We have continued with the same NAFTA assumption we've had in the past, which has been that the legislation will pass We noted in the Greenbook that in light of recent noise, if I may put it that way, that may be somewhat less of a ""gimme"" putt than we regarded it earlier And we thought a bit about what the implications of that might be, which largely--at least in the short term--revolve around the impact on Mexico, not the secondary impact on the United States We have seen this year that Mexican growth has slowed substantially That appears to us to be a combination of tighter policies in Mexico in the face of what had been a rising current account deficit and some uncertainties associated with NAFTA and the level of capital inflows Therefore, for next year, on the assumption that NAFTA would pass, we had moved up Mexican growth somewhat by about a percentage point In the absence of [NAFTA], we regard that increase in growth as problematic--I think that's the way we put it in the Greenbook Moreover, we think there would be some downward pressure on the peso and, therefore, there would be some drag on exports for the United States as a result of the failure of NAFTA That's about as far as we've gone "
4947,1993-11-10," Thank you, Mr Chairman As for the financial market developments, in light of the response to the debate and/or the sharp increase of about 3 or 4 percentage points in short-term interest rates, depending on which rate you choose, the peso appreciated today from about 327 to 321 And the stock market is up by a remarkable 42 percent in Mexico It has a tendency, as the man from the Bank of Mexico just said to me, to overshoot--to be either over enthusiastic one way or over depressed [the other]  As far as the arrangements are concerned, I think the most useful thing to do would be to go through the outline of the approach that we now envision on a contingency basis, most of which I think was described yesterday A couple of points are new and important It has now been decided to ask the BIS to try to put together a package from the other G-10 central banks and Spain So, we are now shooting for an overall package of a short-term credit facility, of which $6 billion would come from the United States and would come from the BIS Half of the $6 billion would come from the Federal Reserve and half would come from the ESF One change from the way we described things yesterday is that up to one-third of the total package would be made available upon request from the Mexicans That means in our case for the $3 billion that we would be putting in, up to $1 billion could be drawn Any disbursements in addition to that would require the mutual agreement of Mexico, the United States, and the BIS on behalf of their piece All the disbursements, with one qualification, would be in proportion to total commitments And there would be no disbursements made after December of this year This is envisioned as a short-term credit facility designed to deal with the run up to the NAFTA vote and the immediate aftermath Drawings would be repayable three months later and the entire facility would expire on March 31, 1994 It would have standard interest rate terms We would get the US Treasury bill rate There would be a link to a favorable indication about Mexico's policies coming from the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund  Because one of the changes from what you thought about and talked about yesterday is that  one then has to ask oneself the question How are we going to assure that we would be repaid? The mechanism we have outlined is that Mexico would commit to maintain $2 billion of reserves on deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and $2 billion at the BIS, though with mutual agreement those reserves could be drawn down lower Thus, in effect--    11/10/93   Only with mutual agreement could the reserves at those two institutions be reduced below that level; that includes our agreement If there were an outstanding balance at the expiry of the facility in March 1994, the standard condition of these arrangements is that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York could sweep in all deposits of Mexico that are available at the Bank to repay any outstanding balance That would take care of our repayment  In addition, Mexico would commit to consult with other participants on its financial developments and policies in the event that its gross reserves decline That is a checkpoint of a sort, to make sure or remind them at least if we think they are wasting too much money in this effort  Now, there is one qualification with respect to timing The aim is to put the overall facility in place as soon as possible However, it is recognized that it is easier and quicker in principle to put the US component of the facility in place rather than the BIS component of it So, assuming that we could get everything done and we were requested by Mexico, the United States would be prepared to announce its credit arrangement before the overall facility had been agreed upon And the US announcement might indicate that efforts are under way to develop a larger multilateral facility That is the outline of the terms and conditions as we now envisage them   Excuse me, I forgot to tell you Bill McDonough?   You have had a call, right, from Governor Mancera?   Yes   Just the framework--[a request to] try to work something out within this framework    11/10/93   In fact in my conversations with the Mexicans, they have indicated that the current intention would be not to do so, though they have not ruled out the possibility   I think so   Well, they have the liquidity to provide the $1 billion, which is all they need to do at this point   I have not checked the balance sheet   As of six months ago they did not, but I am not sure what the situation is at the moment   No To do something more it does; but to use the funds for this purpose does not require an appropriation   There are lots of ways they could do it In the meantime, they might sell some of their other foreign exchange and acquire dollars as a consequence    11/10/93   We looked at this last March--that's the last time I saw their balance sheet--and they had, as I remember, about $27 billion at that time The question is whether the accumulated interest has raised it any more between then and now   We think, because of this mechanism of the reserves being held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and our consent being required for them to draw down those reserves, that we would in effect be covered for that $1 billion   I think as a practical matter--   That's right I cannot anticipate all [that could happen in] the future That is why we have set this up so [it requires] mutual agreement if something happened I do not think we can completely anticipate all the developments that might take place over the next seven days or the next seven weeks   The way we would set this up it would require mutual agreement on two [specific aspects of the overall] agreement    11/10/93  Any drawing beyond the first third would require mutual agreement And there would have to be agreement to draw down the [remaining] balances at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York   That is why we proposed that they would be able to draw at least the first tranche That is the point Although there would be protections, that [tranche] could be drawn free and clear Their own stated intention, as the Chairman has said, was not to get themselves in a situation of overly defending an exchange rate or not defending it enough with monetary policy so that their reserves would be drawn down so much that they would even come close to the low levels that we are contemplating So they might draw, but they are most likely to maintain That is what the number comes from At least in gross reserves, they would have to reconfigure--even if they already have been--what they think their overall policies are going to be    11/10/93   There was mutual recognition involved, I think, Bob   This is a little different than most of the things we have done in the last decade, where the previous ones we've been involved in actually were bridge loans to some [other source of financing] This is more of a ""traditional"" use of the swap line--as we saw it used in the past--where there were short-run pressures, capital flows, and so forth and so on With that qualification, and therefore a slightly different question about where we look for sources of repayment, I think this is well within the basic parameters of how we have treated Mexico three times since 1982 and how the Treasury, in their own operations, has treated other Latin countries   I think the discussions that we have had over the last 24 hours, or at least those I have been a party to, have been quite warm and cordial In fact, Larry Summers at one point said we do have to understand that this is a continuing relationship and we do not want to do things now that would jeopardize [that relationship] in the future or would jeopardize it now So there is a sense of trying to strike a balance here   Before we and the Treasury suggested to the BIS that they go out more formally to ask the other G-10 countries and Spain to participate, I did contact the four biggest players Starting with Canada, for obvious reasons, the United Kingdom, France,    11/10/93  and Germany, it is fair to say that in each case I got some questions, both on strategy as well as detail In the first three of those four countries, I got an on-the-whole favorable reaction Germany was tough In recent years it has always been tough to convince the Bundesbank to go along on these arrangements I basically was asking the authorities of those central banks, including the Bundesbank, whether they would recommend to the US monetary authorities that they not try to put together a G-10 facility because we all recognize that if they thought it was a nonstarter and we tried and that got out, then that would not necessarily be helpful to the Mexican authorities In no case, including the Bundesbank, did I get that kind of advice   The Secretary "
4973,1993-11-16," [In] 30 years   Thirty years He's asking about the redaction of material that would be confidential--that relating to foreign governments or proprietary information And that would be redacted for 30 years, is that true?   No later than 30 years?   Thirty years   Just briefly the state of play is as follows As you know, last week we put in place, in the sense of being ready to go, a bilateral package between the US monetary authorities and the Bank of Mexico, and because of the favorable behavior of the financial markets it wasn't necessary to use that Meanwhile, we have been working with the Bank for International Settlements and their backing central banks to put in place as a contingency a package in which the [United State's] participation would be the same $6 billion The Federal Reserve's [part would be] $3 billion the existing swap line of $700 million that Peter just referred to and the special swap arrangement of $23 billion Our aim is to put all this in place on a contingency basis by tomorrow--to have it ready to go sometime after 800 pm Eastern standard time if things should turn out poorly, but not to do anything unless things should go poorly and the Mexicans decide to activate the arrangement In that connection I would request that you maintain contact with Norm Bernard, telling him where you are In particular, I think we need to know where you might be between 8 and 12 tomorrow night; or if that's too inconvenient, you might give Norm your proxy Our hope and the Mexicans' hope too, obviously, is that none of this will be necessary and it will all go away by early Thursday morning   Well, your memory is probably better than mine, President Jordan I don't think there was a commitment to review  -64-    11/16/93  whether we needed to do away with the swap network The commitment was that we needed to work on the question of balances, and that work is continuing We have had some problems getting the Treasury to focus on that, but I understand that is a continuing effort But if the Committee would like us to prepare a report on whether the swap network should be continued as it is, we can do that I feel that it is probably one of those things that is easier to retain than to do away with   The other part of it as far as I'm concerned and the reason I reacted the way I did--and I obviously misunderstood or misremembered, President Jordan--is that I don't see this as a matter for the Treasury Department at all It is true that since it's the FOMC that maintains the swap network, the FOMC can do away with it I think it is probably fair to say that if we were to move in that direction, we might want to have some consultation because over time we have used that cooperative [approach] But essentially what we do with those things is not a Treasury decision The balances side is a bit more [of an] ongoing [issue] I would note that both last year, in September, and this summer there were approaches from some of the European central banks about possible use of the swap network It is also fair to say, as this current episode with Mexico illustrates, that if one really wanted to help the Danish National Bank--I can't remember the size of our swap network with them but Peter can tell you because it's right there in his table--it's hard to imagine that it  -65-    11/16/93  would cover more than half a day's worth of the Danish National Bank's intervention Is it $100 million--?   But it also [should be noted] that these mechanisms are there and they are a form of central bank cooperation; they are the basis on which we receive and provide information to other central banks And if the need [arises] they provide a framework where we can easily augment [balances] either for our own use or for their use under appropriate [conditions] But, as I said, if the Committee would like us to take another look at this question, we will be glad to do so   I noticed that President McTeer qualified it, saying once we get beyond other more pressing matters--  SPEAKER(?) Yes, that's a big qualification  -66-    11/16/93   --but I hear the directive "
5002,1993-12-21, [Statement--see Appendix] 
5031,1994-02-03," Well, let me deal with the historical issue first The reason why Secretary Simon proposed this arrangement in 1977 was to establish a mechanism that would allow the United States to participate in the arrangement  As I remember, the arrangement was in effect for a period of a year or two It was a joint operation that had been negotiated by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve The System was very much involved, but the Treasury was also very much involved and the arrangement was linked to  The warehousing agreement was very much in that context It was very well thought out; it wasn't a casual action The warehousing facility had existed before that time, but it had been more ad hoc It had existed in similar circumstances in the late 1960s when there also was a special arrangement  The issue of whether warehousing is a loan is obviously a question primarily for the lawyers This Committee faced that issue in 1990 There was one group who felt that it was a loan and should be regarded as a loan The lawyers have informed me that it should not be considered a loan It is a market transaction that's carried off at market rates Although people can disagree with that interpretation, that has been the interpretation of this Committee to date That is a matter of public record That's the majority interpretation of the Committee, and it hasn't been challenged by the majority of Congress or even a substantial minority of Congress   Not the pros and cons A document summarizing the history was circulated earlier   Well, we can recirculate the documents The documentation was circulated to the Committee in 1990; not all of you were here then   We'd be glad to recirculate that document to the Committee, and we will remind you of it next year when the topic comes up "
5068,1994-03-22," The subject is the permanent enlargement of the Mexican swap line I hope the background material that was circulated to you was reasonably comprehensive and comprehensible and that, therefore, I can be brief As was explained, there are two themes to this discussion One is the Mexicans' desire for a substantial and permanent enlargement of their current swap lines with the Federal Reserve System and the United States Treasury; those lines are $700 million and $300 million respectively The second is the United States Treasury's desire not only to be responsive to the Mexican request but also to set up a consultative mechanism on macro policy issues among the three NAFTA countries, which makes a certain amount of sense  Specifically, what is proposed to be put in place, which is now thought would occur sometime in the second half of April, would be a consultative mechanism among the three NAFTA central banks and finance ministries and an announced increase in the swap lines What is being thought about is for the United States Treasury and the System to increase our combined lines to either $5 billion or $6 billion, though I think there is a preference for $6 billion The new swap lines would be divided half and half between the System and the Treasury Activation of those lines, of course, would require consent as is the case at the moment And normally that consent would have to be linked to our satisfaction with the economic policies and reasonable agreements on repayment Indeed, it's contemplated that all or most of any drawings would be collateralized It is contemplated that there would be a parallel, though somewhat smaller, increase in the Bank of Canada's swap line with the Bank of Mexico, though the size has not been decided The thought is that there would be some staff meetings with the Mexicans and the Canadians over the next month that would refine this proposal and then we would come back to the FOMC for action, probably by telegram No action is needed today, but it was felt that a discussion would be helpful As you know, Mexico has been the principal user of our swap network over the past decade or so The size of the actual swap drawings has often been augmented by special arrangements A change in the swap line at this point would clearly be linked to NAFTA and to the shift in Mexico, as of the first of April, to an autonomous central bank It is not, I should emphasize, linked in any way to the recent pressures on the peso I would be glad to answer any questions    3/22/94   On the question about Canada, I think it's required that the Canadians come in at some point They actually do have a swap line now Whether they will agree on the amount that the Treasury is thinking about, which is C$1 billion to C$2 billion or the size that the Mexicans are thinking of, which I was told is C$3 billion, I think is another matter  As far as the conditions are concerned, all swap lines have at least implicitly a condition in terms of the Committee being satisfied that any drawing would be supported by the economic policies of the drawing country So, in that sense it's the same, and I'll come back to that in a minute As for the collateral, normally we don't have any language to that effect in the actual swap line agreement The reason for that in this case is that the Treasury has had in the past quite elaborate conditions in its own swap line with Mexico and in its other arrangements relating to outstanding swap lines My suggestion, or my inclination anyhow, would be essentially to leave our swap line the way it is, except to say that the amount X would be raised to Y We would rely on provisions of the Treasury's agreement for these conditions I think that's a cleaner way to do these things So, in principle there could be, as there has been in the past, activation of one line without activation of the other But when an activation took place, then one could decide what conditions were warranted We have over the years--both with Mexico and with other countries in the more distant past--always wanted to make sure that if a country was going to draw, we had some assurance that they would be able to repay us from one source or another But the details of the conditions specified in advance have varied depending on the circumstances   I assume so We haven't had a full set of discussions, so I can't say that with certainty   No, Canada's line with Mexico would be increased from its current C$250 million to between C$1 billion to C$2 billion   It hasn't been proposed yet to increase our swap line with Canada    3/22/94   Right   Their argument at the time obviously was that announcing a drop in their reserves would cause problems on the financial markets and that was the reason we went along with their request    3/22/94   I think they have been used for both purposes At times when we have been involved, there have been so-called window- dressing operations There were some in the 1980s During the 1982 period they were driven by a slightly different set of considerations that had to do with domestic currency cover concerns I think it is right to question--and I would put it the other way around--whether central banks I think it's fair to say, however, that all central banks do this these days though they tend to use other mechanisms to window-dress the reserves rather than central bank swap lines You could argue that the use of central bank swap lines, which ultimately becomes public, seems much more forthcoming than what has done to manage their reserves over essentially the past 20 years when they have   Well, there have been occasions on which they have been drawn other than in Mexican presidential election years But it is true that those last three have been election years   That's a fair interpretation The $5 billion number was a number that in fact the Mexicans put forward a year ago when they approached us and they had done a rough back-of-the-envelope calculation of the increase in swap lines since the swap network was first established One can come up with these numbers for various countries in a lot of different ways but it's fair to say that the largest increase in our trade since 1967 has been with Mexico, both globally and bilaterally That's where the $5 billion number came from; the $6 billion number came from the fact that that was the number we contemplated providing last November in the context of NAFTA So that's the source of those two figures Neither is based on fine scientific analysis   Yes   Well, we went the same way in the past The most recent other drawing was in the early '80s by Sweden And we asked ourselves the same questions at that time, about how long the drawing was going to be outstanding, what the conditions were, and how they would contemplate repaying it So in that sense we asked the same questions as in the Mexican case   Well, maybe I have not been clear on this What I was suggesting, just as a matter of convenience, was not that we would rely on the Treasury but that the Treasury could put the conditions in their swap arrangement because they have done that in the past We have not put such conditions in our agreements in the past, whether it's the $6 billion line we have with the Bundesbank or any of the other lines And when it came time for a drawing, then we would draw on those conditions rather than have the lawyers specify all those things in advance and have to rescramble them when the time came for a drawing I was speaking just in terms of convenience from our side   They would have to come and ask to draw on the swap line and we would have to approve it And at that time we would say, ""Well, yes, we will approve it as long as we make these collateral arrangements"" That's what I would contemplate rather than pre-specifying those conditions But we'll do it either way   I don't know for certain; that's why we are having this discussion, if I may put it that way If the weight of opinion in the Committee was against going ahead with this request, I think we would inform the Mexicans and the Treasury in advance so that they didn't embarrass us and themselves--particularly themselves--by announcing something they couldn't deliver on  I think the consequences would be that the Treasury would go ahead and enlarge its own arrangement, presumably substantially Whether they would go all the way to $6 billion and leave us at $700 million, I don't know But something like that might happen And that would affect to some extent, I think, our relations both with Mexico and with the United States Treasury at this point But it wouldn't be the end of the world   I'm sorry I didn't answer your question I'm not sure what you mean when you say ""treat Mexico differently"" If you mean by turning down their request, there have been a number of countries over the years whose requests, either to join the swap network or to enlarge existing swap lines have been turned down So nonapproval of their request would not be unprecedented from that standpoint, though in most cases the countries that were turned down were discouraged before they had gone very far into the process But it would obviously have adverse implications at least in the short term for our relations with the Bank of Mexico--and I think it is not irrelevant in that regard that the Bank is now entering into a new status--and also would have some adverse implications for our participation with the Treasury and the Canadian authorities on the macroeconomic policy coordination process I can't speak for the Treasury, but my guess is that they would be less inclined to pursue the arrangements they are now contemplating if we were to back down We do have a long-standing relationship with Mexico and they have called upon us in the past for assistance There have been some debates about whether it has been appropriate, but it's fair to say that the Federal Reserve has taken the lead in many cases in helping    3/22/94  Mexico over the past 20 years So, nonapproval would really have some implications for our relations with that country and that central bank   It's doable but I'm not sure it's worth arguing about, if I may put it that way   Well, let me make two points This Treasury certainly agrees that we do not want to get engaged in using the swap line to peg the exchange rate That's point number one Therefore, in the circumstances, we are dealing essentially with pressures on the exchange rate, which as President McTeer explained, can exist even with a crawling peg or a floating exchange rate We ourselves drew on swap lines in the late 1970s when we were operating with floating exchange rates because we were intervening Presumably the discussions, including the ongoing discussions associated with the consultative mechanism, are designed not to surprise ourselves, so to speak, when these things come up On the question of window-dressing itself, I think it is fair to say that it's a little difficult-- particularly for me speaking as an outsider--to bind all future members of the FOMC But I think it would be perfectly appropriate, based upon this discussion, to convey to the Mexicans in the staff level talks that we are going to have in the next few weeks that there is extreme reluctance to use the swap line for window-dressing purposes And, therefore, since they have to come and ask our permission to begin with, they should know in advance that that's an even harder sell, if I may put it that way, than dealing with more garden variety disorderly markets   Yes, although it depends on the circumstances; but yes in principle In the past that's how things have happened and I would expect no matter who is the Chairman that's how things would be done   We are not always perfect at this, but in the past efforts have been made by the staff, particularly in the case of Mexico because the Mexican swap line has been more actively used than the others, to keep the Committee informed about developments and to try to anticipate possible requests There have been discussions and consultations with the Committee when there have been approaches to us Maybe I shouldn't mention it, but the recently released transcripts included a conference call in October of 1988 about a special swap arrangement which in the end never was implemented, but that was discussed extensively by the Committee at that time And I would presume that that's the way things would happen in the future   Well, I think it would be difficult to say ""no"" if they came to us, as they have in the past, and asked for a special arrangement, too Obviously, you would confront a slightly different situation if they have a $6 billion--in our case $3 billion--swap line with us; it may be slightly more difficult to say ""no"" to an actual drawing than it would be to set up some special arrangement But we can say ""no"" In 1982, for example, we said ""no"" repeatedly We were dealing with a set of circumstances which were quite different from what one would hope to see today or in the near future But we repeatedly said ""no"" We did allow them to have a few window-dressing operations, but that was part of a strategy that set out to get them in the position so they would go to the International Monetary Fund and they would change their policies  So I think the Committee and the Chairman of the Committee would have to make those decisions as they came to them In some sense, you'd have to make those decisions anyhow We can't disengage from Mexico; I think that's the point that President McTeer made basically Mexico is there, and we are going to have to deal with its central bank and all its problems regardless, because we are neighbors and have to share largely the same space   In our case it is central bank to central bank and will remain that way In the Treasury's case, currently it is the Treasury using the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as its agent with both their treasury and the central bank of Mexico I assume they will continue that practice, but that's a question the Treasury has to address But as far as we are concerned, the only issue that would come back to the Committee would be whether to enlarge our swap line with the Bank of Mexico from $700 million to X   [Statement--see

5082,1994-03-24," elsewhere As you probably are aware, the Mexican authorities closed their financial markets today, but they intend to open them tomorrow There has been some limited trading of Mexican instruments outside of Mexico After an initial dip of 7 to 10 percent, the prices of those instruments are now down only about 5 to 7 percent The Mexican authorities have asked for a demonstration of our support under these difficult circumstances  After consultations with the US Treasury and the Bank of Mexico we have agreed to propose to the Committee an arrangement essentially of the same sort that was developed last November in the context of the NAFTA vote Specifically, what is proposed is a $6 billion temporary swap facility consisting of $3 billion each from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury In our case our existing $700 million swap line would be absorbed into the $3 billion line The arrangement would be effective, essentially, on action It would be available until the 29th of April It would have to be repaid by the 29th of July And for your information, the Mexican presidential election is on the 21st of August Drawings would be collateralized by Mexican dollar assets at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York If there were a drawing, there would also have to be an IMF letter of support for Mexico's economic policies  My understanding is that when the Mexican authorities open their markets tomorrow they intend to defend their existing band They have about 1 percent or a little more--about 1-1/4 percent-- leeway in their band since the peso has depreciated 6 or 7 percent over the last several weeks They would do so at least for a while My impression--and I can only say it's my impression--is that there's not a lot of appetite to spend a great deal of money in this process, but they feel they should do it for a while under these circumstances and the uncertainties surrounding them Their reserves are quite adequate, in fact close to $30 billion I understand at the moment Assuming the FOMC approves this temporary increase of the swap line, it would most likely be announced today or early tomorrow A final comment The arrangement proposed is separate from the permanent increase in the swap line discussed at the FOMC meeting on Tuesday and the associated consultation mechanism I would expect that we would come back to the FOMC in April with that proposal, which would in effect supersede this action Thank you, Mr Chairman   It is essentially the same   The only differences are the dates   It's identical except for the dates   The request came from Mexico but they have only made their request to the United States at the moment And I have no indication that they've asked for broader support at this time I did consult with the Bank of Canada and they had not been contacted yet   Well, that's certainly technically possible My sense is that the Treasury would prefer this to be a joint operation   In the past, President Hoenig, our relationship has been exclusively with the central bank; the central bank's status    3/24/94  just has been different than it will be And this will be a swap arrangement executed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on behalf of the FOMC with the Bank of Mexico   I don't think so I would defer to the lawyers, but I don't think that's a problem   That's right, but there are several conditions for drawings on the facility, one of which is that they would have to have a letter from the managing director of the International Monetary Fund saying that the IMF supports their economic policies And the other--the principal one--would be that they would have to have assets on deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York of $2 billion   The way it's set up, the initial drawing would be $2 billion and then we would have to subsequently negotiate any further drawings   If we put out a press release, we'll make sure it is faxed to the Reserve Banks "
5121,1994-05-17," President Jordan, just to amplify on what Peter said, since you referred to the finance ministries, the principal consultations initially were between us and the Treasury Department, and between the Chairman and President Tietmeyer on the day before his statement These consultations were followed up by some discussions about whether the Bundesbank felt it was appropriate to join in a coordinated operation It was only on the morning of May 4 that there were any additional consultations with the Japanese along with the other central banks   Well, I guess that's right, but I can tell you that the Bundesbank Directorate did discuss this operation Whether Mr Issing was present at that discussion I do not know But both Mr Tietmeyer's statement--the excerpts from his speech, which were deliberately released early--and the size of the Bundesbank operation were discussed by the Bundesbank Directorate   [Statement--see Appendix] "
5145,1994-07-05," President Boehne, just one comment on your first question from an historical perspective, which I think is the perspective you are coming from The decision to intervene on that day was a joint decision, so in that sense Peter had no discretion That is no different than it has been But once the decision was taken, it was then largely in the Desk's hands as to how they would handle the intervention That was in contrast to some instances of micro-management over the course of recent years I think Peter had been given quite a large amount of resources for his potential use, and although he consulted about his change of tactics, the tactics were decided by the Desk rather than by the Treasury   Governor Lindsey, just on your first question, it is correct to say that one of the purposes of the May 4 operation was to send a message That doesn't necessarily mean that the purpose of every intervention should be to correct a policy misperception   Well, the dollar had traded below 100 earlier in the week and that was indeed one of the reasons why we didn't operate then and why we felt somewhat more comfortable--though I think it's fair to say not greatly so--about operating at that point, having approached the 100 level for the third or fourth time First, the rate went through that level and then it came back And so some of the psychological aspects of operating close to 100, but above it, were removed That does not remove the point that Peter made about possible consequences of a large adjustment below that in the absence of any actions by the monetary authorities   Well, I have some words in the Chart Show on this point The extent to which our deficit has been financed recently by official sources is exaggerated because basically all that counts is the intervention by the major industrial countries More than half of the financing last year, say, was by nonindustrial countries whose motives are the same as those of any other private sector investor; they don't have an exchange rate motive though they may be speculating on the exchange rate It is not easy to track this accurately because, this is the second leading point, we don't really know why what gets recorded as official inflows are official inflows For example, if a country moves its dollar holdings from the Euro- market to the New York market, it would show up as official financing of our current account deficit even though in some sense in a portfolio preference way and a currency dimension way, it would not be any change So, it is very difficult to interpret all those numbers We have lots of countries around the world that have different motivations for where they hold their assets and why they hold them there That's about all I have to offer   [Statement--see Appendix]   I think that's right It's not clear how much they need to do in order to have great success They have taken some of the bloom off but not a lot Their expansion is running close to double-digit rates   I think that's one of the factors--a good point If China were more successful, or if the cost of that success were 5 percent growth rather than 10 percent growth, the implications for Japan and the other Asian countries might not be entirely negative There would be a risk Definitely the Japanese will tell you, as I think I have commented in other briefings, that they consider slower growth in China to be one of the uncertainties and risks in their forecasts So bad news for China is good news for Japan   I think it depends, as I indicated in my comments, on what you assume about the dollar, the reaction of other rates, and what else is going on at the same time If the 100 basis points were to cause a several percent lower dollar, then because of the direct price effects you would get the price effects much sooner And, of course, you'd have much stronger economic activity On the other hand, the dollar could--for lack of a better word--""levitate""   Well, two points The answer is that it is export-led in the sense that our assumption about Germany is that net exports will be a positive factor in their growth I think we have a little less growth overall, and a little less growth in net exports for Germany than the OECD I know that we do for the OECD countries  -17-    7/5-6/94  other than Germany So that's the answer for the second half of that question We are a little less optimistic than they are in that regard They are all in the same ballpark, but they show a little more growth this year and a little more next year And that's somewhat consistent with the fact that we have somewhat lower US growth so there is less impetus coming from outside than in their forecast   To come back to Governor Blinder's question about the forecast for Germany, I just now recall that our outlook for year-over-year growth in Germany is almost exactly the same for 1995 as the OECD's, though in general we tend to be a smidgen weaker However, OECD put their outlook together before they had the first- quarter numbers My guess is they would probably have a stronger outlook, everything else being equal, just the way one averages Now, that may be made up from the fact that they do have a bit stronger growth next year, so they average out But it's about the same for Germany   They weren't used in the Bluebook; they were based on the experimental model This was done in the International Finance Division We did it for the special presentation that was made for the FOMC on costs of inflation But I think the characteristics of those models were not different fundamentally--at least what I took away from those models--from what the Chairman just described in terms of these models It's a question of what you put in You do not get a better tradeoff unless you impose on the model, which we did at that time, that you have a credibility gain Rational expectations models don't give you that unless you build in that view But that's ex cathedra--not something that you can derive from statistical estimations   As Mike explained, there are two projects under way this year in which the staff is trying to produce a richer set of models for you to draw on, which will probably confuse matters further But our objective is to try to improve these models and to be able to capture, if I can put it that way, a richer mix of the expectations process in the presentations we put forward to you You may end up having so many branches on the tree that you get lost in the forest from it   The portfolio balance model will tell you that if you try to repatriate funds and your currency appreciates, that is the way you reduce the foreign share in your portfolio   The theory does not give an answer; it could be either one It's one person's decision; they all add to one so we ought to treat everybody as one person They can't as a group reduce their foreign assets because of constraints on flows; they have to leave those assets abroad They may add to them, but they have to have their assets abroad "
5160,1994-07-20," In the trade data that were released yesterday, Mr Chairman, there was some indication--we weren't terribly surprised --that the composition was a bit more tilted toward consumer goods than we had anticipated, which does provide some small accounting for the buildup in inventories   As the Committee knows, this has been a rough year for the Mexican financial markets Until about a month ago, however, the situation had stabilized with the peso trading comfortably below its so-called ceiling against the dollar Interest rates were down somewhat from their peaks in late April, and there was some recovery of the stock market However, in late June pressures began to mount again The Bank of Mexico has raised interest rates several times by a total of 100 to 200 basis points on peso- denominated assets in their auctions It has sold about  and it has made substantial sales of dollar-denominated instruments These trends are likely to continue for the next month or so As you know from Peter Fisher's previous reports, we have been following this situation very closely, and we will be sending the Committee later today a staff paper on recent economic and financial developments in Mexico  Two weeks ago Governor Mancera contacted Chairman Greenspan to discuss the situation in Mexico At the same time, there were Mexican contacts with the US Treasury As a result of these conversations, it was decided to follow-up on one proposal from the Bank of Mexico, which was to explore with the other G-10 central banks and the BIS whether there would be any interest in reviving the contingency short-term financial support facility for Mexico that was constructed in November prior to the US NAFTA vote As you will recall, that facility was never announced or activated Vice Chairman McDonough and Governor Blinder raised this matter with the other G-10 governors in Basle ten days ago and somewhat to our surprise got considerable expressions of willingness to consider this request positively After further consultations with the Mexicans and the Treasury, it has been decided to try to put such an arrangement in place The details of the proposed facility would match very closely what was done in November, and I'll go over them briefly  First, there would be a $12 billion facility; half would be provided by other central banks, in some cases with the backing of their governments through the BIS And half would be provided by the  -5-    7/20/94  US monetary authorities, split evenly between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Second, it would be up to the Mexican authorities whether they wanted to announce the existence or activation of the facility This decision would depend on their judgement of the financial market conditions and whether such an announcement would be constructive Once the announcement was made, Mexico could draw up to one-third--that would be $4 billion--against the equivalent collateral of assets deposited at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and at the BIS The financial conditions associated with any additional drawings would have to be agreed upon before such drawings could be made We would expect that these conditions would call for some form of similar collateral arrangements Drawings could be made through September 30th, would be for 90 days, and all repayments would have to be completed by December 30th  The Federal Reserve's participation would be through our existing $3 billion swap line with the Bank of Mexico No formal clearance from the Committee for the activation of the swap line is being requested today Such a request would come only if the Bank of Mexico decides to announce the facility Responses would be collected by Norm Bernard by telephone at that time However, in order for us to go forward with this arrangement on a contingency basis, some sense of the sentiment of the FOMC is necessary  One obvious concern in this proposal is the fact that the impending Mexican election on August 21st is clearly a factor affecting Mexican financial markets at this time This involves to some extent concern over the outcome of the election and the electoral process However, in my judgment the election date also provides a kind of date certain after which the present constraints on the Mexican exchange rate policy will be loosened somewhat, leading possibly to a devaluation of the peso This suggests a second concern What do we think about the Mexican exchange rate policy and how would the proposed facility interact with that policy? We have discussed this subject with the Mexican authorities as much as one can reasonably discuss a matter of this sort with another sovereign country It is difficult to determine if a substantial change in Mexico's exchange rate regime is warranted on economic grounds A reasonable case can be made either way Nevertheless, I am convinced that the Mexican authorities will not endeavor to sustain the current exchange rate regime at all costs if extreme pressure on the peso develops On the other hand, they are not convinced at this point that a devaluation will be necessary, and they see the proposed facility as possibly contributing to confidence I'd be pleased to answer any questions   Vice Chairman McDonough might want to speak to that point   As for the financial arrangements themselves, President Boehne, there is just our swap line of $3 billion, which was approved on a permanent basis in April, and the Treasury has an equivalent swap line of $3 billion Those swap lines are used--and this may be what you're referring to--in connection with the so-called North American Financial Swap Facility that was announced in April In this case, it would not be used in that framework, but in the broader BIS framework The Canadians who are also a part of that North American agreement would be participating through the BIS   That's correct And it would involve--at least if it were announced--an activation of our swap line rather than the way we would treat it in the existing situation which requires our prior approval So we would be in effect giving our approval to the drawing, assuming they wanted to draw   I think the argument probably turns more on the political economy than the economy per se You're absolutely right In January and February, for example, the Mexicans took in $5 billion or $6 billion worth of reserves in an effort to prevent the peso from appreciating to the upper end of their band And there is a strong body of opinion that once the election is over, and assuming it is relatively smooth, that that will repeat itself The uncertainty will be removed I do think that the other feature, however, is that Mexican growth this year has been a little slower than was hoped for Interest rates on balance this year have been higher than they certainly were expected to be; they are double their lows of earlier in the year and Mexico's inflation rate actually has continued to come down So I think one possibility in the interim between the election and the 1st of December--when the framework ""pacto,"" as they call it, would have to be renegotiated by whoever wins the election--is that that might be taken as an opportunity to adjust the exchange rate policy Now, there are a lot of things they could do, which might even include a decision actually to peg the rate A small devaluation to peg the rate is one thing that has been suggested because if they do that now, they have paid the price in their interest rates of the possibility of an exchange rate depreciation   Well, several of us have had conversations with various Mexicans I think they have not laid out all their options My sense from my own conversations, and from hearing about other peoples' conversations, is that they would consider the full range of options in this period when they would have some leeway to rethink what their policy was going to be It might change If indeed the peso appreciated, they might choose the option of a more normal peg, for example I think that is a possibility that certainly some people within the Mexican government have favored in the past Given that they have a current account deficit that is 7 percent of GDP, I personally would be a little worried about that But I could imagine that they might do that if things calmed down Another possibility would be that they would move the band I think the cleanest thing to do--and it's an extension of the current policy--would be to transpose the band by 10 percent approximately, which would mean that in fact they wouldn't have to change the current market rates at all It would be like a European revaluation devaluation, and it would essentially provide a bit more two-way risk in the market situation And then to some extent as things unfolded, they would have some scope to see how matters develop The most interesting thing is that they have had an 8 percent devaluation of the peso this year without any particular uptick in inflation And one question is how that's going to feed through into the current account over the next several quarters   Well, not in terms of what they worry about If the rate in fact stayed where it was, it wouldn't be any different than it is now I would not say that it couldn't go up They couldn't recoup what they've lost over the last four or five months   I would just add two points One is that we did see some of this in November when we had the prospect of a particularly Mexican event spilling over into some of the other financial markets So there is some evidence of that The other point I would make, adding to something you said before, President McDonough, is that   At a later point, right   Some of you are aware of this and some of you are not, and I thought that it was right that everybody be aware of it The Federal Reserve for a long time has never taken up its seats on the board of directors of the Bank for International Settlements We have been entitled to such seats since the Bank was founded in 1930 This matter has come up again in recent months, and the Board considered it a couple of months ago after consulting within the Administration and decided to go ahead Next Monday the BIS will be announcing that we have reached this decision, that the Chairman would take up the ex-officio seat and that President McDonough would take up the other appointed seat as the second US representative on the board There would be a minor adjustment in the BIS charter, and at the same time it would be announced that the governors of the central banks of Canada and Japan, Mr Thiesen and Mr Mieno, had been elected to the BIS board of directors That would mean with the inclusion of the United States that the board would consist of the G-10 countries, which is a step the BIS would like to take and which the Board of Governors has thought was sensible in terms of the future evolution of the BIS on a more global scope So, as I said, the BIS intends to make this announcement on Monday, and I didn't want any of you to be surprised   I think the distinction here, and it's related to the other part, is that   And the other central banks will come to the BIS and will participate more broadly in some of the activities   I hadn't heard anything, but I don't want to answer definitively They have started a 301 process--maybe Governor Blinder knows more about this than I do, if he's allowed to use expertise from his previous incarnation "
5209,1994-09-27," They're reluctant to do it even in their own market these days You may have noticed that they just stopped issuing short-term paper We didn't know that was going to happen The proposal would take two steps forward, but at the same time take one step back in terms of the overall goal Notwithstanding President Broaddus' comment, the goal is to get off the Bundesbank's balance sheet,  So, to get off their balance sheet, given that they don't offer any other kinds of facilities like the investments in dollars that we offer, we are left with a limited number of options There is one other consideration about how fast we should go and how we should do this and that is that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, of course, also invests the foreign exchange reserves of the Treasury Department Although we are not tied to following exactly what they do, I think it would be on the whole constructive to bring them along at roughly the same time in this process So, we think a wholesale change in what we are doing would be more difficult Peter and I have had extensive discussions with the Treasury about their plans On the whole, I think they are pretty much on board They may be just a little behind us in terms of thinking this all the way through   As a technical matter, we still have an offer outstanding to the Bank of Mexico through the end of Friday of this week, September 30 So that's another reason to keep the Committee updated on the situation   [Statement--See Appendix]   I think that's right if you just rely on the microeconomic indicators There are three factors that I think would produce essentially this result One is that we had what we think is a bulge in consumer goods imports in the second quarter We suspect that has to do with either some combination of China or spread of sanctions against China, and/or movements in the seasonals in terms of the timing of imports as they relate to fall purchases   Part of that has shown up in the level of inventories coming out of the third quarter The second factor is that there also was a bulge in oil imports in the second quarter--this certainly is a big difference in terms of 1987 dollars And again we are getting the effects, in fact we are looking for a decrease, in the third quarter as inventories have gone down a bit The third factor is that there was also a considerable increase in imports of computers, which in real terms had a big impact And consistent with that, we are anticipating in the July data at least a drop-off in computer imports So, some of that has to do with these longer-term factors, but the sharp change relates to our interpretation of these volumes "
5234,1994-11-15," I think that is the point, President Broaddus Ultimately, we can and have declined to participate There have been occasions--I am referring to a long period of time--when we have declined to participate The suggestion that we are not going to participate can be a significant brake on the enthusiasm of the Treasury--of all the Treasuries that I have had anything to do with over the years--partly because the norm for the last decade or so has been that almost all operations are joint and all are on a 50/50 basis since we have roughly the same amount of reserves If you said, Peter is just their agent, the quality of our advice would probably be unchanged, but the consequences of ignoring it would be substantially reduced compared to current circumstances where ultimately it becomes known via the Manager's reports whether the Federal Reserve was part of the operation   On the communications question?   I think President Jordan is absolutely right In a sense, we are suffering from the fact that various Treasuries have had a sequence of ad hoc or at least temporary policies for our currency I think that relates both to the international value and the domestic value Those two things are bound up and are inherent in the discussion that we had earlier this morning about whether the foreign exchange value of the dollar in part should be an overt target for monetary policy Given the current way things are structured in the US government, it is difficult to predict where a particular Treasury or Administration will be on this matter Administrations do change and it is, unfortunately I think, an area where personalities, or maybe I should say philosophies, matter to a somewhat surprising degree The evidence on the effectiveness of intervention is mixed, but I think the academic profession would say today that the pendulum has swung back somewhat on the question of the effectiveness of sterilized intervention, and not just through the signaling channels connected to monetary policy but also the signaling channels connected to other policies I think it is fair to say that, as on many other issues in economics, experts lie all along the spectrum [Laughter] I think that's right I have felt that over the years the Federal Reserve has on balance been a very positive force in trying to modulate the excesses of various Administrations It has not always been easy and often the Federal Reserve has found itself leaning to one side of the boat because the Administration or particular people in control of the Administration were leaning to the other side of the boat This has involved a certain amount of moving from one side to  -54-    11/15/94  the other, though I think the basic objective has been to make sure that if the instrument is used, it is used sensibly, not overused, and one does not exaggerate its effectiveness or ineffectiveness  To comment if I may on Governor Lindsey's price message, that is certainly in one set of circumstances something we do and have done implicitly in one form or another There is another side to it, if I may go back to the late 1970s The way I saw the heavy intervention in that period, which was promoted by the Administration at the time, was that that was the device which in the end was needed to convince the Administration that what they saw as bitter medicine had to be taken in October 1979; it was necessary It took 18 months to convince the various people in the Administration, as well as maybe some people within the Federal Reserve, that that was necessary It is difficult to come to the question of disorderly markets narrowly defined I don't want to get into this I think you might not want to use monetary policy, so that it would be only a club in the closet under the right circumstances I think the various German and other officials who have been involved with us have used it that way  One further comment I haven't gone back and checked the record precisely, so I apologize if I go back and find that I am mistaken I would not characterize this Administration as being particularly trigger-happy in this regard They have intervened relatively few times Aside from the Administration in the period of the early 1980s, they are probably the least active The one difference of strategy that the current Administration has followed, consistent with what the Chairman has said and probably not accidentally, is that when they wanted to operate, they have wanted to operate in significant volume to get the market's attention Governor Mullins commented at one point that one could view intervention to some extent as a type of circuit breaker in the market If you hit the market hard enough, it forces the market to stop under some circumstances and it gives the market the opportunity to stop and say Do they know something we don't know, which could be monetary policy or a variety of other things? In order to do that, you need the right scale of circuit breaker to get their attention I think this Administration has tended to be much more deliberate in its policy of wanting to operate on a larger scale But in terms of the number of days of operations, they have tended to be toward the lower end of recent experience We are less than two years into the Administration and all this could change, but that's something I wanted to point out   Maybe I'll just add one footnote to the history before I pick up on your comment After 1971, of course, we did not intervene for quite an extended period of time--March 1971 to July 1973 It was Arthur Burns and President Hayes who essentially prevailed upon the Treasury to take that small instrument out of the closet It may have been a big mistake but that was what happened That's just one example of where, for better or for worse, this Committee at that time found itself quite supportive of intervention because it was a question of caring about our currency, at least that's how it was perceived As Governor Blinder said earlier in the monetary policy discussion, we are dealing in an area where we can sometimes prejudge perceptions with great confidence  As the Chairman said, the Treasury has talked about a multinational, multiday operation that would be relatively small in scale at least by historical standards, but where we might operate successively for 3 to 5 days We might imagine the US authorities thinking in terms of a budget, if I may put it that way, of $6 billion of sales, half of which would come from the System and half would come  -56-    11/15/94  from the Treasury under normal procedures If we did that, we would as a technical matter have to come to the Committee for clearance to increase the limit on the change in the System's overall open position during the intermeeting period The limit is now set at $1-1/2 billion The clearance would be for a larger reduction in our overall open position The clearance is needed regardless of the direction we are going We would raise that--up to, say, $3 billion so that we could accommodate this type of operation I guess the only procedural matter would be that if events over the next few weeks lead the Chairman to think that that is the right thing to do, we would come to you to get your clearance This is not, as technical matter, a vote; it is a procedure that is partly designed to meet, though maybe imperfectly, the Committee's desire--a desire reiterated by President Stern earlier--to have some degree of communication about what we are doing, maybe not why we are doing it It may provide opportunities to ask why we are doing it, as has happened in some of our conference calls It is a mechanism that has been set up both to keep this Committee informed and to review these matters After it is all over, you can review whether it was a success or failure or why it was a success or failure Procedurally, it does put everything on the table   This is obviously a matter for the Committee to decide The historical antecedents of the procedural instructions were in fact to provide greater restraint on our interventions than had existed For example, on the domestic side there is a limit on the intermeeting change in the System's overall holdings of U S government and Federal agency securities, but that limit is very substantial and is occasionally raised On the foreign side, the  -57-    11/15/94  procedural instructions are written the way they are because it is also judged that in some circumstances--given the international nature of these discussions since they don't just involve the United States Treasury but often at least two or three other central banks--they should provide the Chairman with some degree of flexibility to act on behalf of the Committee as long as it is consistent with the foreign currency authorization and the foreign currency directive We have subsequent discussions and provide a way for the Committee to be informed--in contrast to the situation that existed before 1976 where there could be very large operations and, unless the Committee members kept score as they went along, they wouldn't know how much had been bought and sold until the next Committee meeting The existing procedural instructions are designed that way, but you can change them On balance, I think they work pretty well, but obviously there has been a range of views on all the issues in that respect I think one of the purposes of having this discussion was in fact, as the Vice Chairman said, in order to give the Chairman some basis to have further discussions of this with the Treasury and other central banks   Let me come back to where you started the discussion with one question that has been kicking around for weeks-- whether we should do something not routinely larger but nonroutinely larger in the interest of varying the tactics I see some heads going this way around the table but, of course, that's one risk I think the other view of this matter has emphasized that one risk we see is if we do it once, it might become a bad habit But depending on how the market reacts to developments over the next several days or weeks, a possibility is that we might have an operation that is a little larger in scale and a little bit more sustained as a way of varying the pattern of behavior but not necessarily something that would become a new pattern I just wanted to make it clear that--   I think I have been around too long to be able to give you a precise definition of what is a disorderly market   Let me try to do what I just said I can't do Disorder to some extent is in the eyes of the beholder Sometimes we have a situation where the dollar is weaker than the fundamentals would justify Sometimes the weakness has to do with market conditions Both situations have been used Although I know there are preferences for being more precise, there also are preferences for being less precise   Certainly, it was successful! [Laughter]   Not to put words in your mouth, we could be capricious or appear to be capricious about why we are operating We ought to have some sense of what we are trying to accomplish and why we were trying to do it even though it is not always very well articulated   Reread your recommendations  -60-    11/15/94   They will come up a year from now "
5259,1994-12-20," [Statement--See Appendix]   If I could add just two points One is--I'm not sure this is helpful--my impression that the Administration is going through much the same problem If they think that the NAIRU is about what we have estimated it to be, they no longer are in a position to say growth will slow down to potential of 2-1/2 percent because in that case they will have built in a permanently higher inflation and lower unemployment rate I'm not sure how they will square that circle In terms of comparing the Committee's forecast with the Administration's forecast, there may be some leeway on that score My second point comes back to your initial question on the effectiveness of monetary policy and whether it may be reduced In today's world, of course, we tend to assume that one of the channels of monetary policy is through the exchange rate That is why we have model results that suggest the overall effect may be the same as it was 15 or 20 years ago, but the channels have changed with the relaxation of Regulation Q I don't know whether you want to call it an exogenous event, or a favorable event, or an unfavorable event, or something unrelated where there has been a breakdown in monetary policy But, of course, with the dollar having gone down this year rather than going up, which would have been your ex ante assumption, you do have a difference that could either be attributed to a stronger than expected ""economy"" in some sense or a short circuiting of that channel in this particular instance   He's not here, but maybe I can make it He can clarify the facts later, but let me just state that at about 930, the Mexicans did announce that they had moved their intervention band by 15 percent and will continue to crawl that band by four new centavos a day So, they basically have moved the band by 15 percent We don't have any market quotes--   As Peter mentioned in his earlier report, one problem with their monetary policy is that they have an auction today    12/20/94  of their tesobonos and another auction tomorrow of their peso- denominated debt Financial market reactions will depend on how they choose to play those auction results "
5286,1995-01-13," I don't think anybody would sit still for an hour-by-hour report! The useful thing may be to start two weeks ago when you had your conference call and added 50 percent--$1-1/2 billion--to the Federal Reserve's swap line in complementarity with increases in the Treasury and Canadian swap lines and consistent with the BIS agreeing to try to put together their $5 billion short-term financing facility and the commercial banks their $3 billion facility That added up to the $18 billion total that was announced on Monday, January 2 That financing was put together in the context of President Zedillo's speech and was intended to reinforce his economic program As you are probably aware, that speech was delayed several times; it didn't occur until about midday on Tuesday, January 3 It was not greeted with a great deal of enthusiasm in the financial markets, and the situation continued to be quite soggy  Over the last weekend, there was a growing concern that it was necessary or desirable to try to stabilize this situation by demonstrating a bit more financial resolve That led to some intervention on Monday by the Bank of Mexico, which previously had refrained from engaging in any open foreign exchange market intervention, and the Mexicans took the unusual step of asking the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to operate for their account in New York The Federal Reserve Bank of New York issued a statement saying that it was acting for the Bank of Mexico's account in operations consistent with the general support we have been giving to Mexico The Mexicans also announced that they had drawn on the swap line The purpose was to indicate that there was some real money involved Since then, an additional drawing has brought the total up to $500 million on us, $500 million on the Treasury, and a corresponding amount of Can$166 million on the Bank of Canada They also announced the size of their reserves and promised to continue to announce their reserves on a regular basis This was designed to show that they had some reserves and to lock in a general policy of announcing their reserves on a regular basis Lastly, they agreed to undertake a significant tightening of monetary policy, pushing up short-term rates 8 or so percentage points to 20 percent in terms of dollar-denominated assets and raising rates somewhat more--by 10 or 12 percentage points --on peso-denominated assets I think it's fair to say that these actions did not meet with a great deal of success and the auction of tesobonos on Tuesday was decidedly weak despite the increased interest rates that were offered on those assets They received bids for only $163 million, as I remember, and only accepted roughly $60 million at their rate of 20 percent    1/13/95  There was also growing evidence that the problems in Mexico were spreading to other emerging markets in Latin America and elsewhere in the world That led to an intensification of consultations with the Treasury Department on Tuesday afternoon involving the then still Secretary-designate Mr Rubin, who actually became the Secretary of the Treasury by the end of the day Mr Rubin spent his last hours as a free man worrying about Mexico and almost all his hours since then worrying about Mexico After meeting with the Chairman for three hours, he had a meeting lasting several hours with his colleagues in the White House and with the President The President endorsed the Treasury's idea of investigating whether a program of loan guarantees for Mexico would be saleable on Capitol Hill on an expedited basis The President made personal calls to the leadership of the Congress on Tuesday evening saying that the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board would follow up the next day with consultations with each of the leaders and, as it happened, a subset of some of the key committee chairmen and other interested parties Those consultations culminated in a meeting yesterday afternoon--and I think I'll leave the reporting on that to the Chairman--between the President and the leadership of the Congress at which the President said that he remained convinced that it was important to go forward with this, and that he understood from Chairman Greenspan and Secretary Rubin that that was the sense of the leadership of Congress He proposed that they make a joint announcement to that effect That proposal won the endorsement--1 don't want to say the enthusiastic endorsement but I don't think it was a contentious endorsement--of the leadership Early yesterday evening it was announced that they had agreed that a program of loan guarantees would be proposed to the Congress on the joint recommendation of the President and the four leaders At that point, the figure for the total amount of loan guarantees or instruments that would be guaranteed had been left open As a result of these rather extensive consultations on the Hill, it was fairly widely known that the figure being suggested was in the range of $25 to $40 billion Indeed, a number of individuals on the Hill suggested that they thought it was wiser to go for a larger amount rather than a smaller amount, and that is currently the position as I understand it   Yes, it would be new money in one sense Let me make two points about that before I turn this issue back to the Chairman There would be up to $40 billion in loan guarantees What is involved in this program would be that Mexico would be borrowing dollars, I assume on the international capital markets or our capital markets, up to that amount with the guarantee of the United States government At least in the first instance, that guarantee would cover interest and principal, but in the later phases it might cover only principal That would be new money in the sense that they would be raising new money However, the purpose of that new money, granting that money is fungible, would be primarily to fund the fairly large stock of short-term obligations that the government of Mexico    1/13/95  and some of the Mexican banks currently have outstanding It would be used to replace short-term debt with 5- to 10-year debt, and to the extent that that was done it would be essentially a funding operation The particular mechanism that was used in 1992, and more recently in an ongoing program with Israel, has the feature that it essentially has no budgetary impact The reason for that is that the country, Mexico in this case, would pay a fee for the loan guarantee and that fee in turn is based upon the risk element associated with Mexican borrowing, as judged by a generally accepted, robust set of procedures that have been in place for several years and are overseen by OMB on the one hand and CBO on the other So Mexico would pay a fee essentially covering the risk, and that fee would be revenue which would offset the expenditure charge associated with the risk of the obligation In this particular proposal, the Administration would suggest that there be an extra charge not only to cover Treasury expenses, but to provide an extra cushion as well as an incentive to Mexico to move quickly back into the market on an unguaranteed basis In that sense the proposal would be budget neutral       It is not yet decided which committees would have jurisdiction I have been informed on the one hand that this is a matter for the parliamentarians to decide, and on the other hand a matter for the leadership to decide The most likely committees at this point would be the foreign affairs committees of the two bodies That is what I was just told   No, it's Gilman in the House   The risk   That's why I said ""approximately"" budget neutral! I was also leaving aside recognizing that this is just a matter of scoring as opposed to--   Yes   But there is going to be a supplemental fee that would be higher than what the normal charge would be, and that would be a gainer    1/13/95   I'm not going to say what I was going to say-- the security aside from the pesos we get--because I'll get laughed at The security is in terms of oil receivables, a stream of oil receivables The staff, in conjunction with the Treasury, the Canadians, and the Mexicans has reached agreement on the framework to put that security mechanism in place It is anticipated that it will be fully in place by early next week So, although the drawings are not technically secured by oil receivables at this point, the staff is making rapid progress in that direction, and there is a commitment to put that in place Actually, the commitment is only to put it in place by the end of February, but it probably will be completed shortly after the middle of January   Monday is a holiday, so they can't draw between now and Tuesday The target would be to get it in place essentially by the time of or within a day of any further drawings  -8-    1/13/95   No I don't know where they put the proceeds of the drawings that were made, but they were not required to put the proceeds at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York   The security mechanism would apply to whatever is drawn   But so far the mechanism is not in place in a formal sense, as the Chairman said; only the promise is in place   There is a lot in the press, but don't believe all of it--I think that is probably the right way to put it   Right I should add that the $40 billion number--which the Administration now has put forward as their preferred number and I expect to see it on the screen if it isn't there already--is a matter that is being negotiated with the Congress Even that number has not been announced in any official sense "
5313,1995-01-31," Thank you, Mr Chairman I am sure you have heard more than you would like about Mexico's situation in the last few days and weeks Nevertheless, I thought it would be useful to summarize the state of play with regard to the Mexican situation as of this afternoon I will touch on five topics first, the now apparently dead legislation in the US Congress; second, the total US plan to deal with the Mexican crisis that would be aided by certain FOMC actions; third, the IMF program; fourth, efforts to mobilize other forms of multilateral support; and finally, the Bank of Mexico's request to make a further drawing on the existing Federal Reserve/ESF swap lines We need a sense of whether the Committee is inclined to approve the increase in the swap line  First, I can be very brief on the now apparently dead legislation that would have provided up to $40 billion in US government guarantees of Mexican government securities, The prospects for passage of that legislation have gone steadily downhill since it was announced almost three weeks ago Decisions were made last night and this morning by the President and the bipartisan leadership to stop pushing for the legislation I think it is fair to say that the future of the legislation is nonexistent, but I won't belabor the point  Turning to where we are now, before I say anything more, I would note that I am acutely aware of the strongly held view on this Committee that the central bank should not be expected to underwrite foreign or other debt issues, in large part because covering such debt obligations would involve the inappropriate use of central bank funds That being said, the US authorities faced two broad alternatives as it became clear that the legislation would not pass We could conclude that we had tried and failed in what the Chairman has called the ""least worse"" approach, which was to leave Mexico to fend for itself Alternatively, we could try to help by using an approach that is feasible but worse   In the end, the second alternative was chosen The materials that were distributed to you contain several items The first page is a statement by the President and the Congressional leadership Despite the note on top, which is barely legible but says that the new financing package is on hold and has not yet been cleared, the package has now been cleared Attached to that is a summary of the currently proposed program, and behind that you will find President Clinton's speech this morning to the National Governors Association in which he announced this change of strategy The last item is the announcement by the Managing Director of the IMF this morning regarding the Mexican situation and the proposed IMF package  The new approach would basically involve the heavy use of ESF lending to Mexico in the form of short-term swaps, medium-term swaps, and possibly loans and guarantees of Mexican government securities The latter two types of operations apparently are legal for the ESF but apparently also would set a precedent The total could be up to $20 billion To provide the ESF with the necessary dollar liquidity to undertake these operations, the Federal Reserve would be asked to agree to warehouse foreign currencies now held in the ESF, at present $19-1/2 billion in holdings of DM and yen The reason is that the liquid dollar assets on the ESF's balance sheet are only about $5 billion In addition, the Federal Reserve has been asked to participate directly as well The form, consistent with precedent and with what I said earlier about the role of a central bank in such circumstances, would be for the Committee to agree to increase its swap line somewhat as part of this operation However, there would be a ""take-out"" in the form of a commitment from the Treasury that the ESF would take over any System obligation that was outstanding for more than 12 months We are not going to make a formal recommendation to the Committee for action on a specific proposal today However, an increase in our Mexican swap line to $6 billion would, in my opinion, be reasonable as long as we get the take-out I also think the limit on the warehousing of foreign currencies for the ESF should be raised to $20 billion with the understanding that the special increase is linked to the Mexican situation I should also say that a further understanding could be that we have a situation that could last for as long as ten years The Committee may want to discuss these suggestions today and vote on them tomorrow  The third topic is the IMF program Last Thursday, the Mexican authorities announced agreement with IMF management on an economic program in support of Mexico's stabilization efforts The program is scheduled to be considered by the IMF Executive Board on Wednesday with the first disbursement by Friday, assuming the program is approved The program as first proposed was unprecedented in its size, both absolutely and relative to Mexico's quota at the IMF It was three times Mexico's quota, or about $77 billion, of which $39 billion was to be released on approval of the program The economic content of the program is tighter than that proposed by the Mexican authorities on January 3rd in terms of its fiscal policy parameters and especially its monetary policy parameters On the surface the program is designed to achieve the same macroeconomic objectives In terms of growth, as you will recall, the Mexican program called for growth of 1-1/2 percent year over year; inflation in the Mexican program was set at 19 percent December over December; the exchange rate was to get back to 45 pesos per dollar; and the current account balance was to be cut to a deficit of $14 billion this year However,  -60-    1/31-2/1/95  implicit in the program is the notion that some, and probably all, of these objectives will have to be revised and that the terms or contingency arrangements of the program will need to be further tightened as well  Following the collapse of the US legislative proposal, the Managing Director of the IMF decided this morning to make two changes to his recommendations tomorrow with respect to the program The first is to increase the size of the program by $10 billion, which he hopes to finance from non-BIS-member central banks There is some question about that point, and if the funding is not obtained from those central banks and governments, then it would come from the IMF's own resources Second, he would have the IMF disburse the full amount of the original program immediately  On my fourth topic, other multilateral efforts, the extraordinary size of the IMF's original program can be explained by two factors The first is a recognition by IMF management of the serious threat to the international financial system posed by the Mexican situation The second is a recognition of the need, especially as perceived by the United States Congress, for greater international ""burden-sharing,"" as they call it, in efforts to stabilize Mexican financial markets  With respect to burden-sharing, we and the Treasury have been discussing certain proposals with our central bank colleagues The first is to enlarge from $5 billion to $10 billion the BIS facility in favor of Mexico that was agreed upon in principle on December 30th The second is to make the financing from the BIS readily available to meet current short-term financing needs On the first point, the BIS agreed that the increase, in principle, could be announced as part of the package that was unveiled this morning, although you will note that some of the language of the subsequent announcements suggests more agreement than actually exists, as is almost always the case We are less optimistic about agreement on the second point  The Treasury, with our technical support, also has approached three groups of other countries to ask them to assist Mexico You probably have heard that a group of Latin American countries-- Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia--generally has responded favorably, although the modalities for the assistance are not yet agreed upon In addition, the Treasury has approached a group of countries in the Far East and another group of countries in the Middle East for participation I suspect these efforts will now be rolled into the IMF endeavor to raise an additional $10 billion to finance the Mexican program through the Fund  Last, as you know, the Bank of Mexico so far has drawn $1 billion on the $10 billion Canadian and joint Fed/ESF swap facility Those drawings have been made available to the Bank of Mexico rather than being locked up at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York We understand that as of the end of the day, Mexican reserves will be between $24 and $29 billion including those drawings There is some uncertainty about how much they lost today, whether it was $1 billion or $650 million And then Mexico intends to announce the level of its reserves tomorrow Governor Mancera has made an urgent request that we allow a further drawing to enable him to pad his reserves somewhat After consultation with the Treasury, the Chairman has suggested that  -61-    1/31-2/1/95  we allow the Bank of Mexico to draw an additional $2 billion, $1 billion on each swap line, with the understanding that this entire amount would be locked up at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and not immediately available for use by the Bank of Mexico On that somber note I will stop and would be pleased to answer any questions   The security arrangements with respect to the existing enlarged swap arrangement are all in place Under this new proposal, they would remain in place behind the ESF's operations because the ESF would be committed to taking us out first So this arrangement would be behind ours as well--any money would go to us first Those are essentially the same arrangments as those that have been widely talked about in connection with the guarantees arrangement ""Collateral"" is the word that I fight against a lot, Mr Chairman I have had too much feuding with the lawyers on this point   They are an ""assured means of repayment"" The way they work is that the non-Mexican customers receive irrevocable instructions from the Mexican government as of a specified date, a date which would be after a payment was due on the guaranteed bonds or whatever debt instrument we are talking about, to make their oil payments to a bank in the United States, an account of Pemex in the bank in the United States Those receipts would be immediately paid into the government account and from the government account into a Bank of Mexico account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York By prior agreement, though that is not required but useful, the Mexicans would then acknowledge that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York would have the right to set off funds in that account against claims of the United States government that had been assigned by the United States government to the Federal Reserve   I think it is about $6 or $7 billion a year, so it is about $500 million a month The Chairman has pointed out that this is a mechanism that would allow repayment It is also fair to say that if there were circumstances where the repayment was difficult, it might be difficult to fully enforce the mechanism But I think the most likely scenario would be that a subsequent agreement would be made It may be good in this circumstance that the agreement would be between the Mexican government and our government; we would be the agent, but we would be left out of it The subsequent agreement in effect would say Because of other disasters that have happened with Mexico, rather than taking all your oil receipts we would take a more practical amount--not $6 billion a year but $2 billion a year So, rather than paying off $20 billion over 3+ years, they would pay it off over 10 years   Yes, they could   They could, but I think they feel that it would be useful to their objectives to have a lot of people--   We would come in front of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, not the Treasury   There are two issues about whether we are dealing with the Treasury itself or with the ESF   The Treasury is very conscious of the fact that if they make this arrangement--that is the reason for the warehousing of up to $20 billion--they would need to allow for the fact that we had advanced $4, $5, or $6 billion Therefore, we would have to have a contingent claim on them for that $6 billion--if that's the amount-- 12 months down the line They would have to be able to take that claim over, if necessary, either by advancing their own swap or by an arrangement with the Mexicans under this program whereby the Mexicans would use their proceeds to pay us off   Mr Chairman, the Exchange Stabilization Fund does not have appropriated funds  -63-    1/31-2/1/95   I think that is what is in the program   Even if we didn't, the precedent in the 1960s--I think there was a question then about whether the Treasury could engage in foreign exchange operations outside of the ESF--was the use of Roosa bonds in the 1960s The Treasury floated Roosa bonds to obtain foreign currencies and used some of those currencies to take us out That did not involve appropriated funds That was treated as a debt-management operation The Roosa bonds were issued under their debt-management portfolio   I would suggest, though maybe it's not the right thing to suggest, that we would go first to the Treasury If the Treasury went to the oil collateral, if I may use that word, that source of repayment would go first to us   I said the ""Treasury;"" I meant the ESF   No   It subsumes the $9 billion that we have now The $18 billion is comprised of $9 billion from the United States, $1 billion from the Canadians, $5 billion from the BIS, and $3 billion from the commercial banks  -64-    1/31-2/1/95   I don't consider warehousing to be exposure, but--   The figures would be what the Mexicans draw from us and our warehousing with the Treasury   Yes, with a take-out from the Treasury Essentially it's $26 billion with the Exchange Stabilization Fund   The $6 billion would be part of the $20 billion, so it would be--   Six billion dollars would be dedicated to taking us out The twenty includes both what we advance in the short run and what the ESF advances The maximum exposure to Mexico of the ESF and us that is now contemplated, matches, so to speak, the $20 billion of the warehousing   They haven't approved that stand-by arrangement for Mexico yet; they will consider that tomorrow   The two are added together So it will now be $17-3/4 billion rather than $7-3/4 billion   Roughly $25 billion in liquid assets, of which $5 billion is in dollars and $20 billion is in foreign currencies It also has about $9 billion of SDRs, but most of that is matched on the liability side of the balance sheet by liabilities to the Federal Reserve   Quite positively The last time I looked the peso was about 570, having weakened earlier to a new low of 655   I don't think it was ever contingent on the $40 billion because it was put into the market before the $40 billion in guarantees was announced But it was contingent on the BIS facility that existed It was to be paid out pari passu with the BIS part of the package The truth of the matter is, speaking frankly, the banks have not been particularly supportive of this operation   My guess is that once this situation stabilizes, there will be some effort to suggest that the banks could be a little more supportive One of the dominant themes on Capitol Hill has been the question of who peddled this paper, and although a lot of it is not on the balance sheets of the banks, they did a lot of peddling   Twenty plus--   $17 billion!   Yes Well, 2 would be the last number   On the other hand, the number before was the $40 billion plus the $7 billion plus the $5 billion So, the two totals are broadly commensurate   Absolutely!   Governor Mancera is very conscious now that he has a commitment to announce his reserves after the end of every month My understanding from the people I have talked to is that his intention would be to say, as he did the last time the Bank announced its reserves--and this is a small but significant step forward--that his reserves are X and that those include drawings on the North American swap lines of Y   Not yet, but I think that will be part of the Treasury--   They existed--and that was the problem!   I think the major concern--and that is only partly addressed by this since we tentatively plan, at the moment anyhow, to lock up funds--is that announcing he has $24 billion in reserves, given the kind of problems he is up against, does make him look rather naked   The language before the dots is--   The legislation governing the objectives of the ESF was changed, I think for the most part in the mid- to late-1970s The changes included the language that the government of the United States and the International Monetary Fund have the obligation to promote orderly exchange rate arrangements leading to a stable system of exchange rates That was interpreted to include making loans to Bolivia in helping it maintain a system of stable exchange rates   Yes They have made loans to or financial arrangements with at least 37 countries around the world over the last 50 years   I can only say that Treasury lawyers have looked into the question of whether these operations are legal under this broad authorization of what they can do and what the purpose is--   Not the legislation--but operations for three years   I was trying to live up to Governor Lindsey's entreaty that I suggest the questions one could ask as well as the answers   We have used these arrangements five times since 1982  SPEAKER(?) The oil?   The provision for payment from oil export proceeds We never have had to have recourse to them   Ten   The earlier ESF balances agreement also ran for multiple years Whether it ran as long as 10 years I can't remember, but it is unusual to go that long There is a difference between whether it is legal and whether there are precedents for having done it It is unprecedented in that the loans are expected to be outstanding that long So they got involved in offering us a repayment guarantee   And to allow them to stretch out the debt--to replace short-term debt at high rates with long-term debt   I think the Treasury's intention is to secure a financial plan from the Mexicans about what they will do with that financing--that is, their whole debt-management strategy This, of course, would have to be worked out by agreement between the Treasury and the Mexicans and we would participate in terms of our own part in that As would have been provided for in the legislation, the plan  -70-    1/31-2/1/95  would have to be in place before a substantial amount could be drawn free and clear   The Mexicans would in effect be substituting credit from the US government or the Exchange Stabilization Fund rather than from the private market as under the previous guarantee program   In one case they would have borrowed the money with the full faith and credit of the United States in the private market--in the guarantee mechanism   In the second case they either do that, which is one possibility, or they would borrow the dollars from the United States Treasury which would borrow in some sense from the ESF The ESF does not have dollars but it has Treasury bills that it could sell, and the proceeds would be invested in Mexican obligations   We are involved for two reasons One, the ESF does not have the liquidity, so that involves us in the warehousing The other relates to our participation--this would be short-term participation--through the existing swap line, the enlarged swap line, and the suggested super enlarged swap line   No, I think for one year That is one of the reasons why I did not put a specific proposal to you today What I had been thinking, but I wanted to do it tomorrow morning when I had a clearer head, is that you might want to set something up so that they could draw up to $6 billion But once they had drawn $6 billion and the drawing had been outstanding for 12 months it would have to be repaid, and they could not redraw on the enlarged portion of the swap line The Committee would decide over what period--or maybe it could be for two periods--the Mexicans would be allowed to draw on the enlarged swap line And after that point they might be allowed to  -71-    1/31-2/1/95  roll the drawing over up to three times and then be required to repay any unpaid balances As the drawings were repaid, the enlarged swap facility would be extinguished and they could not redraw on it The swap line would drop back to our normal swap line agreement and any further drawings would require Committee clearance   They announced on the 9th of January that their reserves were $56 billion   As of yesterday their reserves were above $2 billion   Do you mean sell those foreign currency assets in the market? In this case, it would be just like any other exchange market intervention, I think   Yes, Peter holds them for the ESF They are reasonably liquid   It is fair to say that as a policy measure, one of the reasons why the Treasury chose to go with the loan guarantee originally rather than using the ESF was that by going to the ESF, even with our cooperation, they felt there might be some sense that their ability to defend the dollar with existing foreign exchange balances was being impaired And, therefore, if forced to sell out to the market, their ability to defend the dollar subsequently would be difficult without foreign exchange reserves, even aside from what one may think about the effectiveness of intervention The Treasury is not particularly ""gung ho"" on intervention, but they are ""gung ho"" on having some powder in the magazine   We need some sense of the Committee's view on the ""drawing"" or whatever word you want to use   It may take us a little while to work out the take-out   As President Melzer said, previously--the action was taken on December 30th--you approved a special increase in the Mexican swap line for a short period of time Now, in fact the drawings by Mexico are still within the $3 billion swap line that existed before it was expanded with the special arrangement on the 30th of December So, you are operating under what was previously agreed upon   The answer, I suppose, is that participation in this current phase requires action on the warehousing limit for one Secondly it involves acting on the proposal with respect to raising the $4-1/2 billion swap line to some number, or not raising it, and articulating how long the enlarged amount would be outstanding before it reverted to the $3 billion normal size of the swap line So, if the Committee does that, I am done   Combined The Mexicans drew $1 billion earlier, divided equally between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Last night they drew an additional $2 billion, of which $1 billion is from the System   I was talking about the combined amount for the United States and Peter was talking about the Federal Reserve portion   Mr Chairman, I am very conscious of the fact that the members have not had their lunch yet! Obviously, if any of you have further questions about what we discussed yesterday afternoon, I will be glad to try to answer them Let me preface that by saying that there probably will be some questions for which my answers will have to be less than perfect But I would like to try to answer any that you have and either stop there, Mr Chairman, or move on to the two proposals that I mentioned yesterday I am at your disposal, including whether you want me to cover the proposals individually or together   I will do the best that I can! On the first part of your question, the legislation that was going to be proposed but which is now dead made reference to the Federal Reserve in several respects I skipped over that yesterday afternoon because those provisions were no longer relevant, having been overtaken by events They related basically to Mexico's monetary policy and the widespread view on Capitol Hill that it is the source of Mexico's problem Some would say it is the exclusive source of Mexico's problem We were mentioned in the legislation in terms of a requirement that the Bank of Mexico provide us with data and information on their policies We also were mentioned in connection with the preparation of various quarterly or semi-annual reports regarding the progress of the program that the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with us and other relevant government agencies, was to submit to Congress Since there is no longer any legislation, that in some sense is not relevant, though I would imagine that we will have to provide some reports to Congress, if not by formal mandate at least in connection with oversight hearings  As for the statement in the IMF Managing Director's press release yesterday, I confess that it was somewhat of a surprise to me since Bill McDonough and I had been consulted and we thought it had been removed When I got back to my office yesterday evening and saw it in the materials that I had handed out to you, it was a surprise to  -117-    1/31-2/1/95  me I checked on this and apparently the reason it was in there is not unrelated to the first question--   Our good friends at the Treasury apparently felt that the statement was needed for two reasons Now, I am interpreting their motives or putting forth hypotheses about their motives because I don't know for sure The first was to add to the credibility, if that's the right word, of this revised proposal on Capitol Hill by continuing to assure certain members of Congress that we would be involved in the process Secondly, they felt that the process would be somewhat less formal than would have been the case under the legislative approach, and therefore they apparently wanted to signal in the IMF's press release that we--we the United States and we the Federal Reserve in particular--would be involved in the normal monitoring, if I can put it that way, and that the IMF would do the managing   I'm not sure what level of commitment this is, but I am reasonably confident that there are no big surprises   One of the reasons why I held forth quite as much as I did yesterday was to try to convey to the Committee in five pages as much information about this process and the substance as I could without going into every eddy and turn that this matter has taken over the last four weeks I tried to outline the thrust of the policy issues and procedures as I understood them  made for  -118-    1/31-2/1/95   The conditions essentially are You will have a tight fiscal policy; you will have a tight monetary policy; you will avoid exchange restrictions and those type of ""thou shalt not"" restrictions There will be nothing quantitative in the conditions, which is one of the frustrations, as the Chairman testified yesterday There is a desire on the part of some to say, for example, that the objective of this policy is to drive the peso exchange rate back to 35 per dollar There are a number of members of Congress, as you probably are very much aware, who say that that should be the sole objective of the policy First of all, I don't think that is what the United States Treasury has in mind Although some people on this Committee may think that, I do not believe that is a majority view more generally So, the lack of quantitative parameters in these restrictions is one of the reasons why certain members of Congress are concerned   With great difficulty!   I would argue that we are locked in anyhow Even if we are not formally locked in, we would be in effect because, for a variety of reasons we have been very much involved--especially over the last couple of years and certainly in recent months--in the particulars of monetary policy and the financial market operations of the Bank of Mexico It is not just the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; it is also the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, for example, which has developed very detailed policy analyses and pronouncements relating to policy We are involved and we cannot say that this is ""they"" and this is ""we"" And we do have an agenda Bill McDonough will tell you that one of the agenda items--if I may put it that way, Bill--is to get the Mexican authorities to relax their restrictions on the functioning of financial markets so they will have a functioning foreign exchange market A particular element of that, I think partly at Bill McDonough's insistence, was written into the letter of intent, which specifies that they would relax those restrictions That is something we have an interest in because it is the judgment of the experts that, until they have more normal features in their foreign exchange market and as long as they do not have an absolutely pegged exchange rate, they will have sizable gyrations in their exchange rate Such gyrations are not good for them and not good for us If the rate moves 5 percent a day, there is  -119-    1/31-2/1/95  just no way for anybody to hedge or cover themselves That is one example We are already involved in that We are trying to help them, through what might be called technical assistance, execute a floating exchange rate policy   Right I can only tell you what I know   I have not seen the letter   With regard to the peso, I think at most it says that one of the objectives of the program would be some strengthening of the peso That was the language that was in the legislation that was set aside yesterday It would not have tied them down to 35 or 45 or 50 to the dollar But I have to say that I have not seen the letter   With the Bank of Mexico, right   Yes, from the ESF   I can't give you a legal opinion The ESF is an entity of the United States government If it made a commitment to us that in some sense it could not cover out of its own funds, I do not know whether it would have an automatic draw on other United States government funds What I can tell you is the following, and this may be helpful The ESF will have $20 billion in the sense that it is expected we will give it to them when or if we do the warehousing So that $20 billion program includes $6 billion covering our swaps and $14 billion of their other funds   I don't think that is what is contemplated   But I don't think that's a realistic possibility because the Treasury knows that it has to have $6 billion set aside to take us out 12 months later   Warehousing is a mechanism that removes the foreign exchange from the ESF's balance sheet As the ESF needs the foreign exchange or as they acquire dollars or otherwise have dollars, they would unwind the warehousing in the same manner they unwound the $9 billion of foreign exchange that they warehoused with us in the late '80s and early '90s   In principle, yes   An operation the ESF may engage in would be one that the proposed legislation had contemplated authorizing The ESF may issue a guarantee to the Government of Mexico allowing it to float securities backed by the US government in the international capital markets  -121-    1/31-2/1/95   Yes   Or $14 billion as I said in my answer to Governor LaWare The $20 billion includes $6 billion to take us out; $14 billion is for them to do these other things   Certainly, it is not assumed that we will go in for the whole $20 billion My personal judgment is that one also should not assume that we would stop substantially shy of that I would be misleading the Committee, at least in terms of my own thought processes, if I left the impression that the amount would be only a couple more billion dollars beyond where we and the Treasury are today, collectively   Well, Treasury is the ultimate--   Yes, but I think in fact what the Committee wants--this has not been written because I didn't want to put it in writing until after we had heard the Committee's discussion--is a commitment from the Secretary of the Treasury to do whatever is necessary in order to repay the Federal Reserve I don't want to try to prejudge or anticipate the way in which that could be done The ESF can get funds elsewhere For example, one way the Treasury paid us off in the 1960s--took us out of exactly this type of arrangement-- was that the general fund of the Treasury drew deutschemarks on the International Monetary Fund It then advanced those deutschemarks to the ESF which the ESF used in turn to pay us off So, I do not want to preclude the possibility that the Secretary of the Treasury in exercising his responsibilities would include other ways of paying us than just out of the $20 billion This is notwithstanding my answer to Governor LaWare's question that their current thinking is that their budget of $20 billion includes $6 billion that is needed to take us out  -122-    1/31-2/1/95   The Secretary of the Treasury--well, really the President of the United States   My reading of the statute is that the funds of the ESF are to be used by the Secretary of the Treasury with the approval of the President The ESF is under the exclusive control of the Secretary of the Treasury   I agree, but either way, whether narrowly or broadly construed, the commitment would come from the Secretary of the Treasury because he has the authority, subject to the approval of the President, to do this   My way of thinking about this, but that again is something one could debate, is that in some sense our backstop is the Treasury How they backstop themselves is their business   Right The Treasury has said they will ask for oil to back up their loans to Mexico, which would include the operations that they may take over from us   You could do it either way, but I think it is probably cleaner to do it as I explained If they take over our obligation to the Bank of Mexico, the funds from the oil facility would first come to them   The oil proceeds would flow from that account   Let me be clear Nothing can be locked up in the New York Fed The only point at which something can be taken from the New York Fed is-- Oh, do you mean locked up in the sense we were discussing last night?   Yes   There are a couple of points I did want to make going through this   Yes, on general questions and now we are going to go to the specifics Mr Chairman, do you want me to say something about the specifics for both or for each separately?   I just want to amplify a few points on the swap arrangement first Basically, the first point on the piece of paper I handed out says that we would have essentially two swap arrangements One would be the regular $3 billion swap arrangement; the other would be a special swap arrangement The Bank of Mexico would be able to draw on those arrangements for 12 months as of yesterday Each drawing could be outstanding for 12 months The next point says that the absolute outside time limit for final repayment either from the Mexicans or the Treasury would be January 31, 1997 As the Bank of Mexico did repay, however, the size of the special line would be reduced permanently If after rising above $3 billion the drawings got down below the $3 billion mark, they would go back into the regular swap line, which would require a separate decision to be activated  We talked about the Treasury take-out There are a number of ways in which that could be done One thing I did not mention--it's something we would have to work out--is the question of how, going forward, the drawings would be shared between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Currently, we are operating under the December 30th framework where everything is done 50/50 I would assume that going forward the sharing would be approximately two to one Again, however, I think one needs to be realistic If the ESF were to get  -124-    1/31-2/1/95  involved, for example, in making a $5 billion loan guarantee, which would take some time to set up, there might be some adjustments as we went along But ultimately as the amount got toward the maximum level we would be moving to that two-to-one proportion  The warehousing proposal is probably somewhat clearer The proposal is to raise the amount from the existing $5 billion to $20 billion This is clearly a rather exceptional operation, and the rationale is to facilitate this program The third point is that this excludes the warehousing of pesos That, it seems to me, is required in terms of the overall logic of this arrangement I would argue that that is a matter we probably ought to keep internal rather than put in the minutes at this stage Finally, although I would say that this arrangement should be subject to annual review, I think in answer to Governor LaWare's question and someone else's is that in principle some of this warehousing might be outstanding, in the limit, for 10 years   The usable funds in the ESF today, counting the foreign exchange as usable, amount to roughly $25 billion   About $5 billion is invested in Treasury securities and the balance is roughly equally divided between marks and yen I think they have slightly more yen than marks   It is obligated only in the sense that they have one other swap arrangement with the Bundesbank So, in some sense if they wanted to advance dollars to the Bundesbank they would use some of the dollars for that But nothing is obligated in a current commitment One of the Treasury's concerns is that this operation does severely limit what the ESF could do over a fairly extended period of time It preserves the ability of the ESF to use its foreign exchange holdings for exchange operations, but that is probably about all it does   Certainly We intend to have a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury to the Chairman of the Federal Reserve on that matter  -125-    1/31-2/1/95   There are two sides to that Peter and I discussed it this morning I decided that between the two choices the Committee would be happier saying that once the drawings got repaid the total would get subtracted and a separate decision would have to be made about putting the funds out again If I may piggyback a bit on the question Governor Lindsey asked earlier and the fact that these swap drawings roll over every three months, if one found Mexico's reserves growing rapidly we would have the scope to encourage them to repay We could not require them to repay but we could use moral suasion in the effort to secure early repayment That might deal partly with your problem  SPEAKER(?) But in fact we have always structured each rollover as subject to mutual consent   We are committing ourselves in advance to provide that consent  SPEAKER(?) But to whom are we committing? Are we committing to the Treasury or we are committing to the Mexicans? I think the whole thing does hang on the difference there We can agree with the Treasury and within the Committee as to what the rules are, but vis-a-vis our relations with the Mexicans and how we rewrite the swap agreements, etc--   The rewrite probably would say the maturity is three months with renewal--  SPEAKER(?) Three months and we have to agree to renew So, that may be the discipline which squares the circle   However, I doubt that we'd want to get to the situation where we use it What we would end up doing is using moral suasion at the end of three months rather than whatever the alternative is--  SPEAKER(?) ""Immoral"" suasion!   --actually calling the loan   The latter  -126-    1/31-2/1/95   By 1997, yes   That is the other side of the monitoring question    -127-    1/31-2/1/95   We would have a responsibility, and the Treasury certainly feels it has a responsibility, because the Treasury will have a lot vested in the success of this That is what I meant when I said in answer to Governor Lindsey's question that I think we have no choice but to be involved in the monitoring--whether our role is put up in neon lights by the International Monetary Fund or not If I may make a personal statement on this matter, having lived through the devaluations of 1976 and 1982 and now this one, I have a personal stake in insuring that this does not happen this way again That is all I can say as far as I am concerned; that is a personal remark rather than an institutional remark   It would not have been linked Basically what would have happened under the previous arrangement is that the Bank of Mexico would have gone out with the US government guarantee and raised, for example, $5 billion in the international capital markets They would have used those funds to meet the pressure on the exchange rate that would be associated with the holders of tesobonos, which are paid off in pesos, not wanting to roll them over but rather wanting to take the pesos and buy dollars   As long as they do not use the guarantee with it What would be necessary for the Treasury, and I would assume we'd be somewhat involved in an advisory role, would be to require the Mexicans, as under the contemplated legislation, to come up with a financial plan That financial plan presumably would say These are the sources of funds we are going to have over the coming short period of time; for some longer period of time, this is going to be our strategy, which includes what we do with monetary policy I don't know what Peter thinks, but I personally thought it was a mistake yesterday for them essentially to cancel the tesobono auction because  -128-    1/31-2/1/95  the rates were so high and they had just been bailed out by President Clinton I may be wrong about that     Yes The Treasury will insist that in order to implement this program, an agreement or a series of agreements will have to be worked out with the Mexicans about what they are going to do And I am using the term ""financial plan"" to refer to that The Ttreasury needs to think about these things before it dribbles $14 billion out the door  -129-    1/31-2/1/95   On another aspect of this problem!   My expectation is that we will get a commitment from the Secretary of the Treasury to do what is required to take this loan off our books after 12 months Exactly how we are going to specify that, I do not know It is my personal view that having a 52- page legal document between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury on these types of matters is not in our interest   I would like to make one other point on this President Melzer asked a question earlier about the oil mechanism Even I, with a reputation for exuberance, if that's the right word, would not go so far as to give up the current arrangement that lies behind our $4-1/2 billion swap line before being satisfied that we have appropriate arrangements in place to convert all this into some other form Even I would not be so imprudent   My answer to that question would be that the problems we are likely to have with this are least likely to be financial It seems to me that there are essentially two risks One lies with what might go on in Mexico if the overall program does not work If the Mexican situation spirals out of control and we are involved--we already are involved with the existing swap line but our involvement could increase--we would get caught up in that situation economically It seems to me that the other principal risk, which may or may not be related, is that this set of arrangements could come under intense political scrutiny in this country regardless of what goes on in Mexico And I can well imagine that that kind of scrutiny is something that many people within the Federal Reserve would prefer to do without I can say from my own experience that there are a number of people on Capitol Hill who are involved in oversight on these arrangements and are reassured by the fact that we are involved in the process   That is one way of thinking about it   That would be one scenario   That is one of the reasons why we are bringing it up   Well, following up on yesterday's discussion, I want to add two separate thoughts One, as far as warehousing pesos, we have said no I think that is important to the consistency of this operation As a technical matter, the ESF will still have some limited capacity to acquire foreign exchange, more yen or DM, in the market This is not a problem that I would worry about right now, but conceivably they might do that at some point They might say we have bought another $5 billion worth of yen and want to warehouse those  -134-    1/31-2/1/95  with the Federal Reserve, too Whether the ESF can do that would require a separate decision by the Federal Open Market Committee One of the reasons that I, at least, would favor putting in place the big number, which is matched with other big numbers in terms of the program itself and with their existing holdings of foreign exchange, is that it would make what we are doing much clearer The slippery slope of doing things a billion here and a billion there is to some extent avoided  On the question of review, I would think it depends on the appetite of the Committee Peter will be regularly reviewing foreign exchange market developments with the Committee, and Mexico for better or for worse is inevitably going to be part of that for some months and perhaps a couple of years So, I think there will be a lot of opportunity for the Committee to exercise its oversight of this To the extent that disbursements mount up quickly, there will be a chance in March to find out what has been going on The staff will make an effort--as we have tried to do in the past though maybe not always successfully--to keep the Committee as informed as we can about ongoing events and to minimize the number of surprises There probably won't be any surprises because we have a perfect crystal ball!   I don't think we have an obligation to announce to Congress We have an obligation in the sense that Governor Partee once said to Congress that we would use our foreign exchange holdings last to collateralize our Federal Reserve notes   What we do not know is whether the scale of things has increased enough since then combined with the fact that reserve requirements have come down so that we would have the room   Let me give you a two-part answer   On the legislative plan, there was still the question of what the Mexicans were going to do with the money I think this is a question similar to the one that President Minehan was asking earlier How are they going to use the money, whether the funds are short-term or longer-term funds? That is where it seems to me the financial plan that I referred to earlier comes in And it is related to the question about our involvement in the monitoring of the economic policy side Indeed, the major rationale for our being involved in the monitoring of the economic policy side is that without  -138-    1/31-2/1/95  that involvement, we could advance them the money--whether it's for the short term, medium term, or long term, and the money could easily be frittered away The two interact   Well, I can name eighty-seven, too   Still, even if those trade policies go wrong, when they do go wrong, their impact on the Federal Reserve or the financial system is relatively minor If Mexico has economic and financial policies that go wrong for the next millenium, or more immediately for the next two or three years, I think that will have a major impact on the Federal Reserve, whether it is wearing its bank- supervisory hat or its financial-system-stability hat, or its macroeconomic-policy hat I think the Federal Reserve has to be concerned about how the Mexican Treasury spends the money, one way or the other I would prefer that our concern not be put in neon lights, but I think we have to be concerned   I agree on your first question that I do not have a answer I will tell you one small element of this, however--or give you my position With respect to the International Monetary Fund, we are in a somewhat similar position, though on a slightly different scale, as we are relative to the Congress The International Monetary Fund got itself into this situation essentially in December They realized that they knew less about what was going on in Mexico than we did We knew a great deal less than we wished we had known, even though we had devoted a considerable amount of resources to this on a daily basis for at least the last year What the IMF does know is that Peter Fisher and his colleagues as well as people here at the Board have much better contacts and information about the day-to-day operations in Mexico than the Fund has That is for two reasons First of all, the Fund, for better or worse, does not have a culture that is designed to follow day-to-day developments in the individual economies of member nations Secondly, on the other side, the Mexicans are world champions in terms of obfuscating about economic information while simultaneously providing a lot of other information Transparency of the way economic policy is conducted in Mexico, including monetary policy, is a very serious problem, and it is one that relates to the comment earlier about the functioning of financial markets as well as comments--what Governor Lindsey was asking about yesterday--concerning the balance sheet of the Bank of Mexico from top to bottom  -139-    1/31-2/1/95  To extend Chairman Greenspan's analogy a step further--maybe I am taking it a step back--once we have put the house fire out, we want to build a more fire-proof house and we want to try to encourage the resident of the house to stop smoking or at least to stop smoking in bed I think we have an interest in getting it done, not that we are going to create a mistake-proof economic environment in Mexico any more than we can create a mistake-proof economic environment in the United States We can hope that with some effort and a considerable expenditure of Federal Reserve resources--I mean human resources and budgetary resources in one sense--to fix things so that at least we will not have these problems coming back  Let me come back to another point on resources I share, for all the reasons Governor Blinder has stated, the concerns about what we will monitor and how we will monitor because this will have, among other things, resource implications for the Federal Reserve System I want to know whether I am going to have to budget one man year or forty-two man years to get this job done right We need to know at the minimum what we are going to be asked to do, and see whether it is feasible to do it both in terms of resources and, as Governor Lindsey and the Chairman have said, in terms of the intellectual feasibility   As a technical matter, if we declined to do the warehousing or pulled out of the existing swap agreement, leaving aside for the moment just hypothetically that we are already involved for $45 billion, the Treasury presumably would do it all alone! Our collateral would be improved by this arrangement, but let's suppose we were starting from square one, and square one probably has us going back to about 1967, and we had never had any dealings with Mexico They are all going to be done via the State Department and the Treasury Department Then the Treasury would take $20 billion and do it all directly without having us as a temporary junior partner on the swap side of it On the warehousing side of it, in principle, the Treasury could find other means to move that $20 billion in foreign exchange off their balance sheet It would be obvious that they did that and that we had said ""no"" But in principle they could do it As the Chairman suggested, perhaps they could do it by warehousing with the Bank of Japan and the Bundesbank I'm not quite sure how they would do that, but in principle they could do it In principle, they could warehouse it with the BIS, and the BIS could warehouse it with the Street All those options are, from some standpoint, maybe preferable as far as we are concerned I would even argue that they illustrate the fact that this is a fairly straightforward set of financial transactions The very fact that it could be done in the private sector suggests that it is perhaps more normal, or less abnormal, than some people think it is But in principle if we walk away from both sides of that, the Treasury would go ahead and do it anyhow That's my thought   I'm sorry you have not had sufficient information I think this upsets everybody; everybody feels that way We have made a very serious effort at the staff level to improve the reports You may not read the weekly reports from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York but since shortly after last April, when this consultation process was formalized, some 60 percent of Peter's words in that report have dealt with his consultations with Canada and Mexico So we have put in extra resources to provide the Committee with additional information on the current financial situation of both Canada and Mexico It may not be enough, but we have stepped up our efforts  The point about these consultations is absolutely true and I regret that personally I called the Treasury and asked about it and recommended that we call a meeting of the North American Financial Group in early September to discuss Mexico's exchange rate policy and their strategy They said ""no"" The next time, I would try to enlist the Chairman of the Federal Reserve in doing that, which might be my normal inclination anyhow I just resisted it this time I think we should have used that mechanism beforehand because that in fact was one of the reasons that we insisted it be set up Having agreed to go up to a $3 billion swap line from the previous $700 million swap line, that was to be part of the quid pro quo So if we were going to be more tightly bound because of the financing arrangements, we would have a mechanism that we could be more comfortable about You are perfectly justified in feeling snookered We all were snookered I apologize to the extent that we could have minimized that, but we will try harder   If the Committee decides to keep the swap line at $4-1/2 billion, the Treasury understands that The Chairman made it very clear in his conversation at the Treasury that we might stay at $4-1/2 billion If the $4-1/2 billion is where the Committee wants to draw the line, that is where it can draw the line "
5329,1995-03-10," Let me just add one point because it relates to what Peter was saying and what President Minehan was asking, at least in part One consequence of the package that the Mexican authorities have announced and presumably will put in place is that they will have substantially less growth, meaning more likely negative growth I understand that the finance minister talked about a current account deficit on the order of only $2 billion versus something like the $14 billion that they were talking about at the time of our last Greenbook Those two things together slightly offset, at least in the short run, the weaker dollar and some of these financial factors that Mike was referring to That tougher package of fiscal measures is essentially double the size of the contingency measures that had been built into the program with the IMF This has been necessitated by the fact that the situation has deteriorated enough in the past five or six weeks so that they had to take more ""cod liver oil"" than they originally had planned   Peter may have his own view My view of the situation is that it still remains very--   Dicey--just took a word out of the Chairman's mouth Given the somewhat improved situation, at least broadly speaking and precariously speaking in the Mexican financial markets, I would be interested to see how things have developed in Argentina today because those two countries have been to some extent playing off each other's difficulties in the last few days Also, the fiscal measures that the government announced on Monday are likely to slow Argentine growth, too, which was already going to be very modest this year I would not bet a lot of money that they will be able to hold things through the election or beyond, but they seem to be quite determined The major problem there, as I see it, is that the banking situation   Very short-term rates, yes   President McDonough, I assume that the IMF mission has not been announced, as well as this other funding?   I've been elsewhere!   Don't shoot the messenger! The Treasury obviously is very uncomfortable about the fact that although the dollar is off its recent lows, it is still near record low levels against both the yen and the D-mark They have been receiving considerable pressure from their colleagues in Europe and Japan to be seen doing something about it in the exchange markets They, I think, also have chosen to take personally the comments of numerous financial reporters who have been saying that Treasury officials have been sitting on their hands One idea that I know they have been kicking around would be to organize with the other countries a several-day-- I'll use the word ""campaign"" but that may be a little too pejorative-- campaign of intervention operations designed to show a more sustained commitment to trying to strengthen the dollar than has been engineered to date As Peter explained, in the operations last week we were at some pains to operate on our own and have the Europeans operate on their own, and then operate again on our own So, there was a deliberate attempt to be seen not as uncoordinated but as operating independently, which we viewed as appropriate given that we thought that some but not all of the problem was a dollar problem I think it still is the case that some but not all of the problem is a dollar problem It is clear--Peter mentioned this in passing--that the European situation definitely has not stabilized The franc is weak again today against the DM and the pound is as well It is difficult to judge to what extent the dollar is suffering from the backwash of  -7-    3/10/95  those European uncertainties On the other side--and I think Bill McDonough can probably speak to this--some of the Europeans are quite anxious for us to be seen in the exchange markets That is the range of thinking that the Treasury no doubt is going to mull over the weekend I think that's all I have   No, I don't think they have a well developed game plan at this point  -8-    3/10/95   We have already booked you in; you can't get out of it! "
5351,1995-03-28," The reason, Governor Lindsey, is that we often do report intervention numbers in that document We can't say it's Class II when it has intervention numbers, and it's not classified when it doesn't have intervention numbers because then we would be revealing something That is the point That's why it's always Class II regardless of whether or not it has intervention numbers in it   Mr Chairman, just to make a technical point on the warehousing issue I don't want to comment on the political aspects of it; that is not my role But as a technical matter the Treasury could conduct its warehousing transactions with the market or with another financial institution So the notion that warehousing as a technical matter is an evasion of the fiscal authority of Congress I think is not correct I am not talking about perceptions We have    3/28/95  worked hard and have changed the warehousing arrangement so that it is now very clearly an arms-length, market-related transaction We do it on exactly the same terms that the Treasury could if it divided it all up and did it with 150 institutions in the market All we are doing is to accommodate the Treasury as a convenience to them This does raise questions about our role and our role in assisting Mexico in these kinds of things, which I perfectly well acknowledge But as a technical matter, the transaction could be done with the market Therefore, I don't think it's fair to say that this is an evasion of the fiscal authority of Congress   It wouldn't show up in the budget either way What the Treasury does is to swap their DM or their yen with us They sell it to us spot and buy it back forward They can do that on exactly the same terms with Citibank or Chase or Deutsche Bank or the Bank of Tokyo, whatever institution it might be That would have exactly the same impact on them fiscally   The Mexico situation, for better or for worse, has clearly given the Halifax Summit something to focus on--something more than just chit-chat about stable exchange rates, if I may put it that way Doing something in the bankruptcy or orderly workout area is one of the ideas that is under some discussion It's also fair to say that other ideas under discussion include some that the Chairman has tried to pour cold water on--that of vastly increasing the size of the IMF and its capacity to deal with these kinds of situations I don't think there is a consensus among the various nations involved in the G-7 on what to do at the moment It appears that most options are still on the table, though some people think that a few options have been taken off   Yes, certainly there are big and small issues involved and both types have been raised here in this discussion That's partly because we started with Mexico, which on the one hand is a country-specific type of problem On the other hand, Mexico is regarded as symptomatic, as the Chairman has said, of the nature of the international financial system and its functioning and the potential problems and challenges as we move into the 21st century It's difficult to sort those things out As far as country-specific problems are concerned, it is fair to say that many other central banks of the major industrial countries are in fact more involved in this process than we are The nature of their involvement is different from ours It might be useful to the Committee, as one of the little studies that the Chairman requested, for us to describe what other G-10 central banks do with regard to dealing with these smaller--if I may put it that way--problems Indeed, in most of the cases where efforts have been made to help other countries we have not been involved in terms of our own money, though the U S Treasury is often involved whereas other central banks have been involved An example is the current effort to put together a bridge loan for Argentina You will find the other G-10 central banks backing the BIS in that loan In the case of United States participation, if that goes forward, it will be done exclusively by the Treasury Most of those central banks in turn are supported by their treasuries in one way or another, sometimes formally but not always formally In some cases there are central banks that take a degree of risk in a loan to another country in a far corner of the world; an example is Sweden relative to Argentina The Federal Reserve has chosen not to do that So maybe it would be useful, at least as a background note, to try to put together a study to describe what other countries do That doesn't touch the big issues but it might help deal with the little ones   Well, on the tougher question, I think you are absolutely right about the result that the standard macro models will give you A cut in the fiscal deficit will produce lower interest rates and that in turn will translate through to reducing the external deficit through lower interest rates and a lower currency One way to square that with the notion that the dollar should appreciate if the fiscal deficit is cut, is to distinguish between real and nominal To the extent that there is a fear out there that the central bank will seek at some point to monetize the deficit or float it away through more inflation, then a country could have a stronger nominal currency at the same time that it had a weaker real currency   There is one other argument for which there is some support in the literature It is a longer-term argument that would run from a lower deficit to more investment, a more competitive currency, and therefore an appreciation of the dollar That is a very long-run argument A slightly different argument has a timing feature If the fiscal deficit is cut, that will start to bring down the current account deficit sooner than otherwise and less of a depreciation will be needed in the long run than otherwise That is a sort of ""compared with what"" argument In terms of the long run, much of this argument does turn on the factors that Peter was talking about--the notion that the fiscal situation has played on the dollar more in terms of whether we, the United States, can manage our affairs appropriately That probably has been exacerbated again in the psychological realm by the Mexican situation Those two situations have played off against each other more than any deep reading of the macroeconomics involved   No I only wish I had thought of it   There is one explanation that I'm not sure is right, but it helps to answer the question of why the dollar was weak relative to many of the European currencies over this period One story that can be told is that there has been some degree of flight from emerging markets, or shifts in demand for emerging market instruments And emerging market instruments are dollar-denominated  Ms MINEHAN Right   The most important of these are the Brady bonds Those bonds have taken a tremendous hit over the first quarter of this year Although US investors hold some of the Brady bonds, they also are held around the world by all kinds of investment funds It's not irrational for those funds, many of which are Japanese--after all there is a lot of savings in Japan--to think that as investors move out of Brady bonds that are dollar denominated instruments, they will move into instruments denominated in the other two or three major currencies, including the Swiss franc So that seems to me to be the one element one can point to that would help explain some degree of rally in terms of our own bond market and some degree of weakness of the dollar vis-a-vis the yen, the deutschemark, and the Swiss franc I am not sure it is quantitatively significant enough, but if you look at what has happened to the prices of the Brady bonds, it has to mean that there has been a big shift in the ex-ante demand for those instruments over this period   We wouldn't have the data unless they are held at the New York Bank   You have to remember that as a statistical matter they can move investments from Eurodollar holdings to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and that will show up as custodian holdings but it doesn't have any currency implications at all   Either that or an exception   [Statement--see Appendix]   Maybe this is cutting it too close, but if you look at the two years together in the Greenbook, we have a little more inflation this year because of what we have assumed about the dollar Therefore, the flatness produces a bit of a distortion It suggests that the trend is very gradual, but there may be more trend than the numbers themselves suggest   A slight deterioration   I apologize because I thought I had read the minutes earlier, but I had not Out thinking at the time of the last meeting was that the Japanese earthquake would affect our imports but not our exports The truth of the matter at this point is that we think the earthquake will affect neither But that was where we were, so I would prefer to take out the phrase in paragraph 14 that says it will affect our exports That shortens the sentence to the one fact that we know pretty certainly--that the Mexican situation will affect our exports "
5384,1995-05-23," Just one technical point The pickup as far as this year is concerned is quite modest I think the fundamental pickup may be seen by focusing on the fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter number Because there was a big negative number last year, the pickup looks a little better as a percent than we would think, though we are looking for an annual rate of growth in the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range for the balance of this year But, as Mike mentioned, we have tended to mark things down over the last several forecasts I think we would have marked things down even more in the absence of this fiscal package, which came in a bit on the high side of people's expectations I find it extremely difficult to judge Japanese fiscal policy because we don't have a very good baseline, if I may put it that way They have two or three supplemental budgets a year The fundamental budget may be good from the standpoint of fiscal rectitude It may be a great way of running things because they can always drop back to a more restrictive policy in the absence of special supplemental budgets On the other hand, in terms of judging the ongoing thrust of policy in the context of unusually large output gaps and, as Peter mentioned, the threat of deflation, that probably is not the right assumption to make I believe the Japanese situation clearly involves some downside risk on balance It is not an unreasonable forecast, but it probably has an uncertainty band around it that is a bit wider than the forecasts for the other industrial countries   We have essentially ignored the trade relations question in the forecast So, I guess implicitly we are assuming that some time between now and the end of June this particular matter will be settled There are then two questions One would be what happens if Congress does go through with the sanctions The trade and the price implications of that are likely to be pretty secondary; we are talking about $6 billion worth of consumer demand I guess the simplest calculation would imply a shift to that much more nominal spending, but that is only 01 percent of total consumer spending over some period We have to worry about secondary effects, but we also have to worry about other adjustments if we assume a full pass- through So, it is not a big number Also, the overall trade implications are not likely to be very large because most of the presumed shift in demand for luxury cars will go to Germany and other countries So, in terms of the aggregate effect on trade, not much would be different That's the easy part of the story The more difficult part would be to gauge what would happen if we got involved in a so-called trade war That is a phrase we throw around, but I don't think we really know what it means, or I don't know what I mean when I say it Probably the most important aspect of that would be the impact on financial markets on the one hand and some broad perception of where economies were going, which I think is likely to be negative It is hard to imagine that a trade war would not be a negative factor on the whole, but how bad it would be is difficult to judge So, in that context, we have assumed it is not going to happen!    5/23/95 "
5411,1995-07-05," They sell us SDR certificates   Right   The Treasury balance goes up   What's on the liability side?   If I could just add one other factor--   One more fact is that this is a case in which the Federal Reserve has no choice as to whether it accepts SDRs   In a lot of other transactions with the Treasury, the Federal Reserve has some choice But the law says, I think, that the Secretary of the Treasury may issue SDR certificates and the Federal Reserve shall accept them Period   No It's outright  SPEAKER(?) It's an outright purchase   Like gold certificates, it's an outright purchase; there are no repurchase agreements on the gold certificates They are required to redeem them under some circumstances   That's warehousing   Permanent, yes    7/5-6/95   It's $4222; it's equivalent to the official price of gold "
5459,1995-09-26," There have been long articles in various German newspapers about the advantages of this kind of operation--newspapers such as the Frankfurter Allegemeine Zeitung and the Suddendeutsche Zeitung The Swiss are understandably somewhat unhappy since they are just sitting there like any other emerging market, if I may put it that way [Laughter]   [Statement--see Appendix]   They announced today, Japanese time, that the head of their New York office had been making false trades for 11 years, which is hard to believe, and had lost roughly $1 billion in the process They will take that loss in their fiscal half-year results The news was released early enough to be in The Washington Post You may not have seen The Washington Post   Peter or someone else may have some more details They called me last night The announcement apparently did not affect their markets The Nikkei, for example, was up 300 points in Tokyo today   Peter has some comments Let me give you mine What I tried to suggest in my briefing is that this is a process that is going to go on for years It's going to be up and down and up and down As different countries and institutions within the countries jockey for position, there will be, I think, a heightening of the debate about the EMU and whether individual countries are ready for it You saw, for example, how Mr Arthuis got beat up on Thursday by Mr Waigel who came out at Majorca and said that maybe we just ought to postpone the EMU for a couple of years Now, that's not necessarily anti-EMU, but it changes the whole timetable The debate is heightened as the time for various kinds of decisions comes closer The effect on the dollar, it seems to me, is largely secondary It partly depends on what you mean by the dollar The dollar tends to weaken relative to the deutschemark the less likely the EMU appears to be and therefore the more likely the deutschemark will be free to rise relative to the dollar Then, the ebb and flow of discussion does tend to affect the dollar The way I think of it is that for people who have liquid assets it is easier to get out of dollars into deutschemarks to cover positions than to get out of Swedish kronors into deutschemarks So, you have a backwash effect on the dollar, at least in the short run   It's certainly a possibility How big it is, I don't know "
5485,1995-11-15," In some degree, it has occurred in the yen market itself That is one of the phenomena   That would be a little difficult One of the problems is that two things are going on with Japanese banks at this point One is the Japanese year-end premium The other is the general Japanese risk premium I think it's a little difficult, for some of the reasons that Peter just pointed out with respect to the funds futures, to separate which of the two you are dealing with You can make an assumption, such as attributing it all to the year-end pressures, but there is some leakage in this process And you have a phenomenon that whatever the pressures are, they are in both the yen markets and the dollar markets I think that's presumably where most of it is There may be a little in the sterling markets    11/15/95   President Minehan, I think one dimension of this that Peter did not include in his report, because he gave a lot of background and the report was already long enough, is that there is a particular problem, which I am sure you will appreciate, in terms of the payments system   We have staff who have worried about this general problem of foreign-held dollars in the payments system for at least a decade to my knowledge In some sense, because of the size of the Japanese banks and their role in the international financial system, they are a particular problem and this arrangement or procedure is designed to deal with that problem One dimension would have almost a pure payments system set of consequences, but I think we all recognize that it is a general dollar payments problem and that it is not unique to Japanese banks In principle, US banks could have the same problem elsewhere Although this arrangement was set up because of the current situation with respect to the Japanese banks, it is part of a general problem and I don't think we have a standard set of procedures to deal with it   Certainly As the Chairman explained, it got publicity when it was not intended and the latter was somewhat premature in any case   My assumption--it's a very safe assumption, Mr Chairman--is that in the case of the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan you would be giving a signal by cancelling the swap lines For the reasons you cited, some people would not want to do that and we therefore have a problem with respect to the Norwegians, which is a particularly bad example My perspective on this has been, as I may have said before when we have had these discussions, that the time to rationalize these arrangements is in the context of European monetary union, if they get to the third stage of having a European central bank In that case most of these countries would have an arrangement with the European central bank Since Norway is outside the union, you would have a slightly complicated situation, but a number of these swap lines would be captured in that arrangement Now, if we want to do away with them completely, that is a different proposition I think it is also worthwhile to think about whether we could imagine using swap arrangements in the context of payments system problems In that case, as President Jordan suggested, we obviously would need more than $250 million It would be a very different operation Because these arrangements always have the characteristics of lender- of-last-resort arrangements as well as helping through what could be just glitches in the payments system, they are not easy to orchestrate "
5509,1995-12-19," Remember, there was a first phase whereby the Committee initially activated the existing $3 billion Then, at the end of December 1994, there was an effort to deal with this problem in what I sometimes call the ""old fashioned"" way by getting banks together and so on The Committee approved a ""temporary"" swap line of $15 billion in conjunction with the arrangement that included $5 billion provided by the BIS Then, the Committee went up to the $3 billion temporary line in the context of the President's second program   Right   The original $3 billion was associated with the regular program   The other part of the confusion is that the Treasury also has a $3 billion swap line with the Mexicans   Too many threes around here   One of the conditions for the Committee's approval of the Mexican drawings was that we would be repaid either way--that is, by the Mexicans or by the US Treasury   I think it was just an accounting convenience that we assigned these drawings to their regular swap line We could have done it the other way around; it might have been somewhat more logical   My view is that it has worked, though maybe not as well as it should have In particular, there have been stepped up consultations at all levels among all three countries, some bilateral and some trilateral I think in fact one of the most useful things that was done--the only thing I think we did right--was that Peter arranged to have a weekly conference call with the Canadians and the Mexicans, which allows us to do a once-a-week update of economic and financial conditions in the three countries That regular weekly call has meant that it is therefore much easier to have ad hoc contacts So, that is one element that has come out of this process    12/19/95   The capacity of central banks to manipulate their reserves is quite substantial, but even in 1994 I think we had a pretty good fix on their reserves, though we may not have kept the Committee as well informed as we should have   The one thing that has happened since we circulated Steve Kamin's memo is that they have adopted a new framework for their monetary policy This is not a big deal, but they have adopted more conventional definitions of their domestic assets and international reserves than they used in the past I think this will facilitate market analysis of their operations I don't think it avoids the possibility that the market may still misinterpret developments in Mexico, but I think the warning flag is quite substantial It remains true that the capacity for the Mexicans, or any government, to try to slip things through is still there   Partly because of these calls that Peter has arranged and other contacts, we are much more informed than we were We can't avoid all surprises   I think that's the right implication and inference, if I may put it that way I can't speak for the Committee We did have a visitor last Friday from the research directorate of the Bank of Mexico I went over both the fact that we would not renew the $650 million drawing and that that was a matter for him to take up with the United States Treasury I also told him that the Committee was going to consider this matter today but that, all things considered, there was not a lot of FOMC appetite for new Mexican drawings in 1996 He said that was certainly the basis on which they were operating His view is that of only one reasonably important    12/19/95  Mexican official on the subject, but I think he was very forthcoming on that   That's one of the reasons why I think their preferred position would be for the Treasury to roll over the two drawings They have a $650 million short-term swap outstanding with the Treasury too, and I think the Mexican position would be that they would like to roll the two together into a medium-term obligation to provide themselves a bit of a cushion, given that the door is going to be closed later in 1996   Certainly that's their position; I think that's a logical position as well   I don't know whether that's the sole roadblock, but that's an issue that we wanted to surface The staff felt that it was a little arcane, and I apologize that the memo may not have been clear The truth of the matter is that even absent that issue, given everything else going on, the objective of the program was basically to get Mexico's financial situation stabilized, and that has been achieved Now, whether they will be able to move from that to what they need to do in terms of growth is a different matter We can't do that for them I think the general attitude is that we have done what we can   As was outlined in the memo, the Treasury is subject to the certification process of the Mexican Debt Disclosure Act In addition, the Treasury appropriation for fiscal year 1996 contains a provision that limits the extent to which they can use the ESF for operations without Congressional approval Since they may take over our portion of the Mexican drawings, that could mean they would be using the ESF for more than $1 billion and for longer than 60 days So, they would be constrained in terms of taking us out of further Mexican swap drawings Coming back to President Minehan's question, that is one of the reasons why it's unlikely that the Treasury will want to get into this right away once disbursements under the President's program come to an end Since they could not be our partner, we would be less likely to want to do something on our own than we might have been in the past   There would have to be an assured means of repayment for any drawing under the general arrangements Actually, the Mexican Debt Disclosure Act has a provision requiring an assured means of repayment in our case So, we would have to have some sense of how the System was going to get repaid in any case In the particular circumstances that Mexico was in, we were getting involved    12/19/95  at least indirectly in a medium-term program and the Committee felt that stretching the maturity to 12 months was about as far--maybe further for some members--as it could be stretched in terms of our normal financial operations "
5533,1996-01-30," They are still putting out the data with warnings on them and that could continue for some time They have had a number of changes in their statistical systems incorporating both their going to pan-German data and aligning their statistical systems with the European norms It is not clear yet what can be interpreted as reliable data In August or July they changed their CPI, for example, and all of a sudden they lost 1/2 percentage point on their rate of inflation   I thought it was very clever myself It elimi- nated the difference between the French and the German inflation rates!   [Statement--see Appendix] "
5578,1996-05-21," Except when the Committee started the meeting at 800 in the morning   People have said that [Laughter] [Statement-- see Appendix]   We are forecasting a decline in oil import prices to $17 per barrel and in WTI spot prices to around $1950 per barrel; that is down a couple of dollars from current levels Our forecast did not assume an Iraqi oil decision at this time, but it did assume that we would get essentially the same amount of oil in 1997, so our forecast had the increased supply occurring 6 months later We actually have the oil price somewhat higher than the futures prices as of last week, so in some sense all that has happened is an adjustment in the timing Other than the short-term factors that Mike was referring to, the one argument that you might point to on the further out picture is that one might be led to conclude that this is ""it"" rather than an assumption that Iraq will be allowed to export much more in the near term So, the prospect of full Iraqi production coming on stream in the next year or two has gone down That is the only story that I could pick up on that   That's right The probability that it will be 2 million barrels has gone down even as the probability of 700,000 barrels has gone up "
5604,1996-07-02," They are changes in production in barrels per day Production is expected to peak in 1997 and to turn down after that   Well, as you probably know better than I, every time we have looked at North Sea production over the last 10 years, it was going to diminish in 2 years The people who look at this, and they include the experts of the International Energy Agency, expect that Norwegian production will level off at a peak level in 1997 and then decline That is, of course, one of the reasons why we don't get the same non-OPEC supply coming on stream as in recent years That is the logic New discoveries and new techniques obviously could lead to more production than we now assume, but that remains to be seen   Well, one issue has to do with the question of Iraqi production coming on stream In fact, we had assumed in our forecast that the 800 thousand barrels per day from Iraq in the second half of the year would be enough to plug the hole in stockbuilding that was created over the first half of the year If that were not to happen, if the oil flow from Iraq were to start on January 1 instead of August 16, we would have oil prices staying up above the $17 per barrel range through the fourth quarter and then coming down to the $17 per barrel range over the first part of next year So, the inventory plug results in some sense from the supply coming from Iraq   Yes In fact, we probably will have a little more cheating   Well, you have uncovered a sleight of hand Actually, the formal assumption that we make for the developing countries in the model simulations is that their interest rates follow our interest rates So, if we damp our nominal GDP or lean against a surge in nominal GDP by raising our interest rates, their rates go up, too Actually, when we ran this simulation, that proved to be insufficient, for perhaps obvious reasons We therefore went in and constrained the GDP growth path for those countries That took out some of the shock, if you want to put it that way, so that growth in the developing countries did not continue on a higher path    7/2-3/96   We got that result without specifying the policy mechanism by which nominal GDP is held down for those countries, but in terms of trying to control the impetus to the US economy, we have achieved that modest result In fact, when we did it another way, we came up with a huge expansion in the developing countries because the rise in US interest rates was insufficient to set off a timely multiplier-accelerator process in reverse We therefore went in and essentially damped things down so that we got something close to the same growth path from the developing countries as we did with the developed countries where the real level of economic activity rises through the first two years, then essentially levels off, and subsequently comes down a bit as the interest rate effects take hold We have essentially the same income path in both cases for the US economy   Yes, but the model runs off interest rates and the exchange rates of the developing countries do stay pretty much in line with the dollar That is one of the reasons, in fact, why we have a different exchange rate in the two scenarios In the first case interest rates go up more in the industrial countries than they do in the United States and as they go up that pulls up their currencies In the second case, we don't have that effect, so that's why the dollar goes the other way than it does in relation to the currencies of the industrial countries, because we share in some sense the same income growth factors   The top chart?   No, the top chart in the top panel includes just goods   These are all goods in nominal terms   My memory would be that, for example this year, we have exports of merchandise growing 7 percent and exports of goods and services together growing 5 percent Next year it is 11 and 9 percent   Yes, services are pulling it down Last year services in the GDP accounts grew only 1-1/2 percent over the four quarters I hesitate to offer a firm opinion because this calculation may not have been done correctly There were revisions and we tried to incorporate them in the historical GDP numbers Whether the revisions got incorporated in the right way, I am not 100 percent confident There was some double counting of services I think that happened more on the import side than on the export side   Because you come from New England, you probably think that your region is providing a lot of services   That don't get measured in I have the same bias, but I have not been able to convince anybody that the treatment is wrong "
5652,1996-09-24," It remains an issue under Maastrict, and I think the answer is politics It's not settled yet, but it appears to be headed that way   The question, Governor Lindsey, is whether we are talking about high politics or grass root politics and that is another source of uncertainty The high politics may bring it about The question is whether the grass root politics will follow the high politics   What is involved in the French budget is not actually an asset sale, but a somewhat complicated takeover of pension obligations in return for cash It is a kind of asset sale Economists would call it an asset sale; I'm not sure accountants would   If I could just interrupt, we could not buy any private assets other than bank deposits We should have mentioned that in the memo It may be useful to note as background that, before the Monetary Control Act, we could only hold our foreign currency balances in the form of bank deposits The Monetary Control Act added government paper So, the only private assets we may hold, as Peter has said, would be bank liabilities   There is one other factual point that it might be useful to note, and I think you referred to it in the memo, Peter That is that one of the characteristics of the German money market is that they do not have a lot of short paper That reflects a policy decision on the part of the Germans, and I might add a policy decision on the part of the Bundesbank They are changing this a little Therefore, the other side of their being good natured about this is that in some sense they themselves have not promoted the kinds of assets in the market that we could easily purchase That is changing a little as I noted, and the Desk has taken advantage of that Again, exactly how it will evolve in the context of the euro--leaving aside all of the other issues about the euro and the amount of euros we will get when the transition occurs--is unclear My guess is that on balance we will be better rather than worse off because the Germans are the ""least modern,"" if I may use that word, in terms of the kinds of government paper that they have on the market "
5676,1996-11-13, Congratulate the Chairman 
5701,1996-12-17, (Statement--see Appendix)  -9-    12/17/96 
5727,1997-02-04," Yes, the authority to enter into a warehousing transaction is in the  first vote   Mr Chairman, President Minehan has a question   That was a period when we and the Treasury were doing quite a lot  of intervention in the markets The Treasury essentially ran out of dollars in the Exchange  Stabilization Fund We warehoused some of their foreign currencies to provide them with  dollars so that they could participate with us in foreign exchange operations   You went immediately to the warehousing issue   [Statement--see Appendix]   I think there are two aspects to your question One would relate to  the short term, meaning the period we are looking at here, and the other would be a longer-term  perspective  With regard to our assessment of what the industry is saying about the short-term  supply and demand balance and abstracting from accidents of one sort or another like cold  weather in Europe, hurricanes, and so forth, we are in fact quite conservative in our use of  conventional relationships in terms of what the industry itself says about new production coming  on line over the next year or so That said, I think that for a medium-term forecast going out    2/4-5/97  beyond this period--and leaving aside the little run-ups that we have had--we might be more  inclined to shift from an almost flat nominal price trend, which implies a real price decline, to  something that might be more flat in real terms While there is no inviolable arithmetic involved  here, I think almost everybody believes that we have to get there ultimately That's because of a  sense that some of the technological improvements that have come on line and other factors will  come into play to produce that result Now, I say all that partly against the background of an  assumption that Iraq will stay put If we assume that Iraq will reenter the market with 3 million  barrels a day or something like that, then we are postponing that scenario for 18 months or a  couple of years before the extra supply is absorbed The one negative on the other side is that a  good deal of this new production is in parts of the world that are not the most stable; one  example is Columbia So, we might have a lower level of prices for a while, but a firmly higher  level of volatility as a result of interruptions of one sort or another in the supply of oil That's  the best I can do "
5795,1997-07-01," To piggyback on the aircraft question, we really do not have a  precise view of what is going on I mentioned that the aircraft shipments have picked up over  the last two quarters The information that we have, where we have some slippage going  forward, is that their foreign component is leveling off rather than continuing to rise A larger  fraction of what is shown on that chart, at least for the next 5 or 6 months, is going into the  domestic side of BFI   Yes, as best we can piece these things together "
5817,1997-08-19," I talked with Hong Kong Monetary Authority officials last night, and  they did not seem particularly concerned Their mode of operation is one that in some sense tends  to draw attention, because in essence they meet a demand for Hong Kong dollars when it arises, but  they automatically tighten their money markets That's why we've seen a rise in their short-term    8/19/97  rates, which they hope will be enough to adjust financial market balance There does seem to me to  be a question as to how long the peg of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar is going to  last The current mechanism is somewhat artificial, and now that the artificiality of the other pegs  in Southeast Asia has been revealed, there is some sense that the Hong Kong authorities are nearer  the time when they will have to make a decision on this issue   I don't think they know what they are going to do, quite frankly In  fairness, they face a difficult problem President Minehan and I were at a conference last week, and  a very bright woman from Indonesia asked what advice we had for them now that they had floated  their currency Mike Mussa of the International Monetary Fund replied that at a minimum they  should not freely float but should have some sort of managed float and should re-orient the basket  of foreign currencies in terms of which they had sought to maintain their own currency's value so  that the basket is less heavily weighted toward the dollar He added that that was the end of his  advice My comment to her was that it was very good advice, although it was only about 25  percent operational in terms of what they really needed to do They have a relatively small open  economy, so the notion that they can ride the roller coaster of international financial disturbances is  very difficult for them to accept Their financial markets do not have the depth or resiliency that is  necessary to allow them to go, for example, to a Canadian style of monetary conditions index and  expect to have the sort of gyroscopic stability that the Canadian dollar has displayed It is a real  problem for them, and we should not underestimate it Perhaps monetary union with the Japanese--  [Laughter]   I think there are two points to be made One--about which it would  seem appropriate to inform the Committee in any event--is that the United States government was  very concerned about this from the beginning In fact, this issue came up last March and I think it  is fair to say, as Governor Meyer can attest based on meetings he attended, that this is an accident  that did not particularly surprise us Once the pressure built in March, we were in the awkward  position, partly because of US political opinion, of not wanting to be perceived as pushing the  Thai authorities into an action that I believe most observers thought was inevitable The Thais  and they have a very serious problem in terms  of restoring confidence and the stability of the baht The Treasury's position basically was to  encourage the Thais to engage with the International Monetary Fund, which has a traditional view  on these types of things, and to urge the Japanese to restrain from pouring money into Thailand  until the Thais had fully arranged their loan from the International Monetary Fund When it came    8/19/97  time for the Fund to put forward its package with the augmentation of bilateral assistance--a quite  unusual feature and one that the Fund tried to put together in connection with Mexico but could not  find countries that were willing to take on the direct Mexican risk in the way the Asians are  prepared to take on the direct Thai risk--the Treasury had to contemplate, in consultation with the  Chairman, whether to participate in this arrangement Post Mexico, as you may remember from  our discussion of the renewal of the swap lines, the Treasury is under much tighter constraints  about what it does with the Exchange Stabilization Fund than it was in the past So, the Treasury  would have had to jump a lot more hurdles to participate, and they have a number of other  proposals before Congress that require political support The latter include the approval of the New  Arrangements to Borrow, which is on the legislative agenda, and the potential approval of an IMF  quota increase So, on balance, they said that they would like to participate for purely geopolitical  reasons, but for internal political reasons it would be risky for them to do so They have said they  can anticipate some step-up in EX-IM Bank financing, but that financing is tied aid as opposed to  the untied aid contained in the rest of this Fund package  The one thing that we and the Treasury have done is to put forward a proposal, which  has now been accepted, to provide some backstopping in the form of short-term liquidity bridge  financing This was in the works from the beginning We were sufficiently skeptical about the  ability of the Fund to raise this medium-term money in Asia that we tried, and were largely  successful, not to put this forward as an alternative but rather as a supplement to the basic package  Agreement on that package has now been reached by the G-10 countries and a few non G-10  countries It is expected to be announced tomorrow or Thursday after the IMF approves the Thai  program That program provides a degree of political, if you want to put it that way, or  international monetary support for the operation, but obviously not on the scale to which the    8/19/97  Japanese and the Southeast Asian and other Asian countries have participated Some people in  Asia think that the Japanese they put up $4 billion and  everybody else put up $6 billion, which is a higher fraction than we got with Mexico On the other  hand, as President Minehan knows, the Japanese were represented at our conference by Mr  Sakakibara, who observed that  So, I don't think we've heard the end of this For your information, this  arrangement probably will be announced Thursday morning or late tomorrow afternoon and will  include a conventional bridge loan--the amount will not be announced--that is intended to bridge to  some World Bank and ADB disbursements that are part of the package The BIS will be putting up  the bridge loan money and will be backstopped as an agent by the Federal Reserve Bank of New  York and ultimately the Exchange Stabilization Fund   I think everybody in the room has heard in one form or another that  they have a very strong political commitment I was referring to the future At this point, it seems  to me that it would be very difficult for them to abandon the current policy The Hong Kong dollar  may be under considerable tension right now, but the right time to rearrange things would not be  only two months after the hand-over, no matter what one thinks about the long-term viability of the  current exchange rate regime One also could say that they ought to pick some point of relative  calm in the next five years and adjust their exchange rate regime They will face some of the same    8/19/97  kinds of issues as they do now concerning which way they should adjust, and if some of their  economists were to say that they have the right answer, I would not believe them  Let me just add the fact that Hong Kong and China have participated in the Thai  financing arrangement and they also are going to participate in the bridge financing; there's not  much risk associated with the latter It is essentially an operational risk--symbolic in my view of  their perceiving themselves as having a big stake in stabilizing this situation for exactly the reason  that they do not want to confront these difficult questions concerning the Hong Kong dollar right  away   You can use the word ""bailout,"" but I am not allowed to The  financial situation in Thailand is in some respects much more problematical than was the case in  Mexico They have something on the order of $38 billion in short-term obligations Most are bank  obligations, of which more than half are to Japanese banks They also have a very large forward  position that is approximately equal to their gross reserves The amount of money being put up,  about $16 billion, is relatively small If we net out the forward position against the foreign  exchange reserves, their reserves position is no better than Mexico's was In a sense they are  getting some $16 billion in this package against $40 billion of short-term obligations, which are  mostly private-sector debts In that sense the whole program is predicated on the assumption of  credibility rather than a bailout because the money is not sufficient to allow all these short-term  lines to run off In the Mexican case, we had a package of close to $40 billion against essentially  $40 billion of short-term bank obligations and tesobonos We tend to forget that there were a lot of    8/19/97  bank obligations in the Mexican case, but they were as vulnerable as the tesobono problem In fact,  in the short run Mexico did lose some dollars through the banking system, but they recovered quite  quickly So, in that sense that financing package was less problematic  Two elements of moral hazard are involved in this case One has to do with the people  on Peter's acreage who conduct their business, but do not book their positions, on that acreage  They are on the other side of many, but not all, of the forward liabilities of the Bank of Thailand  You could say that the system is financing the Thai central bank's ability to meet its commitments  It would be a tricky business if the Thais were to start to default on their foreign exchange  contracts It would change the nature of the business The second element is a little more  conventional It has to do with what should be done with the obligations of banks in Thailand The  Thai central bank already has expended 16 billion--that's in baht, not dollars--to bail out domestic  institutions whose operations have now been suspended They have been quite successful in  sterilizing it, but it has become in effect an obligation of the Thai government as a whole It would  be one thing to stiff bondholders and still another to stiff commercial banks that might be expected  to come in and help support the Thai financial system as a whole The goal is to keep the central  bank's gross and net reserve positions from going to zero as they run down these forward  obligations I think that is the simple answer to your question   We do not yet have the June trade data Taking the inventory data to  give us a hint about what is going to happen to the trade data, one would expect imports to tail off  That would occur especially in the consumer area because we saw such a big rise in imports of  consumer goods in April and May Understanding all of this is a bit puzzling Our forecast tended  to level off such imports in June and into the third quarter, but there is a tension in the forecast as a  whole on exactly this point and how this should be put together   There has been some shift in the seasonal factors over the years and to  some extent earlier this year, especially in the consumer goods area One would not expect  Christmas to come in April, if I may put it that way It is not clear to what extent the seasonal  adjustments may have become unreliable, but it would not be a surprise if the seasonal adjustment  of imports were another source of the noise in these estimates "
5864,1997-11-12," My guess is that that is the way it would happen In fact, a country  can always experience the problem of domestic capital flight, of which there is a substantial  amount in China--on the order of $10 billion a year Another way that domestic residents can  attack the currency is through classical, if I may call it that, leads and lags There also are certain  foreign investment strategies that could be used I do not think the yuan can be attacked in a  money market or financial market sense but--while it is much more difficult--pressure can  certainly be brought on yuan asset values, and in some sense that has been going on   Not much happened in Brazil after they announced their program  Rates were down marginally yesterday; stock markets were flat and are down a little today   Yes, both cases   I thought it would be useful to say a few words about how we have tried, in preparing the Greenbook forecast, to take account of the recent turbulence in the international economic and financial environment I would note at the start that our assessment is very much a work in progress; in particular, the assumptions, explicit and implicit, underlying our analysis could be vitiated  In preparing the Greenbook forecast for the global economy and its impact on our external sector, we tried to take account of three interrelated changes in the international environment since the Committee's previous meeting in September (1) the evolution of the economic and financial    11/12/97  crises in Asia and the limited spread, so far, to other developing economies, particularly in Latin America; (2) changes in our outlook for other industrial economies including the influence on them of Asian and related developments; and (3) the modest further depreciation of the dollar against European currencies The net impact of these changes on our outlook for real net exports of goods and services has been small; they increase the negative contribution of the external sector to growth of real GDP by about two tenths next year and one tenth in the following year Although we think that this is a reasonable best estimate, we also believe that the negative risks to our overall forecast associated with developments in the rest of the world have increased Let me touch on each of the three principal sources of change in our forecast Asia, the other industrial countries, and the dollar  We have sliced and diced in a number of different ways the implications of the financial crises in Asia and hints of their spread to developing economies elsewhere, but I think the simplest way to understand the forecast is as follows In effect, we have taken as a starting point an assumption that in 1998 the current account deficit of the developing economies as a group will have to shift toward surplus by a combined total of $50 billion relative to our baseline in the September Greenbook, which implied a combined 1998 deficit of about $100 billion Based on historical trade patterns, principally with respect to Asian imports, the US share of such a required external adjustment is about $15 billion, or about two tenths percent of nominal GDP In this simple framework, it does not matter much for US economic activity or prices whether this adjustment is caused by macroeconomic policies, by collapsing financial systems, or by severely depressed stock markets, nor does it matter much whether the impact on the US economy is felt via exchange-rate, other relative-price, or aggregate-demand channels as a first approximation, it is the size of the overall adjustment that counts We are assuming that most of the adjustment occurs quickly, by the end of the first half of 1998, and that little further external adjustment in Asia or elsewhere is required in 1999 Our basic message, as we see it, is that in terms of deflationary effects on the US economy, developments in Asia will be more like a ripple than a wave  With respect to other industrial economies, in our forecast we took into consideration two influences the underlying pace of expansion and the effects of the Asian crises Excluding the effects of the Asian crises, we probably would have left our outlook for Japan unchanged because recent data on the economy have been broadly consistent with what we had expected, pointing toward a resumption of growth at around 2-1/2 percent in the second half of the year and extending into 1998 However, mainly because of Japan's relatively large share of Asian trade and relatively small    11/12/97  GDP (compared with the United States), we have marked down Japanese growth next year by about half a percentage point due to the Asian crises With respect to Europe, recent information on trends in economic activity have on balance been better than we had anticipated which, other things being equal, would have led us to edge up projected growth However, these economies also will be affected by the economic adjustments in Asia Europe's share of Asian imports is essentially the same as ours while its combined GDP is somewhat larger, suggesting that the direct effect of the Asian adjustment on European growth should be marginally smaller than on US growth The feedback effects on the US economy of lower growth in Japan and Europe are negative, and they are expected to be somewhat more spread out over time than the direct Asian effects  Turning to dollar exchange rates with the other industrial countries, as Peter Fisher reported, the dollar has appreciated on balance against the yen over the intermeeting period and it has depreciated against the DM and other European currencies, with the latter effect outweighing the former effect in terms of our G-10 average exchange value of the dollar Broadly speaking, these movements are consistent with relative trends in economic activity in these economies and shifts in the market's view of the outlook for monetary policies extending the period of easy money in Japan, continuing moves to withdraw monetary stimulus in Europe, and foreseeing no change in policy in the United States Looking ahead over the forecast period, we have left the dollar unchanged at its recent lower level, on average, in terms of other G-10 currencies This has the effect of providing a small net stimulus to US net exports that partially offsets the negative effects of Asian developments and their feedback on the US economy through weaker growth in the other industrial countries, Japan in particular  Returning to our basic message, the combination of these influences and considerations has led us, on balance, to increase by a small amount the negative contribution of the external sector to US growth over the forecast period The small downward adjustment in prices of imports, other than oil, computers, and semiconductors, in the Greenbook forecast for this meeting is due not to changes in our outlook for the dollar--which on an import- weighted basis in terms of both G-10 and non-G-10 currencies is not projected to change further on average over the forecast period Rather the lower import prices are due to the small decline in international commodity prices that has occurred over the intermeeting period, a decline that may or may not be attributable to developments in Asia  The risks to our forecast with respect to the dollar and underlying growth trends in other industrial countries, we believe, are balanced In    11/12/97  terms of the Asian crises in all their ramifications, the probability of further deterioration should be thought of as greater than the risk of a sudden unexpected improvement However, it would be a mistake to think that there are no upside risks involved in the Asian situation For example, the news coming out of the deputies' meeting in Manila next week about a new Asia-Pacific cooperative financing arrangement may be perceived as sufficiently positive for the region as a whole that net inflows of private capital will resume and substantially reduce the size of the external adjustments that we now think will be required  On the downside, the new government in Thailand may not be able or willing to deliver quickly on that country's IMF-supported economic and financial program; the implementation of the Indonesian program also may get bogged down in domestic or family politics; the storm clouds over Korea may darken further; and the spread of contagion to Latin America may intensify We circulated to the FOMC a note on a so-called ""worst case"" scenario in which the negative impact on US growth from the Asian crises is roughly double what we incorporated in the Greenbook forecast, largely because of an assumed spread of the turmoil to Latin America That scenario might better have been called a ""worse case,"" since it is easy to spin out scenarios that are more extreme  Mr Chairman, I will stop on that pessimistic note   It has not moved much It is still a very big negative or positive  depending upon how you want to think about it   When we did this calculation, we held that unchanged We forced  the adjustments to go elsewhere rather than into the statistical discrepancy   It seems to me that two or three points could be made One is that  there is a sense in which all of this volatility in foreign markets has been associated with some  moves toward tighter policies, as Peter has pointed out We have had the Canadian moves, the  British moves, the German moves, and although Japanese moves have been postponed, it is fair  to say that the generally benign monetary conditions in the industrial countries have been one  factor that has contributed to the acceleration of capital flows to emerging economies As we  have commented before, when that comes to an end, there is some risk of a process of  readjustment, some of which may already be under way I think it is probably a reasonable guess  that if the Committee were to surprise the market and move sooner, or move at all at this point,  there certainly would be some short-run dynamic effects And no doubt we all would come  under some criticism That having been said, unless you think that early tightening would set off  some great avalanche that would continue regardless of fundamentals, I don't think the timing  will make much difference in the medium term I don't think that in any fundamental sense an  earlier policy move will somehow cause political leaders in Southeast Asia to step back from the  things that they have said they were going to do I might even argue that it could accelerate the  adjustment process, but there might be a lot more broken crockery in the meantime    11/12/97   There is always that problem, and that is why I made my last  comment You could always say that if growth is going to be marked down by 5 percentage  points, why not mark it down by 6 percentage points? That is at one level There is always some  chance of a cumulative process, reminiscent of a lot of economic history On the other hand, one  also has to think about something from which many tend to abstract, namely, about what might  happen to policy along the line There likely is some policy whose feedback could prevent the  cumulative effects So, what may happen is difficult to say One point to think about, at least in  terms of developing economies, is that many of them are high-growth economies If they go into  recession, say their GDP declines by 2 or 3 percent, we would not think of that as a big recession  but for them it would represent a very large adjustment from previous growth rates of 6, 7, 8, or  9 percent The adjustment in growth would be something close to double digits We might  anticipate that Korean growth would still be 1 or 2 percent, but that would be a decline from 7 or  8 percent, a 6 percentage point change in the trajectory of the Korean economy Obviously,  there is no magic about zero here, and I think what you are saying is that in some real sense these  economies will be going into some kind of recession  Such a development could have further feedback effects, especially in Japan which, I  would argue, is hampered principally by their delay in doing something about the problems in  their financial system That has meant, at least in part, that their standard macroeconomic  measures may have been somewhat less effective than one might otherwise have thought, and  they are to some extent running out of string I don't think that is true for other industrial  countries as a group The industrial world seems to have the capacity to take policy steps that    11/12/97 37  would cushion some of these effects and in turn avert feedback effects on the developing  economies Things could be much worse  One part of the world that we have left out of our analysis is Eastern Europe There,  too, some economies have been impacted by at least the financial dimensions of all this turmoil  Although our trade with Eastern Europe is trivial, Western European trade with Eastern Europe  is not so trivial If there were dramatic changes in conditions in Eastern Europe, that presumably  would have some impact on Western Europe While it may be fair to say that Western European  nations have scope to use policy to offset the general macroeconomic effects of such a  development, it is not unreasonable to question whether they would be able to coordinate their  policies to do so So, I think there is some risk stemming from potential developments in Eastern  Europe that we have not taken account of arithmetically It is one reason why we probably  should have called our analysis ""a worse"" rather than ""the worst"" case scenario Absolute zero is  difficult to define in this context   It is a little more   It is more like adding 02 to 05 in 1998 and 01 to 02 or 03 in  1999 I think that is the order of magnitude There is always a question about multipliers in  these exercises Now, in fact, when we run these through, the ex post multipliers tend to be close  to 10 It is not entirely clear to me whether that is because the true multiplier is close to 10 or    11/12/97 38  because either automatic policy responses or discretionary policy responses are such that the  multiplier ends up being close to one   That goes to the question of global deflation Perhaps Mike Prell  and Don Kohn ought to answer this question, but my view is that the fundamental behavior of  the US economy has not changed so much in the last half dozen years that we can no longer  analyze effects of this size through standard aggregate demand approaches Obviously, the  developments in question would raise our unemployment rate and lower inflation pressures much  as one might argue that the collapse in Latin America in the early 1980s may have affected our  economy At that time, our economy was recovering from a recession, but it also was a recovery  from a recession with, at least as perceived at the time, remarkably quiescent inflation Inflation  was then in a 4 to 5 percent range, and that rate of inflation may have reflected some influences  from abroad in terms of downward pressure on commodity prices and related developments We  are looking at an effect on our macro economy that is marginal rather than large in terms of  fundamental behavior   On your first comment, I would agree with you and maybe I should  have been more clear It seems to me that in the particular framework that I laid out, which is  not the only way we looked at this, it is the capital account that is forcing the current account  adjustment As you say, the order of magnitude of those capital flows certainly is larger than the  gross trade flows But when it comes down to the corrective effect on goods and services--  which is what we measure in GDP--we end up wanting to look at that in terms of trade We  always have this question, much like the question on stock market effects on consumption, about  how to marry something with financial dimensions to how these things play out in real  dimensions, and whether the effects will be cumulative We have not added that in except, as I  think we mentioned in the Greenbook, that there is a side of this that looks at the implications for  growth in the developing countries It is hard to make everything consistent One sense of why    11/12/97 43  you might find less growth in developing countries would be that the cost of capital has gone up,  uncertainty has gone up, and there has been a big drop in investment It is not only investment  that comes from the public sector, which is supported in these economies, but from the private  sector as well as we go through this financial turmoil In that sense, we try to take account of  that effect   I was traveling, too I got trapped in Springfield, Illinois "
5889,1997-12-16," Are you not just as likely to see higher short-term interest rates, so in  fact it would go the other way? The forward foreign exchange rates would be more depressed  You use the word position, which is quite different--   I don't think you can find 2-year forwards in these markets If they  existed, they would tend to have higher interest rates and would be more depressed than the  current spot rates   Peter Fisher may want to comment, but I think it is reasonable to say  that many people want to cover their positions There are a lot of different ways of covering  them Some covering can be done in the spot market; some in the forward market; some  through borrowing; and some through lending How it manifests itself in individual cases may  be quite different If you have thin markets, this continuing activity may be depressing spot  exchange rates and you may get some bounceback even though the whole process has not played  itself out because basically no one is in a position to provide forward cover   Our message about the international economy and the external sector of the US economy is straightforward and easily summarized We have a weaker outlook for net exports, primarily as a consequence of the further deterioration of economic and financial conditions in Asia While I am tempted to stop at this point and turn to questions, there may be a bit more that I usefully can add It is true that we are again projecting slower global growth, in particular in Asia We also are projecting a stronger dollar and lower oil prices; the first is associated to a considerable degree, though not entirely, with Asian developments, but those developments have only marginally affected our view of oil prices Finally, we have updated our worse-case scenario, and I will say a few words about our current thinking on that subject  With respect to the current quarter, we have very little hard data on US international transactions; trade data for October will not be released until Thursday However, we have written down a small negative contribution of net exports to GDP growth this quarter, in contrast with a small positive contribution in the November Greenbook This estimate is based primarily upon three considerations first, our assessment of the third-quarter data that revealed somewhat weaker exports than we had anticipated; second, a judgment that the unexpected strength in our exports during the first half of this year was coming largely from an accelerator effect on exports of capital goods that has waned with the Asian crisis; and third, anecdotal information, for example, from the Beige Book and the supplementary reports received from Reserve Banks about the apparent negative effects of the Asian crisis on trade flows this quarter The anecdotal information, in turn, is consistent with our prior assessment that the first-round effects of the Asian crisis on our trade will be felt sooner rather than later  Turning to our forecasts for 1998 and 1999, our aggregate projection of growth in the rest of the world, weighted by US nonagricultural exports, is now 2-1/2 percent next year and 3-1/4 percent the following year, compared with a trend rate of around 4 percent Most of the downward adjustment is for the developing economies in Asia, where we anticipate greater near-term    12/16/97  weakness and a more protracted return to trend We have also marked down slightly further our growth forecast for Japan, while that for the other industrial economies is essentially unchanged  Our outlook for Japan and the other industrial countries has been affected by our revised view of dollar exchange rates As Peter Fisher has reported, the dollar strengthened against both the yen and the continental European currencies during the intermeeting period We attribute the yen's weakness to continuing question marks hanging over the Japanese economy and financial system--questions marks that we do not expect will be removed by the announcement, now postponed until tomorrow, of yet another package of policy measures Because we do not expect underlying conditions in Japan to improve immediately or dramatically and because we anticipate that the effects of Asian developments will prevent a further substantial expansion of the Japanese external surpluses in the aggregate, we have incorporated into our projection only a slight appreciation of the yen/ dollar rate from its recent level Compared with our September projection, we now have the yen more than 15 percent weaker at the end of 1999  With respect to continental Europe, we are no longer expecting a further increase in German official interest rates prior to the start of monetary union, and the market appears to be gradually coming around to the same conclusion This has contributed to the weakness of the DM and its associated currencies, and we expect that recent lower exchange rates against the dollar will persist, on balance, over the forecast period We also anticipate in our forecast that sterling will depreciate somewhat against the dollar as UK economic growth and interest rates ease but that the Canadian dollar will strengthen somewhat as interest rates continue to rise in Canada  With respect to the currencies of non-G-10 countries, in particular in the Asian region, our crystal ball is murkier The Asian currencies, except for those of China and Hong Kong, have declined substantially further over the intermeeting period We are not expecting further depreciation, on balance, from the current highly depressed levels, nor are we expecting a recovery To borrow a term from the politics of 1884, I would characterize this as a mugwump position with regard to the nominal exchange rates of these economies--our mug is on one side of the fence and our wump is on the other However, real dollar exchange rates of these countries should appreciate somewhat due to inflation rates that in many cases will approach or exceed double digits  The net result of these assumptions is that the dollar is stronger in both real and nominal terms throughout the forecast period against both G-10 and    12/16/97  non-G-10 currencies, with an associated negative impact on our outlook for net exports  Turning to oil prices, we have reduced our assumption about the price of imported oil by about $2 per barrel in 1998 and 1999 Our revised assumption is based on the substantial increase in official OPEC quotas (which has led us to boost our projection of OPEC production by 900,000 barrels per day in 1998), the easing--at least for the moment--of tensions with Iraq and Iran, and the slowing of global growth, especially in Asia The market appears to have adopted a more cautious interpretation of these developments Although futures prices have declined, the implied downward adjustment in import prices over the forecast period is about half the size embodied in our assumption We believe that the difference reflects primarily continuing concerns about the availability of supply from Iraq and, perhaps, a different assumption about the increase in actual OPEC production--in particular by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates--under the new quotas  In terms of our overall forecast, lower oil prices, of course, imply lower US inflation The principal impact on our external forecast is with respect to the nominal balances Our assumption of lower oil import prices translates into a projected reduction in the value of US oil imports in 1998 and 1999 of about $7 billion a year compared with the November Greenbook Lower oil prices have only marginal effects on net exports in real terms, boosting real imports slightly  In total, the estimated drag from the external sector in the December Greenbook is about 09 percentage point over the four quarters of 1998 and 04 percentage point during 1999 As a rough approximation, the drag from net exports would be a bit less than half this amount in the absence of the effects of the Asian crisis and the weaker outlook for Japan and the yen, using the September Greenbook as the basis for comparison I would caution, however, that it becomes increasingly difficult to disentangle causes and effects in successive forecasts For example, in the case of effects that are transmitted through third countries, establishing the counterfactual assumption is problematic As an illustration, in the November and December Greenbooks, we've assumed progressively more moderate trajectories for monetary policies in the major foreign industrial countries as well as in the United States, and these assumptions have affected our thinking about the path for the dollar No doubt some, but probably not all, of these adjustments can and should be attributed to the generally weaker global outlook and in particular to the effects of the Asian crisis, but it is increasingly tenuous to try to separate out how much is due to developments in Asia and how much is due to other underlying factors    12/16/97  Some of the same qualifications apply to the interpretation of alternative scenarios For this meeting, we have updated and circulated to the Committee a ""worse case"" scenario for the global economy in which the already seriously affected Asian economies experience deeper and more prolonged recessions and less recovery in their real exchange rates In this scenario, the crisis also spreads in a major way to China and Hong Kong, and it impacts with greater ferocity on Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the countries in the area of the former Soviet Union On our assumptions, such a worse case would further reduce the growth rate of US real GDP by about a half percentage point next year and about a quarter point in 1999, compared with the Greenbook forecast, with comparable effects on other industrial economies An important qualification to this analysis is that it assumes that the authorities, in particular those in the major industrial countries, would respond under the hypothesized circumstances by taking appropriate countercylical actions, primarily in the area of monetary policy--that is, they would lower interest rates As I noted earlier, in preparing our Greenbook forecasts, we have already incorporated assumptions that go in this direction; we are no longer assuming much monetary tightening It is another matter, some might argue, to assume that policymakers will act aggressively and on a timely basis to damp a global slowdown in growth that is having differential effects on their economies Policymakers in Europe, preoccupied with the transition to monetary union, might be less than poised to take prompt, decisive action On the other hand, this alternative scenario is one that combines both lower inflation and lower growth, which would facilitate easing action, at least in the area of monetary policy  Although our revised worse case scenario is possible, and you might even see it in February as our base case, I do not believe at this point that this scenario is the most likely outcome No doubt, Asian financial markets and economies will continue to experience substantial downs and ups for some months, but my view of the situation is one of optimism combined with realism I am optimistic that the political leaders in Asia, on balance, are acting and will continue to act constructively to stabilize their economies and financial systems and that the support they receive from the international financial community will help to bridge the gap until confidence in their policies and underlying economies returns On the other hand, it is clear that the crisis is not over, and there is plenty of scope for additional errors or negative surprises  Mr Chairman, I will conclude our presentation on that note   I am never quite sure how to answer those questions about  probabilities, but I would guess a fifth or something like that How seriously should we take that  scenario? I would say moderately seriously This is not a meltdown scenario because it assumes  that action will be taken by others to prevent a meltdown   Yes, I think there is That's partly because we are in December and  this crisis has been going on for some time As Peter said, we have the sense of a flood rather  than a severe rainstorm The psychology is pretty gloomy, though one might say it has been  slightly less gloomy in the last couple of days It is slightly less so only with respect to Korea,  not with respect to any of the other countries But there is a scenario in which we could have a  rebound in that situation For example, their exchange rates could move back up in nominal  terms--we are assuming essentially that they will not--and the global economies could pick up  faster than we anticipate I think this scenario is equally likely, though I would argue that it is  not completely symmetrical I think a better case would be associated with a series of the right  policy steps in the right order, rather than two steps forward and one step back as is often the  case in these situations   No, I would say the better case has the same probability, but it  probably is not as good as the worse case is bad We have a somewhat skewed distribution in  that regard   That possibility certainly is incorporated in the worse case scenario  we have laid out, though the effect may not be as big as some would argue it could be Let me  go back to one of your premises Although there was a 40 percent adjustment in China's official  exchange rate in 1994, most of China's trade--some 80 percent of it--was already being  conducted at the unofficial exchange rate So, although the sign certainly was right, we, unlike  some commentators, do not think the depreciation was a major cause of all these developments  Moreover it came in early 1994, not in 1997 The Chinese financial system is very weak and has    12/16/97 17  many of the same problems, if not worse, as the financial systems in these other economies The  important difference is that the Chinese financial system is not as integrated into the world  financial system so it is not a major source of external weakness It may be a source of internal  weakness, but one can debate that point Clearly, it is not the same source of external weakness  that we find in some of these other countries  That having been said, there certainly is scope for continuing capital flight from  China I know some analysts, including colleagues on my staff, who estimate that capital flight  on the order of $10 billion a year probably is occurring today from Mainland China It is  disguised in the trade account and so forth and there are errors and omissions in the data There  certainly is plenty of money in that economy and there always are ways of getting it out, though  that may require some patience In my view, the Chinese authorities have taken a fairly  responsible and nuanced position to date with regard to the yuan In fact, at the meetings this  week in Kuala Lumpur they basically said that they were not going to devalue their exchange  rate, but they also indicated that they were not going to go out of their way to help neighboring  nations financially any more than they already were As you know, they have a fairly  comfortable international reserve position of well over $130 billion--the latest number that I  remember seeing So, there is a risk there Setting aside the Chairman's view about the  possibility of a downward limit to declines in other Asian exchange rates, which seems to be  right to me, there is a point at which the competitive pressures on China and the different  competitive pressures on Hong Kong would be felt Therefore, I think we cannot rule out the  possibility that that pair of dominoes, to use an old metaphor, could affect other Asian economies  and likely have a secondary ripple effect on the United States and other parts of the world That    12/16/97 18  is a risk, though if I were to assess the risks, I think there is a higher probability of a problem in  Brazil associated in the short run with a spread of the Asian disease and a lower probability of a  problem in Mainland China and Hong Kong   It is in this scenario; it just may not be in the outline that we sent to  you We assumed that the Hong Kong peg goes and, as I remember, that economic growth in  China drops from essentially 4 or 5 percent to zero or close to it next year and similarly in Hong  Kong That aspect of the scenario could be worse, if you want to put it that way, and in some  sense it is just illustrative of what would be happening Any of these developments could be  augmented by 25 or even 50 percent without much argument from me   This time we did it right; we did not call it ""worst!"" [Laughter] "
5916,1998-02-03," I sent a memorandum to the Committee containing the current  versions of the Foreign Currency Authorization, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the  Procedural Instructions No amendments are recommended The memorandum includes    2/3-4/98  a review of the warehousing authority, also with no proposed amendment of the current  arrangement of $5 billion I will answer any questions   The act of hedging would be an act of intervention   Once you hold the foreign exchange, you intervene when you  hedge it It is as if you had reversed the intervention that occurred when you purchased  the foreign exchange to begin with Hedging is an alternative to intervention, and it has    2/3-4/98  been considered on occasion A similar question is whether we could do all the  intervention in the forward market or the nondeliverable forward market I don't think  the Manager would recommend that   I think that is a very important point Although our unrealized  profits or losses get announced once in the summary report for the year and therefore that  is a big number, I think the policy that we have followed for some time now is to forward  our net earnings to the Treasury every week, if I am not mistaken   No, it has been in existence for some years The fact that we  make payments to the Treasury periodically through the year does reduce the political  dimension of this In some foreign countries such as Germany, the central bank makes a  payment once a year and the size and timing in and of itself is a political event Leaving  aside the comments that you made, which are perfectly reasonable, the fact that it is done  routinely in bits and pieces as the foreign exchange value of the dollar rises and falls  means that we essentially cushion it in terms of the political impact Perhaps to further  lower the impact we should not report it only in the annual statement   The effect on GDP would be 02 percentage point, I think   Yes Exports are 10 percent of GDP When they grow 2  percent faster, I think the answer would be 02 percent, roughly   I was at a meeting yesterday where there was a discussion of the  IMF's forecast for particular industrial nations and for the industrial world as a whole  With regard to the effect of Asian developments, I was struck in listening to the forecast  presented by Mike Mussa at the difficulty the IMF staff, too, was having because there  are a lot of things one has to disentangle before one can isolate the Asian effects On the  one hand, the IMF staff has less of an Asian effect on paper, but Mussa does not have  much influence over the individual analysts So, he is less able to force consistency    2/3-4/98  across the forecast than Karen has been He has a smaller change in the current account  balance for Asia but, on the basis of what he said, I think he actually would be closer than  his staff to what we have He gets numbers that are of the same order of magnitude The  one difference was that he was assuming the effects on Japan would all be offset by some  combination of exchange rate changes and other developments; precisely what he had in  mind was difficult to appraise because everything depends on one's starting point in  September He gets about the same effect as we do on North America and Europe, taken  together Like everyone else he had to guesstimate a multiplier there, and he had  estimates that were in the 3/4 percent range Ours is probably a little higher than that, but  it is well within the same ballpark However, his analysis produced a surprising number  for the Europeans at the table Both the French and Germans said it was a much bigger  number than they were thinking about and that is going to mark things down  One point that it seems to me is very misleading from an analytical standpoint is  that the Europeans always look at their growth rates on a year-over-year basis So,  year-over-year growth in Europe may be the same in 1998 as in 1997 because 1997 was a  good year, picking up toward the year-end But if we look at fourth quarter over fourth  quarter, we get something like a half percent markdown and that is essentially the half  percent that Karen was talking about because we used to have the same growth rate in  1998 as we had in 1997 The interesting thing will be to see how the disconnect gets  resolved in 1998 between what is actually happening in markets as opposed to 1998 being  as good a growth year as 1997 and incidentally how that will affect the mood in Europe,  in particular "
5942,1998-03-31," On that average, the dollar is about one percent higher than it was at  the time the Greenbook went to press "
5967,1998-05-19," Isn't this one instance, President McDonough, where that bank  paper is covered by the implicit guarantee of the government? Actually, the Bank of Japan itself  has substantial profits, so I think it could absorb sizable losses The first recourse might be that if a  bank failed, the creditors would be made whole by the government, as has happened in all the other  bank failures, and then the Bank of Japan would be made whole, too   I don't think it is insolvent!   I think it is fair to say that there are other mechanisms to take over  the really bad paper In some sense this occurs when they actually resolve institutions It's not  clear to me exactly what has happened when institutions that failed were taken over by one of these  resolution banking organizations That is where the bad debt of these resolved banks ends up,  although obviously some of it is on the Bank of Japan's balance sheet Actually, their advances  have gone up and down, which suggests that there have been mechanisms to delay some of that in  order to allow time to seek other arrangements The advances got quite large in certain periods, in  the fourth quarter in particular   With regard to your comment on exchange rates, President Poole,  we did look about a year or so ago at whether we would forecast better if we used expected forward  exchange rates and forward interest rates It gets a little complicated when we use non-G10  currencies by the way The answer is that we introduce more noise by using that than by using an    5/19/98  assumption built off independent assumptions for exchange rates and interest rates here and abroad  That is true partly because in the short run, over periods of a year or so, expectations about policy  movements or other developments move around so that a lot of noise is introduced into the  forecast I think we are better off with this arbitrary assumption rather than something that is  driven by market interpretation We are not a lot better off, by the way, but obviously the former  gives us a less good forecast "
5993,1998-06-30," The complications with Russia stem from the fact that it is important  to the United States politically and less important economically and financially It is much more  important economically and financially to our European colleagues The basic problem in  Russia is that although they have made better progress than I think many people might have  expected six or seven years ago, they also have a much longer way to go In particular, the  capacity of the country to generate revenues and the need for funds to meet the obligations of the  government have not been matched There is a real concern that the heavy involvement of  external funds in the financing of their government budget in recent years is building up a  mountain of debt that may be a problem But the crucial issue here is the capacity of the political  system in Russia to operate effectively  As far as financing is concerned, even leaving aside the operations that Peter Fisher  commented on, I do not have a sense that there is a strong likelihood of any bilateral financing,  though I wouldn't assign zero probability to anything at this point The more likely mechanisms  would involve the continued use of international financial institutions where, perhaps especially  in the Russian case, the multilateral approach through these institutions is probably helpful in  terms of blunting some of the political criticisms  The other comment I would make, which is a tribute to what has been accomplished in  part through the efforts of the Federal Reserve System over the years, is that I perceive a general    6/30-7/1/98  feeling now that the central bank is one of the strongest institutions in Russia It should be noted  that many features of the Federal Reserve System were built into the Central Bank of Russia  But as we know, central banks cannot do it all by themselves   It depends on which trade-weighted basis one uses It is a fact that  the yen has not depreciated as much on a broad trade-weighted basis--it has depreciated slightly  on that basis--as it obviously has against the dollar In fact, that is part of the argument But  having said that, as Peter Fisher pointed out in his reference to correlations, the problem is that to  the extent that the yen weakens further and the won, the rupiah, and the Thai baht all weaken  with it, it does not weaken relatively that much on a trade-weighted basis, but it does weaken  relative to dollar This is implicit in Peter Fisher's comments, and I would agree with that In  some sense, we have the chicken and the egg conundrum, but it is increasingly clear that Japan is  the heavy occupant of the boat, if I may mix my metaphors So, a lot depends on the health of  the Japanese economy, as President Broaddus pointed out  It also isn't clear on the other side that even if the yen depreciates, it is likely to  provide much net stimulus to the Japanese economy This is partly because it will not depreciate  that much on average, and it's not clear that the associated income effects among Japan's trading  partners in Asia will not overwhelm any yen price advantages relative to the dollar I would not  advocate a policy of letting the yen go, nor do I think the recent intervention was intended to  promote any stabilization of the yen Its purpose was at best to try to cause the markets to pause  and think a little about what the fundamentals might be saying There is some question, it seems  to me, on that score But the simple answer to your question is that the yen may be said to be  back to where it was, but it depends a bit on what you take as your reference point or index    6/30-7/1/98   Peter Hooper is right You are a little ahead of us in terms of  looking at the newspapers this morning The Greenbook as of the time it went to bed actually  had an implied monthly forecast through the end of the year that was almost the same as the  market futures There was a slight variation as we went out into 1998, but I think that was  largely a function of the market's adding some risk premium about uncertainties such as whether  Iraq will continue to produce and so forth That actually has been a feature of most of the recent  forecasts in the sense that we go with a point estimate of supply and the market has more of an    6/30-7/1/98  uncertainty band around it and therefore has a risk premium built into it after six months out  But through December as of the time the Greenbook went to bed, the forecasts were very close  More recently, as Peter said, we had the OPEC announcement on Tuesday and the current  market may now have a somewhat different interpretation than the one we assumed before we  learned about the OPEC decision   Governor Meyer, I think the problem here, if you want to put it in a  slightly different way, is that these Asian countries whose currencies have lost 30, 50, or 80  percent of their value and have negative growth rates of 20 percent of GDP present a challenge    6/30-7/1/98  for economics to explain Whether we talk about the functioning of the economy as working  through the financial markets or other dimensions of the confidence process, it is certainly a  reasonable proposition that we do not have to have simultaneous currency depreciations and  negative growth But it is also, I think, a reasonable proposition that this kind of accelerated free  fall of currencies more often than not is associated with declines in real GDP rather than  increases in real GDP Declines do not occur in all circumstances There was a depreciation of  sterling and the lira in the fall of 1992, and that was positive for European growth In the context  of a financial crisis, which Japan certainly is experiencing, it is hard to imagine that a  depreciation of the yen in the short run would actually improve growth in a substantial way   That comes from the 10-year bond yield   To come to that part of your question, it seems to me that two  aspects are involved One is that, as with everything else with Japan, it is difficult to tell In  particular, as you mentioned, part of the dimension of the disinflationary process has to do with  the current level of asset prices There, in particular, the asset price situation has not yet  stabilized, and in turn that is related in part to what they have not done and what they may be  unwilling to do to clean up their banking and financial system Therefore, we may have an  undervaluation in the yen relative to its long-run equilibrium, but that is in some sense my view  of what the Japanese have to do to deal with it  Your colleagues, who spent more time in Japan than I did, can comment on the fact  that Japan still has a remarkably prosperous economy, especially in Tokyo When we talk to  Japanese officials about their economy, they will tell us that if we look at the department stores  we will see a lot of customers; everybody is buying; everybody is well dressed It does not strike  an outside observer as an economy in a depressed state That may say more about whether  advanced industrial economies can sustain extended periods of no growth, which is not what we  have been used to assuming But given what Japan started from in terms of wealth and standard  of living, I think that in fact a large proportion of the Japanese economy can very easily sustain  extended periods of slow growth That, in turn, contributes to their lack of urgency in trying to  solve some of the fundamental problems associated with their banking and financial system "
6017,1998-08-18," I don't know either, but my guess would be that the fixing rate is a  rate at which people have agreed ex ante to settle certain contracts Ultimately, it should provide  some guidance, but it doesn't necessarily provide any in the short run The black market rate  presumably depends a bit on where you are and who you are and which black market you are  talking about--the foreign exchange kiosks outside the railway station or the large transactions I  think there is a big difference between those Over time, we could see a black market in Russia  that was very important in terms of its effects on import pricing and the inflation structure or one  that was of only minor significance because it would be the place where one might go to take    8/18/98  $100, not $100 million, out of the country The Russians have essentially brought their foreign  exchange and financial markets to a halt In time, as they announce what they are doing with the  GKOs and what they are doing with the 90-day suspension of debt repayments, one would think  that these things will come together For a while, though, I would assume there will be a number  of different rates depending on the nature of the underlying transactions I guess that's as far as I  would go, which is more words but less substance probably than Peter Fisher conveyed   Good!   They floated their exchange rate   They had a band before, but they were really operating with a heavily  guided, narrow interbank band However, they floated the ruble in a wide enough band that it is  trading, at least for the moment, within that band; it is not yet at the lower limit They announced  that they were going to restructure their internal official debt in the form of the GKOs, which are  obligations with maturities of less than one year, and their OFZs, their more than 1-year  obligations They announced a debt moratorium or suspension of controlled payments, and they  clarified that announcement slightly this morning to say what was included and what was not  They excluded debt to the EBRD, state and local debt, and some other categories   They have excluded foreign official obligations    8/18/98   Private-sector debt is subject to a form of temporary capital control   Yes, debt owed to foreign lenders The trouble is that the linkages are  quite high It is a little odd to read in the wires that Russian banks have borrowed abroad in order  to invest in GKOs, which are obligations denominated in rubles That is not exactly what one  normally would think would be the way so-called financial institutions should operate That has  led to a lot of problems and, of course, there has been a lot of financial engineering going on  relating to those transactions That has created a lawyers' paradise   Well, lots of laws, maybe no justice! [Laughter]   I think the answer to that question is ""yes"" They had lost about $5  billion in reserves, most of it in the last couple of weeks since their program was put in place It  was quite clear that the new program approved by the IMF on July 20 had not stabilized  confidence They were facing an external and internal financial crisis The only difference is that  they did it with $10 billion of actual foreign exchange reserves still in the bank rather than zero  One might argue that it is better to take such actions sooner rather than later   Yes Their dwindling reserves combined with the momentum in the  market last week did not, I think, give them much choice on Monday Both of their actions are  regrettable, as has been amply highlighted Abandoning the peg means, at least for the moment,  that they put in jeopardy the one success they have had on domestic inflation With regard to what  might be viewed as their internal defaults, I think that will be mostly a matter of restructuring and  refinancing their internal debts, though that process gives rise to some trepidation It is hoped that  there will not be a confiscatory refinancing in real terms, and in that sense one might argue that  they will just be leveling the playing field that is particularly oriented toward the domestic fiscal  problem Even making relatively modest assumptions about how much they have achieved on the  fiscal side, they have a primary surplus Their problem relates to the fact that they have  accumulated a lot of debt recently, and they have very high interest rates   Let me start with a few words about the June trade data that were released this morning The deficit was $142 billion compared with a downward revised $155 billion in May As readers of the footnotes in the Greenbook know, we put down an estimate for the June deficit that was somewhat larger than the one that was implicit in BEA's preliminary estimate of second-quarter GDP We had weaker exports of goods and services, stronger imports, and a deficit of $16 billion That deficit was similar to one of the consensus market reports and a bit higher than another, though both were above the BEA estimate In fact, exports declined further in June by about the magnitude that BEA assumed but by less than we had estimated The decline in imports was more than BEA assumed and substantially more than we estimated, suggesting perhaps a bit less strength in underlying domestic demand than we might have thought Despite this positive surprise, the effects of the Asian crisis on our trade balance are not over Our bilateral trade deficits with the Asian economies, including Japan, widened further in the second quarter Moreover, we had a decline in real exports of goods and services for a rare second quarter in a row The differences between the staff and BEA estimates for real net exports in Q2 from the now-published data merely reduce the deterioration from almost $60 billion--measured in chained 1992 dollars--to slightly less than $50 billion at an annual rate Our quick look at these data suggests that, taken alone, they would imply an upward revision of about half a percentage point to second-quarter growth However, there is likely to be a substantial offset in producers' durable equipment  To state the obvious, the June trade data do not alter the contour of our outlook for the external sector from the one we have presented for the last seven meetings continuing restraint on aggregate demand in the United States associated with very weak growth on average abroad and a strong dollar But we see some diminution in these trends Though it is difficult to imagine at times, growth abroad will eventually return to trend In our outlook, growth picks up next year, but it remains extraordinarily weak We believe that the modest pickup in foreign growth on average--with perhaps some associated modest uptick in interest rates abroad--the success of the euro's introduction, the stabilization of the Asian crisis, including importantly the situation in Japan, and the widening US current account deficit will be enough to bring about some decline in the dollar next year  As I am sure you can appreciate and as was amply demonstrated in Peter Fisher's report and by the discussion that followed it, we once again had to assemble a forecast against the background of substantial turbulence in global financial markets that has been associated with considerable uncertainty about    8/18/98  the course of policies and other developments in much of the rest of the world While most of the major industrial countries seem to be on solid growth paths, Japan is a glaring exception In fact, one might argue that the uncertainty about its prospects are indicative of the risks in the entire external forecast  So, let me say a few words about our outlook for Japan while staying away from the deflation debate I proceed from the assumption that Japan's downward spiral eventually will come to an end We have a bottom built into the forecast but not much of a recovery Four consecutive quarters of negative growth are projected to end this quarter For the remainder of the forecast period, Japanese growth averages less than one percent at an annual rate While net exports impart a small positive contribution to Japanese growth throughout the forecast period, that growth is driven almost entirely by government spending We have a swing in the structural budget deficit of 3/4 percentage point this year and a bit more than 1 percentage point next year, including a large dose of permanent personal and corporate tax cuts and some additional spending that is not yet on the plate of the Diet However, private domestic demand contracts through the middle of next year and is flat thereafter, even with substantial tax cuts Thus, we have at best the hint of a turnaround in Japan based on the assumption that the Japanese authorities will continue gradually to get their collective act together on fixing the banking system and the macro economy  For the developing countries in Asia, we have five quarters of negative growth extending into early 1999 and a modest recovery thereafter Our basic story is that external and internal financial conditions stabilize, recovery begins in the traded goods sector, confidence improves, and investment begins to pull out of its deep swoon, financed primarily from internal sources of funds--not by domestic banks  Outside of Asia, we have weakness in Latin America owing to the spillovers from Asia that add to investor caution and boost interest rates With slowing growth in Canada and the United Kingdom because of the rise in real interest rates in both countries, there is not enough growth in Euroland to provide much impetus to aggregate foreign growth  Weighted by US nonagricultural exports, the four-quarter growth of foreign GDP was less than 2 percent in the second quarter of this year and will have remained below that rate for six consecutive quarters ending in the third quarter of next year The only comparable period over the past thirty years was in 1982-83 By this metric, the Asian crisis and its surrounding events and aftermath are now projected to match the scale of the Latin American crisis in the early 1980s To review a bit of history, in that case the dollar continued to rise through early 1985--albeit with a different US fiscal-monetary mix--and our current account deficit peaked at 36 percent of GDP in 1987, the year in which our net international investment position turned negative In contrast, we    8/18/98  project that the current account deficit as a share of GDP will exceed the previous peak by early next year and that our net international investment position will be an estimated minus 20 percent of GDP  There are still considerable downside risks to the outlook, as illustrated by the material on the possible implications of recent Russian events that was circulated to the Committee late yesterday by Peter Hooper At the same time, there are some upside risks as well Without spelling them all out, let me just say that at some point our outlook for the external sector will be seen in hindsight to have been too pessimistic  Nevertheless, I suspect that the next cycle of external excitement will focus on our external position and the dollar The reason is that unless growth in the rest of the world comes roaring back, we are likely to see a continuing erosion of our external position from what is already a rather low base, and investors will see dollar depreciation as the only way to narrow the gap Moreover, we don't know how much of the recent strength of the dollar has been driven by safe-haven or risk-aversion considerations It is suggestive, I think, that the dollar did not rise against either the DM or the yen yesterday following the Russian announcements Once Japan and the rest of Asia stabilize, the air could come out of the dollar's balloon in a rush, and I could find myself in another location drafting vacuous statements about the excessive and unjustified weakness in the dollar  Mike Prell will now add his own perspective on the outlook   I would say a couple of things I think your sign is probably right I  believe the problems are still there; we still hear these reports The question is one of magnitude  It is fair to say that our imports have not increased as much as one might have thought as a result  of this crisis But we have to be a little careful about that conclusion because those imports have  held up in nominal terms and their prices clearly are down So, in real terms there has been an  increase in imports from Asia, though perhaps not as much as certain incentives would suggest  there could have been Therefore, it would seem to me that in time, one way or another, if the  incentive is there and remains, people will find a way around the obstacles and there will be  some upward impact on our imports On the other hand, to the extent that the growth of the US  market slows, not all of the higher Asian exports may be coming to the United States I find it is  quite interesting that the one area where we seem to have been about right in our forecasts is the  extent to which the swing in the trade position of the developing Asian countries has been shared  among importing countries Some considerable fraction has gone to Japan, notwithstanding its  own situation, and a considerable fraction to Europe as well Indeed, in line with some  comments at recent meetings, European domestic demand has been much stronger than we  expected before the crisis, and European net exports have been much weaker Thus, there has  been a parallelism in this situation   The answer to the first part of your question is that we have aggregate  price and aggregate quantity numbers The aggregate price numbers basically come from the BLS  survey of import prices There are problems with those import prices, and what we do is to take a  nominal total and deflate by an index at various levels of detail to get real figures The quality of  the price data is substantially better than it was 20 years ago We used to have something called  ""the unit value,"" which really would have led you to ask this question On the other hand, it also is  not clear what we are now getting with the price data or what question they are answering That's  because it is unclear what the relationship is between the price that is quoted on an invoice and    8/18/98  included in the index and the price at which the sale actually is made and embodied in aggregate  demand  The other point is exactly what I was trying to say in response to Bob Parry's question  We do have disaggregated price indices by area, and we can see what has happened to the price  index for the Asian countries That has declined dramatically You may then say that the nominal  amounts of our imports from them have been flat, so the increase in real imports has been  substantial I think the only point that we can make here is that we have a J-curve effect We  might have expected that J-curve effect to have run its course earlier I have not been able to look  at the detail of the numbers that came out today, but there have been stories, for example, relating  to some industrial supplies You probably have heard additional stories about iron and steel, for  example, some involving Korea The trouble is that we have a third factor, which is the general  weakness of commodity prices In fact, one of the surprises in the data that came in today was  that June exports and imports of industrial supplies were much less than we had anticipated I  asked the same question you are asking, is this shortfall nominal or is it real? The answer may be  some of both A lot of it may well be nominal, in which case real would be less The analysis is  very complicated The other thing you want to remember is that although conceptually we think  about exports and imports as being final demand, they are not Very few imports go directly from  the ship or the plane to the supermarket shelf As a result, the way they get imbedded in the  production and therefore the price structure is very complicated, and it probably has become more  complicated in recent years Just-in-time inventories, reduced transportation costs, and the  reduced weight in GDP which the Chairman likes to cite mean that the way these things get  integrated accounts for much less of GDP That is probably one of the reasons why simple rules  of thumb for exchange rate depreciation or exchange rate changes and inflation have tended to    8/18/98  break down Another reason may be that we are not talking about just two countries We are  talking about the increasing number of sources of imports to be traded, as in the Indonesia point  that you raised "
6060,1998-09-29," They never involved trade! Seriously, Peter did not mention the fact  that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is going to release its turnover survey today If we  go back and look at the first such survey many years ago, we find almost precisely the same low  number, namely something like 10 percent or 15 percent of all the financial transactions are  traceable to real transactions The multiplier essentially has been constant over the roughly 20  years that the Bank has been doing that survey I don't think there has been much change, at  least on the foreign exchange side One can assert that it is a Ponzi game, but I'm not sure it is a  bigger Ponzi game than it was 20 years ago   My impression of most of the work that has been done on this  subject over a long period of time is that volatility has not shown much trend in markets that are  well developed Of course, we may have episodes of high volatility and that is what Peter has  pointed out This is an episode in which we observe an extreme set of withdrawals from a large  number of markets But that does not say anything, it seems to me, about whether we are on a  new trend   These things, it seems to me, give us six years worth of information  and they are all off the charts   What can I say after all the talk and ink that has been spilled on international economic and financial developments since the Committee's August meeting? It occurred to me that the Committee's    9/29/98  ""central tendency"" preference might be that I should shut up and get out of here My so-called international friends have caused enough trouble, and you do not need any further explanations from me about the consequences of external developments for the US economy  On the other hand, you may have noticed that our forecast for the external sector of the US economy has weakened further, although it has not changed all that much from the one prepared for the August meeting, before the Russian authorities lost their game of roulette with the domestic and international financial markets and set off a global withdrawal from risk That may be surprising in light of the aforementioned spilled ink It is clear that our external forecast would have been different without the change in our assumption about US monetary policy and the calming influence, even before its delivery, of the Chairman's testimony last week  In brief, four factors have influenced our outlook for net exports in different directions Recent trade data have strengthened our near-term outlook Projected slower growth abroad and in the United States reduces both our exports and our imports, but the former is more important than the latter A slightly weaker dollar tends to strengthen our exports and weaken our imports  On the first factor, US trade data for June and July were stronger than we had anticipated, leading us to reduce slightly our estimate of the negative contribution of net exports over the four quarters of 1998 In the June data, imports were weaker than we expected; however, this weakness brought the second quarter as a whole more in line with our model estimates In both June and July data, we were surprised that exports, particularly of machinery, did not fall as much as we had expected In the Greenbook forecast, we carried some of that strength through into the remaining months of the quarter However, in light of the August report on shipments of capital goods that was released late last week and suggested weaker- than-expected PDE shipments in that month, we may well have overdone our cautious optimism On the other hand, there may well be some remaining residual seasonality that will boost fourth-quarter exports that we have not taken into account in our forecast  Turning to the second factor, our forecast for growth abroad, which was very weak to begin with, has been revised down again--by half a percentage point this year and three quarters of a point next year This is the major reason why we now are projecting no growth in real exports of goods and services between the second quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of next year, in contrast with the 2-1/4 percent growth in our previous forecast  In particular, for Latin America we have reduced growth by 1-1/2 and 2 percentage points this year and next, respectively, in reaction to the reduced access of countries in this region to credit in international capital markets    9/29/98  and to interest rates that have been elevated in defense of their currencies In particular, we have negative growth this year and next in Brazil and Venezuela, negative growth this year in Chile, and negative growth next year in Argentina We are assuming that Brazil will adopt a program that involves significant fiscal tightening and a depreciation of the Brazilian real with negative short-run effects on Brazilian growth, but our base assumption is that these adjustments will be relatively orderly and will not push the Argentine peso off its peg  With respect to Asia other than Japan, we have reduced slightly our already very weak outlook There are a few signs of a bottoming out of economic activity in Korea--ask the US steel industry--and Thailand, but not enough to lead us to alter our basic outlook  Turning to the industrial countries, we have not altered our basic view of the weak outlook in Japan We had anticipated the cut that occurred earlier this month in the Bank of Japan's target for the overnight rate The official release on second-quarter growth suggested that activity was not quite as weak as we expected, largely because of a sharper-than-anticipated decline in real imports We expect the third quarter to record a fourth consecutive negative quarter, in part because of delays in the implementation of the program of fiscal stimulus We now anticipate that more of the effects of that program will be felt in 1999  We have weakened our outlook for the other foreign G-7 countries more significantly in light of the deterioration of global financial conditions, spillovers from Russia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America, and in the case of Euroland, a stronger currency that has affected our outlook for Germany in particular This deterioration occurs despite significant changes in our assumptions about monetary policies in these economies In the United Kingdom, we now assume that interest rates will decline by 125 basis points by the end of 1999, to a level 150 basis points lower than we assumed in August In Canada, interest rates are assumed to decline in line with US rates, but with a longer lag and from the elevated level to which the Bank of Canada pushed them in late August In Euroland, we assume that short-term rates converge to the current German level by the end of the year and remain there through the end of the forecast period, in contrast to the assumption in the August Greenbook of a rise of 75 basis points over the course of 1999 We have not assumed that the outcome of the German election will affect policy or the economy during the forecast period; it remains to be seen if we will be right  With respect to monetary policy in Euroland, it is clear that right now euro-area central bankers do not want to lower interest rates below the current German level before the European system of central banks becomes operational on January 4, 1999 However, in considering how attitudes may change going forward, I found it instructive to consider how the outlook for    9/29/98  growth in Euroland has changed over the past 12 month  Using our own forecasts for the G-7 members of the Euro area as a proxy, our current forecast for growth over the four quarters of 1998 is lower than we thought it would be a year ago by three tenths in France, four tenths in Germany, and one percentage point in Italy Moreover, contrary to European protestations that the Asian crisis has had little effect on Europe, our estimate of the contribution of net exports is half a percentage point lower for Italy, 1-1/4 points lower in Germany, and 2-1/4 points lower in France As the Europeans have pointed out, they have had a positive surprise on domestic demand, leading to caution about monetary policy easing in Frankfurt--both at the Bundesbank and at the ECB Nevertheless, if the euro should appreciate against the dollar by more than the roughly 10 percent that we are projecting from the second quarter of this year to the fourth quarter of next year, we could well see a reduction in interest rates before we see an increase  With respect to my third factor, US economic activity, the downward revision to US growth, despite our changed assumption about US monetary policy, is the major factor behind our projection of somewhat slower growth of imports of goods and services  Fourth, the dollar has weakened a bit more than we expected over the intermeeting period, primarily against the major foreign currencies We expect the dollar to continue to decline on average during the forecast period, reaching roughly the same point by the end of 1999 in terms of our real 29-currency index as we had projected in the August Greenbook This forecast seems reasonable with respect to the major currencies, given the roughly parallel adjustment in our monetary policy assumptions here and abroad However, the slightly weaker dollar in the near term tends to strengthen our outlook for exports and weaken our outlook for imports a bit  The combined influence of these forces on our outlook for real net exports is to weaken it somewhat further, but not by a huge amount However, the risks over the forecast period as a whole remain skewed to the downside Moreover, in thinking about Federal Reserve policy in this context, the issue is not simply one of how developments in the rest of the world will affect us Under current circumstances, the size of the potential linkages from Federal Reserve actions or inactions to the rest of the world and back onto the US economy appears to have been magnified  Dave Stockton will complete our report   In preparing for this meeting, I looked back at the work that we did  on a worse case scenario late last year In one sense, we are close to the worse case, but it has  taken a different form The sense in which we are close is essentially in that the total impact on  the US economy is commensurate with it It has taken the form, however, of the deeper  recessions and problems in Asia including Japan and no spread to Latin America We had in our    9/29/98  worse case scenario a generalized spread to Latin America It is a little embarrassing to say so at  this time, but this proves the less than reliable nature of forecasting We had no growth in Asian  economies last year in our worse case scenario and also no growth in Latin America We now  have positive growth on average in Latin America and negative growth in the Asian economies  So, we are close to our worse case forecast, but we have a slightly different mix  I think that outcome also points to the second part of your question about where these  foreign economies are heading I probably should have said this in my oral presentation Our  outlook for Latin America is quite gloomy and is much gloomier than I think anyone will see in  other forecasts That may just be because we did ours three days ago, and most of the others you  have seen were done three weeks ago But as was pointed out in the Greenbook, we made a  rather modest adjustment I always find it easiest to think about current account deficits, at least  in terms of our own economy, by calibrating them on the basis of how large an adjustment in the  deficit goes with everything else that is happening in the economy It gives me a shorthand way  of assessing how big the impact is on the United States The answer there is that in our forecast  we only cut the current account deficits of Latin America in half from where we had them last  year We are still assuming that the major countries in Latin America can finance $30 billion  current account deficits rather than $60 billion deficits It is easy to envision, especially in light  of what has happened in Asia, that the number could be zero or a $30 billion surplus without any  stretch of the imagination I think that will be the next aspect of this  One other point about Asia is that our 1998 forecasts for China and Singapore are  about the same as they were earlier It is the affected economies in Asia that were much weaker  than we had them before But clearly in Latin America and, I think, in eastern Europe and  Russia--which are not as important to our economy as to the economies of Europe as I tried to    9/29/98  illustrate in my little story about our forecasts of the G-3 nati ns within Euroland--there clearly  has been a big impact  The interesting development is our forecast I did not go back and look at it, but I  believe our US forecast for 1998 even now is probably stronger than it was a year ago  Interestingly, our Euroland forecast is slightly weaker than we had it last September The Euro  area has taken a very large hit on the external side This suggests, I would think, that there is a  risk of some substantial cumulation on the downside Now, we could talk ourselves into being  too gloomy about these things   It is useful to think about worse case scenarios, but worse case  scenarios do not always come true Let me just end on that point   When we do these forecasts, there is a tendency to be at least slightly  conservative There are so many different scenarios that are possible for Brazil We took a sort  of average of what we felt was a reasonable set of scenarios in which we assumed that the  Brazilians basically have three problems they have a fiscal problem; they have a banking  problem; and they have a competitiveness problem We are assuming that these problems are all  somewhat interrelated If they address the fiscal problem that will be enough to avert a complete  loss of confidence Although the exchange rate may have to give, it may give in a way that  either is a discrete devaluation followed by a faster rate of crawl or simply a faster rate of crawl  so that by the end of the period, the real will be at a level that by one rule of thumb appears to be  sustainable One indicator suggests that the currency may be 15 percent overvalued So, the real  could get down to an acceptable level without too much of an adjustment  I'm not sure what you mean by drawing the line in the sand, unless you mean drawing  the line in the sand in terms of the exchange rate itself?   I think that is one of the problems with these situations Brazil has  an election on Sunday, so I don't imagine that the president of Brazil is going to say they are  about to devalue Nor do I think they want to devalue They actually may be considering a  widening of the band Setting a faster rate of crawl is not as much of a problem as a devaluation  They might want to talk themselves into that, maybe correctly It did seem likely to us as we  prepared our forecast that there would be a devaluation or some adjustment of their exchange  rate over the period But since we did not know when it was going to come, whether it was  going to come tomorrow or next week or the week after that or in January, and whether it was  going to be discrete or gradual, we put it in as being at the desired level a year from now We  drew a straight line between its pre- and post-devaluation levels so that it did not drift around  during the forecast period I think there are very sizable downside risks The worse the scenario,  the more likely obviously it could have ripple effects not just in Latin America but elsewhere   Yes, and that has been in our forecast On that point, we have  tended to be somewhat more optimistic all along That may not have been the case initially  when we probably had convergence at a higher level Fairly early on, however, we had  convergence at the relatively low French and German level and the beneficial effects of that on  the Euroland economies I don't want to minimize the actual problems that they have had  There are two groups of countries Italy, where the actual performance of the economy is not so  great, is lowering its interest rates One could argue that is not so bad, but that gets everyone  involved in the fiscal fights that they are having Then we have the other group of countries that    9/29/98  have higher interest rates because they want to pursue tighter monetary policies The question  then is, what about France and Germany? At the moment, there is no reason for them to panic,  and I'm not sure that I necessarily would panic In my view it is a little foolish to say that there  is no way one can imagine why they would need to lower interest rates In some sense, our  forecast does have them lowering interest rates It's just that by not having an increase in interest  rates associated with a boom condition in the wake of EMU, we now have them with unchanged  interest rates The rate differential in this forecast in some sense is not that much different than it  was in the last forecast   There is collateral but no margin   The off-balance-sheet presumably goes the same way as the balance  sheet "
6081,1998-10-15," I would note that, of course, we have no new real data on the external  sector New trade data are coming out next week for August, which seems like a long time ago  The dollar has weakened, particularly against the yen The positive news is that the weakness  has also pulled up some of the other Asian currencies I do not have a ready explanation for the  dollar's weakness against the yen It has weakened slightly against the European currencies  With regard to foreign economic activity, I would say that the information that has come  in over the last few weeks has been consistent with what we were saying That implies some  sense of a catch-up, if I may put it that way, with the somewhat weaker outlook that we had in  the September Greenbook There are nonetheless some small positive factors in my view The  fact that the IMF legislation is likely to be enacted means that there is one less shoe to drop We    10/15/98  got through the Brazilian elections The Japanese have passed some banking bills, but no one  knows quite how they are going to implement those bills And I think the recent international  meetings in Washington were somewhat of a reality check for our European friends  On the other hand, it is pretty clear that globally there is an increase in financial stresses  When we look at certain indicators of the kind that we look at for the US economy--they are not  as available abroad--they all show the same kinds of effects Although Brazil is through its  elections, it is not through the new economic program There is a question about the implications  of the German elections The international policy complexion of the new government leaves  some big question marks at this point But I don't think anything has basically changed in our  outlook We had a weak outlook, and I think the downside risks are still there "
