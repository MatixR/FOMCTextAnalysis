 Mr Chairman, I think the staff has done an unusually good job in describing the outlook, and I know Mike has done a very exceptional job in handling some very difficult questions I guess I come out pretty close to where Frank Morris is on this I think that the recent spate of statistics indicates that the economy is really beginning to strengthen quite a bit and a lot of that apparently is resulting from improved exports I would sort of discount the last figures we got from Census on the trade balance on the grounds that you have a lot of price increases of imported goods in there, and price increases on oil, and probably some anticipatory buying because of the oil problems and also because of protectionist legislation So, if this is true, then I think we could see some bigger figures than the staff is projecting We are approaching the end of the fifth year of economic expansion at a time when we would expect bottlenecks to begin to appear, and I think they are in some industries This is the kind of environment in which we could see wage and cost pressures begin to turn around from what we have been fortunate to have had in the immediate past, along with this further heightening of inflationary pressures and attendant upward pressure on long-term interest rates So, I think it's a situation where we have to increase the care with which we look at the situation; we're now in a different era from where we were a couple of months or so ago   As Bob Parry indicated, Mr Chairman, a number of us at the last meeting thought that we were probably going to have to let interest rates rise over the next 12 to 18 months if we were going to prevent this underlying rate of inflation from accelerating And it seems to me that this expectation is even more likely now, in view of the information that we have had since then At the same time, I am not exactly sure when it will be appropriate for us to take that action; but I believe that it will probably be sooner than I would  -28-    8/18/87 -29-  have thought at the time of the last meeting I am also well aware that the history of the System has been that, generally, we have not moved fast enough against inflation So, I tend to try to compensate for that Despite that, since there is a good deal of uncertainty out there, I believe the best case for now is to stick with alternative B I would make it asymmetrical with the "would" on the tightening side and the "might" on the other I think the Board staff's statement with regards to the "as well as" clause does suggest that it would be helpful to shift that around to deemphasize the borrowing side; as for the weakness of the dollar, that may deserve some further thought I think there is also another argument that we ought to put restraint of the business expansion high on that list if we are going to change the list around And I would not put in that sentence on the undershoot of the aggregates at all And I say this with the sneaking suspicion that later on down the road, I am going to look back and say, "I wish I had been where Jerry Corrigan and those others were"   Following up on Chairman Greenspan's comment, Peter, suppose that in the next maintenance period you do come in pretty close to $600 million and the market now expects $500 to $600 million Would you expect much rate movement if you got closer to that figure?   Mr Chairman, most of the comments have been directed at particular parts of the forecast My feeling the last time was that the economy would be somewhat stronger than the Greenbook was projecting, and the staff, indeed, have moved their forecast in that general direction So, we have very little quarrel with what they have done We think the main driving force is going to be an improvement in net exports of goods and services; and plant and equipment expenditures, particularly in the equipment area, also provide a pretty good push If we were to guess, we would say the risk might still be that the forecast is a little low But really what bothers us, I guess, is the feeling that they might be right on this forecast In saying that, I'm focusing on the inflation rate that they are projecting for next year--when it goes up to 4-1/2 percent I think we ought to be able to do better than that for next year, and we ought to target something less than that A 4-1/2 percent inflation rate could easily become 5 percent; and 5 percent is not really reasonable price stability So, rather than thinking they may have overestimated, we're afraid that they might be about right and have come up with some results that are a little too strong on the price side   Mr Chairman, I'm afraid I owe some apology for having discussed my thoughts on the state of the US economy at a time you wanted to consign to questions So let me just address that last question you posed as best I can, which is not very well I think you have to look at the negative correlation we have had between exchange rates and long-term interest rates since the fall of 1986 to get an answer to that There are three possible explanations one is that this has resulted from still a third factor, which is the rise in inflationary expectations A second--and maybe the most popular explanation of it--is that this decline in the dollar rate has been a decline in the real rate because of the persistently larger trade deficits that we have had, and fears that this will be reflected in higher import prices, which also will spill over into the prices of goods from those industries that compete with imports And the third explanation is that the rates may be high because the market is responding to what it thinks we are likely to do; but if that is the case, tightening would clearly be inappropriate because that would mean, I think, that a large part of that was real My impression has been that there really hasn't been that much response at the long end  -23-    9/22/87  to actions that we have taken For example, the response to what I thought was a very strong statement via the discount rate increase and also the raising of the borrowed reserve level was big at the short end; but we didn't really have all that much response at the long end So, that suggests to me that some part of this is probably real I guess I would end up with a view along the lines that Jerry first outlined, and some others have endorsed, that part of this is real and part of this is inflationary expectations I don't know what the mix is and I guess nobody else does But, I believe both factors are at work, I'm afraid   I do too   Mr Chairman, you might think in view of how I stressed the unacceptability of the forecast for next year that I would be advocating "C" as Bob Parry did, but I really think the steps we have taken already have been pretty strong In fact, we haven't even implemented all we agreed to do last time, so I would not favor anything beyond "B", particularly since I think that there has been a rise in real rates Also, we have had pretty subdued behavior on the part of the aggregates But I wouldn't want the symmetrical part of it because I just don't see the likelihood that we would want to ease during this period As a general rule, I'd rather it be symmetrical because I don't think we usually know; but I think something would be read into it if we eliminated the asymmetry this time   Could we rephrase that and say we did not change policy rather than we did nothing?   There's a constitutional basis for that position   Mike, with businesses having become so much leaner and meaner in recent years and increasingly willing to bring about permanent layoffs and temporary layoffs, some of our contacts have been telling us that if the downturn does intensify, they would expect the unemployment rate to jump pretty sharply because of this changing attitude on the part of businesses Does that seem reasonable to you? If so, have you factored it into these high unemployment rates that you are projecting here?   I agree pretty much with your forecast It just struck me as an interesting thought, since business people seem to feel that they will not hesitate this time like they sometimes have in the past   It is interesting that they got so much leaner with such a big rise too in the participation rate in the labor force It seems to have happened   He may see some jumps of other types too   This seems to be a day of confessions, Mr Chairman, and I will have to join those who confess that they don't have much confidence in their own projections I have less now than I typically do, of course, which is saying that I don't have a great deal We have these two elements of uncertainty to be sure first, we don't know what the impact of the decline that has occurred in the stock market thus far is going to be; second and more importantly, we don't know how much further domestic and foreign markets may decline And I don't think a further decline is a risk we can completely rule out So, the uncertainty level is extremely high But we don't know the answers to these questions Assuming that the market settles down somewhere in the 1900-2100 range, I think the staff's forecast is pretty reasonable; I don't think we could improve on that a great deal That seems to be what the business people in our District feel; at least that's what we have been able to uncover up until now But I do think there's a lot of risk in this, regardless of where you come out It is clear to me that there has been a big blow to inflation and to inflationary expectations in the short run from this But if the decline turns out to be as moderate as the staff has projected, and as we have endorsed, I don't think it's unreasonable to suppose that by the middle or last half of next year the same kind of worries that we had on the inflation front earlier might reemerge And I think that we ought to have that in mind as a definite possibility as we address what we do in the immediate future, because the effects of actions we take now are going to be felt down the road, and we ought to be well aware that that possibility is at least out there   I think the point at which you arrive has to be dependent in part on what you think really happened to the stock market whether it came from real shocks or liquidity shocks or some combination I lean to the view that it was more real, along the lines of what Frank Morris was describing earlier, in that the earnings-price ratios had gotten totally out of line with the bond yield And then there were a couple of sparks that set it off the problems in the Persian Gulf and the likelihood that we were going to enact some very severe protectionist legislation At the same time, I think there were liquidity shocks once this happened And I think we met those liquidity shocks, as we ought to in such a case, when we issued a statement that we would provide liquidity But as far as these real shocks are concerned, I don't think there's a lot that we can do about that through policy So, I would come out, I think, right where you did on this, Mr Chairman And like Ed Boehne, I would look through the borrowing to the federal funds rate and [seek a rate] of around 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent, which I had interpreted as being a little on the easy side of "B" as it was written in the Bluebook, but which you now have convinced me is really what you had in mind In view of the way in which this directive is going to be dissected, I think it would be good to go with Variant I But there are a couple of references in there that would bother me and might confuse the market If you look at the references to greater flexibility on lines 105 and 106 of the draft that was distributed with the brown cover, that need for greater flexibility, I think, could be a little confusing to the market It isn't clear to me what it means and I don't think it would be clear to the market I would hasten to add that this reference to our intention to ensure adequate liquidity is perfectly clear to me and I think it's obviously appropriate So, on the wording of this, I would tend to end up the same way Governor Angell did in saying somewhat lesser restraint "would" and slightly greater restraint "might"   It is something we don't have a lot of control over   Mr Chairman, I don't think it's all that different from what we have, in fact, done We have had this wide range but it has been understood that we have had a borrowing number that was associated with a much narrower federal funds range And we didn't change that [sentence] then I think we probably would have met and changed that borrowing level or changed it without meeting   You can say way back when they--   Mr Chairman, I'm glad that you raised this issue because I share a lot of these frustrations that Manley has voiced I have thought for some time that we were having a problem with choosing a borrowed reserve level and getting what we wanted in the way of federal funds behavior A lot of unexpected behavior is short-lived and doesn't really have much impact But frequently, the deviations  -11-    3/29/88  are rather long and rather large; and in effect, I think they end up changing the stance of monetary policy that the Committee wants and misleading the market, too As Manley stated very well, I think the federal funds rate is the most important thing in determining the demand for money and the behavior of the aggregates over time And I think that the Committee has been confused by this, because at times we've gotten federal funds rates that were not what we'd expected at all and that has led to some misunderstanding For example, at the last meeting we had some discussion about what had transpired in the previous meeting  Now, there are a couple of arguments that have been advanced in favor of borrowed-reserve targeting The first of these is that you can get movements in anticipation of where we should go that are generated on the part of the market We've looked at that fairly closely and sometimes this happens; but it just doesn't look to us as if the empirical evidence is really overwhelming on that You certainly can find a number of instances--Manley cited some, and there are others--where the market has moved the federal funds rate in a way that we didn't want it to move The Continental situation and right before the October 19th crash, I think, are two notable examples So, I don't think that argument holds a lot of water But I think the important argument, and really the reason why we went to this procedure, was basically a political one We were afraid that we could not move the federal funds rate as much as we really felt we ought to, unless we obfuscated in some way We're not really moving the federal funds rate, we're targeting reserves and the markets have driven the funds rate up That may have had some validity at the time, and I had some sympathy for it But as time goes on, I've become more and more concerned about a procedure that really involves trying to fool the public and the Congress and the markets, and at times fooling ourselves in the process  What I'd like to suggest, if we have time for it, is an alternative procedure that might conceivably be satisfactory for both sides The procedure would be to establish a band for the federal funds rate, let's say a weekly average of 50 basis points, that would be understood to be the range in which we would operate during the intermeeting period The beginning point would be the midpoint of that, but the Desk, in consultation with you, Mr Chairman, would have the freedom to move anywhere within that 50-point range This would give us some leeway for market forces to work And it could be understood that if the federal funds rate moved out of this range, then there would be consultation with the Committee I think that this would be very clear to all of us and that it would work much better, because now we sometimes get federal funds rates that we didn't vote for and didn't want So, I think a move in that direction would be very helpful and clearly would be more honest I would hate to have to defend what we have been doing on the grounds that, in a sense, we really don't want people to know what we are up to I'd rather stand up, as Manley says, like a man, and do what we have to do But I do understand the other argument, because in '79, I'm sure we would not have gotten some people to vote for the new procedure if they had not thought that it provided a cover for doing something they didn't think that they could get away with I've heard members of the Committee state that So it's not something to disregard lightly; but I think that our long-term credibility can be damaged if we use that as a cover-up for what we're really doing  -12-    3/29/88   I think that it was the very hot political environment that made us reluctant to do that You know, interest rates were getting pretty high about that time There was a lot of pressure on us and we knew that we had to do something And we had to make it palatable so we didn't get shot out of the water as soon as we began to move I think--I don't know if others would agree--that's why we did it at that time I thought that we would end up targeting the money supply; but I think most of the people in the room really thought it was a way that they could get the federal funds rate up more than they otherwise could get away with, in that kind of highly charged political environment That's the way that I read it I don't know; Jerry or some of the others who were here might see it somewhat differently   I think you can argue that, for some people, it's a little easier to move the borrowing target I argued as you did I don't think we ought to do that But I do think that some people would be more likely to move at the point in the cycle in which we usually make our worst mistakes [unintelligible] cycle   I mentioned it   Mr Chairman, I think maybe I ought to clarify some of my statements I would like to say, first of all, that I'm very sympathetic to what Governor Angell had to say that what we really ought to do is control the supply of reserves in such a manner that we control whatever monetary aggregate is going to determine the level of prices over the long run I don't think we can really, in the long run, control real variables; all we can control are nominal ones I think the objective ought to be stable prices And that's the way I would want to do it If we ever get to that millennium, I think that required reserves are probably going to be the best target for us against whatever aggregate we settle on And I wouldn't want any bands on the federal funds range at all; I would want that to be free to move enough to allow us to hit that target What I was talking about earlier was this interim period where the demand for money has been unstable and our present procedures call for us to try to gauge the dimensions of the demand for money and set the operating variable that will best give us the kind of results we want And I think that's the federal funds rate  So far as this issue of discretion is concerned, I did not mean to take away your flexibility I was trying to suggest a band that was reasonable--that would be agreeable to the whole Committee as an operating range within which you could adjust the rate I'd like to use the whole band--that 50-basis-point-average range that I talked about--and just have some understanding that if we went beyond that, you would consult with the Committee There was some discussion, as you remember, at the last meeting that maybe we shouldn't have changed the borrowed reserve target without consultation I didn't hold that view, but some did And I thought it was important that we reach some agreement on when there would be a consultation and that's the reason I suggested it But, basically, I don't want to do this over the long run with the federal funds rate at all I want to do it with reserves, somehow measured, if we can get back to a more rational financial [unintelligible] So, that's where I come out My recommendation applies only to the interim period that we're in, and if I thought that this would prevent our going back to [reserve targeting]--Lee, as you said--let me change my position   Let me change my position because I want to get, I think, where you want to get And if this would jeopardize that, then I've made a bad mistake   I know; traditionally, it has been very long   Is that your entire statement, Roger?   Say that again   I think these upward revisions that the staff has made are perfectly appropriate, Mr Chairman, in light of the data we have gotten since the last meeting I keep thinking about a remark someone made then about how nice it would be if we could hold onto these things--the low unemployment and the rate of growth for the sixth and now the seventh year of expansion--still without much pickup in prices I'd buy that scenario any time and I guess a lot of other people would too I suppose some people might think that this is a rather rosy scenario, but I really think the danger lies on the other side that we may get too much strength in the economy, more than we now anticipate, and this might stimulate a sharp increase in inflationary expectations with the predictable fallouts on the dollar and US interest rates And I believe that that is a risk we can do something about with monetary policy I think we ought to be concerned about it, and in that connection, I would be getting a little concerned about the strength in the aggregates I would really be concerned if that continues for another month or so in the face of apparent strength in the economy I am not yet suggesting that the aggregates have gotten to the point where we ought to place as much emphasis on them as we did a few years ago, but I think they now may be giving us better information about the economy than they were a while back I think it would be wise to pay a little more attention to them than to try to appraise the strength of the business outlook as we have been doing the last several months   Mr Chairman, I think the staff has made an excellent case in its forecast for an early move It's true we have made a couple of moves recently, and I think they have been timely and very appropriate But I remember so many times sitting around this table when this was the apparent stage of a business cycle where traditionally we have made our largest mistakes So I think we ought to move now I think you've given us wise counsel in suggesting we hold that $100 million increase in the borrowed reserve figure; and I would buy that, with an asymmetric directive I'd like to get rid of that language about the unusual flexibility I think that's unduly fuzzy and just confuses people And I'd like to keep open that option that we would go the other $100 million if, after two or three weeks, it looks as if we need to In short, "B"   Initially; maintain initially   Mr Chairman, could I ask for some estimate of the length of time before we move?   At the most?   That's right  -14-    5/17/88   You haven't ruled out the $200 million, have you?   No, but I mean over time, after you've moved the $100 million, if these contingencies--   That's the point I was making   Mr Chairman? I have one question Did we mean to have maintain initially? We talked about that and I thought we sort of--  -17-    5/17/88   It was; but it wasn't when Norm read it   He did?   Well, I missed that one, too I'm sorry, Norm   Oh! You had it in a different place; that's why I couldn't find it I'm sorry--I was looking for it down near the "maintain"   Mr Chairman, I have a lot of sympathy with what Tom is trying to do because I think his ultimate objective is to achieve price stability I don't know how this Committee would vote on that, but I remember several years ago Chairman Volcker asked us what we thought the objective was and half of us voted for price stability alone; half voted the other way; and he didn't vote and didn't break the tie But I think that is the ultimate objective, and I hear more and more people around here saying that And I think Tom is trying to create a constraint that will make us really work toward that objective and not lose sight of it But my problem with it is that even though he thinks this is a constraint, I believe, in practice, that it really might end up being used like a target And our analysis, like Bob Parry's, suggests that M2 is really better for this in the sense of predicting the level of long-run inflation And that, I think, is the thing we really ought to look at, rather than how well it predicts nominal GNP, since I don't think we can peg real variables over the long run All we can do is affect the price level So, what I would like to do is to carry the thing a step further than Tom has, and suggest we think about using total reserves and nonborrowed reserves, or something of that sort, as an operating instrument What we have now is very akin to using free reserves, which has been fraught with problems the whole time I know that there are some institutional changes that will improve this--you could get rid of the reserve requirements against interbank deposits, [unintelligible] deposits, nonpersonal deposits, all those things You could have a penalty discount rate All those things could be done, assuming you can get the legislation for some of them In any event, if we could work in that direction, then I think we'd have something that would really be very useful to us Of course, one of the things we would want to analyze is what this might do to short- term market rates, and I don't think we have a good handle on that Most people think they would fluctuate a lot more; my instincts tell me that the private market would take care of that And, even if they fluctuated more, I don't believe that would be transmitted to long- term rates to the extent that most people seem to be assuming In any case, if we could use this as an operating variable instead of borrowed reserves, or the federal funds rate, or whatever people think it is we're using, I think it would be a very efficient way to try to achieve the very thing that Tom is advocating Now, if it came down to a vote as to whether to do what he suggested or not do it, I would say do what he has suggested I'd like to take it further than that, but I think it's better than what we now have, because it is a constraint And we really don't have many constraints now, given our willingness to violate our target ranges on an ad hoc, judgmental,  -24-    5/17/88  basis And I'd like a little more of a rule in there, a little more of a road map than we have, to the extent we can do it   Even if you could find a perfect rule, I doubt the Committee would vote for it, because it's so much more fun making ad hoc decisions every time   I mean I'm assuming away that problem; I still think we would vote for discretion   But, at a minimum, you have to tell the [Congressional] Committee next time in the Humphrey-Hawkins [testimony] that we have either rejected it, or we are looking at it and have not yet decided whether to accept it   I think you're right, Mr Chairman; that's the way I viewed it I tried to take it a little farther in the direction that I thought it ought to go, which nobody else will agree with except maybe Tom Melzer and Lee Hoskins I think that can be very productive   I would like to see us use multiple-year targets, if we can ever get to the point that we could agree on that I think it's an exciting step   I don't--not in the long run I think it's the best predictor of inflation of any of the aggregates we have now   It hasn't been too far from that   You want to implicate us!   If you can predict the prices, do you need to predict the interest rates?   I don't always understand these things, but weakly I'd suggest that it is a pretty darn good predictor of the price level   Very large   Was there any revision to the number for the previous month?  SPEAKER(?) Yes    8/16/88   Mr Chairman, I was just going to ask Ted Have you redone your projections of net exports since you got the Census merchandise trade figures?   This figure for net exports for, say, the fourth quarter of 1989 would not be very far off from $472 billion then?   Mr Chairman, I share Frank Morris's appreciation of the staff's efforts to give us some drought-adjusted figures for the GNP for the projection period Obviously, that drought has been a severe blow to a lot of parts of the country, but there's really nothing that monetary policy can do in the short run to deal with that So, I think we need to focus on these drought-adjusted figures in trying to plan the course of monetary policy These figures show GNP, after a bulge in this quarter, working down on a drought-adjusted basis to around 2 percent in the early part of next year That seems to me--in light of the tightness in labor markets and the higher levels of capacity in a lot of key industries--to be about as fast as we would want GNP to grow at this stage  I'm not quite as optimistic as Ed Boehne was--and I gather, probably Martha--that on the basis of these variable rates on consumer loans, consumption will slow down as much as the staff has guessed They've got 13 percent throughout each quarter of 1989 If I had to guess, I would think it's probably going to run higher than that-- although that would certainly be a desirable rate, in view of the necessity of getting that down to the point that we can accommodate an improvement in our balance of payments  What really bothers me most, I think, is what bothers most of the others; that despite all this tightening that we have done up until now, and the staff's projection of considerably more tightening beyond this, we've still got pretty big increases in inflation projected For example, the CPI less food and energy is rising at over a 5 percent rate at the end of next year, and much the same sort of thing is true for the fixed-weight GNP deflator, which is close to  -18-    8/16/88  4-1/2 percent These may be too high, I don't know, but they certainly seem reasonable to me, given the upward pressure on wages and employment costs that are now becoming increasingly apparent And what this means to me is that we still have a serious inflation threat facing us And if we have projected inflation at less than it actually turns out to be, then that's going to cross, I think, a pretty important threshhold in terms of what it would do to inflationary expectations And I think that could be very serious indeed So I hope we can hold it down some--at least as low as the staff is projecting And I would like to think we can do better than that   I can explain that, Martha   One of us is really--   Mr Chairman, I think I share Lee's objective of getting back to the point, if we ever can do this, where we can really control this supply of reserves--somehow measured--so as to control  -31-    8/16/88  the rate of growth of the money supply To put it I guess a bit unkindly, it seems to me that what we do now really is sort of a modern-day version of the real bills doctrine, in a sense The market gets all the money it wants at some price or some borrowed reserve level If it wants more, we pump out the reserves and we say the demand for money has increased If it wants less, we sop up reserves and say the demand for money has declined If we want to nudge it one way or another, through either the borrowed reserve target or through manipulating the federal funds rate, we change the price of money--in much the way the discount rate used to function under the old real bills doctrine So I really don't see that it's much different from that  But, given the uncertainties that people feel exist in the aggregates at the present time, I think I would come out a little different from where Lee does on which of the various alternatives we should use I would use the federal funds rate I think we are confusing the public, we are confusing ourselves, and we are confusing the boards of directors by going through the borrowed reserve target And in recent days, we've been resolving all doubts in favor of the federal funds rate, and I would prefer to just use that federal funds rate as long as we are on this kind of regime But I think at some point the aggregates are going to behave in a more normal, predictable, way and we can reduce this degree of fine tuning that we've been following And only then will I feel very comfortable with any policy decision Now we have to pick out a level of interest rates somehow defined, and predict what will happen The way I do that is to figure out what I think it is on an ad hoc basis and then I bear in mind that most of our mistakes I think have been on the side of being too easy, historically So I put in a fudge factor and vote for something a little tighter than I think it probably ought to be on the ground that that's the way we usually miss But I do hope our simulations suggest M2 is beginning to behave reasonably normally now; Don verified that to some degree And I hope somewhere along the way we can get to the point that we are really controlling the supply of money rather than letting it be purely demand determined   It has been very good really Wayne said a while ago he was taking considerable comfort in M2; and I was taking a lot of comfort in that, too, until Don pointed out that it was the RPs and the Eurodollars that were weak The consumer-type components of M2 were relatively strong, so that reduced my degree of comfort Still, that's something that makes me feel better than I otherwise would because they've been--   He can do that to people   That's basically a political argument   It's a political argument, though, and I think that's the strongest argument that Ed has made for the borrowing target And I think that's why we stuck with it   I think [unintelligible] moves it, so be it   This is not the only issue that has ever been discussed three times   Mr Chairman, a while ago I commended Mike Prell and his associates for producing drought-adjusted figures on GNP I would like, with equal vigor, to commend Don Kohn for producing an asymmetric Bluebook I agree completely with what you said on policy, and a willingness to act further if the need should arise I also agree with your statement that it might well happen that we will need "C" next month [If that's the case,] I would hope we would have an intermeeting telephone conference like we've had And finally, I would agree completely with Governor Angell's suggestion that we move the aggregates up to number one, which probably doesn't come as a great surprise to some in this room   Mike, could you give us some of the details of the revision in GNP, including the deflator and the fixed-weight deflator   Do you know which components of GNP were revised down?   What did you do to it? Did you take care of that place?   Another problem for him; he can [profit?] from that   Mr Chairman, I think every point I wanted to make has been made by someone--but some by one person and some by another Let me just summarize briefly We agree very closely with what the staff has suggested in the Greenbook We see the same signs of moderation, partly because of the employment figures and other national figures, and also because of the grass-roots reports that we've getting from our directors, particularly in textiles and furniture  But I'm glad to see this, because I thought the economy was growing way, way too fast and the risks were all on the upside This suggests that maybe they're less on the upside now than they were before But like most of those who have spoken, I still think that the risks definitely are skewed more towards the upside and that there's a danger that the economy might overheat These figures showing moderation have been around for only a month or two at most, and apart from housing, there are no real large parts of the GNP accounts or significant sectors that show any signs of a great or sustained weakness  And then, if you look at the figures in section II of the Greenbook, they show that there is some upward pressure on both wages and prices Mike has just reported that the figures on the implicit price deflator and the fixed-weight deflator for the second quarter were worse than we thought they were, based on the initial reports So in short, while I feel a little bit better than I did before, because there are some signs of slowing, I don't think we're out of the woods yet And I would think that the staff's prognostication that somewhere down the line we'll need to tighten further is probably still right, although now might not be the time to do that   Mr Chairman, I agree with your position too The only thing I would add to it is that these rates of inflation projected by the Board's staff, as indexed by the fixed-weight deflator, are way too high So, I wouldn't be completely satisfied with that outlook, although that may be the most it's reasonable to expect I would go right down the line with you on it   Except that the fixed-weight did hit 5 percent last quarter   We had doughnuts, I know that   I think you take it the wrong way It's the other three of us!   Well, Mr Chairman, I guess like you are not surprised by what Jerry Corrigan said, you probably won't be surprised by what I say either I like this paper very much because I think it    11/1/88  has very important implications about how we ought to conduct our long-run policy The main thing the evidence says to me is the same thing I think it said to all of you--namely, that we can control prices over the long run by controlling M2 It also suggests that there has not been in the last 30 years or so enough of a permanent shift in demand for money that that would have been troublesome Now, of course, it does point out that we might have shifts in money over time for which we'd have to allow, but I don't think that really negates the basic conclusion that we can control the price level over the long run while targeting the M2 The idea of controlling inflation in this manner obviously is not a new one, but the evidence given in this paper I think makes it pretty dramatic and gives it added support  I think all of this really raises some fundamental questions about our current long-run strategy Obtaining long-run price stability is clearly one of the preeminent goals of monetary policy; I would say it is the goal of monetary policy We frequently state this in our public statements, and yet there's nothing really in our current set of procedures that ensures that we are really going to target M2 or any other aggregate over the long run It's true that we announce that we have targets for these aggregates, but we don't hit those targets a lot of time And we allow base drift to come in, and so there's no assurance in our present procedures that M2 is going to grow at a rate that will be compatible over the long run with price stability--over 2, 3, 4, 5 years, or whatever you want to target on I've been dissatisfied with this procedure for a long time, and I think there are some other members who have been somewhat uncomfortable with it, too The staff paper provides impressive evidence that we really can control price stability in the long run by controlling M2, if we just change our procedures to ensure that we keep our long-run M2 [unintelligible] And I'd like to make one further observation about section 6 of the staff paper which explores the long-run dynamic characteristics of the price gap equation The analysis in this section suggests that if we fix the M2 growth at a constant rate, the price level [fluctuation] would remain pretty wide around the equilibrium level for many years before stabilizing the--   Yes, that's right! And this is very discouraging more so to me than to you, Manley, because I'm an old man I'm going to be on a fixed income in four years We have to wait until our grandchildren to see this price stability   Yes, our great grandchildren I haven't even gotten my first grandchild yet, but do have one coming in January in case any of you are interested! I think it needs to be emphasized that this particular analysis deals only with the special case where there is a stable rate of growth in the money supply I think it's reasonable to suppose that we could have some kind of reactive mechanism that would bring this under better control and damp these oscillations We had one of a sort when we were targeting nonborrowed reserves If there was an overshoot in the aggregates [under that sort of targeting] we made the banks borrow half of that overshoot And that was an automatic mechanism There are others that obviously    11/1/88  could be used I would also draw the opposite conclusion from the Lucas critique on this and say that intuitively I think if you had a stable rate of growth in money supply over this 30 years, that you would not have changed the structure of the models So, if you targeted a stable rate of growth after that you would have had less in the way of oscillations this produced because these are two very different regimes and that is the issue to which I think the Lucas critique was addressed I've said too much, Mr Chairman, but I surely like what the staff is doing I would not go quite so far as one of my colleagues and say the first eight pages represent the best work the staff has ever done because I think it has done a lot of other awfully good work, too   There's a problem with that!   But not necessarily   Mr Chairman, I have a lot of sympathy with the view that Lee Hoskins expressed I have had some reservations about  -17-    11/1/88  these swaps ever since we entered into them It's not that I'm all that opposed to smoothing operations but I felt that they might delay our dealing with some fundamental problems by covering them up for a while I think it is important to note that foreign affairs are basically an Administration function and the Treasury has primacy in this area And even if we philosophically don't agree with the kind of intervention we've done--and I think we pretty well [have expressed that] disagreement--we would have to yield to the Treasury on this, just as monetary policy is a function that Congress has delegated the Federal Reserve and the Treasury shouldn't be telling us what to do in those areas   The last two firms would meet all these tests?   There have been very few changes in the Greenbook projections this time from last time, and we agree pretty broadly with that and think they are pretty closely on target It seems clear that there has been a slowing in real activity--or there was in the third quarter--and I think it's reasonable to suppose that, on a drought- adjusted basis, the economy will grow more slowly next year than it has this year At the same time, I think the risks are on the upside but I think they've got a pretty good forecast I wouldn't be quite as sure about the risks on the upside as Frank Morris, but I'd be more or less about where Ed Boehne came out on both the level of output and prices   Well, it's been the day to do things   Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation, too I'm very sympathetic to what Tom Melzer has said, though We can probably explain the weakness in the aggregates, and the early increases in short-term rates up to this point, but next meeting I will be in favor of a symmetric directive if the weakness in money continues for another month For now, I would agree completely with what you recommended   Mr Chairman, the Greenbook projections look quite reasonable to us Until very recently we had thought that they were underestimating the amount of economic growth we would have in the economy But at this point I guess we think the risk of error is about equal on both sides of that This change in our view is not the result of what we see in the Greenbook or the Beigebook or what we pick up in the way of anecdotal information To us those sources suggest--if you allow for some downtick in some of the monthly statistics in February because of that temporary weather-induced burst in January and also allow for the sluggishness recently in automobile sales, which may prove to be temporary--that the economy looks pretty strong What makes us think that the risks really have shifted is that we have taken, we think, some pretty significant policy moves in recent weeks and months The federal funds rate is up about 3-1/2 percentage points over a pretty short period of time, and we think these policy actions--particularly the most recent ones--have increased the odds that economic activity will moderate later this year just as the Greenbook projects And these actions significantly reduce the risk that the economy is going to overheat further  Now, the recent sharp increases in prices at the wholesale level and certainly at the consumer level worry us a great deal as do the indications of upward pressures on wages And we're deeply concerned about broad increases in prices outside the food and energy area That suggests that the underlying rate of inflation has risen at least a notch or two in the last several months On the other hand, the trend rate of growth in M2 has dropped pretty markedly over the last two years and I think that provides us with at least some insurance against a really sharp further acceleration in the underlying rate of inflation for the remainder of 1989 But I would add, perhaps gratuitously, that if we're really going to get inflation down to a zero level I think somewhere down the road we've certainly got to get the aggregates growing at a slower rate than they have grown over most of this two-year period--maybe no slower in 1989, but certainly in a trend sense they have to come down still further if we're going to get to our ultimate goal   Mr Chairman, I favor holding policy steady over the period ahead, for a period of the next few weeks anyway My hunch is the same as the one that's there [in the forecast] and also the one you made in assuming that some further increase in the funds rate is probably going to be needed later on to keep inflationary pressures and expectations from building up over the months ahead So, I would want the directive to be asymmetrical But I think it's also possible that we've done enough, particularly in looking at the behavior of M2 and how that has decelerated I realize a lot of that stems from how opportunity costs of holding M2 [have changed] just recently; but if  -35-    3/28/89  you look at the last two years M2 growth is still down to 47 percent from many years at a trend rate of about 89 percent That is one whale of a lot of deceleration over that period That leads me to be more sanguine about what might happen to inflation than I would be in the absence of that decided deceleration in M2 So, I would go with "B," at least until we have more information on the March figures; I'd watch those closely because I may well be wrong on that Certainly, the current statistics do not reflect anything that would suggest that we ought not tighten more You've got to look way back at what has been put in train, guess about those lagged effects, and reach the conclusion that now is the time to pause And that's really where I think the focus ought to be right now   Both?   You would have said yes if he hadn't helped you,   Sam, you mentioned a while ago that the Germans had some differences over the type of intervention What is their preference on that?   I can't now, Bob, but I'd give you--   At our last meeting, Mr Chairman, I think Governor LaWare said he thought the economy was probably a little mushier--if I remember his words right--than most people were thinking   I understand words like that   Well, I think the national data that have been released subsequently support that, and we see confirmation of that in our District The Beigebook report showed that consumer spending and manufacturing activity were moderating a good deal in March and April and the comments of our directors at the last couple of meetings have been noticeably less bullish than before At our meeting last Thursday several of the directors who live in what they like to call the golden crescent, which reaches from Baltimore through Washington and Richmond down to the Tidewater area around Norfolk, said activity actually has slowed up somewhat And this has been a boom area for some time  So far as the outlook is concerned, I think the Board's staff has made a solid case in the forecast that they have in the Greenbook And I think Mike made a further solid case by modifying that in the direction that he suggested when he drew on the later numbers This means essentially a soft landing Of course, everybody hopes that's what we will have It has been so long since we've had one that I don't think I would even remember Like Ed Boehne, up until recently I've been thinking that the risk of error was on the up side and now I think it has become more balanced between the up side and the down side I do think, however, that it would be premature to conclude that the risk is definitely on the down side at this point It's still possible that the sluggishness we have seen in the economy could turn out to be temporary A lot of it comes from the weakness in automobile sales and the incentives there are pretty sizable; so it's quite possible that that will turn around I remember so many times in the past when we thought we saw signs of weakening and they turned out not to have materialized For example, in the face of the weak employment reports that we had back in July and August we were really  -19-    5/16/89  worried about the economy for a while; and then they shot back up in the fall Don't misunderstand me I'm not suggesting that there is going to be a reacceleration As a matter of fact, I think that's unlikely The only point I mean to make is that I think it's a little premature to conclude that the economy really has turned downward at this point I would hold off a little on that judgment, although we certainly can make a better case for that now than we could have at the last meeting   Martha, you've raised an interesting question about whether the borrowed reserve target or the federal funds rate is the better indicator of policy Earlier Governor Angell raised the question as to whether the behavior of the aggregates or the federal funds rate was the better target And I think we all--   I'm saying there are three ways we can measure it that have been discussed here today, and I like Governor Angell's way best I like the federal funds rate second best and the borrowed reserves third best And they are all incompatible with one another We had a pretty interesting discussion earlier   Yes, I know what you were doing   But what the Bluebook did assume was that the best measure of the degree of reserve pressure was the federal funds rate, because you've adjusted your borrowing target to influence that rate   All the worrying about viewing the borrowed reserve target flexibly was designed to give preference to the federal funds rate which [unintelligible] was probably given--   Mr Chairman, I would favor "B;" $600 million; symmetrical language with "slightly" and "might" I'm not really worried about abandoning that asymmetrical directive because by the  -43-    5/16/89  time it comes out it will be after our July meeting and you will have testified before the two Congressional Committees The market, I hope, has the wisdom to look back and [recognize that] when we removed the tilt [the outlook] was very uncertain and that tilt was justifiably removed at that time It may subsequently have been reversed by whatever actions we take, but I think that a rational market observer--and there are a number of them--would think that was the logical thing for us to have done   I was suggesting "slightly/might" on both of them   Yes That predisposes us not to move unless we have some evidence that we don't now have It's a stronger vote to remain where we are than "somewhat" and "would," I think We may be getting into minutia here but--   If I were voting I would [accept] "somewhat" and "would;" I even toyed with the idea of "somewhat" and "might" and other permutations and combinations of that   That's possible, too, but I thought that would drive Don and his associates crazy   That probably means he doesn't want any questions!   Mr Chairman, most of what I wanted to cover has been covered by various people I wanted to start off by saying that I think this issue is more important than any of the ones we have on the agenda Despite the Japanese belief that sterilized intervention can have some permanent lasting effect, I don't really buy that And I think this does put us into a dangerous position As Sam indicated a while ago, we can drive the dollar down and the Treasury has a vested interest in that so as not to show a loss on its operations You could say that we do, too, although I'm sure that that's not anything that would motivate us   Oh, I know that   Well, the next point I was going to make was that I was sure you were making just that sort of argument and I wanted to commend you for having done that I do think one issue remains and that is one that Governor Angell and Governor Johnson raised last time whether this really can fall in our existing directive to counter disorderly conditions To my mind, it might go a little beyond that And I realize the [unintelligible] of the constitution is the Treasury [unintelligible] and I think you had to cooperate; I would support that But I think it does behoove us to continue, as you are doing, to try to educate them that this path is fraught with a lot of dangers At some point if we continue to get pressure from the Treasury to do this kind of thing I think we ought to at least take a look at the directive and maybe expand it--if we think that's appropriate--beyond disorderly conditions I wouldn't want to go beyond that myself but maybe the Committee could I realize you've been on the side of the angels in this and--   Well, I was going to commend you but at the same time criticize the fact that we unavoidably and inextricably got drawn into it because of the Treasury's primary status in this thing I would express the hope that this study we have undertaken could convince some of those who really don't know that much about it   As I said, I knew you were on the side of the angels! Others may argue, but Wayne has had very close contact with angels and he says that that is exactly right! If there's anyone here who's equipped to speak for the angels I think he really is   Mr Chairman, I just have one comment I was comforted by your statement that central bankers were lined up almost uniformly against the ministers of finance on that Do you know how strongly they are arguing their position with their minister of finance counterparts as you are clearly doing in this country?   May we all take off that day, Mr Chairman? I'd really like to take off Well, Monday is a holiday   It'll be in the paper Tuesday, then   What you are saying, then, is that it was the wrong job in your view?   But it is the wrong job   That's exactly the problem   We can use a long-run perfectly vertical Phillips curve and I wouldn't have any objection to that  -48-    10/3/89   Mr Chairman, I find myself in a little different position from the first three speakers We really haven't changed our view of the economic outlook very much from what we had last time The Greenbook projections seem reasonable to us; the staff always does a good job I don't think I will ever understand how Mike Prell is able to answer so many questions so well! But since there is some onus on us to say how we differ, I would say that our best guess is that the downside risk is a little greater at this point than the upside risk, for a couple of reasons First of all, I don't think we have yet seen the full effects of all the tightening that we have undertaken over the last year and a half Secondly, a lot of the improvement that the Greenbook projects is based on the external sector and that, in turn, has an underlying assumption that the dollar is going to continue to depreciate at a rather steady rate That's certainly a plausible position, but I think one can make some case that there is certainly more than a small possibility that the dollar just may not decline for reasons that we don't well understand I don't think we fully understand why it was strong before we started intervening; it may well be that that strength is going to resume, particularly after we are out of the market If that were to be the case, then real net exports and real GNP might come in a bit weaker than what the staff is projecting On the inflation side, I found the staff's efforts to estimate the magnitude of the effects of the projected depreciation of the dollar extremely helpful but rather  -26-    10/3/89  disturbing, because even with these alternative projections we didn't show much progress on inflation through 1991 But again, we find ourselves in a rather unique position in that we think inflation may do better than the staff thinks I feel rather uncomfortable with that because I remember--   We think we will have less inflation than they projected The reason I feel uncomfortable with that is that over time I think most of our System policy errors have been made by having been too easy rather than by having been too tight And the outlook is dependent to a large extent on what I think is an unusually high degree of credibility that policy now enjoys My feeling is that we probably have a higher degree of credibility now than we have ever had And I think your statement in response to the Neal resolution did a lot to strengthen that So, I'm a bit more optimistic on this than I have been But I hope that doesn't translate into the wrong kind of policy for the Committee because I'm not ready at this point to relinquish the reins and say that we have this battle won, by any means    -29-    10/3/89   Well, I'm talking about   How big is the gap is what he's asking   Mr Chairman, I'm very sympathetic to the point that Lee Hoskins made because I tend to focus on the longer run, as I think he does And I think our long-run problem is inflation rather than recession I'm also sympathetic to the points made by those who favor symmetry just because I'd like to send a signal to the market that we don't really approve of the G-7 action But I also share Wayne's feeling that monetary policy has been a little tighter than most people assume and that it may be [sufficient to] hold down the inflation risk So, I think your original formulation is probably the best one for now; I would go with "B" asymmetrical on the easing side   Ted, I was a little surprised by the severity of the decline in net exports in the third quarter I just didn't sense the things that you [noted] Does that seem to be a reasonable figure to you or is that one that we might--   Self-glorified numbers   Mr Chairman, the Greenbook projections haven't changed very much since last time and neither have ours We continue to believe that if there is risk, the risk is probably that the economy will be a little weaker than the staff have been projecting That feeling has been heightened by recent anecdotal information that we've been picking up I got a particularly interesting piece this morning A president of one of the small investment firms in Richmond sent me a collection of articles published by a guru he's been following for some 30 years and he said that the problem with the economy was that the Reserve Bank Presidents had recently started attending the Open Market Committee meetings and they were bullying you into accepting tighter monetary policy, which he thought was correct! But more important than that, our directors at their last meeting were decidedly less optimistic about the economy than they had been They reported weakness in commercial construction and automobile sales a good deal weaker, with several dealerships in trouble They said manufacturing activity appeared to be softening and loan demand was flat at some of the large commercial banks But they went ahead to stress that despite all this, they didn't think [the economy] was really falling out of bed And labor was still very tight But in view of this indication that we've gotten from various sources, the Fifth District is probably slowing to some extent Since this area has been one of the stronger parts of the national economy, we think that the national economy, if it isn't right on target with the Greenbook's projection, will perhaps be somewhat weaker than that At the same time, we're a bit more optimistic--the Richmond Fed staff  -18-    11/14/89  has been assuming no change in monetary policy--on the inflation side Given the amount of tightening that we had in '88 and in '89, we think we're going to begin to see some dividends from that I think there is some evidence of that in the squeeze in profit margins now; despite rising labor costs, firms are not able to pass that on to prices because there's more resistance to those prices So, we are hoping that we'll do a little better on the inflation front than the staff is projecting   Mr Chairman, I would go along with "B" with asymmetric language I recognize that we've done quite a bit of easing in recent weeks and that M2 is growing pretty strongly Clearly, at some point, as Tom expressed it so well on the "Call" the other day--and Governor Angell has made the same point--we're going to have to start paying more attention to the aggregates and less to these short-term indicators of real economic activity or else we're going to be headed for a lot of trouble I don't think we've reached that point just yet, but that's clearly a judgment call Having said that, I think it is very essential that we keep our eyes firmly on our longer-term goal of bringing down inflation Accordingly, I think any further easing, even that little amount permitted by the proviso, should be approached very, very cautiously  -29-    11/14/89   Well, losses on our books could go directly in there too   There are at least two dangers One is that we can lose our credibility and the market will assume we're going to ease policy in order not to take the losses The other is that members of Congress become concerned about the losses and try to exert political pressure on us so that we don't have to take those losses, which would mean pressure to ease policy   We didn't do that   You got reckless there for a minute!   Well, it's in the wrong direction   What does that say about your thoughts on the evaluation of the Committee?   Mr Chairman, I think the changes in the staff projections are clearly in the right direction As a lot of people have indicated, there is a great deal of uncertainty, but I do think we have enough hard information now to know that the inventory swing  -25-    3/27/90  from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year was [more] than we thought Consequently, it looks as if the rate of growth in real GNP in the first quarter is going to be correspondingly higher One of the key points looking ahead, of course, is that the staff has projected that there will be some rise in interest rates over this period of time in order to get roughly the same rate of growth in GNP and more or less the same sort of inflation figures I think that change in policy assumptions is quite correct We've had a sustained growth in M2 for about 9 months now and this may well strengthen aggregate demand considerably In addition, events in Eastern Europe have moved much more rapidly than anybody felt they probably would So it seems to me that the transformation of these economies is necessarily going to lead to higher real interest rates throughout the industrial world Given this assumed upward adjustment in rates that the staff has incorporated in its forecast, I think the risk is about evenly split between up and down If they had not raised these rates, I would have placed the risk on the up side in their forecast I don't think it will surprise anybody to know that my chief concern is that which was voiced first by Governor Angell that there's no improvement in inflation over this projection period Someone mentioned an absence of trend, but actually if you look at the fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter figures on the fixed-weight deflator and the CPI, they both are higher for '90 and '91 than they were in the last Greenbook The CPI ends up in the fourth quarter of '91 at about 4-1/2 percent, and I think we have to do a good deal better than that Someone--I guess that was Governor Angell too--used the term "unacceptable" If we want to maintain our credibility, I think we have to do better than that I sense that despite our best efforts we have lost some of that credibility recently; we ought to think about that very carefully as we formulate our policy later on in this meeting   Anybody you want to suggest to do it?   Mr Chairman, when we've been faced with this degree of uncertainty about the business outlook I don't think we've ever tightened before And yet when I look back through the history of the System, I think this is where we've made most of our mistakes If we could take the Bluebook at face value and assume that we would get a growth of M2 of 6 percent for April through June, I think that would be an adequate slowing, given the rate at which the aggregates have been growing But I'm a little suspicious that it might be a little stronger than that So, I favor a bit of a preemptive strike-- somewhere between "B" and "C," a "B-" or "C+" But that clearly isn't going to happen So, I would be prepared, if I were voting, to vote for a directive with asymmetry to the [tighter] side I think we ought to do at least that much If subsequent economic information suggested that that was the wrong way to have leaned, I don't see that we really would lose anything since that would not be released until after the next meeting   Mr Chairman, we think that the more restrictive monetary policy that the staff is projecting is going to be needed if we're going to generate greater projected disinflation as appropriate What's striking and disappointing to us is that this assumed tighter    5/15/90  policy is expected to produce only a small improvement in the inflation outlook, at least through 1991, but a fairly substantial reduction in GNP next year I think most of us would agree, and indeed this was an import of the excellent memorandum distributed to us sometime back, that there are different kinds of models on this those that are forward-looking and those that are backward-looking I assume that most of this is based on the MPS model If you used one that is more forward-looking, I think that would suggest a better tradeoff, with more disinflation at a smaller cost Of course, the staff readily acknowledges this in saying that the assumed tighter monetary policy could yield a much bigger payoff if it increased our credibility And that, of course, is a very important issue from the standpoint of our policy decision later on I don't think most of us would be willing to argue in favor of a tighter policy if we thought the payoff on inflation was going to be quite as small as what has been projected in the Greenbook  My own feeling is that the payoff would be larger because I think people are becoming more and more forward looking If we can demonstrate to the public that we really have a strong commitment to [reducing] inflation, then I think perhaps we could have much better results than the staff is projecting on the inflation side Now, we wouldn't quarrel much with the staff's near-term projections for the second and third quarters I would guess that the near-term risks might be skewed a little toward the down side because I think there really is something to this real estate credit crunch We hear this from too many places We had an interesting statement by a major regional developer who is a very astute man, I think He said that funding has virtually dried up; he cited one large city in the country where only one out of eleven major real estate developers can get any credit at all And if that is true, of course, then it could have some early impacts and would bias the next couple of quarters to the down side   Mr Chairman, I'd like to reiterate my view that the progress we make toward achieving our long-run objective and the transition cost of moving to that are going to be affected a great deal by the credibility of our policy --the large regional real estate developer who told me that only one out of eleven developers in a given city could get credit--said that he thought our credibility as an inflation fighter had all but disappeared He could find nobody who thought inflation was going to come down, and he was obviously disappointed that we didn't  And that made me think about it somewhat differently than I otherwise would have because I think this fellow is unusually perceptive   No he isn't; he's even younger than I am, Martha, if you can conceive of such a thing! So, I think we ought to pay a little more attention to the long-run issues in the position we take today than we typically do, instead of our perceptions of what is going on in the short-run part of the economy And we [ought] to focus on what this is going to do to our credibility So, I would favor "B" for now, but I would go asymmetrical You've taken care of a good part of my concerns by suggesting that you really favor asymmetry but that you're not quite ready to put that language in the directive I think we need a signal out there that we really haven't abandoned our quest for price stability I'd like to see us put that asymmetry in the directive But the behavior of the aggregates is a concern to me to some extent I would be alarmed if they don't pick up before long, especially M2 and not so much M3, because I think we might have squeezed too much But overall some kind of signal--not a discount rate increase but something from this Committee--really would be very helpful right now, because I agree with you that our next move will be to tighten Of course, like everybody else, I'm guessing on that    5/15/90   We need some kind of reserve measure tied to M2, but there's no way--   Our present structure was set up to target Ml, which then ceased to be a good indicator We have all this institutional set-up in effect and it's not useful   Very cleverly done, too   I thought it was great at the time, but I didn't know what was going to happen to Ml   Peter, does anybody think we've tightened any because we went above our expected--?   I haven't seen any indication of it; I just wondered if you had   You are in the [minority] Of all the observers you're one of the few who really think that Don't virtually all observers think of it as a target?   You have to be able to predict--   This is obviously a very volatile and highly uncertain period and any economic forecast is going to be subject to an unusual degree of uncertainty At the same time, I think we have to avoid overemphasizing these uncertainties To me the main thing that has changed is that we have this oil problem in the Middle East and we don't know how that is going to affect the price of oil Given the kind of assumptions that the staff has made about what will happen to the price of oil, I believe their forecast is a very plausible one and I think the economic projections make sense I would guess that the odds of error are about equal in both directions The key feature of the forecast to me is not so much that a recession is predicted, but that the recession the staff is projecting is relatively shallow and brief And when you think about recessions that we've had in the past, they have almost always been preceded by some kind of overheating of the economy inventories have been bloated to some extent, usually inflation has accelerated rapidly, and interest rates generally have risen rapidly But those conditions really don't exist for the most part today So again, I think the staff's projection is pretty well on target I make this point because I think it implies that the policy approach that we take ought to be cautious and measured, like the one that we have been taking in recent years I don't think there's any cause for panic now even though we obviously need to be alert to what is going to happen in the Middle East  So far as our District economy is concerned, usually I don't see anything that's all that different, but I come out with a little different view than Bob Forrestal did I don't think the Beigebook  -20-    10/2/90  report reflects conditions as well as what we've heard since then because our most recent anecdotal information suggests that economic activity is still growing for the most part, but at very slow rates The sharp slowing that we had been reporting early in the year seems to have subsided The main weak point in our area, as is true I guess in most other places, is certainly commercial building We have some major problems in the Baltimore-Washington-Norfolk corridor It looks as if we increasingly will have to deal with the kind of real estate problems that some other parts of the country have been through Apart from that particular situation, however, I would describe the activity in our area as still growing, but at a very, very modest pace   You took time to add an "A+" though   It's not a holiday for financial markets, though it is a bank holiday   But the securities market will be open   Mr Chairman, if you would favor this move without the budget agreement because of economic considerations, wouldn't it be wiser to link it more to those economic considerations so we don't have this precedent of having acted because fiscal policy has acted? I think that could set a precedent for us in the future that--   You have a point there You still stressed it in the context of a longer-term objective of trying to control inflation, given that the aggregates have picked up some, but a lot of that pickup may be fictitious It seems to me that under those circumstances maybe a little lower interest rate is compatible with keeping the money supply running at the rate we had in mind all along, and couching it in those terms--   Yes, that's essentially what I'm saying   But I would still express that in terms of reiterating our long-term objectives   This is perfectly compatible with that and it's not throwing in the towel [on inflation]; that's what we're concerned about   All I'm saying is let's make that a part of the statement I think most of us would agree that that is the way we want to do it   It's hard to know, really, what funds rate level to pick out of thin air that will give us the rate of growth we want in the aggregates I was cheered by the pickup in M2, but when you examine it you wonder if that isn't part fictitious   To me, if in fact M2 is really still relatively weak, then this easing is perfectly compatible with the policy that aims toward price stability But if M2 for some reason or other strengthened a great deal beyond what we think, then--   I'd feel a little better if I knew how that reserve requirement matter worked out   Is this change in the reserve requirements going to have any real impact?  -50-    10/2/90   Mr Chairman, this is a time when we have to be extremely cautious, as everybody has suggested here We have had recent increases in the core rate of inflation; we have weakness in the dollar and complete uncertainty as to how this budget package is going to play The more I look at it the more it bothers me For example, I don't know whether the public is going to [react] the same way And there is this nervousness in the bond market, which made me lean initially toward doing nothing on the federal funds rate But to me changing the federal funds rate is not really a change in policy; it's a change in policy if we really are trying to do something with a rate of growth in the aggregates And you have satisfied me that your intention is to try to keep to what I think is an appropriate target So, I don't think that's a change in policy The market, however, is going to look at it as a change in policy, and that's why I suggested earlier that we couch it in terms of not having abandoned our long-run target, but just as a way of implementing what we want to do   So, I would go along with it It wouldn't have been my first choice, but you're probably more right than I was when I got here As to this second step, I sure would agree with Jerry Corrigan--as you did and I think everybody has--that we want to look at that one very closely But to the extent that we can disabuse the market of the notion that we really have changed the thrust of our policy every time the federal funds rate jumps a little--   As I've said before, it's a modern day version of the real bills doctrine We set a particular rate and the market gets all the money it wants at that rate The only way we have to encourage it to take more is to lower that rate, or the only way to discourage it is to raise the rate, which is what we had under the real bills doctrine And I don't like the initiative for the    10/2/90  generation of the money supply to come from the market It ought to be supply determined rather than demand determined since the long-term velocity of M2 looks like a pretty stable function to me now So, I've always endorsed that I don't have the answer, as I indicated earlier We just don't have any reserve measure that can be expected to control M2, so I don't know what the alternative is And I am very frustrated over that   One thing to bear in mind is that the employment report comes out on Friday and that's significant   Well, at some point that law has to be changed, it seems to me This is probably not the time to do it   We really ought to get rid of that; it's a fiction [unintelligible] reserve requirement rather than some notes and deposits   Mr Chairman, I think that Don gave us a good solution to the problem, and I certainly agree with Bob Parry that the    11/13/90  final option is the best one We certainly don't want to lock ourselves into the pre-1979 procedures where we have a very narrow range and have all the problems attendant to that When you look at the third and fourth options, we have all these difficulties writing what we want in the directive now, and I can't imagine this group being able to sit around the table and come up with an alternative that we would agree on for the language there So, this kicks me back toward the final option If we're not willing to do anything in the way of adopting a new one, then I think what we have now is better than any of the alternatives other than dropping it   Yes, go back to option one if we don't go to five, but I much prefer five I've always been opposed to any limits of any sort because my predilections are to try to control things with some kind of a reserve measure That necessitates a wider range over which the federal funds rate can move than we've been willing to tolerate in the past   Well, when Roger used to say we were targeting the federal funds rate, Chairman Volcker used to say "That's what you always say, Roger" He always used those exact words   Mike, the absence of objections might be because some of us have been objecting for so many years with so little success that we just finally quit out of a sense of futility But I see renewed hope, based on what the Chairman said about that And I think it is tied into Governor Angell's point that it's really closely related to what our new procedures turn out to be, if indeed we adopt new procedures   That was enthusiastic! It suggests, Mr Chairman, that if we want enthusiasm on the part of the Committee that we should discuss insignificant items   Mr Chairman, I think the Greenbook's forecast is certainly plausible and internally consistent, given the kinds of assumptions the staff is making about policy and the price of oil over the forecast horizon But it seems to me that the risk is clearly on the down side even if one assumes that oil prices will behave as the staff has concluded by declining significantly What impresses me about all the recent data we have received, both statistical and anecdotal, is that it is just universally bad As Mike Prell indicated a while ago, the worst is the employment figures But the National Association of Purchasing Managers' figures don't look good We got the figures on industrial production and capacity utilization this morning and they certainly didn't look good The Beigebook suggested that virtually all parts of the economy--in most sectors and in most regions--are experiencing slower growth or even some decline  -23-    11/13/90  in business activity From our directors and other grassroots contacts, except for those in the agricultural area, we're just not getting any good comments at all At last Thursday's meeting of our board, for example, they were more pessimistic than I remember for years and years; even at the meeting before there were a few bright spots that were mentioned, but absolutely none at this one We even had one letter from an unusually affable former director who is a strong supporter of this System saying that the System really didn't understand how bad it was out there He was irked by all the statements that we don't know whether we are in a recession or not and he proceeded to give me a set of figures that demonstrated to his satisfaction that we are, though they were hardly conclusive  Obviously, none of this suggests that we're about to fall over the edge of the cliff But given the state of business and consumer confidence, which as I assess it is lower than I can remember for many a day, it seems to me that there's a better than even chance that we're going to have a greater drop in GNP than the staff is projecting It may well mean also that the recovery is not going to come as early as the second quarter Now, I think the downside risks would increase pretty significantly if the growth in the aggregates comes in below what is projected, and I'm very much concerned by this further evidence of weak growth in the aggregates I hope the Committee is going to take some steps later on to try to get the aggregates more nearly on what seems to me to be an appropriate path Finally, I would like to say that I sure was happy to see the projections on inflation that the staff has made for down the road a way It's certainly true that we're going to have some turbulent times, but I think we have made some progress toward our long-run objective of achieving price stability I'm delighted to see this reflected in the forecast, and I believe the staff is going to be right on that   Is that your unbiased report?   That's a subdivision of the Fifth District, Mr Chairman   It would be easier in that you would not have to worry about what the level of borrowed reserves was as much as you did   Mr Chairman, these are obviously uncertain and difficult times not only for consumers and producers but also for forecasters This looks a little different from anything we've ever had before I think the staff's forecast is highly plausible, given    12/18/90  the assumptions on which it rests But our hunch is that the projection for real GNP for the current quarter and the first half of 1991 will turn out to be on the high side even if the oil prices do come down from the relatively optimistic path that the staff has assumed I have several reasons for saying this One is the big revision the staff has made in net exports of goods and services by showing a pretty steep, near-term drop in imports which, of course, has the effect of raising both real GNP and net imports of goods and services compared to the November Greenbook forecast We think the direction of this revision was clearly appropriate, given the weakness in domestic demand that's been evident in the recent data and also the census data mentioned in the Greenbook and again the figures that we've gotten on the merchandise trade balance for October--though a lot of that may wash out as Ted suggested Despite all those things, the magnitude of the revision looks a little big to us And the second reason is this persistent weakness in M2, which I don't think anybody really can explain satisfactorily That continues to worry us a great deal And finally, we've been impressed by the continued strong negative tone of most of the anecdotal information that we've been getting from all sorts of sources One piece of information that struck me as particularly impressive came from the  who is in the plastics business and makes parts for manufacturers all over the country and sells them on a nationwide business He called up specifically to tell us that the bottom had fallen completely out of his order book, which is something that he had not seen before   This had happened last month Now, we feel somewhat more comfortable with the staff's inflation forecast than with the projections on output and employment The staff has revised downward a little its projections for inflation for 1991 and 1992 from the last Greenbook, and that strikes us as appropriate But as I said earlier, I really think the monetary restraint that we have put in place over the last several years as a whole may well produce greater long-term benefits on the inflation side than the staff has been projecting even if this recession turns out--as I hope it will--to be as mild as they are projecting   Mr Chairman, I was just looking at the P* model shown in Chart 9 and, as I read that, it provides me with a pretty good comfort level Don, do you take much comfort in that?   Well, in the long run it has been pretty darn stable   That's right   If we did this, you don't think it would provide an undue degree of surprise, do you?   That's the way I read it   Mr Chairman, you formulated exactly what I would have done I just want to express the hope that the Board of Governors in its wisdom does what you suggested it might do tomorrow so that the net effect would be a 1/4 point change in the federal funds rate If the Board does not act, then 1/4 point is all I would want to do at this point I think a 1/2-point move would do things to the bond market and the foreign exchange market that we wouldn't like very  -35-    12/18/90  much That would be seen as throwing in the towel [on inflation] at this point So, I'm with you 100 percent on that   Which might or might not be used   I think we could put out a news release if we decided this sort of thing   Bob Parry and I are going to be on next year too [as voting members]!   And it's on the other side where we've made our mistakes every time throughout our history practically   Mr Chairman, I agree completely with your point about federal funds targeting I've felt for a long time that we needed to find something else, preferably some kind of reserve measure, but that's not all that easy with a lot of the parts of M2  -2-    3/26/91  not reserveable and with the proclivity of the financial markets for innovating if we did slap reserve requirements on those But I think we need to move in that direction, and we probably need a little more consultation than we've had The problem I had with the memo was that I didn't think the authors necessarily were suggesting more consultation I think you've been unusually good in calling us together, but there have been one or two instances when I wished we had gotten together and we didn't--the change in the discount rate right before the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting, for example One of my colleagues called and said "You know, you've just been disenfranchised on your vote" Well, I happened to agree with that move; we were one of the Reserve Banks that had sent in [a request to lower the discount rate], and I didn't really feel disenfranchised But he felt very strongly that that [action] had precluded the FOMC from determining the federal funds rate, which he thought was the province of the FOMC And I can understand that argument So, I would opt for slightly more consultation, but I think you've been better than anyone else has ever been in providing that   I think there probably would be a preference for unwinding the warehousing first, too, Mr Chairman   We might be able to couple that with opposition to letting the FDIC borrow $25 million from us and get a credit--   That wasn't really what I had in mind, but that's an interesting fallout   I bet it would too I was just thinking about the monetary policy accord in the early '50s We need a credit accord too, where they don't try to dictate the composition of our assets, which is what the FDIC maneuver does and what this warehousing does   Yes, I didn't mean to get ahead of you   Mr Chairman, we've moved in a slightly different direction from Bob Forrestal in that we think the near-term outlook has improved significantly since the February meeting Back then we were expecting the recession to last through most, if not all, of the second quarter, and we felt that the risk of error in the Board staff's projection was clearly on the down side We now agree with the staff that the economy is likely to turn back up in the second  -25-    3/26/91  quarter and we think the bulk of the risk has now shifted to the up side, particularly in the second and third quarters, although obviously there is still some risk that we could have more down side weakness than we see For example, exports might not do as well as we are thinking  The main reasons why we feel a little more bullish are what you might expect One has been this decidedly improved level of confidence on the part of businesses and consumers that followed the ending of the war The second is that we've had this flurry of scattered statistics that suggest some little intensification of activity And the third is that the grass roots information that we're picking up around our District is decidedly better than what we saw at the time of our last meeting And the improvement appears to be more than what could be accounted for by the normal seasonal things, which is something that businessmen have difficulty distinguishing when they're reporting on whether business conditions have improved For example, at our last board meeting I saw what was the most abrupt change in the attitude of our directors between two meetings that I've seen at any time since I've been with the System They were practically all on the positive side The one exception was our director who had been on the positive side before and he has moved to the negative side now But seems to move in a different direction from everybody else on a lot of issues And then the last but by no means the least reason we're more optimistic is the pickup in growth of M2 It seems to be responding to our earlier easing actions and, as Mike Prell indicated, that doesn't guarantee a strong recovery but it certainly does enhance the possibility that that is what we'll get  On the price side, we were particularly glad to see that the staff has lowered its forecast of inflation somewhat over the period ahead We're still generally optimistic that long-term inflationary pressures are going to move in the right direction as a result of what I think has been a very wise monetary policy over a period of several years now I think we're going to hit pay dirt on that one But I am disturbed, of course, by the rapid run-up in both the consumer price index and the producer price index even after allowing for the known special factors I'd be even more concerned about that if the recent growth in the aggregates doesn't slow somewhat in the near future from its pace in the last couple of months   Mr Chairman, several months ago we sat around this table as we eased policy and reminded ourselves--and several people participated in this--that we had better be ready when the time came to avoid the mistake that we usually have made in the past in not tightening soon enough I was prepared to deliver that same talk again and also to throw in a caveat that we ought not pay much attention to our favorite economic indicator, the level of employment You made essentially the same talk and made all the points I thought were pertinent So, I very much agree with you that we ought to stay with "B" with a symmetrical directive I also agree that if we move in either direction, it would be desirable to meet and talk about it  -43-    3/26/91   Si is the first fellow who has ever had a hired gun to speak for him at a meeting!   It would be "somewhat" still?   Mr Chairman, I think the staff's downward revision in their projection of real GNP for the second quarter makes sense in light of the incoming information More generally, the overall profile that they've predicted for the next three or four quarters strikes us as eminently reasonable given the staff's policy assumptions, the behavior of most of the leading indicators, and the pattern of recent anecdotal information It's interesting to me how close the projections of the staff are to those of the private economy Mike suggested theirs were a bit stronger, but it seems to me they are remarkably close, which is something that many people might view with alarm given the record of forecasters in the past I might be one of those except that I believe they're about right on this And I believe that the risk of error is about equal on the up side and on the down side I guess the most important question we ought to ask ourselves is How great is the risk that we will have a big error on the down side? In other words, how likely is it that we will get a significantly greater decline in the current quarter than the staff expects and that this will be followed perhaps by a greater decline in the third quarter? Obviously, we can't rule that out entirely; but in the absence of some totally unlikely, unexpected negative supply shocks such as we had last August, the probability of that kind of decline seems to me to be pretty low We've already taken out a lot of insurance to prevent such a thing happening, with the cumulative policy actions over the last six months or so And beyond that, we're now seeing new signs of life in residential construction, strength in the stock market and some of the other leading indicators, and a recent upturn in the National Association of Purchasing Managers' index, which was higher in April than it was in the lowest quarter trough of any previous full economic upturn  So, those all suggest to me that we are probably now very near the bottom of a recession Whether it's going to be longer or whether it's a near trough, I don't know But it seems to me that a significant further weakening is decidedly unlikely I was particularly glad to see that the staff has reduced its inflation forecast because I have felt for some time that we had followed a very wise policy [course of] action and that it would pay off in terms of inflation numbers The staff has cut a couple of notches off the inflation projections for both this year and next year and they're now predicting a core rate of inflation of about 3 percent at the end of 1992 And I think we ought to have at least that degree of progress against inflation But it is important that we keep in mind what the staff has assumed when it made these projections, and that is that we'll come very close to achieving the midpoint of our target range for M2 I think it's critically important that we take whatever steps are required to keep M2 somewhat in that range in case the recovery and consequently the money demand turns out to be somewhat stronger than it now appears to us that it might be   This is in the Bluebook, Norm?   So move   Mr Chairman, I'm glad you gave us a chance to take a look at this I don't think it would surprise anyone who has listened to what I've said that I would favor such a study And now, like Governor Angell, I don't know where the answer would lead; and Al Broaddus certainly doesn't know exactly where it would lead But I've never really been comfortable trying to control the aggregates by manipulating the federal funds rate because I think the demand for money for any given level of income in the short run fluctuates too much to do that I have some sympathy for those alternatives that have a degree of automatism But I remember that when we had the procedures in 1979-82 and we were supposed to adjust the level of borrowed reserves by half the amount of any miss in the aggregates, about two-thirds of the moves we made were also discretionary So, I'm not under any illusions that we're really about to put [policy] on automatic pilot But a lot of things have come along in the way of studies on this since we last looked at it All I would advocate is that we use the System's considerable research resources to examine this question because I think all of us feel some dissatisfaction with the way we do it But I don't believe there's anybody here who really feels that he knows the answers as to exactly how it ought to be done    8/20/91  It was simple in my mind when we wanted to control Ml; but it's not simple when we're trying to control M2 and only a small fraction of M2 is reservable And we're not paying interest on required reserves, and that encourages further innovations So, where this will lead, I don't know I suspect we probably won't get far from where we are, but we ought to take a good hard look at it And I think Don and Dave have done us a good service in providing us these various alternatives   One of the big reasons reserve targeting has been opposed in the past has been the feeling that it would cause more fluctuations in short-term interest rates And as Al indicates in his letter, there is some evidence now that that might not be the case for long-term rates That could be an important factor, I think    8/20/91   It's awfully hard, even if you know what you want to accomplish, to pick the [appropriate] fed funds rate   You'd be surprised as to what the aggregates are doing with that particular fed funds rate, which we thought would be something very different   And therein lies our frustration, I think   Well, I think Governor Kelley has done us a real service in pointing these things out I've been uncomfortable for a long time with the way we've handled this thing And even though we ourselves don't pay much attention to this, the Fed watchers do pay a lot of attention to it and they think it's an indication of our practice More importantly, if we do change them, they think that means we've changed our emphasis So, if we continue doing that, there's a strong argument for doing what is almost the unthinkable, as you and Jerry have pointed out, of debating this and maybe reaching an impasse at every meeting So, I've concluded that what I think you are all moving toward is that we should eliminate this language and take another route Changing this list, even infrequently, tends to promote the perception already held by many that we are constantly changing our objectives and we're trading off one objective against the other And I don't think considering the list at each meeting would add anything to our policy deliberations; that could hamper us,  -13-    8/20/91  as Don pointed out, and you and Jerry also have mentioned So, my preference would be to adopt what is Governor Kelley's point 3 and Don's example under 4 Don gives three examples and I like the one labeled 4b, which is at the bottom of page 3 in his memo, because it puts long-run price stability at the head of the list And needless to say, I'd want to retain the reference to the aggregates because right now I think that is the best route to get to long-term price stability, although our views may change as a result of this study we talked about earlier But adherence to that approach doesn't necessarily bind us to that every time If we have a particular situation like we have now, with extreme weakness in the aggregates for some unexplainable reason, or like the stock market crash in October of 1987, then we could certainly change it But I would like to start off with saying something about price stability As Don pointed out, there is such a reference in the previous paragraph, but I don't think it would hurt to put it at the beginning of the operational paragraph too and make it a generic reference I would very much favor doing that   I think this point bears on the one that you raised earlier about our not thinking of a change in the federal funds rate as a change in policy and yet the market, or most of the market, does If we had this overall summary statement as in Don's example 4b on page 3 "In the context of the Committee's long-run  -15-    8/20/91  objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, somewhat greater reserve restraint" then we can go into these things But we have said that that is in our judgment compatible with our long-run objective and I think it would reduce the tendency of the public to think of that as a change in policy when it really isn't That's one of the main reasons I lean toward a reserve base measure because if we had that, we could have interest rates go this way or that way and we wouldn't have any better idea as to which way they would go than anybody else I don't know if they would tend to be interpreted that way, but it is just the natural fallout of trying to seek a long-run objective; it may involve lower rates or it may involve higher rates, and that can change all over the place from time to time   Celebration?  END OF MEETING  -42-       Mr Chairman, we're very, very close to the staff, as we usually are, and maybe even closer this time than ordinarily We'd be very happy if we got the outcome that they think is most likely, but from the standpoint of policy the relevant question is where the risks lie I think the staff concludes as we do that the risks probably are on the down side, when you think about the insurance problems--and now we have the casualty insurance companies hit by hurricane Bob--the so-called credit crunch, and the weakness in the aggregates We ought to keep in mind some other things, too There's always doubt when you're in a recession as to what it is that's going to take you out of it I remember that in every single one we've had Mike just enumerated three major factors that had caused the staff to think that maybe this forecast ought to be revised slightly upward the behavior of consumer expenditures, residential construction, and net exports The thing that worries us most of all, I think, is the behavior of payroll unemployment and employment We went back and looked at the behavior of this for all the postwar upturns in the first three months following a trough If you look at that and compare the first estimate that we have now for the last month, it really doesn't look very different from what we've had in the other postwar upturns except in one case So, this may not be quite as alarming as it looks on the surface With these things in mind, I don't think it's time yet to push the panic button But I think we have to be very, very alert to the risk to the near-term outlook that is being posed by the behavior of the aggregates since we simply can't explain by econometric models or otherwise all of this weakness that we've seen in them And that makes me worry somewhat that monetary policy could have been tighter than we really meant it to be   I want to be a spectator, not a participant   Mr Chairman, in most cases I would agree with Lee, but I think there are some special factors at work here So, I would buy all three of your recommendations--"B," asymmetry toward ease, and version II   Well, I think getting a hand on the true state of the economy and its near-term prospects is about as difficult this time as it has been at any time I've ever been involved in it, and I've been doing this longer than I would like to remember Much of the anecdotal information that we've been getting lately has been negative and discouraging Of course, there is some positive news-- especially in the manufacturing area--and similarly the statistics are pretty mixed But despite all that conflicting information, I think the staff has made a particularly strong case for the kind of moderate growth that they're projecting here And I think it's important to bear in mind that this is just a moderate [recovery] and not in any sense a strong one Real GNP, for example, is expected to grow at only slightly above what most people assume to be the long-run economic potential So, if this is all that happens, this recovery is definitely going to be on the slow end of those that we've had in the postwar period Our guess is that the downside risk on the forecast, while somewhat greater than the upside risk, is not as much greater as most people appear to think today We're all aware of the downside risk presented by such things as the weakness in M2, apparently continuing restraint on credit supplies to some industries and in some geographical areas, the fiscal restraint in the federal and the state and local government [sectors], and the heavy overhang of commercial real estate throughout the country But balancing all these negatives, at least to some extent, are strong increases in the leading indicators of manufacturing activity, an apparent reduction in the underlying inflationary pressures--although Mike did explain very clearly that that's not an unambiguous signal--and the substantial reductions that we in the Federal Reserve have effected on short-term and long-term rates  -10-    10/1/91  The one aspect of this recovery that does appear to be clear to me, really, is that we have made substantial progress toward reducing inflation or the underlying trend rate of inflation The staff's projection of about a 3-1/2 percent rate by late next year in the context of continued moderate real growth seems pretty reasonable to us And if we can get 3-1/2 percent next year and then maybe 2-1/2 percent in 1993, then I think we will be closing in on what is effectively price stability Now, I'm certainly aware of the risk that excessive monetary restraint could damage the economy and its apparently precarious position and that we could make it more difficult, if not impossible, to achieve sustained price stability So, we definitely want to exercise a degree of caution But at the same time I think it's important that we not be too cautious We clearly have some momentum in reducing the inflation rate now; our credibility is growing and that will not only increase our chances of attaining our goal but will also reduce the cost of attaining it   It's "B"  -29-    10/1/91   Mr Chairman, I come out right where you do but I really do feel a great loss in seeing M2 lose its meaning I feel almost like a baby who has lost his pacifier! [Laughter]   It took a while!   Mr Chairman, there's another complication A number of us have meetings of our executive committees or full boards on Thursday and we'll be addressing the question of the discount rate And if we know that we're going to cut the federal funds rate 1/4 point on Friday, we can't tell the directors yet They don't have the  -37-    11/5/91  information they need to make a rational decision So, there's another reason for doing it now rather than then, although I have a lot of sympathy for what Peter and his associates have been saying   Sure, I can; but I have knowledge that they don't have that I can't share with them   And I wouldn't--   Well, it is [a concern] to me not to share information and give them my best judgment, which would have to be affected by the knowledge that we were going to cut [the funds rate] 1/4 point the next day We're pretty free with our directors but we never tell them anything about what we're going to do or anything about what we just did that isn't released, and we never will So we couldn't possibly tell them that this 1/4 point [reduction] was pending And yet I think their attitude would be affected to some significant extent by that if they knew   If you hadn't talked so long, maybe we could have! [Laughter]   I know I'm being facetious   Could I ask Peter one question, Mr Chairman? Peter, if we went in before the normal time, which you could and sometimes do, would that alleviate to any extent the problem that you alluded to originally?   I'd favor doing it in the morning, first thing   No, I was thinking about going ahead and doing it through the market tomorrow as soon as the market opens   That's what I think I'd do   No, nor 1130 am   It seems obvious to us that in our District people now think everything is pessimistic; whether they're consumers or business people, [they have] very low expectations A particularly striking [example] came at our last meeting, which was a joint meeting of our Baltimore/Richmond boards, when I heard the most pessimistic statements of the economic conditions I think I've heard in the 36 years or so that I've been attending these meetings And virtually all the reports we've gotten since then have been along that line  From what I read and what I've heard around the table, it's pretty clear that for the most part that pessimism is equally widespread in the rest of the country and may be even more widespread in certain places And then we got--to use Mike's term from a while ago--"a stunning confirmation" of this when we received this downward revision in the Conference Board consumer confidence series But having said all this, I think the question we have to answer this morning is Exactly what does this mean in terms of the near-term prospects for the economy? I certainly think it tells us something namely, that the recovery has been weaker up until now and probably will be weaker in the immediate future than any of us thought it was going to be The current quarter and probably the first quarter are certainly going to reflect this So, the downward revisions in the Board staff's figures are clearly indicated But I think it would be premature at this point to conclude that this apparently declining  -16-    11/5/91  confidence means that the economy is necessarily going to go into a double-dip recession as some people have been assuming Sentiment frequently remains bearish in the early stages of an economic upturn, and it's clearly even gloomier than usual this time if I remember correctly I think the media has added a lot to this because there has been so much more hype on this than in the past  Now, I know there are differences of opinion about what these consumer surveys show, but three studies done by different Federal Reserve Banks have suggested that they are not really very good predictors I would say they probably are a coincident indicator at best So, while we have this October drop in the survey of the Conference Board and this obvious pessimism in the form of anecdotal information, I'm not ready to push the panic button at this point Some of the recent data are a bit on the favorable side at least We had some upward revision in the payroll employment figures for August and September and the M2 numbers have turned around--not as much as I would like, but they've certainly turned around recently And the orders and production components of the National Association of Purchasing Managers [survey] in October were generally favorable So, I think the staff's revised forecast is reasonable And the risks on their projection are probably equally divided, although like Gary Stern--who I believe is the only other one who said this--I think they might even be tilted a little toward the up side So, we ought to approach this policy issue today very cautiously before we make any kind of major move toward ease   Would that be on Friday?   On the federal funds rate?   Mr Chairman, I'd like to suggest a compromise, which I guess would be controversial, though   Mr Chairman, there may be some people who still entertain doubts that Governor Lindsey is actually from the Fifth District, but he is wearing the Thomas Jefferson tie If you can arrange it, I think it would be good if you would call Terry Sandford and tell him you'd like him to come over and meet him; he would recognize the tie!   Mr Chairman, I think Governor Kelley has done us a real service in bringing this question up, and I would strongly support his recommendation seconded by you I'm particularly pleased that he listed price stability and then sustainable economic growth, since I feel so strongly that that is the route by which we reach sustainable economic growth So, I really like the order of those   Well, there were some others too--you included, I think   It will shorten the meetings; that's another advantage of it I wish I had thought to mention that!   What kind of insect is that white fly?   Mr Chairman, I think it's a very difficult time to forecast Of course, it's always hard but it is particularly difficult now Looking back, the vast majority of forecasts--and that certainly includes our forecast--underestimated the strength of the negative forces that are apparently working in the economy But I guess by now we really should realize that some of this restructuring and downsizing that we've seen in a lot of different industries will not only eliminate existing jobs--forever probably--but will also raise a lot of doubts in the minds of others about their job security, with predictable effects on consumer and business confidence I think we've all been aware that there are some important structural changes taking place in the economy, but we underestimated the extent to which they were restraining consumer income and spending And, of course, in this highly uncertain environment, the disinflation process is making it increasingly difficult for businesses to pass on any increase in prices The firms are naturally very reluctant to hire and are cautious about inventory management, not to mention capital expenditures This caution really augurs well for the long run because I think we're going to emerge with a much more competitive society than we had before But certainly in the short run it has some implications for the level of business activity and I think it's going to retard the recovery beyond what we had thought earlier  When you think about the structural changes and couple those with some cyclical changes occurring on top of them, it makes it very difficult to predict how strong and how persistent these restraining forces are going to be and to what extent they're going to be offset by the lagged effects of the considerable easing in monetary policy  -12-    12/17/91  we've done over a period of a number of months The Greenbook projections of the real economy strike us as reasonable and quite plausible, given what we now know We do think the staff might be a little high in their projections of inflation, although those are certainly reasonable But I believe the inflation outcome in [1992] is going to be a tad better than projected in the Greenbook if we can maintain the System's credibility about our long-term objectives That last point is a very crucial one as we move into this policy- setting process today Another measured step toward ease of the sort we've been taking for some time is probably appropriate now, but I think any more aggressive move would be quite counterproductive at this point   Don, I have been one of those who thought that M2 was flashing wrong signals I even went so far as to say in one of my more frivolous moments that it was as if I were experiencing colic like a baby who has lost his pacifier But looking at it now, as Governor Mullins indicated earlier, it might not have been flashing all the wrong signals What has happened has been along the lines of what you would have expected, taking it at face value   I think that's a much better answer than the one I suggested earlier You had warned us that there might not be [unintelligible]   Mr Chairman, I always feel very uncomfortable when I disagree with Tom Melzer, and I'm partly with him because I think we've done almost enough But if we adopt your proposal of moving [the funds rate] 1/4 point--and I would add a gratuitous bit of advice to the Board of Governors that they couple that with a 1/2 point cut in the discount rate--I think, and hope, that the market probably would conclude on its own that we've gone as far as we are going to go And some people will come out of the woodwork when they think rates have gone as low as they're going to go   I would be a little more leery of taking that second step because I think a 1/2 point move on the funds rate, even if it's done later on, might look surprisingly close to these ridiculous suggestions we've been getting with regard to fiscal policy I basically buy what you have suggested, but I share some of Tom's nervousness that we're almost there   I didn't hear it that way I'm sorry   When you invoke the proviso, if you have to, you would go 1/4 point and that's all?   I guess I'm the only one who is confused!   No, it's my fault   Mr Chairman, I think Peter has done an excellent job of outlining the history of this for us and he has made an excellent case for a high degree of liquidity That has been needed in part because we have had to offset reserves supplied through the discount window and also through foreign exchange operations The only point I would make is that a lot of us have reservations about how much we ought to deal in the foreign exchange market The changes in the discount mechanism and the law that was passed last year suggested that we lessen our emergency lending through the discount    3/31/92  window So, I think this gives us a little more opportunity after we've sopped up the reserves released by the reduction in reserve requirements and through the "encouragement at the margin"--I believe that's the term you used, Peter--toward getting longer-term securities If there is some premium on those rates, this could help to reduce that premium to some extent, although I don't really buy that argument to any great degree I think we have a little better case now for intervening than we did before but it's only a marginal case, and I don't feel very strongly about it We also would earn a little more from the Treasury if we did more, but who can tell? Maybe, we'd need more liquidity and a further reduction in the reserve requirements It was a good paper; I thought it was very, very good   Mr Chairman, there has been a marked change in the degree of optimism in our area, which seems to be very similar to what is happening in the rest of the country For example, in our recent regular survey of retailers and manufacturers for the Beigebook, we found more signs of optimism, both nationally and locally, than we had at any time since 1989 Contacts with our directors and others since then have pretty well verified that sort of sentiment And we are seeing in the actual figures some pickup in physical activity For example, new home sales and residential construction are rising pretty much across the District; and sales and production in industries related to housing--like furniture, textiles, and homebuilding products--are also picking up in strength At our last meeting, one of our most astute directors said he sees absolutely nobody who thinks the recession is not over The way he put it, the only question in people's minds is what the strength of the recovery will be  So, against that kind of regional background, and taking account of the latest information that we have gotten on a national basis, I think the staff was justified in making the upward revision in the forecast that it did The overall profile of the Greenbook is quite close to what we would expect The key question is where the risk of error lies And on this we come out a little differently from some of the others who have spoken in that we think the risk of error is on the high side even after these upward revisions in the forecast are taken into account That is because we continue to believe that the easing we put into effect in November and December was pretty strong medicine and that its full potential impacts have not yet shown up and probably are not captured fully in the Greenbook and other forecasts But we have less confidence in that now than we did because of the weakening in the behavior of M2 in March One of our economists did a simulation that suggested the widespread uncertainty about jobs probably was reducing consumption by maybe 2-1/2 percent from what it otherwise would be It's really an interesting study; it's econometric but nevertheless pretty revealing, and it sort of verifies what everybody assumed was happening  I'm happy to see that the staff still expects that the disinflation trend will continue and that inflation can be brought down somewhere below 3 percent by the second half of this year As the Greenbook notes, this projection is pretty much at odds with most of the current market expectations It's also at odds with most of the forecasts that we've seen, which call for an early increase in inflationary pressures as the economy improves But the difference between the staff forecast and these other forecasts now is that we can make ours happen if we play our cards right! And I'm increasingly confident that we will   Mr Chairman, I came prepared to argue for "B" symmetric I wanted to point out that we could move in either direction but that if the economy did strengthen, as I thought it most likely would, then we would look very omniscient to have moved at this particular time when this [directive] is released in late May But after absorbing the new numbers on M2 and listening to your other comments, I come closer to where you are The only difference I have  -34-    3/31/92  is that your disinheriting the P* model bothers me a little because I still have a lot of faith in that   That part I agree with; you made that very clear But there was a statement you made in the beginning against giving too much credit to the P* model  LAWARE He was being modest   I have a lot of faith in it because I don't think we have any evidence yet that there's not a shift in the secular trend of V2 But I would comfortably--   Well, I think it is, too As a matter of fact, if you take M2 at face value and say that we thought we had a reason to explain its weakness, it has pretty darn well predicted what happened even without any adjustments So, maybe it didn't lose some of its meaning I did think that we would be [tightening policy] and it would be nice to show that we anticipated this a little But I have some more doubts as a result of the behavior of the money numbers than I had That being true, I can put that off for another meeting At the next meeting I hope we will be able to move to symmetric language if events go our way between now and then   Mr Chairman, I agree fully I've never had very much sympathy for intervention, but I do remember the days that Jerry has alluded to when we had to draw on the swaps to get money to support the dollar And if we are going to continue [to intervene], which I hope we won't, our holdings could come in useful, as he says But I have never been sympathetic toward intervention and I'm glad we're going in the direction we're going   Mike, in reading the Greenbook, I concluded that you thought the first-quarter GNP, or rather GDP--I haven't made that transition completely--increased at a 3 percent rate Then in reading the briefing papers last night, I thought at first you were going to say 33 percent but then I looked at the chart and it appeared that it might go as high as 4 percent What is your best guess as to what that figure really might be?   That really would be something of a surprise to the private economy if it were that much, wouldn't it?   Mr Chairman, the staff forecast has changed really just a little since the last time We thought it was a good forecast then, and it still seems to be a reasonable forecast to us Certainly, most of the anecdotal and other information that we are getting in the Fifth District and also in the country as a whole is consistent with this relatively moderate rate of recovery that the staff is projecting  On the point regarding commercial real estate transactions, our Vice Chairman is a big real estate operator He does a large volume of business and also is a solvent real estate developer, which makes him an unusual breed He has been reporting for about two months now that commercial real estate is beginning to move Nothing new is being built, but it is beginning to move; the prices had  -12-    5/19/92  dropped to the point that they looked attractive He also always adds "and there's plenty of financing out there for it" This was not true a while back, but that's the way he has seen it for some two months And I think that's a pretty [reliable] reading because his firm operates in a lot of cities throughout the country  It's certainly true that both manufacturing activity and retail sales did appear to have decelerated a bit since we had the gains earlier in the year Nevertheless, most of our contacts believe that the recovery is here to stay this time That view was universal at our last board meeting, for example And for the most part they expect their own businesses and industries to grow at a solid, if something less than spectacular, rate over the months ahead These contacts cite a wide variety of leading indicators; they all seem to have their favorites, and those range from increasing trucking activity to reduced loan delinquencies to rising telephone hookups, and on and on  Even though I think the staff forecast is reasonable, it's certainly true that reasonable forecasts don't always come true So we have to ask, as we always should, where the risk lies And I think the risk of errors may be on the down side I'm bothered by this sharp deceleration in the rate of growth in M2, although I think your explanation comes very close to explaining why it has misbehaved, and I'm very sympathetic to that The apparent continued sluggishness in May is obviously a further risk on the down side, and it's a risk I worry about a great deal Still, I believe we can be fairly certain that the weakness that we had results from these special factors such as the lower non-withheld personal income tax payments and the movement into other kinds of assets, this substitution for M2-type balances My 85 year old mother-in-law, for example, is now out in the longer end of the market and that is something I never thought would take place! And I think we'll be better able to gauge--   Well, if we get the lower interest rates that the staff has projected she might take capital gains on that! Anyway, I think to be better able to read the significance of M2 we have to get a little further past April and the tax date  Now, on the other side, I think it's worth noting that the main differences between the staff forecast and most other forecasts is that the staff expects inflation to decline further this year and then hold steady next year Many of the other forecasters think inflation is going to bottom out this year and is going to be higher in the next few years The staff is also projecting, as I just mentioned, lower long-term interest rates over the period ahead and it seems as if most other forecasters expect interest rates to continue on an uptrend I see the Greenbook projection as more desirable, and it is certainly plausible But I believe the chances of achieving this are going to depend pretty highly on whether or not we make the right policy calls in the critical months ahead In particular, I think we have to convince the markets and the public that we are still determined to reduce inflation further even as we try to foster this budding recovery we apparently have under way The credibility of our long-term strategy is at a very crucial point right now and it's really on the line So, I think we need to do all we can to reinforce  -13-    5/19/92  this commitment that I think all of us in this room share to working inflation down over the longer run   Tell them to go long!   "B" symmetric, Mr Chairman, with your clarification about your reluctance to move in either direction unless we had some confirmation in the real economy as well as the aggregates I think you're dead right on that and I was going to throw that [comment] out had you not done it ahead of me Another thing we need to address is this alternative sentence proposed for the directive That sentence indicates we are expecting at least a moderate resumption of expansion in the aggregates, and I'd like to see that in there rather than the old sentence that we had   Mr Chairman, a while ago you said that statutorily the Treasury has the primary responsibility [for foreign exchange policy] I believe it would be safe to say, wouldn't it, that it also has that primary responsibility under the Constitution, just as Congress has the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof, which gives us primacy in the monetary policy area   That's what I was speaking of   Including the 5 percent interest on them, I suppose?    8/18/92   Well, they ought to have some value on accrued interest I would assume   That would seem a right unwelcomed message to send out   Mr Chairman, a while ago Si Keehn's analogy of an airplane reminded me of another mechanical analogy that I think is very pertinent here In the days when we first began to install antipollution equipment on automobiles I used to get terribly frustrated trying to get the car started and running very smoothly I've been experiencing the same sort of feeling about the economy with its fits and starts and near stalls But eventually we usually did get the car to run pretty smoothly, and I'm satisfied that sooner or later we're going to have the economy moving up at a smoother pace But I do think the downward revision that the staff has made in the forecast over the remainder of 1992 is clearly appropriate in view of the lackluster growth we've had in the economy since the end of the first quarter My guess is that the risks of errors are about evenly divided between the up side and the down side On the down side, for example, many of the factors that have been plaguing us in the recovery in recent months--such as the negative impact of this corporate restructuring, which I think augurs well for the long run but is terribly painful in the short run--are still around But it does mean increasing efficiency in the long run And I think the rise in productivity probably means a higher long-term growth potential than the 2 percent the staff is estimating We also have the slowing in defense expenditures; we have situations abroad where the economies are not really growing very fast; we have the oversupply of office space and other commercial real estate And maybe even more important in the minds of the consumer, there are a lot of non-economic worries such as crime and drugs and the breakdown of family values that I think have been making people less inclined to part with their dollars than they otherwise would be I believe this sort of thing is going to be with us for quite a while and is going to exert a drag on economic activity in the period ahead, and the weight of the drag  -22-    8/18/92  could even increase Of course, in addition to that we have the weakness in M2 We've explained a lot of that, I think, but I still have a nagging worry that there's some weakness there that we're really not explaining away by these special factors  But then one can look at the up side of this and say that there are at least some signs now that this might turn into a typical recovery--albeit a much less rapid recovery than we've usually had-- because of the decline in interest rates, which eventually I think is going to stimulate housing My expectations got a little setback with the data released this morning Certainly, sales of durable goods at the consumer level and also of producers durable equipment are going to be one of the stronger parts in the recovery when it comes And that, of course, will stimulate jobs and economic growth But having said that, I think it is important for us to recognize that there's a big downside risk and it's very serious I'm getting at the same sort of thing that Dick Syron was talking about a while ago  If these reduced Greenbook expectations turn out to be true, this could be pretty serious in terms of jeopardizing our strategy for getting to our long-term objectives We need to give that some consideration in our setting of short-term policy goals today Now, in the case of the long-term objective, I think the staff's estimate of the inflationary outlook is [about right]; we will certainly be moving closer to our goal by the end of 1994 That's obviously very encouraging to someone who thinks that the prime goal of monetary policy ought to be price stability But in the context of the staff's outlook, it seems to me that this further progress is dependent upon continued sluggishness of any projected recovery even as far out as the second half of 1994 Maybe this continued softness is necessary in order to get inflation down further But my own guess is that we can get the same kind of inflation results with stronger real growth in late 1993 and in 1994 if we maintain a visible commitment to our long-term objective of price stability, despite the current weakness in the economy And I think we ought not miss any chances to say that that is our ultimate long-term goal even though we recognize that we have some short-term problems on the side of weakness in the economy right now   Mr Chairman, ordinarily I'm biased very much in favor of symmetric language but I think your reasoning on why we shouldn't switch from one to the other and then back again is compelling So, I would say "B" asymmetric   I just want to commend those of you who had a part in the decision for having tried to urge the Treasury not to do this intervention I think you proved your point very well   The latest national reports--especially that of the National Association of Purchasing Managers, the employment figures, and the downturn in consumer expectations--have been very disheartening to say the least In light of those reports, I think the staff was correct in lowering its projection; what they've done seems pretty reasonable to me But I don't think anybody really understands why we are getting this persistent weakness in the economy In such a case it looks to me as if the risks of error on any kind of forecast are very high indeed I would be more hesitant to guess which way the risks of error might lie in this particular period of time  I do take a small measure of comfort in the most recent information we have gotten from around our District The economic picture may not be as bleak as suggested by the national data; some of the District information is [more current] For example, reports of our directors at the September meeting certainly did nothing to suggest that there would be any further decline in business activity in their view in our District The same is true of the reports that we got in our regular survey of manufacturers and retailers In fact, that survey actually suggested a slight improvement in a number of areas such as retail sales, manufacturing, business sentiment, and residential real estate And I think the recent growth in bank credit and money also presents at least a ray of hope about the future Indications that loans are now more available, as reported in the Greenbook, are pretty well consistent with what we are hearing in our District through anecdotal information While the 3 percent rate of growth in M2 in August and September is lower than I would like to see at this point, it's a big improvement over the negative rates of growth that we had for the previous five months I hope this could be the beginning of some sustained period of higher growth  Insofar as the inflation forecast is concerned, as you know, the Greenbook is showing a decline in the CPI down to a rate of about 2 percent by the end of 1994 That seems reasonable to me, given the sharp deceleration in money growth that we've had over the last several years If we were to achieve this low inflation rate, however, then I think we have to be prepared if necessary to let the federal funds rate rise rather quickly when economic activity and the rate of growth of money do speed up, although I hope what Governor Angell described is really what will happen in that case I'll return to this point later when we get to the policy discussion   Mr Chairman, I think the policy decision that we face this morning is, as Don said, essentially a matter of weighing the risk of a renewed deterioration in the economy against the risk that a further easing at this juncture will damage our credibility and might not do any good in any event My real preference, reading the tea leaves the way I do, is to do something now--move a quarter point --but I can accept your formulation of "B" with an asymmetric directive But I want to underscore what Jerry Jordan said This decision would be a lot easier if we had cut those targets back in July Governor Angell and I felt strongly enough about advocating a cut in the [1992] targets [in July 1991] that we actually dissented on [the vote to retain them] But if we do cut them regularly, I think we establish the credibility whereby we can make these short-term lowering [moves] without scaring the market half to death because we would reassure them that we have not lost sight of our long-term targets   But not on the merits of the case!   Thank you very much, Mr Chairman I'll be perfectly willing to send you a letter if I think you're going astray, and I hope you will heed that letter!   I don't have a fax machine but I'm thinking about getting one   What you really want to ask is how we were able to exclude this before we found out it was a sin!   Mr Chairman, I agree with Bob Forrestal I think that Mr Gonzalez's purpose really is to politicize the Federal Reserve, and he hopes to do that by exposing our deliberations So, I think he's not really asking for [earlier release of] our actions He knows those fairly soon, although one could argue that we could make them available a little sooner What he wants to know is the deliberations I was around here when we gave up the memoranda of  -62-    11/17/92  discussion; I hated to see it [discontinued], although I understood the reason why the Committee did it I chatted with Chairman Burns about it at the time and he said he too hated to see them go because they do have valuable information for scholars--admittedly only a few [of them are interested]--but the memoranda do have some valid information for those inside and outside the System I think we would be wise to resume preparing them I doubt that would inhibit our discussions and deliberations at all if they were released, say, three years or even two years later And we would be responding to a point you made which I think is very real That maybe we do have a responsibility for making available to the public something more than we are now doing And I don't think that would inhibit our discussions For example, would you mind tomorrow if someone told people what you had said two years ago at an FOMC meeting? My view is "no"   Well, you mean they would get out sooner than the lag we would set?  SPEAKER(?) Yes   Well, it takes a while to write them! It's one heck of a job Norm will tell you that And I may have lost a friend!   Mr Chairman, we come out very close to the staff projections on the real side of the economy, and they in turn are generally in line with what most private forecasters are saying in that they call for a gradual recovery Our guess is that the risk has now shifted to the [up side] For the first time I think we see some signs that the economy may really be beginning to move a bit For example, a substantial portion of the latest data, both nonfinancial as well as financial, has been at least somewhat stronger than expected Prospects for consumer spending in particular look much better than I thought they would look; they strike us as really rather bright when coupled with the apparent upswing in consumer confidence    11/17/92  as reported in the Michigan Survey for early November And the apparent acceleration in commercial lending at banks is another favorable financial sign Also, the anecdotal information that we've been picking up around our District has been considerably more upbeat lately than it had been for a couple of months Our directors' comments in particular have been better for two successive months than they were before that And their comments for the last couple of years have been pretty darn good leading indicators Somehow or other this group we have now has been better able to call the movements in the economy than almost any group of directors we've had in the past And this is what they're telling us Now, we're all aware, of course, that these developments can prove to be pretty transitory We have had a lot of fits and starts in this frustrating recovery period that we've been through Nevertheless, I believe [the improvement] may be real this time  Let me make just one final comment about the inflation projections that the staff has made Over the last several years, I've often been accused of being much too optimistic about inflation A lot of that stems from my deep faith in the wisdom of this Committee to do what needs to be done I think our policy has been excellent for many years now Now I think we're seeing some evidence that my optimism about inflation is beginning to be realized We've made tremendous progress If you look at the staff projection of 2 percent inflation in the CPI for '94, for example, I think we've gotten very close to what really amounts to zero inflation, taking into account the errors of measurement in that measure And I express one parting hope That the Committee will continue to behave as it has in the past If you do, my fellow pensioners and I will forever be grateful to you for your fine work!   Mr Chairman, I have a strong preference for lowering the ranges by a full percentage point, although I don't think your suggestion of 2 to 6 percent would be all that bad I don't think this is a purely technical issue, though I think this [affects] our credibility Governor Angell and I argued unsuccessfully for such a move back in 1991 In 1992 I did not argue for it because I thought we were clearly in a recession and it would look bad at that point But I do think we would have done better if we had moved it back at that time Now, the technical case is very strong Don and his colleagues, Messrs Feinman and Porter, have done a great job in showing that 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent is technically a very good place for the range to be But that gives us just a little bit of margin We would be just above the 1-1/2 percent lower limit if they're right in their assumption that 2 percent growth in M2 is what we would get and that velocity would behave as they suspect But the 5-1/2 percent on the up side gives us a lot of room for movement in case the economy turns out to be stronger than they have assumed, and I believe that is one of the more likely outcomes As far as the timing is concerned, it would look unnecessarily provocative if we did this now unless we were also to ease our short-term [policy] just a little and couple the two actions I would prefer to wait until February to do it I think we would experience less political flak if we did that  So, I feel pretty strongly that we ought to go with "B," and I would like to see the directive made symmetric If we do decide, though, to change the federal funds rate today and lower it a little, then I think we ought to go ahead and couple that with a lowered long- term range I'm not as skeptical as Bill McDonough is about how the markets would accept this I think there are a lot of people out there who would find that somewhat acceptable But if we lower the federal funds rate, I think we definitely should lower that longer-run range or else we'll be perceived as having thrown in the towel on inflation I guess I end up about where Governor LaWare and Governor Angell did on that   Mr Chairman, I know you prefer to explain it as a technical move, but do you think it's purely technical?   I don't   Well, the technical argument is very strong, but I think there are some people who still entertain doubts about how serious we are about achieving price stability, and I think they will  -45-    11/17/92  take this as a concrete sign that we may be more serious than they thought before   More than we've ever had; I wouldn't argue that   I agree that that's exactly the position of everybody in this room, but I'm not sure that the public is completely convinced at this point But I don't want to let this--   That's right And since that yield sits up there where it does, I think that is some evidence   That's right   I don't think it reflects entirely, but some part of it--   You think you have an ally and so does Governor Angell!
