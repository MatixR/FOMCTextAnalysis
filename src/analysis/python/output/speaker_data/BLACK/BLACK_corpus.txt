 Mr Chairman, I think the staff has done an unusually good job in describing the outlook, and I know Mike has done a very exceptional job in handling some very difficult questions I guess I come out pretty close to where Frank Morris is on this I think that the recent spate of statistics indicates that the economy is really beginning to strengthen quite a bit and a lot of that apparently is resulting from improved exports I would sort of discount the last figures we got from Census on the trade balance on the grounds that you have a lot of price increases of imported goods in there, and price increases on oil, and probably some anticipatory buying because of the oil problems and also because of protectionist legislation So, if this is true, then I think we could see some bigger figures than the staff is projecting We are approaching the end of the fifth year of economic expansion at a time when we would expect bottlenecks to begin to appear, and I think they are in some industries This is the kind of environment in which we could see wage and cost pressures begin to turn around from what we have been fortunate to have had in the immediate past, along with this further heightening of inflationary pressures and attendant upward pressure on long-term interest rates So, I think it's a situation where we have to increase the care with which we look at the situation; we're now in a different era from where we were a couple of months or so ago   As Bob Parry indicated, Mr Chairman, a number of us at the last meeting thought that we were probably going to have to let interest rates rise over the next 12 to 18 months if we were going to prevent this underlying rate of inflation from accelerating And it seems to me that this expectation is even more likely now, in view of the information that we have had since then At the same time, I am not exactly sure when it will be appropriate for us to take that action; but I believe that it will probably be sooner than I would  -28-    8/18/87 -29-  have thought at the time of the last meeting I am also well aware that the history of the System has been that, generally, we have not moved fast enough against inflation So, I tend to try to compensate for that Despite that, since there is a good deal of uncertainty out there, I believe the best case for now is to stick with alternative B I would make it asymmetrical with the "would" on the tightening side and the "might" on the other I think the Board staff's statement with regards to the "as well as" clause does suggest that it would be helpful to shift that around to deemphasize the borrowing side; as for the weakness of the dollar, that may deserve some further thought I think there is also another argument that we ought to put restraint of the business expansion high on that list if we are going to change the list around And I would not put in that sentence on the undershoot of the aggregates at all And I say this with the sneaking suspicion that later on down the road, I am going to look back and say, "I wish I had been where Jerry Corrigan and those others were"   Following up on Chairman Greenspan's comment, Peter, suppose that in the next maintenance period you do come in pretty close to $600 million and the market now expects $500 to $600 million Would you expect much rate movement if you got closer to that figure?   Mr Chairman, most of the comments have been directed at particular parts of the forecast My feeling the last time was that the economy would be somewhat stronger than the Greenbook was projecting, and the staff, indeed, have moved their forecast in that general direction So, we have very little quarrel with what they have done We think the main driving force is going to be an improvement in net exports of goods and services; and plant and equipment expenditures, particularly in the equipment area, also provide a pretty good push If we were to guess, we would say the risk might still be that the forecast is a little low But really what bothers us, I guess, is the feeling that they might be right on this forecast In saying that, I'm focusing on the inflation rate that they are projecting for next year--when it goes up to 4-1/2 percent I think we ought to be able to do better than that for next year, and we ought to target something less than that A 4-1/2 percent inflation rate could easily become 5 percent; and 5 percent is not really reasonable price stability So, rather than thinking they may have overestimated, we're afraid that they might be about right and have come up with some results that are a little too strong on the price side   Mr Chairman, I'm afraid I owe some apology for having discussed my thoughts on the state of the US economy at a time you wanted to consign to questions So let me just address that last question you posed as best I can, which is not very well I think you have to look at the negative correlation we have had between exchange rates and long-term interest rates since the fall of 1986 to get an answer to that There are three possible explanations one is that this has resulted from still a third factor, which is the rise in inflationary expectations A second--and maybe the most popular explanation of it--is that this decline in the dollar rate has been a decline in the real rate because of the persistently larger trade deficits that we have had, and fears that this will be reflected in higher import prices, which also will spill over into the prices of goods from those industries that compete with imports And the third explanation is that the rates may be high because the market is responding to what it thinks we are likely to do; but if that is the case, tightening would clearly be inappropriate because that would mean, I think, that a large part of that was real My impression has been that there really hasn't been that much response at the long end  -23-    9/22/87  to actions that we have taken For example, the response to what I thought was a very strong statement via the discount rate increase and also the raising of the borrowed reserve level was big at the short end; but we didn't really have all that much response at the long end So, that suggests to me that some part of this is probably real I guess I would end up with a view along the lines that Jerry first outlined, and some others have endorsed, that part of this is real and part of this is inflationary expectations I don't know what the mix is and I guess nobody else does But, I believe both factors are at work, I'm afraid   I do too   Mr Chairman, you might think in view of how I stressed the unacceptability of the forecast for next year that I would be advocating "C" as Bob Parry did, but I really think the steps we have taken already have been pretty strong In fact, we haven't even implemented all we agreed to do last time, so I would not favor anything beyond "B", particularly since I think that there has been a rise in real rates Also, we have had pretty subdued behavior on the part of the aggregates But I wouldn't want the symmetrical part of it because I just don't see the likelihood that we would want to ease during this period As a general rule, I'd rather it be symmetrical because I don't think we usually know; but I think something would be read into it if we eliminated the asymmetry this time   Could we rephrase that and say we did not change policy rather than we did nothing?   There's a constitutional basis for that position   Mike, with businesses having become so much leaner and meaner in recent years and increasingly willing to bring about permanent layoffs and temporary layoffs, some of our contacts have been telling us that if the downturn does intensify, they would expect the unemployment rate to jump pretty sharply because of this changing attitude on the part of businesses Does that seem reasonable to you? If so, have you factored it into these high unemployment rates that you are projecting here?   I agree pretty much with your forecast It just struck me as an interesting thought, since business people seem to feel that they will not hesitate this time like they sometimes have in the past   It is interesting that they got so much leaner with such a big rise too in the participation rate in the labor force It seems to have happened   He may see some jumps of other types too   This seems to be a day of confessions, Mr Chairman, and I will have to join those who confess that they don't have much confidence in their own projections I have less now than I typically do, of course, which is saying that I don't have a great deal We have these two elements of uncertainty to be sure first, we don't know what the impact of the decline that has occurred in the stock market thus far is going to be; second and more importantly, we don't know how much further domestic and foreign markets may decline And I don't think a further decline is a risk we can completely rule out So, the uncertainty level is extremely high But we don't know the answers to these questions Assuming that the market settles down somewhere in the 1900-2100 range, I think the staff's forecast is pretty reasonable; I don't think we could improve on that a great deal That seems to be what the business people in our District feel; at least that's what we have been able to uncover up until now But I do think there's a lot of risk in this, regardless of where you come out It is clear to me that there has been a big blow to inflation and to inflationary expectations in the short run from this But if the decline turns out to be as moderate as the staff has projected, and as we have endorsed, I don't think it's unreasonable to suppose that by the middle or last half of next year the same kind of worries that we had on the inflation front earlier might reemerge And I think that we ought to have that in mind as a definite possibility as we address what we do in the immediate future, because the effects of actions we take now are going to be felt down the road, and we ought to be well aware that that possibility is at least out there   I think the point at which you arrive has to be dependent in part on what you think really happened to the stock market whether it came from real shocks or liquidity shocks or some combination I lean to the view that it was more real, along the lines of what Frank Morris was describing earlier, in that the earnings-price ratios had gotten totally out of line with the bond yield And then there were a couple of sparks that set it off the problems in the Persian Gulf and the likelihood that we were going to enact some very severe protectionist legislation At the same time, I think there were liquidity shocks once this happened And I think we met those liquidity shocks, as we ought to in such a case, when we issued a statement that we would provide liquidity But as far as these real shocks are concerned, I don't think there's a lot that we can do about that through policy So, I would come out, I think, right where you did on this, Mr Chairman And like Ed Boehne, I would look through the borrowing to the federal funds rate and [seek a rate] of around 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent, which I had interpreted as being a little on the easy side of "B" as it was written in the Bluebook, but which you now have convinced me is really what you had in mind In view of the way in which this directive is going to be dissected, I think it would be good to go with Variant I But there are a couple of references in there that would bother me and might confuse the market If you look at the references to greater flexibility on lines 105 and 106 of the draft that was distributed with the brown cover, that need for greater flexibility, I think, could be a little confusing to the market It isn't clear to me what it means and I don't think it would be clear to the market I would hasten to add that this reference to our intention to ensure adequate liquidity is perfectly clear to me and I think it's obviously appropriate So, on the wording of this, I would tend to end up the same way Governor Angell did in saying somewhat lesser restraint "would" and slightly greater restraint "might"   It is something we don't have a lot of control over   Mr Chairman, I don't think it's all that different from what we have, in fact, done We have had this wide range but it has been understood that we have had a borrowing number that was associated with a much narrower federal funds range And we didn't change that [sentence] then I think we probably would have met and changed that borrowing level or changed it without meeting   You can say way back when they--   Mr Chairman, I think there are two key questions here that we need to consider One is whether or not the funds rate gives us the right signals if we target borrowed reserves, which has been addressed by the staff The other is whether or not it's really easier--from a political standpoint, or to follow up on Jerry Corrigan's point, because of inertia--to [make a policy] move under the borrowed reserve procedure Generally, the federal funds rate probably does move in the right direction to give the correct signal when we are using a borrowed reserve target But there are times when    12/15-16/87  it doesn't For example, in 1984, around the time of the Continental Illinois Bank crisis, Chuck Partee had to reassure the markets through an article in The New York Times that we were targeting borrowed reserves and that the rise in the federal funds rate did stem from banks' unwillingness to borrow--that it really didn't have anything to do with a tightening of policy at that particular time Also, right before the market crash on the 19th, I think there was a perception in the market that we probably would tighten at a time when we really didn't want that to happen In general, a borrowing target probably works [to give the right signal] but it doesn't always work that way  There's a lot to Jerry's argument that there is inertia when operating under a federal funds target; the Committee, just because it doesn't know where the funds rate ought to go, is less apt to move There is also some substance, I think, to the political argument that it gives us a certain degree of protection if we can say we really don't control the federal funds rate, we control borrowed reserves At least at one time I think that did alleviate some of the concerns of Congress and gave us some protection I'm not sure that's the case much anymore, except maybe in the case of some Congressmen The market seems to look through this and be reasonably certain that we have in mind a certain level or range for the federal funds rate Moreover, if the borrowing really doesn't change and the federal funds rate does change, they tend to think that's really what we want So, I would be inclined to do something like alternative (3), which is to go back to borrowed reserve targeting but pay a little more attention to the federal funds rate when it is not behaving in the way we think it ought to, and deal with it on an ad hoc basis But my real hope is that we can do what Bob Heller suggested--if we can ever get the aggregates behaving more normally--and that is, make some institutional changes and move toward a nonborrowed reserve target, which would have certain desirable automatic features that would enable us to ease or tighten without having to take discretionary actions I would hope that at some point we can move in that direction because now what the market gets is largely demand- determined and I think there ought to be a larger element of supply- determined in there than we have now because of the misbehavior of the aggregates   Unless the uncertainty is completely behind us, I think if we were to try to go in that direction, we'd have to make a public announcement that we thought enough of the uncertainty was behind us that we were going back to a borrowed reserve target We should do that so the swings in the federal funds rate that would probably result would not be misinterpreted   Yes, pretty quickly; but the first two or three days they would read all sorts of changes in policy into that, I would think   Mr Chairman, as Governor Angell was talking about the federal funds rate being what the market thought we wanted it to be, I remembered a day back in the early 1960s, which was before Peter Sternlight was Manager, when the open market wire said, in effect, that the federal funds rate was hanging at around 2-7/8 percent, or whatever it was at the time, out of respect for what the market thinks the Federal Reserve System's intentions are That has always stuck in my mind and I think there is some of that right now   And I'm not going to get more   Well, a New York press officer does announce that there is a special situation borrowing in there without giving an exact amount   It was in the days of trying to sell membership and this was one of the--   Don, I think you made an excellent case for not targeting M1A or Ml for the coming year Do you entertain any hope, as I do--although it's becoming a lingering hope, I guess--that at some point depository institutions are going to alter their pricing procedures on NOW accounts and OCDs so that they will reduce the interest elasticity of M1 and make it a better target? Or is there hope that the demand for M1 will become more stable as this adjustment process to deregulation goes further?   I will confess to this group that, with considerable pain, I share that feeling   Mr Chairman, I share Tom's longing for something like that that we can anchor our decisions to; otherwise we have nothing but a series of ad hoc decisions that are disconnected to a  -27-    12/15-16/87  certain degree I feel very uncomfortable with that because I don't think we're really smart enough to do it If there is something we can hang our hats on, I sure would feel a lot better That's why I'm so disappointed that M1 has lost some of that value that it once had I would encourage experimentation along these lines There has to be something out there that we can hang our hats on   But, if this is as unreliable as you say, suppose nominal GNP is not growing fast enough and you push interest rates down and the money supply slows down You really haven't necessarily moved in the right direction, even though--   Sometimes   Mr Chairman, I would just like to take issue with Jerry Corrigan a little about the reserve requirement system being irrational It is rational if you think M1 is the thing that you ought to control because all the requirements are lagged except those against M1 deposits So, if M1 were really what you wanted to control, you would figure out how much you needed in reserves for those other types of deposits, supply that, and anything else you put out would be used to support M1 and only M1 If M1 is your target, the only thing that would be more rational, I think, would be to have 0 percent requirements against everything that wasn't in M1; but, if M1 is of no value anymore--although I think it once was--then it is irrational The reserve requirement system was set up that way because at that time the prevailing feeling was that M1 was really the best of the targets And I think it was   No, I'm talking about the fact that we lag some reserve requirements and don't lag the others   Okay I thought I finally understood something and now I find out I haven't understood that either!   I agree with that on the monetary base And when I said I had sympathy with Tom, it wasn't that I was favoring a monetary base I meant that I had sympathy for some kind of an anchor to hang policy on, and if he could demonstrate [unintelligible]--   Well, I don't think the use of the base as a target will necessarily imply a steady rate of growth in that You would figure out what non-monetary liabilities were using up in the way of reserves, supply that and then supply the amount you thought was necessary to support whatever kinds of monetary aggregates you wanted That doesn't say to me that it has to be a steady rate   You might not want to ask him; he may have gone to sleep!  -36-    12/15-16/87   Has this switching to diversified portfolios had much downward effect on the dollar?   I would say switching had to have had some effect, even though I'm not much of an interventionist   Would you go so far as to say that recession is almost inevitable to get a desirable result?   Is business saving rising as well as personal saving?   You almost have to have a rise in business saving as well as personal, I would think, under that scenario   That's what I was implying that you would have rising capital consumption allowances and profits   That's what really bothers me more than anything else, I guess   I really don't have much to say I think the staff did an exceptionally good job on the Greenbook, and Mike really covered all the caveats that we now are throwing out I'm sympathetic with what Governor Kelley said about worrying about the aggregates To use your metaphor, Mr Chairman, we don't know if the plumbing has been reconnected or not; but I do strongly suspect that it will be reconnected before we know it has And I'm wondering if these could be flashing danger signals But, on the other side of that, the employment [outlook] from the National Association of Purchasing Managers report was extremely strong We went back and telephoned the contacts that we usually talk to when we produce the Beige Book to see if we could find any evidence that there were changes in expectations or sales We looked at 25 retailers, for example, and 18 said that recently their sales definitely had been running well above what they were last year; only three said they were down   Well, Martha, I was going to get to this in a minute, and say you were spending more than Si Keehn, because the  in Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia, said that sales were exceptionally strong In Washington, they were running 16 percent ahead; in Baltimore 13 percent ahead; and in Philadelphia 18 percent ahead   Dollars   There's a lot of discounting, so I don't know if it's more or less If there's more, then that means that you have  -57-    12/15-16/87  more volume, really, than these figures would imply We also looked at our industrial--   It's since Thanksgiving, which is really the beginning of the Christmas season She was very optimistic, much more so than  But it was really amazing to us that we couldn't find more evidence; nobody had scaled down estimates of what would happen next year In looking at the industrial contacts it's pretty much the same sort of thing So I guess you can just summarize their responses by saying that going into the details just didn't show any real signs of weakening at this point So, for what that's worth-  It makes me feel better than I thought I would feel at this time following the crash on October 19   It's the sort of scenario that would worry Jerry Corrigan   How about Peter in consultation with the Chairman?   Mr Chairman, I would maintain our basic policy stance that's indicated by a federal funds rate centered on 6-3/4 percent I think we ought to continue the present operating procedures for the period immediately ahead but I'd like to take advantage of some of these year-end pressures to allow the funds rate to begin to move around a bit more than it has Then as we move into the new year, I'd like to go to alternative (3) whether or not there's an announcement effect, as indicated in Don's and Peter's memo I guess that would call at that time for about $400 million in borrowing I would keep the asymmetrical language unless we remove the sentence that says, "still sensitive conditions in the financial markets"   No, I'm saying I would keep it asymmetric, as it now is, unless we remove the reference to still sensitive conditions   Don, what did you say for M1 for '88?   Well, as I indicated yesterday, Mr Chairman, I was very close to Frank Morris and very close to Jerry I suppose at this point I'm a little closer to Frank in that I'm not as sure as my colleagues in Richmond are that we will have the weakness in the first part of the year But I think there is a distinct risk that by the end of the year the economy will really be rolling and there may be stronger upward pressure on prices and wages than most people are now expecting That would put us in a very difficult situation, and a dangerous one I think, given the advanced stage of the expansion So, my feeling is that reducing the risks of that kind of scenario playing  -35-    2/9-10/88  itself out ought to be one of the principal goals, if not the principal goal, of long-run policy So I would opt for alternative III Ordinarily, I think the Bluebook tends to favor the middle alternative, but I thought this time, Don, you did an excellent job in defending alternative III with your 6 percent midpoint If the economy should be a little weaker in the first part of the year, then the 7-1/2 percent limit ought to be enough to accommodate that and also some downdrift in interest rates But I think more importantly, dropping the range a full percentage point rather than just 1/2 of a percentage point, as we tentatively decided in July, would send a strong, and I think a very reassuring, signal to the markets and the public that the System is looking beyond the immediate softness in business activity towards the potentially more serious threat of excessive and rapid inflation later on And if we voted for that, I think you could make that point very strongly in your testimony I know you'd get some flack on that from some members of Congress, but I think that would be muted by the recent strength in the aggregates and the significant drop in interest rates I think, in the end, we'd be a whole lot better off from the standpoint of political pressure, if M2 growth didn't come out in the lower half of the range but somewhere near the midpoint And I think we have a better chance to do that with alternative III than with alternative II   What's wrong with a longer-than-usual coffee break?   Well, there are other things to do out there   The reason--   Mr Chairman, I've been in Frank Morris' camp in thinking that expenditures on plant and equipment, along with net exports of goods and services, would be the real driving force in the economy You pointed out that he may have overlooked the foreign part of that But that would suggest that one of the two, anyway, increases a good deal I guess the thing that puzzled me so much in the fourth-quarter figures that were released was the sharp decline in producers' durable equipment One of our contacts who specializes in watching the computer industry attributed this to the  And he feels    2/9-10/88  that this is a much weaker pattern of expenditures than we really had Does that sound sensible?   I guess I still find that hard to believe in view of what I thought was happening I know you mentioned in the Greenbook that a good part of this was computer equipment And that's the reason I raise this question about  That is different from the way most of the other computer companies report the figures I don't know whether there is any truth in what this fellow said or not, but he seemed to know what he was talking about And it confirmed my suspicions, though I was hoping you could lend some support to that hypothesis   This fellow said he talked to That probably  was the exact reason; I hadn't thought about that, which is now [unintelligible]--  SPEAKER(?) Yes, but I thought the decline was 38 percent If I read this one [correctly,] it's 72 percent in the fourth quarter Where did I get that 38?   Mr Chairman, it doesn't look as if we have that many differences for the year as a whole with the Board staff's forecast We are sort of in the same camp--which probably makes you very nervous, Mike But I think what's coming out in this discussion is that the shape or the profile is probably more important for policy than taking the year as a whole Several people have indicated that they think the weakness in the first half, as a result of the inventory correction, may be greater than the staff is projecting Most of my colleagues at Richmond share that feeling My feeling is that the staff has it about right But I think that, in either case, there's a distinct risk that we can have more strength in the latter part of the year than people in general have been thinking--in view of the turnaround in the aggregates, the shape of the decline in interest rates, and also the obvious strength in the industrial sector So I think this is something we ought to bear very closely in mind as we address the policy issue because we may have a short-term problem, from the policy standpoint, that is quite different from what we may have later in the year And that will influence what I will say later on with regard to the various alternatives   [Unintelligible] now 75 percent of the developers are committed   Don, I didn't see any mention of your borrowing targets under any of these alternatives [in the Bluebook]   I'm sorry, I remember having seen that I was just looking for it in a different place and couldn't find it   That threw me off   And I've even got it underlined so I have no excuse for not having remembered exactly what you had I thought that's probably what it was, but I just wanted to make sure   You want to identify it? It wasn't on the agenda   Mr Chairman, I would favor "B", but I'd like to see the average level of the federal funds rate near the lower end of this projected 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent range I think there's a good chance that the relationship between the level of borrowing and the federal funds rate is going to continue to surprise us from time-to- time in the weeks ahead So, I'd like to maintain this flexibility in the operating procedures that we have, and retain the sentence that's on lines 103 to 107 of the directive in this form  As far as the long run is concerned, I would stick with alternative III The statement that I'm really trying to make is that I think there is uncertainty in the economy now We have to be accommodative and make sure that that doesn't become serious But my suspicion is that it's not going to be all that bad So we want to be careful in the long run not to waken fears that we have thrown in the towel on the inflation issue, yet at the same time show sensitivity to the weakness that has been evident recently   Consistent   Yes, I had the same problem   Mr Chairman, I'm glad that you raised this issue because I share a lot of these frustrations that Manley has voiced I have thought for some time that we were having a problem with choosing a borrowed reserve level and getting what we wanted in the way of federal funds behavior A lot of unexpected behavior is short-lived and doesn't really have much impact But frequently, the deviations  -11-    3/29/88  are rather long and rather large; and in effect, I think they end up changing the stance of monetary policy that the Committee wants and misleading the market, too As Manley stated very well, I think the federal funds rate is the most important thing in determining the demand for money and the behavior of the aggregates over time And I think that the Committee has been confused by this, because at times we've gotten federal funds rates that were not what we'd expected at all and that has led to some misunderstanding For example, at the last meeting we had some discussion about what had transpired in the previous meeting  Now, there are a couple of arguments that have been advanced in favor of borrowed-reserve targeting The first of these is that you can get movements in anticipation of where we should go that are generated on the part of the market We've looked at that fairly closely and sometimes this happens; but it just doesn't look to us as if the empirical evidence is really overwhelming on that You certainly can find a number of instances--Manley cited some, and there are others--where the market has moved the federal funds rate in a way that we didn't want it to move The Continental situation and right before the October 19th crash, I think, are two notable examples So, I don't think that argument holds a lot of water But I think the important argument, and really the reason why we went to this procedure, was basically a political one We were afraid that we could not move the federal funds rate as much as we really felt we ought to, unless we obfuscated in some way We're not really moving the federal funds rate, we're targeting reserves and the markets have driven the funds rate up That may have had some validity at the time, and I had some sympathy for it But as time goes on, I've become more and more concerned about a procedure that really involves trying to fool the public and the Congress and the markets, and at times fooling ourselves in the process  What I'd like to suggest, if we have time for it, is an alternative procedure that might conceivably be satisfactory for both sides The procedure would be to establish a band for the federal funds rate, let's say a weekly average of 50 basis points, that would be understood to be the range in which we would operate during the intermeeting period The beginning point would be the midpoint of that, but the Desk, in consultation with you, Mr Chairman, would have the freedom to move anywhere within that 50-point range This would give us some leeway for market forces to work And it could be understood that if the federal funds rate moved out of this range, then there would be consultation with the Committee I think that this would be very clear to all of us and that it would work much better, because now we sometimes get federal funds rates that we didn't vote for and didn't want So, I think a move in that direction would be very helpful and clearly would be more honest I would hate to have to defend what we have been doing on the grounds that, in a sense, we really don't want people to know what we are up to I'd rather stand up, as Manley says, like a man, and do what we have to do But I do understand the other argument, because in '79, I'm sure we would not have gotten some people to vote for the new procedure if they had not thought that it provided a cover for doing something they didn't think that they could get away with I've heard members of the Committee state that So it's not something to disregard lightly; but I think that our long-term credibility can be damaged if we use that as a cover-up for what we're really doing  -12-    3/29/88   I think that it was the very hot political environment that made us reluctant to do that You know, interest rates were getting pretty high about that time There was a lot of pressure on us and we knew that we had to do something And we had to make it palatable so we didn't get shot out of the water as soon as we began to move I think--I don't know if others would agree--that's why we did it at that time I thought that we would end up targeting the money supply; but I think most of the people in the room really thought it was a way that they could get the federal funds rate up more than they otherwise could get away with, in that kind of highly charged political environment That's the way that I read it I don't know; Jerry or some of the others who were here might see it somewhat differently   I think you can argue that, for some people, it's a little easier to move the borrowing target I argued as you did I don't think we ought to do that But I do think that some people would be more likely to move at the point in the cycle in which we usually make our worst mistakes [unintelligible] cycle   I mentioned it   Mr Chairman, I think maybe I ought to clarify some of my statements I would like to say, first of all, that I'm very sympathetic to what Governor Angell had to say that what we really ought to do is control the supply of reserves in such a manner that we control whatever monetary aggregate is going to determine the level of prices over the long run I don't think we can really, in the long run, control real variables; all we can control are nominal ones I think the objective ought to be stable prices And that's the way I would want to do it If we ever get to that millennium, I think that required reserves are probably going to be the best target for us against whatever aggregate we settle on And I wouldn't want any bands on the federal funds range at all; I would want that to be free to move enough to allow us to hit that target What I was talking about earlier was this interim period where the demand for money has been unstable and our present procedures call for us to try to gauge the dimensions of the demand for money and set the operating variable that will best give us the kind of results we want And I think that's the federal funds rate  So far as this issue of discretion is concerned, I did not mean to take away your flexibility I was trying to suggest a band that was reasonable--that would be agreeable to the whole Committee as an operating range within which you could adjust the rate I'd like to use the whole band--that 50-basis-point-average range that I talked about--and just have some understanding that if we went beyond that, you would consult with the Committee There was some discussion, as you remember, at the last meeting that maybe we shouldn't have changed the borrowed reserve target without consultation I didn't hold that view, but some did And I thought it was important that we reach some agreement on when there would be a consultation and that's the reason I suggested it But, basically, I don't want to do this over the long run with the federal funds rate at all I want to do it with reserves, somehow measured, if we can get back to a more rational financial [unintelligible] So, that's where I come out My recommendation applies only to the interim period that we're in, and if I thought that this would prevent our going back to [reserve targeting]--Lee, as you said--let me change my position   Let me change my position because I want to get, I think, where you want to get And if this would jeopardize that, then I've made a bad mistake   I know; traditionally, it has been very long   Is that your entire statement, Roger?   Say that again   I think these upward revisions that the staff has made are perfectly appropriate, Mr Chairman, in light of the data we have gotten since the last meeting I keep thinking about a remark someone made then about how nice it would be if we could hold onto these things--the low unemployment and the rate of growth for the sixth and now the seventh year of expansion--still without much pickup in prices I'd buy that scenario any time and I guess a lot of other people would too I suppose some people might think that this is a rather rosy scenario, but I really think the danger lies on the other side that we may get too much strength in the economy, more than we now anticipate, and this might stimulate a sharp increase in inflationary expectations with the predictable fallouts on the dollar and US interest rates And I believe that that is a risk we can do something about with monetary policy I think we ought to be concerned about it, and in that connection, I would be getting a little concerned about the strength in the aggregates I would really be concerned if that continues for another month or so in the face of apparent strength in the economy I am not yet suggesting that the aggregates have gotten to the point where we ought to place as much emphasis on them as we did a few years ago, but I think they now may be giving us better information about the economy than they were a while back I think it would be wise to pay a little more attention to them than to try to appraise the strength of the business outlook as we have been doing the last several months   Mr Chairman, I think the staff has made an excellent case in its forecast for an early move It's true we have made a couple of moves recently, and I think they have been timely and very appropriate But I remember so many times sitting around this table when this was the apparent stage of a business cycle where traditionally we have made our largest mistakes So I think we ought to move now I think you've given us wise counsel in suggesting we hold that $100 million increase in the borrowed reserve figure; and I would buy that, with an asymmetric directive I'd like to get rid of that language about the unusual flexibility I think that's unduly fuzzy and just confuses people And I'd like to keep open that option that we would go the other $100 million if, after two or three weeks, it looks as if we need to In short, "B"   Initially; maintain initially   Mr Chairman, could I ask for some estimate of the length of time before we move?   At the most?   That's right  -14-    5/17/88   You haven't ruled out the $200 million, have you?   No, but I mean over time, after you've moved the $100 million, if these contingencies--   That's the point I was making   Mr Chairman? I have one question Did we mean to have maintain initially? We talked about that and I thought we sort of--  -17-    5/17/88   It was; but it wasn't when Norm read it   He did?   Well, I missed that one, too I'm sorry, Norm   Oh! You had it in a different place; that's why I couldn't find it I'm sorry--I was looking for it down near the "maintain"   Mr Chairman, I have a lot of sympathy with what Tom is trying to do because I think his ultimate objective is to achieve price stability I don't know how this Committee would vote on that, but I remember several years ago Chairman Volcker asked us what we thought the objective was and half of us voted for price stability alone; half voted the other way; and he didn't vote and didn't break the tie But I think that is the ultimate objective, and I hear more and more people around here saying that And I think Tom is trying to create a constraint that will make us really work toward that objective and not lose sight of it But my problem with it is that even though he thinks this is a constraint, I believe, in practice, that it really might end up being used like a target And our analysis, like Bob Parry's, suggests that M2 is really better for this in the sense of predicting the level of long-run inflation And that, I think, is the thing we really ought to look at, rather than how well it predicts nominal GNP, since I don't think we can peg real variables over the long run All we can do is affect the price level So, what I would like to do is to carry the thing a step further than Tom has, and suggest we think about using total reserves and nonborrowed reserves, or something of that sort, as an operating instrument What we have now is very akin to using free reserves, which has been fraught with problems the whole time I know that there are some institutional changes that will improve this--you could get rid of the reserve requirements against interbank deposits, [unintelligible] deposits, nonpersonal deposits, all those things You could have a penalty discount rate All those things could be done, assuming you can get the legislation for some of them In any event, if we could work in that direction, then I think we'd have something that would really be very useful to us Of course, one of the things we would want to analyze is what this might do to short- term market rates, and I don't think we have a good handle on that Most people think they would fluctuate a lot more; my instincts tell me that the private market would take care of that And, even if they fluctuated more, I don't believe that would be transmitted to long- term rates to the extent that most people seem to be assuming In any case, if we could use this as an operating variable instead of borrowed reserves, or the federal funds rate, or whatever people think it is we're using, I think it would be a very efficient way to try to achieve the very thing that Tom is advocating Now, if it came down to a vote as to whether to do what he suggested or not do it, I would say do what he has suggested I'd like to take it further than that, but I think it's better than what we now have, because it is a constraint And we really don't have many constraints now, given our willingness to violate our target ranges on an ad hoc, judgmental,  -24-    5/17/88  basis And I'd like a little more of a rule in there, a little more of a road map than we have, to the extent we can do it   Even if you could find a perfect rule, I doubt the Committee would vote for it, because it's so much more fun making ad hoc decisions every time   I mean I'm assuming away that problem; I still think we would vote for discretion   But, at a minimum, you have to tell the [Congressional] Committee next time in the Humphrey-Hawkins [testimony] that we have either rejected it, or we are looking at it and have not yet decided whether to accept it   I think you're right, Mr Chairman; that's the way I viewed it I tried to take it a little farther in the direction that I thought it ought to go, which nobody else will agree with except maybe Tom Melzer and Lee Hoskins I think that can be very productive   I would like to see us use multiple-year targets, if we can ever get to the point that we could agree on that I think it's an exciting step   I don't--not in the long run I think it's the best predictor of inflation of any of the aggregates we have now   It hasn't been too far from that   You want to implicate us!   If you can predict the prices, do you need to predict the interest rates?   I don't always understand these things, but weakly I'd suggest that it is a pretty darn good predictor of the price level   Your borrowed reserve figure is below target, too     So moved   I think there's no explanation   That's where the challenge is   Don, you used an interesting term that I don't remember right now, but I think you really said you assumed expectations weren't rational in this low growth--   What was that term you used? I want to remember that   It was an interesting one; I should have jotted it down   Well, one thing to bear in mind is that he have been  taking a big share of the business down there Yesterday, I talked to him and he closed the conversation by saying "I'm getting extremely worried about inflation"   He doesn't expect his own or his associates' [wages to go up], but he's worried about the inflationary pressures emanating elsewhere with no increases in salaries or wages for his own people That's one of the problems     Turning to the District, Mr Chairman, I think it's safe to say, in summary, that our grassroots contacts don't  -27-    6/29-30/88  really see any slowing in the expansion, in contrast to what the national figures seem to be showing There are widespread reports of extremely high levels of capacity operation in textiles, furniture, chemicals, paper--that sort of thing; difficulty in hiring workers; upward pressure on wages--and our most concrete example is in the case of the fast food industries where they have had to push their wages up well above the minimum in a number of places; and also reports of shortages of chemicals in certain areas For example,  and his suppliers of certain [raw materials] that he uses put him on quotas so he can't produce enough to satisfy his demand  In the case of housing, all of you in Washington are familiar with what has happened around here They can't keep up with demand And pretty much the same sort of thing has happened in the Richmond, Charlotte, Greensboro, Raleigh, Chapel Hill, and Durham areas, where the economy is really booming Home prices in Washington in the last couple of years have gone up about 1/3 and pretty much the same sort of thing is true in Richmond That's what they seem to feel, but I think Frank is right in saying the statistics do show some slowing there  Insofar as our particular projections are concerned, there's not a lot of difference in what we've projected and what the Board staff has done, except that we do expect more inflation next year than they have put in [their forecast] Interestingly enough, Tom Melzer and I ended up with exactly the same amount of additional inflation for next year The most important thing, I think, in the staff's analysis is their assumption that we need to have some tightening actions in order to bring about the results that they're projecting An analysis we have conducted at our own Bank reaches the same sort of conclusion My guess is that if there's going to be an error, I would come out about where Jerry Corrigan and some of the rest of you did that the Board staff's forecast--and ours as well--might be actually forecasting less inflation than we're apt really to have  At the rate we're going, the Greenbook shows a very smooth transition from this expansion driven by domestic demand toward one driven by foreign demand Except for a brief upswing in the third quarter, the rate of growth in gross private domestic purchases is expected to slow down significantly as the result of a weakening in consumer demand and business fixed investment And, of course, that's a perfectly plausible scenario, and it would be a very excellent one if it works out But, as I'm sure everyone would have to agree, it's far from a safe bet I guess we would conclude that business fixed investment in particular, given the high levels of capacity utilization, is apt to be somewhat stronger than we're thinking So, in short, while we think the Greenbook forecast is very reasonable and very defensible, that's probably the best that we could hope for; and our fears are that we're not going to do that well on the inflation side   Also a part of ours!   I agree with your prescription, Mr Chairman, which is where most people have come out There's one observation I'd like to make, though I think there's one big weakness with this practice of setting one-year ranges for the aggregates, and that is that it doesn't really commit us to doing anything beyond that year in this Governor Angell suggested a while ago that it is important that we target some nominal variable He mentioned nominal GNP I think it's a point, although certainly one can't be sure that it's a better variable to target than would be M2 [I'd suggest that you] announce, when you give your testimony, that our intention is to move further in the years beyond If you look at the chart showing velocity of M2 in the Bluebook, that looks pretty darn constant over a period of 30 years It's true that it jumped around more in the '80s, but it looks remarkably stable for an economic variable And I would like to see you say that our intention is, given past evidence, and with a zero rate of change in velocity, to bring that down in the early '90s to about 3 percent--which I would interpret to be the long-run potential of the economy--or whatever you can get the Committee to agree to and feel comfortable about in saying something beyond '89 I think that would be very helpful to the markets And I would certainly favor something of that sort   Mr Chairman, I have two problems with that One is that you would be going into next year without having set any long- run targets   My other problem is more serious And that is, that I would like to see us state tentative targets over the long run that tell the market what we have often said in the past--that we want to get these aggregates down to the point that we've got noninflationary growth To me, [the approach recommended by Jerry Corrigan] would show less resolve than I think [is desirable]   Mr Chairman, I guess the real question is whether we've done enough up until now If you look at the real activity signs, I guess that would say probably we have; but if you look at the recent behavior of the aggregates--unless that's an aberration of some sort--that says we haven't My guess is that we  -50-    6/29-30/88  haven't done quite enough yet, so I was thinking in terms of that level of borrowed reserves that would be associated with an expected federal funds rate of 7-3/4 percent But I could live with what you're suggesting, with an asymmetric directive and the understanding that we get together in a couple of weeks and take a look at it   Mr Chairman, this gets us into an awkward position with regard to our boards of directors When we first sent in our recommended increase in the discount rate, we had in mind a half point increase in the federal funds rate, which we virtually have achieved That would suggest that we really ought to withdraw our recommendation, which is hard to explain to them because we can't really tell them what the System has done at the Open Market level   It gets into a ticklish position We did withdraw our first one for that very reason We had gotten up to where we wanted to go, so we withdrew it and then decided it needed to go more   Sure, that would be very helpful I've been debating what I would say to them because I can't really tell them what I know   As I say, the market assumes that the System has tightened   And therein lies another problem for the directors because, under our new procedures, if we haven't gotten a recommendation in, they are not going to be in that first wave And that's going to be very disappointing to them   I think it will be very helpful to give them a chance to join   Well, that's what we really told them   I don't think they are all unduly disappointed, but it's awfully hard to tell them the full rationale for your recommendation when you really can't tell them what the Open Market Committee has decided   That would solve that particular problem, Martha   If you abstract from this, special pressures are factors that would push the federal funds rate up We have, by going $50 million higher, done a slight tightening How's that? And I think it ought to reflect that   $520 million   Some of us have been suspected of slighter than--   Very large   Was there any revision to the number for the previous month?  SPEAKER(?) Yes    8/16/88   Mr Chairman, I was just going to ask Ted Have you redone your projections of net exports since you got the Census merchandise trade figures?   This figure for net exports for, say, the fourth quarter of 1989 would not be very far off from $472 billion then?   Mr Chairman, I share Frank Morris's appreciation of the staff's efforts to give us some drought-adjusted figures for the GNP for the projection period Obviously, that drought has been a severe blow to a lot of parts of the country, but there's really nothing that monetary policy can do in the short run to deal with that So, I think we need to focus on these drought-adjusted figures in trying to plan the course of monetary policy These figures show GNP, after a bulge in this quarter, working down on a drought-adjusted basis to around 2 percent in the early part of next year That seems to me--in light of the tightness in labor markets and the higher levels of capacity in a lot of key industries--to be about as fast as we would want GNP to grow at this stage  I'm not quite as optimistic as Ed Boehne was--and I gather, probably Martha--that on the basis of these variable rates on consumer loans, consumption will slow down as much as the staff has guessed They've got 13 percent throughout each quarter of 1989 If I had to guess, I would think it's probably going to run higher than that-- although that would certainly be a desirable rate, in view of the necessity of getting that down to the point that we can accommodate an improvement in our balance of payments  What really bothers me most, I think, is what bothers most of the others; that despite all this tightening that we have done up until now, and the staff's projection of considerably more tightening beyond this, we've still got pretty big increases in inflation projected For example, the CPI less food and energy is rising at over a 5 percent rate at the end of next year, and much the same sort of thing is true for the fixed-weight GNP deflator, which is close to  -18-    8/16/88  4-1/2 percent These may be too high, I don't know, but they certainly seem reasonable to me, given the upward pressure on wages and employment costs that are now becoming increasingly apparent And what this means to me is that we still have a serious inflation threat facing us And if we have projected inflation at less than it actually turns out to be, then that's going to cross, I think, a pretty important threshhold in terms of what it would do to inflationary expectations And I think that could be very serious indeed So I hope we can hold it down some--at least as low as the staff is projecting And I would like to think we can do better than that   I can explain that, Martha   One of us is really--   Mr Chairman, I think I share Lee's objective of getting back to the point, if we ever can do this, where we can really control this supply of reserves--somehow measured--so as to control  -31-    8/16/88  the rate of growth of the money supply To put it I guess a bit unkindly, it seems to me that what we do now really is sort of a modern-day version of the real bills doctrine, in a sense The market gets all the money it wants at some price or some borrowed reserve level If it wants more, we pump out the reserves and we say the demand for money has increased If it wants less, we sop up reserves and say the demand for money has declined If we want to nudge it one way or another, through either the borrowed reserve target or through manipulating the federal funds rate, we change the price of money--in much the way the discount rate used to function under the old real bills doctrine So I really don't see that it's much different from that  But, given the uncertainties that people feel exist in the aggregates at the present time, I think I would come out a little different from where Lee does on which of the various alternatives we should use I would use the federal funds rate I think we are confusing the public, we are confusing ourselves, and we are confusing the boards of directors by going through the borrowed reserve target And in recent days, we've been resolving all doubts in favor of the federal funds rate, and I would prefer to just use that federal funds rate as long as we are on this kind of regime But I think at some point the aggregates are going to behave in a more normal, predictable, way and we can reduce this degree of fine tuning that we've been following And only then will I feel very comfortable with any policy decision Now we have to pick out a level of interest rates somehow defined, and predict what will happen The way I do that is to figure out what I think it is on an ad hoc basis and then I bear in mind that most of our mistakes I think have been on the side of being too easy, historically So I put in a fudge factor and vote for something a little tighter than I think it probably ought to be on the ground that that's the way we usually miss But I do hope our simulations suggest M2 is beginning to behave reasonably normally now; Don verified that to some degree And I hope somewhere along the way we can get to the point that we are really controlling the supply of money rather than letting it be purely demand determined   It has been very good really Wayne said a while ago he was taking considerable comfort in M2; and I was taking a lot of comfort in that, too, until Don pointed out that it was the RPs and the Eurodollars that were weak The consumer-type components of M2 were relatively strong, so that reduced my degree of comfort Still, that's something that makes me feel better than I otherwise would because they've been--   He can do that to people   That's basically a political argument   It's a political argument, though, and I think that's the strongest argument that Ed has made for the borrowing target And I think that's why we stuck with it   I think [unintelligible] moves it, so be it   This is not the only issue that has ever been discussed three times   Mr Chairman, a while ago I commended Mike Prell and his associates for producing drought-adjusted figures on GNP I would like, with equal vigor, to commend Don Kohn for producing an asymmetric Bluebook I agree completely with what you said on policy, and a willingness to act further if the need should arise I also agree with your statement that it might well happen that we will need "C" next month [If that's the case,] I would hope we would have an intermeeting telephone conference like we've had And finally, I would agree completely with Governor Angell's suggestion that we move the aggregates up to number one, which probably doesn't come as a great surprise to some in this room   Mike, could you give us some of the details of the revision in GNP, including the deflator and the fixed-weight deflator   Do you know which components of GNP were revised down?   What did you do to it? Did you take care of that place?   Another problem for him; he can [profit?] from that   Mr Chairman, I think every point I wanted to make has been made by someone--but some by one person and some by another Let me just summarize briefly We agree very closely with what the staff has suggested in the Greenbook We see the same signs of moderation, partly because of the employment figures and other national figures, and also because of the grass-roots reports that we've getting from our directors, particularly in textiles and furniture  But I'm glad to see this, because I thought the economy was growing way, way too fast and the risks were all on the upside This suggests that maybe they're less on the upside now than they were before But like most of those who have spoken, I still think that the risks definitely are skewed more towards the upside and that there's a danger that the economy might overheat These figures showing moderation have been around for only a month or two at most, and apart from housing, there are no real large parts of the GNP accounts or significant sectors that show any signs of a great or sustained weakness  And then, if you look at the figures in section II of the Greenbook, they show that there is some upward pressure on both wages and prices Mike has just reported that the figures on the implicit price deflator and the fixed-weight deflator for the second quarter were worse than we thought they were, based on the initial reports So in short, while I feel a little bit better than I did before, because there are some signs of slowing, I don't think we're out of the woods yet And I would think that the staff's prognostication that somewhere down the line we'll need to tighten further is probably still right, although now might not be the time to do that   Mr Chairman, I agree with your position too The only thing I would add to it is that these rates of inflation projected by the Board's staff, as indexed by the fixed-weight deflator, are way too high So, I wouldn't be completely satisfied with that outlook, although that may be the most it's reasonable to expect I would go right down the line with you on it   Except that the fixed-weight did hit 5 percent last quarter   We had doughnuts, I know that   I think you take it the wrong way It's the other three of us!   Well, Mr Chairman, I guess like you are not surprised by what Jerry Corrigan said, you probably won't be surprised by what I say either I like this paper very much because I think it    11/1/88  has very important implications about how we ought to conduct our long-run policy The main thing the evidence says to me is the same thing I think it said to all of you--namely, that we can control prices over the long run by controlling M2 It also suggests that there has not been in the last 30 years or so enough of a permanent shift in demand for money that that would have been troublesome Now, of course, it does point out that we might have shifts in money over time for which we'd have to allow, but I don't think that really negates the basic conclusion that we can control the price level over the long run while targeting the M2 The idea of controlling inflation in this manner obviously is not a new one, but the evidence given in this paper I think makes it pretty dramatic and gives it added support  I think all of this really raises some fundamental questions about our current long-run strategy Obtaining long-run price stability is clearly one of the preeminent goals of monetary policy; I would say it is the goal of monetary policy We frequently state this in our public statements, and yet there's nothing really in our current set of procedures that ensures that we are really going to target M2 or any other aggregate over the long run It's true that we announce that we have targets for these aggregates, but we don't hit those targets a lot of time And we allow base drift to come in, and so there's no assurance in our present procedures that M2 is going to grow at a rate that will be compatible over the long run with price stability--over 2, 3, 4, 5 years, or whatever you want to target on I've been dissatisfied with this procedure for a long time, and I think there are some other members who have been somewhat uncomfortable with it, too The staff paper provides impressive evidence that we really can control price stability in the long run by controlling M2, if we just change our procedures to ensure that we keep our long-run M2 [unintelligible] And I'd like to make one further observation about section 6 of the staff paper which explores the long-run dynamic characteristics of the price gap equation The analysis in this section suggests that if we fix the M2 growth at a constant rate, the price level [fluctuation] would remain pretty wide around the equilibrium level for many years before stabilizing the--   Yes, that's right! And this is very discouraging more so to me than to you, Manley, because I'm an old man I'm going to be on a fixed income in four years We have to wait until our grandchildren to see this price stability   Yes, our great grandchildren I haven't even gotten my first grandchild yet, but do have one coming in January in case any of you are interested! I think it needs to be emphasized that this particular analysis deals only with the special case where there is a stable rate of growth in the money supply I think it's reasonable to suppose that we could have some kind of reactive mechanism that would bring this under better control and damp these oscillations We had one of a sort when we were targeting nonborrowed reserves If there was an overshoot in the aggregates [under that sort of targeting] we made the banks borrow half of that overshoot And that was an automatic mechanism There are others that obviously    11/1/88  could be used I would also draw the opposite conclusion from the Lucas critique on this and say that intuitively I think if you had a stable rate of growth in money supply over this 30 years, that you would not have changed the structure of the models So, if you targeted a stable rate of growth after that you would have had less in the way of oscillations this produced because these are two very different regimes and that is the issue to which I think the Lucas critique was addressed I've said too much, Mr Chairman, but I surely like what the staff is doing I would not go quite so far as one of my colleagues and say the first eight pages represent the best work the staff has ever done because I think it has done a lot of other awfully good work, too   There's a problem with that!   But not necessarily   Mr Chairman, I have a lot of sympathy with the view that Lee Hoskins expressed I have had some reservations about  -17-    11/1/88  these swaps ever since we entered into them It's not that I'm all that opposed to smoothing operations but I felt that they might delay our dealing with some fundamental problems by covering them up for a while I think it is important to note that foreign affairs are basically an Administration function and the Treasury has primacy in this area And even if we philosophically don't agree with the kind of intervention we've done--and I think we pretty well [have expressed that] disagreement--we would have to yield to the Treasury on this, just as monetary policy is a function that Congress has delegated the Federal Reserve and the Treasury shouldn't be telling us what to do in those areas   The last two firms would meet all these tests?   There have been very few changes in the Greenbook projections this time from last time, and we agree pretty broadly with that and think they are pretty closely on target It seems clear that there has been a slowing in real activity--or there was in the third quarter--and I think it's reasonable to suppose that, on a drought- adjusted basis, the economy will grow more slowly next year than it has this year At the same time, I think the risks are on the upside but I think they've got a pretty good forecast I wouldn't be quite as sure about the risks on the upside as Frank Morris, but I'd be more or less about where Ed Boehne came out on both the level of output and prices   Well, it's been the day to do things   Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation, too I'm very sympathetic to what Tom Melzer has said, though We can probably explain the weakness in the aggregates, and the early increases in short-term rates up to this point, but next meeting I will be in favor of a symmetric directive if the weakness in money continues for another month For now, I would agree completely with what you recommended   Peter, is it fair to say that most differences have been resolved in favor of the federal funds rate?   Yes, I was on the [morning conference] call this time, and I think that's an excellent description of what you did I was really referring to the longer run It seems to me that in the past most of them have been resolved in favor of the federal funds rate Not all certainly, but I think that's what it has usually yielded   Mr Chairman, as I've indicated a lot of times, what I hope we are going to move to eventually is some kind of reserve targets and make the necessary institutional changes so they'll work I think it's important in the interim that we recognize that this borrowed reserve target is not a reserve target in the usual sense The real instrument under current procedures, as I perceive it, is the federal funds rate because this is what determines the demand for money and consequently the rate of growth in the aggregates And the borrowing is simply the device that we use to try to control the federal funds rate I think it has confused us, and it has confused the markets on occasion I remember that Manley and I were arguing this back at the March meeting I think it was I would favor adopting, if we could get a consensus, a wider range for the federal funds rate and dropping the borrowing target I would then give the Desk, in consultation with you [Chairman Greenspan], enough freedom to move anywhere within this half percentage point limit [for the federal funds rate] that seems consistent with the directive I still favor that I think this [recent intermeeting] period illustrated that I think Peter Sternlight handled it beautifully the way he jumped back    12/13-14/88  from one and then the other I do think most of the time we have resolved it in favor of the federal funds rate where there were differences And I think that's the more important of the two   Wayne, wouldn't a lot of that announcement effect be lost since this wouldn't be released until Friday following the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting?   I certainly wouldn't favor targeting a particular federal funds rate I might want a band for the reason that Wayne has indicated But I would just note that the band associated with the borrowing target did not necessitate a borrowing target as long as we had the band   You know, when we were under the borrowed-- nonborrowed reserve targeting procedure, we made banks borrow half of any shortfall There was an automatic corrective mechanism there, and we made ad hoc adjustments every now and then as needed, and I'd like to preserve that right That's the kind of direction I would like   I'm not sure  -10-    12/13-14/88   Yes, if the money supply spurted, we made banks in effect borrow half of the additional reserves that they needed And that was an automatic brake on that   Well, that would appeal to me a whole lot more than what we have now, but there's not going to be a consensus on that at this point I hope some day there will [unintelligible]   One thing we probably can agree on is that we've been doing a pretty darn good job with what we've had; it's just a question of whether we can continue to do it with this procedure   What I was advocating here is not what we had before but a much wider band I would be totally opposed to going back to what we had before That and the market--   Mr Chairman, I'm afraid I have misstated my position pretty badly I think the excellent memo we had last time demonstrates pretty clearly that there is a good relationship in the long run between M2 and the price level And I think the price level ought to be our ultimate target I think that's all we really ought to be targeting on If we do that, then I think these other things will fall into place about as well as they can That suggests to me that somehow or other we have to control the supply of money In the short run, which is what we are talking about here now, our procedures regardless of whether we use a borrowed reserve target or a federal funds rate [range that is] narrower or wider--and I had in mind a wider one--necessitate our being able to estimate the short-run demand for money I think that's very difficult to do All I was attempting to say is that I think if you leave out the borrowed reserves stuff and work with the federal funds rate, we'll probably do better in the short run in doing that But I will not be satisfied until we get to the point that we really pay a lot more attention over the long run to what's happening to M2, or if some other variable is a better predictor of the rate of inflation then that's the way I want to move I certainly don't have in mind any rigid pegging of the federal funds rate That to me would be nothing but a modern day version of the real bills doctrine where the market would get everything it wanted in the way of money at the particular rate we chose and all we could do to change that would be to raise the rate or lower it--which means we'll end up with a real bills doctrine, and I'm violently opposed to that I think that doctrine has long since been discredited And so the question really is what kind of mechanism in the short run can get us to what I think should be our long-run target or some control over prices over the long run through controlling the rate of growth in some aggregate or some reserve measure I don't know what the answer is in the short run We had a memo on that and it doesn't suggest the answer is very easy But there is the sense in which I offered this recommendation of mine And I'm afraid I didn't make that very clear   It's not quite complete yet   Ted, were the September figures on CIF basis revised?   What is it for September? I didn't get that somehow   $106 billion, is what it is now?   Thank you   That may not be shared in other states   We noticed   Mr Chairman I've been following these Greenbooks for a long time, and I think really in the last year or so they have been considerably better than they were before then although they have always been good And I found this one particularly helpful although it does make me darn nervous on the inflation side because it suggests that there's very little room for error It projects a further tightening of policy over this period and an appreciable rise in interest rates, and this doesn't cause the underlying rate of inflation to diminish very much, and then only well into 1990 when the decline is modest at best So, it seems to me that the risk of error really is that we are probably going to have more inflation than the staff has in the Greenbook if in fact there is any risk of error in this Wage pressures, as several people have indicated, are increasing--not rapidly in some cases--but certainly unmistakably; and if consumer prices increase at the rate of 4-1/2 to 5 percent that they are projecting for next year, it seems to me it's almost inevitable that we will begin to see some wage pressures then So, I would not be surprised, in the absence of some action on our part, to see, rather than declining inflation in 1990, some wage-price spiral feeding on each other  and he expected wage pressures there and elsewhere to be considerably stronger than most people seem to anticipate  Now, on the real side of the economy, my guess is that in the first part of next year anyway despite signs that the rapid upward pace of some of the foreign economies may be slowing to some extent, we are still going to have perhaps a little more restraint in our export demand than the staff has suggested And with the growth in employment and income that we are having in the domestic economy this suggests to me that probably domestic spending is also going to be stronger than the staff is projecting So, I think we've got an incipient boom on our hands, but basically I'm in pretty close agreement with the staff in what needs to be done to control that   He has succeeded where many of us who have tried before have failed!   I think they have   He just retracted his comment!   Mr Chairman, I would favor "C" I have never differed with you since you've been here, and I do so with great trepidation today because I have such respect for your judgment But I think the market has expected a discount rate increase, and I think if we don't get one it might be interpreted as some lessening of our resolve to deal with this problem we see developing And I think there's also a lot of substance to the point that Governor Angell made that if we are concerned about the lack of a firm relationship between the level of borrowed reserves and the federal funds rate, I think that would be exacerbated by letting that [rate spread widen] still further But at the same time I want to be reasonable on this, and I can see the merits to what you've said I can certainly see the merits to what Tom Melzer has said because the aggregates do concern me a great deal I would not be willing to go this far if I didn't see a sign that they were beginning to move I would like to bargain with you a little bit on that $100 million and make it a little higher than that But I don't think it's an important enough difference that I'd want to go to the mat on it or anything of that sort I'd really like the discount rate to be a part of it   Mr Chairman, could I ask for some clarification? The $100 million, would you anticipate this would move the federal funds rate to 8-7/8 initially from 8-5/8 percent?   Yes   6 to 10? I thought it would be 7 to 11  SPEAKER(?) Well, it should be 7 to 11   If we leave it at 6 to 10, we've got the midpoint below where we are now I'm not sure where we are Are we at 8-1/2 or 8-5/8? I think we are at 8-5/8   It shows the gamble we are taking!   Mr Chairman, Don did such an excellent job of outlining various alternatives and he answered most any question I might have But I do have one little simple question that I'd like to ask Do you personally, Don, have more respect for the price projections made by your big model or by your single-equation model that stems from that very excellent memo we got back in November of  -26-    2/7-8/89  last year? I guess that tells you which one I have the most respect for   When you're winning something--   I wouldn't want to--   Yes, I realize that I didn't mean to oversimplify I would have equal confidence for 1989 since they project the same inflation figures that I did; there was very little difference   They are pretty close  -27-    2/7-8/89   I was just going to indicate my support for what Governor Angell was saying But I'm wondering if the Humphrey-Hawkins wording precludes our focusing on one aggregate since it says "provide  -30-    2/7-8/89  for the rate of increase or diminution in aggregates" or something like that   Aggregates   I guess, then, that you wouldn't have to have M3 I thought maybe you would since it says money and credit If you had one of each I think you could meet the definition as such I support it even--   Yes, I know But I was just thinking about the correct thing to do [according to the Act], not what Congress wanted [in July]   Yes, well--  SPEAKER(?) It could be M2 [unintelligible] and credit   I would favor that   Right You should have said the public and financial markets   You learned your lesson   Mr Chairman, I think you put your finger on it when you said the question was really whether we would have to raise the range the next time we look at it So, I don't feel very strongly about either one of these alternatives But I do have some preference  -35-    2/7-8/89  for alternative "II" because I see the basic function of setting these targets as being that of reassuring the public about our anti- inflationary resolve If we assume we have to have a 4 percentage point spread or something like that in the ranges because of the sensitivity of M2 to declining interest rates or rising interest rates, that suggests to me that what we're really after eventually is a range of about 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent or something like that And I think we're in a position now that we could take that additional step The upper part of the alternative "II" range would be 6-1/2 percent; and if we could take these figures at face value on M2 that should give us sufficient flexibility, even with a declining rate of growth and a drop in short-term rates in 1990, to still hit this 5 percent rate with some room to spare--and to hit the 6 percent in 1991 with some room to spare Like Gary Stern, I don't think we would really have to end up raising that but it's not a do or die issue with me I could go with either one, but I do have that preference because I think we can take a good step now without much risk   Right   Well, I think it's amply true what Jerry was saying about those [depositors] who initially come out But they spend that money buying something else; it moves into the hands of some other people So you've got to go beyond that and ask What are they going to do with that? And it might well come back into deposits in some form   [If it is] first in the operational paragraph, Bob, that may be sufficient I agree with your sentiments, but in the operational paragraph--   You know, it certainly would help to have this [analysis] sent out a little ahead of time so that we could reflect on it a bit That's a lot to digest in that short a period of time   Mr Chairman, our projections for 1990 pretty closely parallel those of the Greenbook We do expect slightly more growth, but not quite enough to put us in the outlier column as has sometimes happened in the past And we expect a tad more in the way of an increase in the consumer price index As Mike Prell suggested very well a while ago, more important than the specifics of the forecast are some of the things that underlie it And as we read the economy the pressure on US productive resources looks very, very strong to us This is evident, I think, in most recent statistical data real personal consumption expenditures ex-automobiles, for example, were very strong; the nonagricultural employment figures for January were very strong; and the theme report that we got on business capital expenditures, which I found extremely helpful this time, seemed to indicate strength We're getting the same sort of  -10-    2/7-8/89  grassroots information from our contacts around the District To us, one particularly interesting thing this time was a comment of  who has been in the department store business  says that business is really booming so it came as  something of a surprise to us Now, if we have this strong demand, as is apparent to us, that naturally is going to put some upward pressure on real interest rates And any attempt on our part to resist that pressure through monetary policy is going to risk getting inflationary pressures So we've assumed, like the staff, that our monetary policy will not resist these things; rather we predicated our forecast on the assumption that there will be a significant further increase in short- term interest rates, and specifically some increase in the relatively near future Now, if we do allow that increase to occur then we think the risks are about equal on both sides If we don't let that increase occur then we think the risks are on the up side of more inflation than the staff has projected   He's just saying in the case of inconsistencies between the borrowing level and the funds rate resolve doubts on the side of borrowing   Our special theme reports suggested that would be pretty strong, really, if I read that [right] Is that the way you read it? I was very much encouraged by what that seemed to say   And that's good GNP   Mr Chairman, I'm very close to Jerry Corrigan and very close to Lee Hoskins A while ago I appeared to be complimenting Don Kohn unduly at the expense of Mike Prell But I'd like to say that I think that Mike's forecast for the economy--the need for increasing short-term rates--is probably absolutely accurate And I favor sooner rather than later But there's always this risk that we could do too much now As far as this yield curve is concerned, one reason it's the way it is [relates to] an expectation on the part of knowledgeable observers that we probably will do some further tightening fairly soon So, I clearly come out in favor of "C" But there is this matter of institutional harmony that Jerry mentioned a while ago And given your commitment, Mr Chairman, to move to this in a couple of weeks or so I can go along with that I'd rather do it now but I can vote for that   Well, I meant to consider a move depending on what the data say And if they point in the other direction I wouldn't want to move; I think it is very "iffy" right now I'm less convinced than most of my colleagues in Richmond that this has gotten quite as far away from us as some people think   If we say "maintain" would that preclude our letting the federal funds rate move up?   And "maintain" would permit us to raise the borrowing target $100 million?   I wanted to make sure that we didn't preclude a decision to raise the borrowed reserve target if the data indicated, simply because we said "maintain" in here And the answer is no   I just wanted to be sure on that one   Mr Chairman, the Greenbook projections look quite reasonable to us Until very recently we had thought that they were underestimating the amount of economic growth we would have in the economy But at this point I guess we think the risk of error is about equal on both sides of that This change in our view is not the result of what we see in the Greenbook or the Beigebook or what we pick up in the way of anecdotal information To us those sources suggest--if you allow for some downtick in some of the monthly statistics in February because of that temporary weather-induced burst in January and also allow for the sluggishness recently in automobile sales, which may prove to be temporary--that the economy looks pretty strong What makes us think that the risks really have shifted is that we have taken, we think, some pretty significant policy moves in recent weeks and months The federal funds rate is up about 3-1/2 percentage points over a pretty short period of time, and we think these policy actions--particularly the most recent ones--have increased the odds that economic activity will moderate later this year just as the Greenbook projects And these actions significantly reduce the risk that the economy is going to overheat further  Now, the recent sharp increases in prices at the wholesale level and certainly at the consumer level worry us a great deal as do the indications of upward pressures on wages And we're deeply concerned about broad increases in prices outside the food and energy area That suggests that the underlying rate of inflation has risen at least a notch or two in the last several months On the other hand, the trend rate of growth in M2 has dropped pretty markedly over the last two years and I think that provides us with at least some insurance against a really sharp further acceleration in the underlying rate of inflation for the remainder of 1989 But I would add, perhaps gratuitously, that if we're really going to get inflation down to a zero level I think somewhere down the road we've certainly got to get the aggregates growing at a slower rate than they have grown over most of this two-year period--maybe no slower in 1989, but certainly in a trend sense they have to come down still further if we're going to get to our ultimate goal   Mr Chairman, I favor holding policy steady over the period ahead, for a period of the next few weeks anyway My hunch is the same as the one that's there [in the forecast] and also the one you made in assuming that some further increase in the funds rate is probably going to be needed later on to keep inflationary pressures and expectations from building up over the months ahead So, I would want the directive to be asymmetrical But I think it's also possible that we've done enough, particularly in looking at the behavior of M2 and how that has decelerated I realize a lot of that stems from how opportunity costs of holding M2 [have changed] just recently; but if  -35-    3/28/89  you look at the last two years M2 growth is still down to 47 percent from many years at a trend rate of about 89 percent That is one whale of a lot of deceleration over that period That leads me to be more sanguine about what might happen to inflation than I would be in the absence of that decided deceleration in M2 So, I would go with "B," at least until we have more information on the March figures; I'd watch those closely because I may well be wrong on that Certainly, the current statistics do not reflect anything that would suggest that we ought not tighten more You've got to look way back at what has been put in train, guess about those lagged effects, and reach the conclusion that now is the time to pause And that's really where I think the focus ought to be right now   Both?   You would have said yes if he hadn't helped you,   Sam, you mentioned a while ago that the Germans had some differences over the type of intervention What is their preference on that?   I can't now, Bob, but I'd give you--   At our last meeting, Mr Chairman, I think Governor LaWare said he thought the economy was probably a little mushier--if I remember his words right--than most people were thinking   I understand words like that   Well, I think the national data that have been released subsequently support that, and we see confirmation of that in our District The Beigebook report showed that consumer spending and manufacturing activity were moderating a good deal in March and April and the comments of our directors at the last couple of meetings have been noticeably less bullish than before At our meeting last Thursday several of the directors who live in what they like to call the golden crescent, which reaches from Baltimore through Washington and Richmond down to the Tidewater area around Norfolk, said activity actually has slowed up somewhat And this has been a boom area for some time  So far as the outlook is concerned, I think the Board's staff has made a solid case in the forecast that they have in the Greenbook And I think Mike made a further solid case by modifying that in the direction that he suggested when he drew on the later numbers This means essentially a soft landing Of course, everybody hopes that's what we will have It has been so long since we've had one that I don't think I would even remember Like Ed Boehne, up until recently I've been thinking that the risk of error was on the up side and now I think it has become more balanced between the up side and the down side I do think, however, that it would be premature to conclude that the risk is definitely on the down side at this point It's still possible that the sluggishness we have seen in the economy could turn out to be temporary A lot of it comes from the weakness in automobile sales and the incentives there are pretty sizable; so it's quite possible that that will turn around I remember so many times in the past when we thought we saw signs of weakening and they turned out not to have materialized For example, in the face of the weak employment reports that we had back in July and August we were really  -19-    5/16/89  worried about the economy for a while; and then they shot back up in the fall Don't misunderstand me I'm not suggesting that there is going to be a reacceleration As a matter of fact, I think that's unlikely The only point I mean to make is that I think it's a little premature to conclude that the economy really has turned downward at this point I would hold off a little on that judgment, although we certainly can make a better case for that now than we could have at the last meeting   Martha, you've raised an interesting question about whether the borrowed reserve target or the federal funds rate is the better indicator of policy Earlier Governor Angell raised the question as to whether the behavior of the aggregates or the federal funds rate was the better target And I think we all--   I'm saying there are three ways we can measure it that have been discussed here today, and I like Governor Angell's way best I like the federal funds rate second best and the borrowed reserves third best And they are all incompatible with one another We had a pretty interesting discussion earlier   Yes, I know what you were doing   But what the Bluebook did assume was that the best measure of the degree of reserve pressure was the federal funds rate, because you've adjusted your borrowing target to influence that rate   All the worrying about viewing the borrowed reserve target flexibly was designed to give preference to the federal funds rate which [unintelligible] was probably given--   Mr Chairman, I would favor "B;" $600 million; symmetrical language with "slightly" and "might" I'm not really worried about abandoning that asymmetrical directive because by the  -43-    5/16/89  time it comes out it will be after our July meeting and you will have testified before the two Congressional Committees The market, I hope, has the wisdom to look back and [recognize that] when we removed the tilt [the outlook] was very uncertain and that tilt was justifiably removed at that time It may subsequently have been reversed by whatever actions we take, but I think that a rational market observer--and there are a number of them--would think that was the logical thing for us to have done   I was suggesting "slightly/might" on both of them   Yes That predisposes us not to move unless we have some evidence that we don't now have It's a stronger vote to remain where we are than "somewhat" and "would," I think We may be getting into minutia here but--   If I were voting I would [accept] "somewhat" and "would;" I even toyed with the idea of "somewhat" and "might" and other permutations and combinations of that   That's possible, too, but I thought that would drive Don and his associates crazy   Mr Chairman, I think you have taken away the easy part of the problem The 1990 ranges are really where I suspect we will have most of our differences here And I think that's the more important part of [our decision] A lot of this depends on how one views the ranges; there are different ways that one can look at this To me, the most important thing is that the ranges are our signal to the public, and I hope a reasonable signal, of what we plan  -34-    7/5-6/89  to do over the next four to six quarters to achieve the long-run objectives of monetary policy Accordingly, I think it's very important that the ranges we select for 1990 make it crystal clear to the public that this current apparent softening in final demand is not going to divert us from our objective of trying to restore price stability over the long run We have made a lot of progress on this and I think we've had excellent monetary policy for a long time now But we still have the underlying inflation rate at around 5 percent, so we still have some distance to go on that All of us, obviously, would like to achieve price stability with a minimum of disruption in the economy But I think price stability really has to be our primary--and I would say our single overriding--long-term goal I think the greater the public's confidence in our commitment to that end, the less the short-term disruptions are going to be  So, in my mind, it's highly desirable that we reduce the range for M2 further in 1990 to maintain the credibility that we've won over such a long period of time So, I strongly prefer alternative III What that means to me, really, is that we want the underlying rate of growth of M2 to come in somewhere around the 4-1/2 percent midpoint of the 2-1/2 percent to 6-1/2 percent range, which would be consistent with what I think we've been trying to do for a long time Now, I recognize that the staff's baseline forecast for M2 for 1990 is 6-1/2 percent That means, of course, that a 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent range doesn't give us a lot of leeway for error on the up side But frankly, I wouldn't be unduly concerned if interest rate movements or some other temporary factor did cause us to come in above that, as long as we were reasonably confident that that was temporary and it was something that we could explain to the public  If you'd permit me to add one final point, Mr Chairman Every time we go through this exercise, I become more and more convinced that we really need to change our targeting procedures to look at this on a multi-year basis Several of us have made this point in the past; and I'd like to suggest again that we take a look at that because, given base drift, this seems to me a pretty inefficient way to target on the long-run objectives on which I think we all agree I would like to see us, if we can agree on that, make some kind of move in that general direction   I can't really quarrel with that I was just hoping, as I was telling Don before the meeting, that he could come up with as good reasons why we ran over the target as he did in his recent memorandum--which I thought was excellent work--explaining why we ran so low If he could, then I could be pretty well satisfied with that He certainly eliminated some of my worries about this unduly slow rate of growth we've had in M2 recently It has been about 3 percent adjusted   He did it and he did it very well!   You'll have to speak more quietly next time, Jerry, if you want a longer reign!   It is a modern-day version of the real bills doctrine   Are they attributing that to what they think we're about to do? What is the explanation?   Any guess on the unemployment rate and the figures this Friday?   Mr Chairman, our projections are very close to those in the Greenbook We have slightly higher growth in real GNP and a slightly higher inflation rate but the differences here are really minor and not worth mentioning The overall profile of the forecast is just about the same More interesting than the projections themselves is the question as to where the risk of error probably lies If one looks at domestic final demand only, one might conclude that the risk in the case of GNP is definitely on the down side But, as we all know, the behavior of net exports of goods and services has had a very large impact on our total GNP over the last six years And the prospects for net exports are something of a wild card in the outlook currently I think the staff's projected sharp drop in the growth of exports is certainly reasonable, given the strength of the dollar But the underlying demand abroad is pretty strong in a number of countries and this could buttress our exports for a while, I think, even if the dollar remains relatively strong On balance, I would say that the risk of error in our forecast and that of the staff's is probably on the down side; but I wouldn't rule out the possibility that the economy could be a little stronger, given this wild card on the export side  When we get to the price issue, I think the risk is about evenly distributed The staff is expecting that the underlying rate of inflation as measured by the CPI less energy and food will be about 5 percent over the next several quarters I think a lot of that is going to depend on how strongly these aggregates come back and whether the projection of growth in the aggregates is really going to materialize On an anecdotal level, at a recent meeting of our board  -17-    7/5-6/89  of directors to which we invited our alumni there were more mentions on the part of both groups about how tight labor really is and the virtual impossibility of attracting labor Now, we have a pretty prosperous District by and large with the exception of a few parts of West Virginia But still, it was striking that so many were reporting such difficulty in attracting labor This leads me to think that we may have more wage/price pressures than some people assume or that these pressures may be around a little longer than some are assuming   Don, in your chart 9 where you have P above P*, is that a significant difference that would [lead] you to think that that's some indication for us that it might not [unintelligible]?   I like that adverb   Mr Chairman, you made my talk for me except that you made it much better than I would have But, I would like to suggest one thing It probably won't meet with a lot of acceptance but I'd like to see the monetary aggregates moved up in that list of things that might temper what we're doing in the intermeeting period Rather than the unemployment and employment figures [to be released] this Friday or inflation figures coming later on, I think this is  -54-    7/5-6/89  really the crucial thing And I think it's important that we do keep [money growth] moving up; it has been very weak for a long time and unless we get to change that, frankly, I think we're going to run into trouble before very long So I'd like to see that moved up to the first place But otherwise, I'm right with you on this   When the federal funds rate comes down a little and the aggregates continue at the rate they have been going, I think the market will be scared very much by those developments So, the reason I suggested moving that up a little is that they ought to know that we are concerned that the aggregates not stay that low forever, but rather that they should move up a bit from where they are The work that Don and his associates did alleviates a lot of my worries about it because that work pretty well suggests to me around 3 percent, which might not be too bad I don't think that [low growth] ought to go on any longer now; and I'd like the markets to know that if it doesn't begin to move a little we'll have to do something   I always suggest that   [Unintelligible]   That probably means he doesn't want any questions!   Mr Chairman, most of what I wanted to cover has been covered by various people I wanted to start off by saying that I think this issue is more important than any of the ones we have on the agenda Despite the Japanese belief that sterilized intervention can have some permanent lasting effect, I don't really buy that And I think this does put us into a dangerous position As Sam indicated a while ago, we can drive the dollar down and the Treasury has a vested interest in that so as not to show a loss on its operations You could say that we do, too, although I'm sure that that's not anything that would motivate us   Oh, I know that   Well, the next point I was going to make was that I was sure you were making just that sort of argument and I wanted to commend you for having done that I do think one issue remains and that is one that Governor Angell and Governor Johnson raised last time whether this really can fall in our existing directive to counter disorderly conditions To my mind, it might go a little beyond that And I realize the [unintelligible] of the constitution is the Treasury [unintelligible] and I think you had to cooperate; I would support that But I think it does behoove us to continue, as you are doing, to try to educate them that this path is fraught with a lot of dangers At some point if we continue to get pressure from the Treasury to do this kind of thing I think we ought to at least take a look at the directive and maybe expand it--if we think that's appropriate--beyond disorderly conditions I wouldn't want to go beyond that myself but maybe the Committee could I realize you've been on the side of the angels in this and--   Well, I was going to commend you but at the same time criticize the fact that we unavoidably and inextricably got drawn into it because of the Treasury's primary status in this thing I would express the hope that this study we have undertaken could convince some of those who really don't know that much about it   As I said, I knew you were on the side of the angels! Others may argue, but Wayne has had very close contact with angels and he says that that is exactly right! If there's anyone here who's equipped to speak for the angels I think he really is   Mr Chairman, I just have one comment I was comforted by your statement that central bankers were lined up almost uniformly against the ministers of finance on that Do you know how strongly they are arguing their position with their minister of finance counterparts as you are clearly doing in this country?   May we all take off that day, Mr Chairman? I'd really like to take off Well, Monday is a holiday   It'll be in the paper Tuesday, then   What you are saying, then, is that it was the wrong job in your view?   But it is the wrong job   That's exactly the problem   We can use a long-run perfectly vertical Phillips curve and I wouldn't have any objection to that  -48-    10/3/89   Mr Chairman, I find myself in a little different position from the first three speakers We really haven't changed our view of the economic outlook very much from what we had last time The Greenbook projections seem reasonable to us; the staff always does a good job I don't think I will ever understand how Mike Prell is able to answer so many questions so well! But since there is some onus on us to say how we differ, I would say that our best guess is that the downside risk is a little greater at this point than the upside risk, for a couple of reasons First of all, I don't think we have yet seen the full effects of all the tightening that we have undertaken over the last year and a half Secondly, a lot of the improvement that the Greenbook projects is based on the external sector and that, in turn, has an underlying assumption that the dollar is going to continue to depreciate at a rather steady rate That's certainly a plausible position, but I think one can make some case that there is certainly more than a small possibility that the dollar just may not decline for reasons that we don't well understand I don't think we fully understand why it was strong before we started intervening; it may well be that that strength is going to resume, particularly after we are out of the market If that were to be the case, then real net exports and real GNP might come in a bit weaker than what the staff is projecting On the inflation side, I found the staff's efforts to estimate the magnitude of the effects of the projected depreciation of the dollar extremely helpful but rather  -26-    10/3/89  disturbing, because even with these alternative projections we didn't show much progress on inflation through 1991 But again, we find ourselves in a rather unique position in that we think inflation may do better than the staff thinks I feel rather uncomfortable with that because I remember--   We think we will have less inflation than they projected The reason I feel uncomfortable with that is that over time I think most of our System policy errors have been made by having been too easy rather than by having been too tight And the outlook is dependent to a large extent on what I think is an unusually high degree of credibility that policy now enjoys My feeling is that we probably have a higher degree of credibility now than we have ever had And I think your statement in response to the Neal resolution did a lot to strengthen that So, I'm a bit more optimistic on this than I have been But I hope that doesn't translate into the wrong kind of policy for the Committee because I'm not ready at this point to relinquish the reins and say that we have this battle won, by any means    -29-    10/3/89   Well, I'm talking about   How big is the gap is what he's asking   Mr Chairman, I'm very sympathetic to the point that Lee Hoskins made because I tend to focus on the longer run, as I think he does And I think our long-run problem is inflation rather than recession I'm also sympathetic to the points made by those who favor symmetry just because I'd like to send a signal to the market that we don't really approve of the G-7 action But I also share Wayne's feeling that monetary policy has been a little tighter than most people assume and that it may be [sufficient to] hold down the inflation risk So, I think your original formulation is probably the best one for now; I would go with "B" asymmetrical on the easing side   Ted, I was a little surprised by the severity of the decline in net exports in the third quarter I just didn't sense the things that you [noted] Does that seem to be a reasonable figure to you or is that one that we might--   Self-glorified numbers   Mr Chairman, the Greenbook projections haven't changed very much since last time and neither have ours We continue to believe that if there is risk, the risk is probably that the economy will be a little weaker than the staff have been projecting That feeling has been heightened by recent anecdotal information that we've been picking up I got a particularly interesting piece this morning A president of one of the small investment firms in Richmond sent me a collection of articles published by a guru he's been following for some 30 years and he said that the problem with the economy was that the Reserve Bank Presidents had recently started attending the Open Market Committee meetings and they were bullying you into accepting tighter monetary policy, which he thought was correct! But more important than that, our directors at their last meeting were decidedly less optimistic about the economy than they had been They reported weakness in commercial construction and automobile sales a good deal weaker, with several dealerships in trouble They said manufacturing activity appeared to be softening and loan demand was flat at some of the large commercial banks But they went ahead to stress that despite all this, they didn't think [the economy] was really falling out of bed And labor was still very tight But in view of this indication that we've gotten from various sources, the Fifth District is probably slowing to some extent Since this area has been one of the stronger parts of the national economy, we think that the national economy, if it isn't right on target with the Greenbook's projection, will perhaps be somewhat weaker than that At the same time, we're a bit more optimistic--the Richmond Fed staff  -18-    11/14/89  has been assuming no change in monetary policy--on the inflation side Given the amount of tightening that we had in '88 and in '89, we think we're going to begin to see some dividends from that I think there is some evidence of that in the squeeze in profit margins now; despite rising labor costs, firms are not able to pass that on to prices because there's more resistance to those prices So, we are hoping that we'll do a little better on the inflation front than the staff is projecting   Mr Chairman, I would go along with "B" with asymmetric language I recognize that we've done quite a bit of easing in recent weeks and that M2 is growing pretty strongly Clearly, at some point, as Tom expressed it so well on the "Call" the other day--and Governor Angell has made the same point--we're going to have to start paying more attention to the aggregates and less to these short-term indicators of real economic activity or else we're going to be headed for a lot of trouble I don't think we've reached that point just yet, but that's clearly a judgment call Having said that, I think it is very essential that we keep our eyes firmly on our longer-term goal of bringing down inflation Accordingly, I think any further easing, even that little amount permitted by the proviso, should be approached very, very cautiously  -29-    11/14/89   I think one could also argue that our credibility wasn't as high during that period as it might be in the future   Which would have made it even less   Like so many others, Mr Chairman, I would compliment the staff; in fact, I did compliment Mike Prell before the meeting And I'd like to compliment you in allowing us to talk about these things I've been attending these meetings off and on for 30 years now and almost all the time for 16 years and in that period of time I don't think we've addressed a topic quite as important as what we're doing now I know no one would have a lot of confidence in the econometric measures that one would use to determine what the costs of eliminating inflation are, but what to me comes out as most important is the qualitative differences between these various approaches The backward-looking model, which is the traditional way we've looked at it here, makes the cost very, very high But if we can assume that we have something like rational expectations and forward-looking  -21-    12/18-19/89  expectations and if we can assume that we have some kind of credibility and strength in that credibility, then the cost becomes considerably less I think Manley made a good point a while ago, which Lee picked up on, when he said maybe the worst case is the one we had in the early '80s when we really hit the economy with a big shock without announcing exactly what we were going to do I don't think we really anticipated ourselves that rates were going to go anything like that high; and yet from this vantage point, it seems to me the costs have been relatively low There were certainly costs, but they were relatively low And if something like the Neal resolution passed, and if we could state our targets--I would like to say over multiple years rather than just one year--in advance and come close to these and eliminate this base drift, then I think the costs are not nearly so scary as we seem to be concluding here Finally, I'd like to pick up on Governor Angell's point about the cost of not aiming at zero inflation, which is the alternative I think we have had a lot of experience of that in the postwar period I think those costs are very great; and there are substantial risks that evolve from that sort of a program So to me the case is to try to [unintelligible] rational expectations to the extent that you can and back those up with as high credibility as you can and then the costs of doing what we'd all like to do are going to be lower than they would be under any of the other possible alternatives   That's where a lot of them are   Mr Chairman, I'm sort of on the side of the Angells in this!   Well, I shouldn't have said it, I guess It looks to me like the first question breaks down into two points one is whether we ought to seek a zero rate of inflation or a steady low rate; the second is whether the Fed should target a zero rate of inflation or a stable price level And there are a lot of costs Don mentioned a while ago shoe leather costs in trying to minimize one's balances because of a rise in nominal rates and interactions with the tax code When you have inflation of any kind, even a low level, you have all these nonsocial institutions that rise up and use resources to help you beat inflation So, clearly, I think what we ought to do is to aim for a zero rate Governor LaWare raised some interesting questions about this because he was saying, I think, that the existing indexes don't capture all the improvements in quality That is certainly true And, therefore, I was glad to see that you got the Neal Subcommittee to adopt your definition of inflation, which is much less specific in that we don't have inflation when it no longer affects the decisions of the decisionmakers  Now, with regard to the second part of the question--the price level at which we ought to aim, or the zero inflation rate--I think we ought to aim at a particular price index, as I think Governor Angell was saying Otherwise, I think we're apt to get shocks of all sorts [that induce] deviations from that zero rate In effect, that's where the political pressures are going to arise So, unless we undo that if it's an upward pressure or undo it if it's a downward pressure and go back to our original target, then I think we're going to have price level drift that is not unlike the base drift that we had when we targeted the monetary aggregates   Well, I just think that our whole economic system has a bias in favor of inflation I even think that the Federal Reserve has some bias in favor of inflation   In that kind of world I think that's what you would expect; but in a political world I don't think they would [be random] The answer really, Manley, is that they would be purely random, but it's the political issue that enters in   That expresses it; I wish I'd thought of that   Well, my mother-in-law is an exception to a lot of other--   Well, let me answer the second question I got us off track I can see As to the timetable, I would come out right where Governor Angell did on that; and that's where you came out, Mr Chairman, in your testimony before the Neal Subcommittee I think in the interest of credibility we need to pin ourselves down to get there If all these simulations we did are in any sense right, you have less painful results when expectations are forward-looking rather than based entirely on past experience So I would like to see that tied down to a 5-year period, realizing that if we don't hit it that  -36-    12/18-19/89  we would have a few problems on that But I think if we had the target we'd be more likely to hit it than if we didn't   I remember, too   Mr Chairman, I think Governor Angell was right in going back to the Constitution where it says Congress should have the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof And that has been delegated to us through various forms of legislation Don Kohn mentioned a while ago that among the objectives that have specifically been spelled out in the existing Acts is to control inflation I think the best way to make that point is to do precisely what you did before the Neal Subcommittee by saying that this is the best way to get all these other things, which I sincerely believe   I do too, absolutely And that would be the brunt of my argument   If we didn't approve it, Sam would end up having to buy some dollars with some of his earnings on foreign currencies to stay below the limit So we pretty well have to do it for that reason Maybe--   Well, let's see   Yes   Yes  -58-    12/18-19/89   The limit has to be enough to keep it from--   I'm not disagreeing with that   Peter, off and on for several years Roger Guffey has been raising questions about whether the seasonal borrowing levels mean the same thing as the adjustment borrowing levels Intuitively, I can't see how they really could because I don't think of banks as feeling the same degree of pressure when they have a [seasonal] loan that doesn't have to be paid off until a specific maturity date But the studies that the staff has done always have suggested that, so far as we can tell over the banking system, the reaction to either type of borrowing has been pretty much identical and we have treated them as identical This time we made two technical adjustments because of misjudgments about the level of seasonal borrowing Does this indicate any change in the attitude of the staff toward seasonal borrowing?   It makes sense to me that you're doing it But that's what I would have concluded without a study One of my predecessors used to say that research consists of proving with uncertainty that which was known for certain beforehand I'm glad to see this now and I imagine Roger is glad to see it too   That's the problem!   Could I ask, Ted What would be your figure for net exports of goods and services for the third quarter?   You mean it's a $6 billion improvement?   But if you take those two factors off, Martha, they total 9/10ths of a percent--if I'm not wrong--so this comes down to 12 percent So, really, your first quarter is as weak as any quarter in 1990 after you take account of the earthquake and the Boeing strike   Mr Chairman, we came here with the idea of saying that we thought the general outline of the Board's forecast was pretty accurate But we intended to express the feeling that if we  -77-    12/18-19/89  had any doubts, the doubts were whether the economy would be quite as strong as the projection And I think Mike essentially has done that in his revised statement We've been influenced not only by the incoming statistics but by the anecdotal information that we picked up, particularly at our last Board meeting It's always hard to interpret what business people are saying about things because they don't seem to have any concept of seasonally adjusted rates or anything of that sort; they are always looking at the previous year They can say it's the worst ever and it really might be a seasonally adjusted improvement Anyway, they said the things one would have expected them to say They were universally pessimistic; and there hasn't been a meeting since the last recession when our directors have been as uniformly pessimistic as they were at this one Other anecdotal information has been pretty much along those same lines We're a bit more optimistic than the staff is, though, toward the end of 1990 and the first part of 1991; [we're expecting] GNP to pick up primarily because of export improvement And I think it's quite possible, and probably likely, that domestic demand will be stronger than the staff is suggesting in its forecast I think too that lower interest rates may well be compatible with our efforts to control inflation, and the staff is projecting essentially flat interest rates Finally, I'm a bit more optimistic on prices than they are It's a great comfort to me that the P* model, which I think is a very great piece of work, is projecting [unintelligible] for next year But just looking at the way I see the market working, profits are being squeezed and they're being squeezed because businessmen can't pass on price increases There's a lot more resistance to price increases now than at any time in my lifetime that I can remember And I think that's why they can't pass these things on I [refuse] to pay list on anything Somebody accused me the other day of shopping three places before I'd buy an ice cream cone I haven't gotten quite that bad! But I do think the American consumer is in that kind of--   In essence what we do is buy in quantity and put it in the freezer and make our own ice cream cones at home! Anyway, I do think that is a bigger factor now than it has been And I think some of these price indexes recently have been reflecting more inflation than perhaps we have had; for example, the last one shows automobile prices and apparel prices as being the two main offenders The indexes are supposed to measure the price at which the items are generally available and I don't think they pick up the extent to which discounts occur Automobiles, for example, you can buy at below dealer cost; there's no question about that in many cases I think the System's practice of bidding for automobiles when we buy, which I think we have to do, really results in our paying higher prices than if we could go around and dicker with the dealers I believe I can buy an automobile more cheaply than the Reserve Bank bank can buy one I think the surveys are not picking up a lot of that discounting because the discounted prices don't appear to be generally available So, I feel a little better about the price situation I think [the outlook] looks very much like a soft landing with a slow pickup after that That's probably too good to be true but that's my best guess   You don't think you're sending a false impression for later years do you?   Mr Chairman, I think it's a close call today I have a marginal preference for staying right where we are because of very strong growth in M2 I have enough faith in the past to believe that the secular velocity of M2 is likely to remain pretty stable, and along the lines that Lee and Don were discussing awhile ago, that means somewhere along the way that growth is going to have to be slowed down At the same time, I see less inflation out there than most people do right now And I think interest rates are likely to be lower as we go along than most people seem to feel So, I could live with your recommendation If I were voting I would go with you on that, although I have a slight marginal preference for not making a change   And deeply felt   I agree with that, Mr Chairman  -99-    12/18-19/89   The last time you suggested that we submit ideas on rewording the directive that was the one we submitted and it was rejected   I strongly support Governor Angell on that point   At least!   We have not followed Robert's Rules in the past   There are some other things we would like to resurvey too that we didn't vote--  SPEAKER(?) We'll have different voting members next year   Mr Chairman, Governor Seger raised an interesting question about base drift I've been very much concerned about that problem over time I had felt that the best way was some kind of point target, and I even thought of going with some range for missing above or below But the way we do it, if we end up expecting a rate of growth for the next year from some point other than the one where we are at year-end, it's very difficult to explain to the public I don't know exactly the way around that unless we move to some kind of point target But it's very confusing If we're way over, even those of us who are the most hawkish are reluctant to vote for something like a 2 percent rate of growth to counterbalance some of the overshoot, because that would seem rather extreme to the public who would just pick up the 2 percent and not realize that it came from a different base I think it's a problem we ought to try to deal with somewhat differently from the way we're doing But I don't really have the best answer as to how to do that I do have a lot of sympathy for some kind of point target way out there, a multiyear target   It would certainly be good if we could do that since our [Congressional] testimony--that of the four Reserve Bank Presidents and yours--of course suggested it If we thought this were a real possibility within a 5-year period, the only scenario here that even comes somewhat close to that is strategy II   Probably not I hope we have something better than anything that appears in any of them actually; but I think it would be rather optimistic to expect that   Mr Chairman, I share your enthusiasm for the material contained on page 8 because I think strategy II clearly is the sort of thing that we really want to get, at a minimum And even that strategy has inflation coming down only 2 percentage points over a 5-year period In contrast to that, which seems to me to be the minimum progress that we ought to aim for, the baseline would have us coming down to an inflation rate that is still more than 3 percent in 1994 I part company a little with you by thinking that alternative III is probably a better way to go But I realize that there are political problems We did go with 3 to 7 percent tentatively as the range for M2 last time--although I argued forcibly, and I thought extremely persuasively, that it ought to be 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent but lost that battle--and it is very difficult to bring it down But we also have to think about the risk of not doing something to lower the inflation over time And that risk bothers me when I look at strategy II because it has the unemployment rate going up to 6 percent; I'm  -31-    2/6-7/90  sure that bothers everybody else in the room too But, as Governor Angell said, this is a Phillips curve type model and the Bluebook points out, I think wisely, that a more restrictive policy might well change expectations and increase the credibility of our efforts and reduce the cost of getting there So, the tradeoffs might not be as unfavorable Finally, beyond that, I would say that we need to give some consideration to the risk associated with an outcome like the one in the baseline simulation The inflation rate is still above 3 percent in 1994 and we've all said, as embodied in the Neal Resolution, that 5 years seems to be a reasonable length of time to work the inflation rate down gradually If we had 3 percent that late, I think observers would pretty well conclude that we had thrown in the towel We can certainly do what is compatible with strategy II with alternative II instead of III, and I certainly wouldn't dissent on it if I were voting But I do have some preference for alternative III because I would like to send that little signal to the market that we still have the long-run objective of reducing inflation   Mr Chairman, excuse me I was just going to say that I'm very sympathetic to what Governor Angell has said, but I think the Humphrey-Hawkins Act says we have to report the rate of increase or diminution of the monetary and credit aggregates And usually, I believe--   It was just the plural on "aggregates" that made me hesitate, because I really support what he says if we could get away with it   Second   That wouldn't be good   I hope so   What lines are you on, Bob?   Mr Chairman, Governor Johnson's questioning about these real long-term interest rates prompted me to look at the footnotes on Chart 15 down in the lower left-hand corner where there are three asterisks That says inflation is estimated by a 36-month centered moving average of actual inflation, forecast by staff [where needed] Does that mean that the last figure has 18 months of forecasting in it?   I think they all want to go home!   Mr Chairman, our projections for the Humphrey- Hawkins report are very similar to those of the Greenbook on both GNP and unemployment We basically agree with what I think the Greenbook is saying that the economy seems to be passing through an inventory correction that's largely centered in manufacturing and that the correction ought to be pretty well completed during the first quarter of this year At the last meeting we felt that the risk of error was on the down side and this time we've shifted to the point that we now have a sense that the risks are about evenly divided on each side We've been impressed by how quickly the domestic automobile industry has adjusted or moved to adjust its inventories downward, and we are  -11-    2/6-7/90  encouraged by the strength of orders for durables goods and also for nondefense capital goods So this suggests to us that manufacturing may be stronger than we thought and also that business outlays for new equipment may be somewhat better than we thought earlier  At the same time, I have to say that I'm really concerned about these projections for inflation that the staff has for 1991 as well as 1990 They show, in essence, no further progress in bringing inflation down from the present rate and, in fact, the CPI less food and energy is shown as actually increasing a notch in 1990 and again in 1991 The same is true of the fixed-weight GNP index I think, like all of us of course, that that would be a very undesirable outcome--to put it gently--in view of our stated goal of getting prices down I think it's essential that somehow or other we improve on this inflation performance shown in the Greenbook, and I'd like to suggest that we keep this in mind when we work on our long-term targets later on in this meeting We're more optimistic on inflation, I should add, than the staff is   We put in 4 percent   No growth   Some of you are still there!   Mr Chairman, I share fully Lee Hoskins' assessment of how we ought to measure the impact of monetary policy And that puts someone who believes that in a very difficult position because what we have to do is to pick out of the air, as it were, some borrowed reserve target that will create some federal funds rate that will enable us to predict the demand for money I'm very skeptical of our ability to do that in the short run, and I always have trouble with this particular part of the meetings for that reason My guess is that the caveat Don Kohn threw out is probably right and that we're probably going to get a slower rate of monetary growth with existing money market conditions than shown in "B" That's a pure guess But for that reason I would stick with "B" because I think the rate of growth we may get on M2 may be closer to that shown for "C"   Well, losses on our books could go directly in there too   There are at least two dangers One is that we can lose our credibility and the market will assume we're going to ease policy in order not to take the losses The other is that members of Congress become concerned about the losses and try to exert political pressure on us so that we don't have to take those losses, which would mean pressure to ease policy   We didn't do that   You got reckless there for a minute!   Well, it's in the wrong direction   What does that say about your thoughts on the evaluation of the Committee?   Mr Chairman, I think the changes in the staff projections are clearly in the right direction As a lot of people have indicated, there is a great deal of uncertainty, but I do think we have enough hard information now to know that the inventory swing  -25-    3/27/90  from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year was [more] than we thought Consequently, it looks as if the rate of growth in real GNP in the first quarter is going to be correspondingly higher One of the key points looking ahead, of course, is that the staff has projected that there will be some rise in interest rates over this period of time in order to get roughly the same rate of growth in GNP and more or less the same sort of inflation figures I think that change in policy assumptions is quite correct We've had a sustained growth in M2 for about 9 months now and this may well strengthen aggregate demand considerably In addition, events in Eastern Europe have moved much more rapidly than anybody felt they probably would So it seems to me that the transformation of these economies is necessarily going to lead to higher real interest rates throughout the industrial world Given this assumed upward adjustment in rates that the staff has incorporated in its forecast, I think the risk is about evenly split between up and down If they had not raised these rates, I would have placed the risk on the up side in their forecast I don't think it will surprise anybody to know that my chief concern is that which was voiced first by Governor Angell that there's no improvement in inflation over this projection period Someone mentioned an absence of trend, but actually if you look at the fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter figures on the fixed-weight deflator and the CPI, they both are higher for '90 and '91 than they were in the last Greenbook The CPI ends up in the fourth quarter of '91 at about 4-1/2 percent, and I think we have to do a good deal better than that Someone--I guess that was Governor Angell too--used the term "unacceptable" If we want to maintain our credibility, I think we have to do better than that I sense that despite our best efforts we have lost some of that credibility recently; we ought to think about that very carefully as we formulate our policy later on in this meeting   Anybody you want to suggest to do it?   Mr Chairman, when we've been faced with this degree of uncertainty about the business outlook I don't think we've ever tightened before And yet when I look back through the history of the System, I think this is where we've made most of our mistakes If we could take the Bluebook at face value and assume that we would get a growth of M2 of 6 percent for April through June, I think that would be an adequate slowing, given the rate at which the aggregates have been growing But I'm a little suspicious that it might be a little stronger than that So, I favor a bit of a preemptive strike-- somewhere between "B" and "C," a "B-" or "C+" But that clearly isn't going to happen So, I would be prepared, if I were voting, to vote for a directive with asymmetry to the [tighter] side I think we ought to do at least that much If subsequent economic information suggested that that was the wrong way to have leaned, I don't see that we really would lose anything since that would not be released until after the next meeting   Mr Chairman, we think that the more restrictive monetary policy that the staff is projecting is going to be needed if we're going to generate greater projected disinflation as appropriate What's striking and disappointing to us is that this assumed tighter    5/15/90  policy is expected to produce only a small improvement in the inflation outlook, at least through 1991, but a fairly substantial reduction in GNP next year I think most of us would agree, and indeed this was an import of the excellent memorandum distributed to us sometime back, that there are different kinds of models on this those that are forward-looking and those that are backward-looking I assume that most of this is based on the MPS model If you used one that is more forward-looking, I think that would suggest a better tradeoff, with more disinflation at a smaller cost Of course, the staff readily acknowledges this in saying that the assumed tighter monetary policy could yield a much bigger payoff if it increased our credibility And that, of course, is a very important issue from the standpoint of our policy decision later on I don't think most of us would be willing to argue in favor of a tighter policy if we thought the payoff on inflation was going to be quite as small as what has been projected in the Greenbook  My own feeling is that the payoff would be larger because I think people are becoming more and more forward looking If we can demonstrate to the public that we really have a strong commitment to [reducing] inflation, then I think perhaps we could have much better results than the staff is projecting on the inflation side Now, we wouldn't quarrel much with the staff's near-term projections for the second and third quarters I would guess that the near-term risks might be skewed a little toward the down side because I think there really is something to this real estate credit crunch We hear this from too many places We had an interesting statement by a major regional developer who is a very astute man, I think He said that funding has virtually dried up; he cited one large city in the country where only one out of eleven major real estate developers can get any credit at all And if that is true, of course, then it could have some early impacts and would bias the next couple of quarters to the down side   Mr Chairman, I'd like to reiterate my view that the progress we make toward achieving our long-run objective and the transition cost of moving to that are going to be affected a great deal by the credibility of our policy --the large regional real estate developer who told me that only one out of eleven developers in a given city could get credit--said that he thought our credibility as an inflation fighter had all but disappeared He could find nobody who thought inflation was going to come down, and he was obviously disappointed that we didn't  And that made me think about it somewhat differently than I otherwise would have because I think this fellow is unusually perceptive   No he isn't; he's even younger than I am, Martha, if you can conceive of such a thing! So, I think we ought to pay a little more attention to the long-run issues in the position we take today than we typically do, instead of our perceptions of what is going on in the short-run part of the economy And we [ought] to focus on what this is going to do to our credibility So, I would favor "B" for now, but I would go asymmetrical You've taken care of a good part of my concerns by suggesting that you really favor asymmetry but that you're not quite ready to put that language in the directive I think we need a signal out there that we really haven't abandoned our quest for price stability I'd like to see us put that asymmetry in the directive But the behavior of the aggregates is a concern to me to some extent I would be alarmed if they don't pick up before long, especially M2 and not so much M3, because I think we might have squeezed too much But overall some kind of signal--not a discount rate increase but something from this Committee--really would be very helpful right now, because I agree with you that our next move will be to tighten Of course, like everybody else, I'm guessing on that    5/15/90   I concur, Mr Chairman, with Bob Forrestal's statement about how useful these longer-run [Bluebook] simulations are because I like to look at monetary policy from a particularly long-run viewpoint As I studied these, I found myself thinking about the Neal Resolution If we can assume hypothetically--I'm sure it's purely hypothetical--that the Neal Resolution would pass Congress this year, we would be mandated to bring inflation down to zero by the year 1995, the last year shown in the simulations Since we supported this resolution publicly in part of the testimony [presented by] many of us, the deceleration shown in the simulations in strategy II would seem to be the very least that we ought to be aiming for over the long run Two percent is certainly not zero, but it's considerably closer than the 3-1/4 percent that we would have in the baseline simulation And the simulations for strategy II do suggest that GNP growth would be very modest over this extended period of time in order to get inflation down to the 2 percent level over the five-year period But as we are well aware, there are various kinds of models and the Board's model is not a particularly forward-looking model I think one that took more consideration of the rational expectations [theory] might show that there would be a [higher] rate of real growth consistent with the progress against inflation that is shown in strategy II In any case, the inflation rate in strategy II seems to me to be the minimum progress that would be consistent with our stated objectives To help achieve this minimum progress--and I would hope we could do even better although I'm doubtful about that--I think we ought to reduce the ranges for M2 steadily over this entire period of time, with the goal of eventually bringing them down to 2-1/2 or 3 percent no later than 1995 I had this sort of thinking in mind when I argued--I felt very persuasively but later found out very unconvincingly--in February that we ought to go to 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent for 1990 So, I would like to see us do that, and we can explain it on the basis of its behavior There is some risk, I suppose, that some might think that was a tightening move, which I would not consider it to be In any event, I do feel very strongly, whatever we do with the 1990 ranges, that we ought to cut them for 1991--in the case of M2, to 2 to 6 percent I think the adoption of such a range would send the public a pretty clear signal that we have    7/2-3/90  a continued firm commitment to our anti-inflationary strategy And it may be especially helpful to send this signal right now because of the recent fiscal developments and the likelihood that we're going to get added political pressure to ease policy aggressively if anything significant comes out of this Now, if we did reduce the M2 ranges, it obviously makes sense to lower the M3 ranges too, although I really don't think that does a lot for us operationally I'm pretty sympathetic to Governor Angell's suggestion that we eliminate M3 But I do think the staff produced a good memo that suggests that there is some marginal value in maintaining it   Which were easy to explain to Congress at the time--   Mr Chairman, our projections for GNP are pretty close to the staff's; they are almost right on the button for this year, but they are a little lower next year than the staff is projecting As we see it, this seems to be pretty compatible with the kind of growth we've had in the aggregates recently and the Greenbook's assumption that we'll have the same degree of restraint over the forecast period We would guess that the risk of error would be on the down side and perhaps very much on the down side for the next six months or so I say that partly because there doesn't seem to be a real thrust in the economy anywhere right now, with the exception perhaps of exports, and also because of the sharp deceleration in the aggregates The staff memo did a good job of eliminating a lot of the worries I had about the slowing in the aggregates, but as the staff admits--and, of course, we all know--this could be reflecting to some degree a slower growth in the economy than would be healthy And we, like Bob Forrestal, Si Keehn, Tom Melzer, Gary Stern, and maybe some others, are more optimistic than the staff about the degree of inflation that we will have, and we have felt that way for some time We think the staff is about right for this year because of what is already in place for the first quarter, and that puts us at 4-3/4 percent on the CPI for the year But we're expecting a deceleration in 1991, down to the neighborhood of 3-3/4 percent maybe, because of the drop in M2 growth in the second quarter and also the projection on the part of the staff that we will have a constant federal funds rate over the forecast period And, finally, we think the credibility we will get on our anti-inflation policy, if in fact we do hold the federal funds rate steady over the next 18 months in the face of rather sluggish real growth, really ought to have at least a moderate [salutary] effect on the rate of inflation that we actually achieve I was intrigued by Si Keehn's comments about "ponding" in his District; we've had a little dry spell, Si, and I think we would be happy with a little "puddling"   Mr Chairman, I think the last several years of monetary policy have been some of our very finest; I wouldn't go back and change any vote that I've cast during that time It has been many years since I went through an entire session without dissenting in favor of tighter money I started off thinking about the short-run objectives with exactly what you had in mind an asymmetrical directive because of this apparent softness in the economy and the slow growth in the aggregates Then I started looking at the economy a little more closely and I read Don's and his associates' memo And when I looked at the economy, I couldn't see what it was that was going to make us turn down; and his memo on the behavior of the aggregates gave me a good deal of comfort So, I became somewhat uncomfortable with the asymmetrical part of it, since I think our objective is price stability and we're going to have to take some responsible risks on the side of restraint if we're going to get there I came out with alternative B, but I favor symmetry I certainly wouldn't dissent on this, but I do think that in general it's better to have a symmetrical directive because that suggests we are able to go either way I think that would give sufficient leeway  -51-    7/2-3/90  to do exactly what you have in mind I don't have any great problem with asymmetry, but I have a slight preference, as I think Governor Angell has also, for symmetrical language But I think you're very close to where we ought to be on this You made a good statement; I found particularly helpful your analysis of the current conditions, and I take some comfort in your view of inventories I share that feeling I don't know what's going to make us turn down So, if I voted, I would go with symmetrical but not dissent on asymmetrical   We need some kind of reserve measure tied to M2, but there's no way--   Our present structure was set up to target Ml, which then ceased to be a good indicator We have all this institutional set-up in effect and it's not useful   Very cleverly done, too   I thought it was great at the time, but I didn't know what was going to happen to Ml   Peter, does anybody think we've tightened any because we went above our expected--?   I haven't seen any indication of it; I just wondered if you had   You are in the [minority] Of all the observers you're one of the few who really think that Don't virtually all observers think of it as a target?   You have to be able to predict--   This is obviously a very volatile and highly uncertain period and any economic forecast is going to be subject to an unusual degree of uncertainty At the same time, I think we have to avoid overemphasizing these uncertainties To me the main thing that has changed is that we have this oil problem in the Middle East and we don't know how that is going to affect the price of oil Given the kind of assumptions that the staff has made about what will happen to the price of oil, I believe their forecast is a very plausible one and I think the economic projections make sense I would guess that the odds of error are about equal in both directions The key feature of the forecast to me is not so much that a recession is predicted, but that the recession the staff is projecting is relatively shallow and brief And when you think about recessions that we've had in the past, they have almost always been preceded by some kind of overheating of the economy inventories have been bloated to some extent, usually inflation has accelerated rapidly, and interest rates generally have risen rapidly But those conditions really don't exist for the most part today So again, I think the staff's projection is pretty well on target I make this point because I think it implies that the policy approach that we take ought to be cautious and measured, like the one that we have been taking in recent years I don't think there's any cause for panic now even though we obviously need to be alert to what is going to happen in the Middle East  So far as our District economy is concerned, usually I don't see anything that's all that different, but I come out with a little different view than Bob Forrestal did I don't think the Beigebook  -20-    10/2/90  report reflects conditions as well as what we've heard since then because our most recent anecdotal information suggests that economic activity is still growing for the most part, but at very slow rates The sharp slowing that we had been reporting early in the year seems to have subsided The main weak point in our area, as is true I guess in most other places, is certainly commercial building We have some major problems in the Baltimore-Washington-Norfolk corridor It looks as if we increasingly will have to deal with the kind of real estate problems that some other parts of the country have been through Apart from that particular situation, however, I would describe the activity in our area as still growing, but at a very, very modest pace   You took time to add an "A+" though   It's not a holiday for financial markets, though it is a bank holiday   But the securities market will be open   Mr Chairman, if you would favor this move without the budget agreement because of economic considerations, wouldn't it be wiser to link it more to those economic considerations so we don't have this precedent of having acted because fiscal policy has acted? I think that could set a precedent for us in the future that--   You have a point there You still stressed it in the context of a longer-term objective of trying to control inflation, given that the aggregates have picked up some, but a lot of that pickup may be fictitious It seems to me that under those circumstances maybe a little lower interest rate is compatible with keeping the money supply running at the rate we had in mind all along, and couching it in those terms--   Yes, that's essentially what I'm saying   But I would still express that in terms of reiterating our long-term objectives   This is perfectly compatible with that and it's not throwing in the towel [on inflation]; that's what we're concerned about   All I'm saying is let's make that a part of the statement I think most of us would agree that that is the way we want to do it   It's hard to know, really, what funds rate level to pick out of thin air that will give us the rate of growth we want in the aggregates I was cheered by the pickup in M2, but when you examine it you wonder if that isn't part fictitious   To me, if in fact M2 is really still relatively weak, then this easing is perfectly compatible with the policy that aims toward price stability But if M2 for some reason or other strengthened a great deal beyond what we think, then--   I'd feel a little better if I knew how that reserve requirement matter worked out   Is this change in the reserve requirements going to have any real impact?  -50-    10/2/90   Mr Chairman, this is a time when we have to be extremely cautious, as everybody has suggested here We have had recent increases in the core rate of inflation; we have weakness in the dollar and complete uncertainty as to how this budget package is going to play The more I look at it the more it bothers me For example, I don't know whether the public is going to [react] the same way And there is this nervousness in the bond market, which made me lean initially toward doing nothing on the federal funds rate But to me changing the federal funds rate is not really a change in policy; it's a change in policy if we really are trying to do something with a rate of growth in the aggregates And you have satisfied me that your intention is to try to keep to what I think is an appropriate target So, I don't think that's a change in policy The market, however, is going to look at it as a change in policy, and that's why I suggested earlier that we couch it in terms of not having abandoned our long-run target, but just as a way of implementing what we want to do   So, I would go along with it It wouldn't have been my first choice, but you're probably more right than I was when I got here As to this second step, I sure would agree with Jerry Corrigan--as you did and I think everybody has--that we want to look at that one very closely But to the extent that we can disabuse the market of the notion that we really have changed the thrust of our policy every time the federal funds rate jumps a little--   As I've said before, it's a modern day version of the real bills doctrine We set a particular rate and the market gets all the money it wants at that rate The only way we have to encourage it to take more is to lower that rate, or the only way to discourage it is to raise the rate, which is what we had under the real bills doctrine And I don't like the initiative for the    10/2/90  generation of the money supply to come from the market It ought to be supply determined rather than demand determined since the long-term velocity of M2 looks like a pretty stable function to me now So, I've always endorsed that I don't have the answer, as I indicated earlier We just don't have any reserve measure that can be expected to control M2, so I don't know what the alternative is And I am very frustrated over that   One thing to bear in mind is that the employment report comes out on Friday and that's significant   Well, at some point that law has to be changed, it seems to me This is probably not the time to do it   We really ought to get rid of that; it's a fiction [unintelligible] reserve requirement rather than some notes and deposits   Mr Chairman, I think that Don gave us a good solution to the problem, and I certainly agree with Bob Parry that the    11/13/90  final option is the best one We certainly don't want to lock ourselves into the pre-1979 procedures where we have a very narrow range and have all the problems attendant to that When you look at the third and fourth options, we have all these difficulties writing what we want in the directive now, and I can't imagine this group being able to sit around the table and come up with an alternative that we would agree on for the language there So, this kicks me back toward the final option If we're not willing to do anything in the way of adopting a new one, then I think what we have now is better than any of the alternatives other than dropping it   Yes, go back to option one if we don't go to five, but I much prefer five I've always been opposed to any limits of any sort because my predilections are to try to control things with some kind of a reserve measure That necessitates a wider range over which the federal funds rate can move than we've been willing to tolerate in the past   Well, when Roger used to say we were targeting the federal funds rate, Chairman Volcker used to say "That's what you always say, Roger" He always used those exact words   Mike, the absence of objections might be because some of us have been objecting for so many years with so little success that we just finally quit out of a sense of futility But I see renewed hope, based on what the Chairman said about that And I think it is tied into Governor Angell's point that it's really closely related to what our new procedures turn out to be, if indeed we adopt new procedures   That was enthusiastic! It suggests, Mr Chairman, that if we want enthusiasm on the part of the Committee that we should discuss insignificant items   Mr Chairman, I think the Greenbook's forecast is certainly plausible and internally consistent, given the kinds of assumptions the staff is making about policy and the price of oil over the forecast horizon But it seems to me that the risk is clearly on the down side even if one assumes that oil prices will behave as the staff has concluded by declining significantly What impresses me about all the recent data we have received, both statistical and anecdotal, is that it is just universally bad As Mike Prell indicated a while ago, the worst is the employment figures But the National Association of Purchasing Managers' figures don't look good We got the figures on industrial production and capacity utilization this morning and they certainly didn't look good The Beigebook suggested that virtually all parts of the economy--in most sectors and in most regions--are experiencing slower growth or even some decline  -23-    11/13/90  in business activity From our directors and other grassroots contacts, except for those in the agricultural area, we're just not getting any good comments at all At last Thursday's meeting of our board, for example, they were more pessimistic than I remember for years and years; even at the meeting before there were a few bright spots that were mentioned, but absolutely none at this one We even had one letter from an unusually affable former director who is a strong supporter of this System saying that the System really didn't understand how bad it was out there He was irked by all the statements that we don't know whether we are in a recession or not and he proceeded to give me a set of figures that demonstrated to his satisfaction that we are, though they were hardly conclusive  Obviously, none of this suggests that we're about to fall over the edge of the cliff But given the state of business and consumer confidence, which as I assess it is lower than I can remember for many a day, it seems to me that there's a better than even chance that we're going to have a greater drop in GNP than the staff is projecting It may well mean also that the recovery is not going to come as early as the second quarter Now, I think the downside risks would increase pretty significantly if the growth in the aggregates comes in below what is projected, and I'm very much concerned by this further evidence of weak growth in the aggregates I hope the Committee is going to take some steps later on to try to get the aggregates more nearly on what seems to me to be an appropriate path Finally, I would like to say that I sure was happy to see the projections on inflation that the staff has made for down the road a way It's certainly true that we're going to have some turbulent times, but I think we have made some progress toward our long-run objective of achieving price stability I'm delighted to see this reflected in the forecast, and I believe the staff is going to be right on that   Is that your unbiased report?   That's a subdivision of the Fifth District, Mr Chairman   It would be easier in that you would not have to worry about what the level of borrowed reserves was as much as you did   Mr Chairman, these are obviously uncertain and difficult times not only for consumers and producers but also for forecasters This looks a little different from anything we've ever had before I think the staff's forecast is highly plausible, given    12/18/90  the assumptions on which it rests But our hunch is that the projection for real GNP for the current quarter and the first half of 1991 will turn out to be on the high side even if the oil prices do come down from the relatively optimistic path that the staff has assumed I have several reasons for saying this One is the big revision the staff has made in net exports of goods and services by showing a pretty steep, near-term drop in imports which, of course, has the effect of raising both real GNP and net imports of goods and services compared to the November Greenbook forecast We think the direction of this revision was clearly appropriate, given the weakness in domestic demand that's been evident in the recent data and also the census data mentioned in the Greenbook and again the figures that we've gotten on the merchandise trade balance for October--though a lot of that may wash out as Ted suggested Despite all those things, the magnitude of the revision looks a little big to us And the second reason is this persistent weakness in M2, which I don't think anybody really can explain satisfactorily That continues to worry us a great deal And finally, we've been impressed by the continued strong negative tone of most of the anecdotal information that we've been getting from all sorts of sources One piece of information that struck me as particularly impressive came from the  who is in the plastics business and makes parts for manufacturers all over the country and sells them on a nationwide business He called up specifically to tell us that the bottom had fallen completely out of his order book, which is something that he had not seen before   This had happened last month Now, we feel somewhat more comfortable with the staff's inflation forecast than with the projections on output and employment The staff has revised downward a little its projections for inflation for 1991 and 1992 from the last Greenbook, and that strikes us as appropriate But as I said earlier, I really think the monetary restraint that we have put in place over the last several years as a whole may well produce greater long-term benefits on the inflation side than the staff has been projecting even if this recession turns out--as I hope it will--to be as mild as they are projecting   Mr Chairman, I was just looking at the P* model shown in Chart 9 and, as I read that, it provides me with a pretty good comfort level Don, do you take much comfort in that?   Well, in the long run it has been pretty darn stable   That's right   If we did this, you don't think it would provide an undue degree of surprise, do you?   That's the way I read it   Mr Chairman, you formulated exactly what I would have done I just want to express the hope that the Board of Governors in its wisdom does what you suggested it might do tomorrow so that the net effect would be a 1/4 point change in the federal funds rate If the Board does not act, then 1/4 point is all I would want to do at this point I think a 1/2-point move would do things to the bond market and the foreign exchange market that we wouldn't like very  -35-    12/18/90  much That would be seen as throwing in the towel [on inflation] at this point So, I'm with you 100 percent on that   Which might or might not be used   I think we could put out a news release if we decided this sort of thing   Bob Parry and I are going to be on next year too [as voting members]!   And it's on the other side where we've made our mistakes every time throughout our history practically   You haven't used the BIS on this have you, Sam? We have done this ourselves?   Mr Chairman, I have been on the [morning] call thus far this year and I think Peter handled this exceptionally well under very difficult conditions But it necessitated his resolving these frequent doubts between the borrowed reserve target and the expected federal funds rate always, it seemed to me, on the side of the expected federal funds rate And that's how he kept the market apprised of what we really were aiming at Peter, I just wanted to ask you if you could remember a period when the relationship between the borrowed reserve level and the federal funds rate was quite as tenuous as it seems to have been [recently]   I hope there wasn't another because I know how you struggled with that   Si, one time during the week I was joking with members of the Board's staff [on the call], and Peter asked if we would mind stopping so he'd have time to get into the market It looked like we were going to delay him unduly--which was unintentional by the way!   It wouldn't appear to be as much of a giveaway program now with the banks so troubled   If you could ever sell it, this is the time you could sell it   They already have been seen coming out  -14-    2/5-6/91   I have a question to which probably everybody except me knows the answer on Chart 3   This is shown as a percent of real federal purchases What is the fiscal impetus there?   Yes, I would be interested in seeing your memo I'm sorry I was the only one who didn't understand   I was just curious I was trying to figure out what it could be and I couldn't come up with anything   They're not Persian carpets, are they?   Mr Chairman, I think the staff has done a very thorough job in putting together their economic forecast but, like so many of the other speakers, I believe that it may be a bit on the optimistic side and that the risk of error with respect to real GNP is at least moderately tilted toward the down side I think the staff is probably about right on its guess that the war may end in the spring but my fear is that it will be the late spring rather than the early spring In any event, while the war is going on there are going to be a lot of continuing uncertainties and periodic setbacks and it's going to damp both business and consumer confidence as well as sentiment in  -28-    2/5-6/91  the financial markets Now, these negative impacts are going to be amplified, I think, by three big problems the situation in the Northeast; the perceived fragility in the banking system; and the extreme weakness in commercial real estate in substantial parts of the country So, we think there's a significant chance that the economy will recover later and probably less strongly than the staff is projecting Our guess would be that the recovery might begin in the third quarter rather than in the second And we expect only about 1 percent growth in real GNP on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis, which does not put us comfortably within the central tendency, as Si was, but labels us as an outlier in that the staff is predicting about 2 percent growth over this period We also are an outlier on the inflation side because we're more optimistic about inflation under the assumption that we can avoid a long and destructive war in the Gulf In addition to the effects of the declining oil prices on the CPI, we think that the underlying trend rate of inflation is going to begin to respond in '91 to the considerable deceleration that we've had in the growth of the aggregates over the last several years I think it's quite possible that our core inflation rate for the CPI may be down to around 3-1/2 percent or lower by the end of the year   Mr Chairman, I would agree that alternative B is the best We have just taken a fairly significant, strong, and dramatic policy action and any further move now would appear to me to be sending the signal that we had pushed the panic button The staff may be right in saying that we won't have to ease further in this cycle I certainly hope that that's true because it's in that area and the failure to tighten up promptly that we've usually made our mistakes But in my own forecast I see it somewhat weaker than the staff does So, I think it's possible that we may have to do a bit more [easing] before we start upward, though I hope not But because of that possibility, I would go with your asymmetric directive tilted toward ease Lest anyone think that a hawk has become a dove, I think I will be among those who will argue the strongest quite early for an increase in the federal funds rate, if the economy does turn around   Yes I was just going to say that I have a lot of sympathy for what Tom said I think that reserve measures can be refined, though There are several things that are reservable that are not part of M2 The whole [reserve structure] is set up with the idea of controlling M1 but we know ahead of time, because requirements against interbank deposits and government deposits are lagged, what volume of reserves we need for that And we could put those in at the beginning of the period Those against the M2 portion are not lagged quite as much So anything we put out over and above that, which would be something of a refined measure of total reserves, would be available for supporting M2 and nothing else I think we could get to something like that Another thing I'd like to see us do is to try to make some estimates of the amount of currency that is going abroad because that [outflow means the] currency component is badly distorted and if we think that's part of our domestic money supply, we're being badly mislead But I really think the rate of growth in the aggregates is demand-determined now, and I think as Tom does that it ought to be supply-determined to some degree and that's not easy because of the reserve structure we have Also, I think financial innovation would create a number of instruments that would not be reservable; indeed, a lot of them in M2 are not reservable now But I think we can get something better by moving in general in that direction And I would support--   I agree with what Governor Angell suggested I'd also like to move monetary aggregates up [in the list] I'd rather have them before trends in economic activity, but that's raising an issue I don't think you want to get into   Mr Chairman, I agree completely with your point about federal funds targeting I've felt for a long time that we needed to find something else, preferably some kind of reserve measure, but that's not all that easy with a lot of the parts of M2  -2-    3/26/91  not reserveable and with the proclivity of the financial markets for innovating if we did slap reserve requirements on those But I think we need to move in that direction, and we probably need a little more consultation than we've had The problem I had with the memo was that I didn't think the authors necessarily were suggesting more consultation I think you've been unusually good in calling us together, but there have been one or two instances when I wished we had gotten together and we didn't--the change in the discount rate right before the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting, for example One of my colleagues called and said "You know, you've just been disenfranchised on your vote" Well, I happened to agree with that move; we were one of the Reserve Banks that had sent in [a request to lower the discount rate], and I didn't really feel disenfranchised But he felt very strongly that that [action] had precluded the FOMC from determining the federal funds rate, which he thought was the province of the FOMC And I can understand that argument So, I would opt for slightly more consultation, but I think you've been better than anyone else has ever been in providing that   I think there probably would be a preference for unwinding the warehousing first, too, Mr Chairman   We might be able to couple that with opposition to letting the FDIC borrow $25 million from us and get a credit--   That wasn't really what I had in mind, but that's an interesting fallout   I bet it would too I was just thinking about the monetary policy accord in the early '50s We need a credit accord too, where they don't try to dictate the composition of our assets, which is what the FDIC maneuver does and what this warehousing does   Yes, I didn't mean to get ahead of you   Mr Chairman, we've moved in a slightly different direction from Bob Forrestal in that we think the near-term outlook has improved significantly since the February meeting Back then we were expecting the recession to last through most, if not all, of the second quarter, and we felt that the risk of error in the Board staff's projection was clearly on the down side We now agree with the staff that the economy is likely to turn back up in the second  -25-    3/26/91  quarter and we think the bulk of the risk has now shifted to the up side, particularly in the second and third quarters, although obviously there is still some risk that we could have more down side weakness than we see For example, exports might not do as well as we are thinking  The main reasons why we feel a little more bullish are what you might expect One has been this decidedly improved level of confidence on the part of businesses and consumers that followed the ending of the war The second is that we've had this flurry of scattered statistics that suggest some little intensification of activity And the third is that the grass roots information that we're picking up around our District is decidedly better than what we saw at the time of our last meeting And the improvement appears to be more than what could be accounted for by the normal seasonal things, which is something that businessmen have difficulty distinguishing when they're reporting on whether business conditions have improved For example, at our last board meeting I saw what was the most abrupt change in the attitude of our directors between two meetings that I've seen at any time since I've been with the System They were practically all on the positive side The one exception was our director who had been on the positive side before and he has moved to the negative side now But seems to move in a different direction from everybody else on a lot of issues And then the last but by no means the least reason we're more optimistic is the pickup in growth of M2 It seems to be responding to our earlier easing actions and, as Mike Prell indicated, that doesn't guarantee a strong recovery but it certainly does enhance the possibility that that is what we'll get  On the price side, we were particularly glad to see that the staff has lowered its forecast of inflation somewhat over the period ahead We're still generally optimistic that long-term inflationary pressures are going to move in the right direction as a result of what I think has been a very wise monetary policy over a period of several years now I think we're going to hit pay dirt on that one But I am disturbed, of course, by the rapid run-up in both the consumer price index and the producer price index even after allowing for the known special factors I'd be even more concerned about that if the recent growth in the aggregates doesn't slow somewhat in the near future from its pace in the last couple of months   Mr Chairman, several months ago we sat around this table as we eased policy and reminded ourselves--and several people participated in this--that we had better be ready when the time came to avoid the mistake that we usually have made in the past in not tightening soon enough I was prepared to deliver that same talk again and also to throw in a caveat that we ought not pay much attention to our favorite economic indicator, the level of employment You made essentially the same talk and made all the points I thought were pertinent So, I very much agree with you that we ought to stay with "B" with a symmetrical directive I also agree that if we move in either direction, it would be desirable to meet and talk about it  -43-    3/26/91   Si is the first fellow who has ever had a hired gun to speak for him at a meeting!   It would be "somewhat" still?   Mr Chairman, I think the staff's downward revision in their projection of real GNP for the second quarter makes sense in light of the incoming information More generally, the overall profile that they've predicted for the next three or four quarters strikes us as eminently reasonable given the staff's policy assumptions, the behavior of most of the leading indicators, and the pattern of recent anecdotal information It's interesting to me how close the projections of the staff are to those of the private economy Mike suggested theirs were a bit stronger, but it seems to me they are remarkably close, which is something that many people might view with alarm given the record of forecasters in the past I might be one of those except that I believe they're about right on this And I believe that the risk of error is about equal on the up side and on the down side I guess the most important question we ought to ask ourselves is How great is the risk that we will have a big error on the down side? In other words, how likely is it that we will get a significantly greater decline in the current quarter than the staff expects and that this will be followed perhaps by a greater decline in the third quarter? Obviously, we can't rule that out entirely; but in the absence of some totally unlikely, unexpected negative supply shocks such as we had last August, the probability of that kind of decline seems to me to be pretty low We've already taken out a lot of insurance to prevent such a thing happening, with the cumulative policy actions over the last six months or so And beyond that, we're now seeing new signs of life in residential construction, strength in the stock market and some of the other leading indicators, and a recent upturn in the National Association of Purchasing Managers' index, which was higher in April than it was in the lowest quarter trough of any previous full economic upturn  So, those all suggest to me that we are probably now very near the bottom of a recession Whether it's going to be longer or whether it's a near trough, I don't know But it seems to me that a significant further weakening is decidedly unlikely I was particularly glad to see that the staff has reduced its inflation forecast because I have felt for some time that we had followed a very wise policy [course of] action and that it would pay off in terms of inflation numbers The staff has cut a couple of notches off the inflation projections for both this year and next year and they're now predicting a core rate of inflation of about 3 percent at the end of 1992 And I think we ought to have at least that degree of progress against inflation But it is important that we keep in mind what the staff has assumed when it made these projections, and that is that we'll come very close to achieving the midpoint of our target range for M2 I think it's critically important that we take whatever steps are required to keep M2 somewhat in that range in case the recovery and consequently the money demand turns out to be somewhat stronger than it now appears to us that it might be   This is in the Bluebook, Norm?   Mr Chairman, I've never disagreed with you before, much to my pleasure, and I certainly agree with your comments that the baseline growth rate for M2 is much too high and that strategy II is near what we ought to be aiming for I even went so  -35-    7/2-3/91  far as to say one time to a reporter, facetiously, that much to my dismay I was tempted to just give you my proxy and go play golf And you, on another occasion, said you were going to hold me to that! I will try to cover my tracks by saying that I suppose at some point inevitably we're all going to differ  So, I'm with you on the first two-thirds but [not] when we get down to the discussion of the ranges I recognize that long-run alternative II, which means extending the '91 ranges to '92, could encompass strategy II--an idea that we both endorse But as the Bluebook points out on the bottom of page 19, long-run alternative III, which lowers all the ranges 1/2 percentage point is "more consistent with the spirit and intent" of our anti-inflationary strategy And that would provide fresh evidence of our commitment to the very things that Governor Angell has just described very well I think that is a very important point, as he emphasized As I said yesterday and as he said much better today, we are at a very crucial point; we've had remarkable success up to this point and many forecasters are now beginning to lower their projections of inflation in part because they think the economy is not really going to spurt as much as it has in past recoveries But I think a large part of that is due to the growing credibility that we have gained because we have had this remarkable record over the last several years I think leaving these ranges unchanged in '92 would raise some doubts and possibly slow, if not break, the momentum that we've gained thus far But lowering them would reinforce our credibility and I think would reduce the transitional costs of achieving price stability Consequently, I very strongly favor alternative III I recognize that M2 growth may well be in the upper part of that range next year if we adopt that alternative, but that strikes me as a pretty manageable problem that we could afford to take on in view of the benefits that I think we would get from the credibility standpoint by lowering our ranges And if, as Governor Angell postulated, we had to raise them, I share his confidence that you could explain that very well We really have a golden opportunity here that we haven't had until now, and I think we have to seize it Although there are many reasons why I could argue that we ought to temporize, I'm afraid that I just have to come out for alternative III   Show the kind of restraint that Governor Angell and I showed!   I'll second that, Mr Chairman   Except they had it a point too high!   My term will be up; I sure would like to know now  -11-    7/2-3/91  SPEAKER(?) We'll send you a postcard!   Mr Chairman, I hate to say this because it may be a source of worry and concern for the staff, but our projection for '91 is almost exactly what you all have So, you may want to go back and check yours! As I read the Greenbook, adjusting for the swings in the overseas earnings of oil companies, it's pretty clear that the [recession] must have hit bottom in the second quarter That's a reasonable conclusion based on what we know about the April and May  -12-    7/2-3/91  figures and the little we know about the June figures Whatever the final record does show, I don't think the bottom will come any later than July in view of this evidence we have of increased consumer spending and strength in residential construction In any case, I think that the staff's 1991 projections are very plausible and that the risks of error are about equal on both sides for both real GNP and inflation  When we get to '92, however, we differ right much We are much more optimistic on both the growth side and on the inflation side We're projecting about 1/2 percentage point more growth in real GNP and we're forecasting only a 3 percent rise in the CPI, which is about 3/4 of a point lower than the Greenbook and well below most other forecasts that we've seen Now, I need to emphasize something that we have already alluded to earlier, and that is that our staff's 1992 projections are based, in accordance with our instructions, on what we would regard as an appropriate monetary policy in the next six quarters So, what we've done is to assume that M2 will come in slightly above the midpoint of its current range this year and that the FOMC will lower the range for 1992 to 2 to 6 percent and will hold the actual growth of money within that range This assumption of a lower target range for 1992 has a direct bearing on our projection since we believe, given the background of very favorable behavior in the money supply over the last few years, that reducing the range further would increase significantly the credibility of our anti- inflationary strategy and, consequently, would result in a more favorable division of nominal GNP between real growth and inflation-- because of [how we factor in] forward-looking expectations, Lee And without that strategy [unintelligible] If we achieve what we think are these highly plausible results, then we think the prospects of the subsequent years after 1992 will be very bright indeed I think we have a real opportunity here to make significant progress--the best we've had since I've been around   You left too soon!   I would strongly support that suggestion I've been urging my colleagues in Richmond to do just that, but they have  -45-    7/2-3/91  been resisting because they don't really think it can be done And it is difficult, unless we're saying that the reserveable part of M2 is going to grow at the same rate as the nonreserveable part If we paid interest on reserve balances, it would make that more likely But having to reach up in the air and pick some federal funds rate that's going to give some predictable rate of growth in the money supply is just a crap shoot at best I'd really like to move toward some kind of reserve targeting if it can be done But it might necessitate a complete change in the reserve requirement regime to do it successfully   Don, is there anything that suggests--other than what your material contains--that the small time and savings deposits might be moving into bond and stock funds?   Would I be justified in being less concerned about the weakness in June because of where this money has gone?   I come out, I think, about where you do It gives me some comfort knowing where they've gone; otherwise I'd be concerned that M2 has been too weak   I agree with "B" symmetric, Mr Chairman I would like to suggest that we consider moving the "monetary aggregates" phrase up to either first or second place, though I'm a little concerned by the weakness we've had, but I think there's a good explanation for it So, I think Governor Angell is right; we have not been too tight But at some point the aggregates may give us a little more accurate information and I'd like to pay more attention to them   That's fine   So move   Mr Chairman, I'm glad you gave us a chance to take a look at this I don't think it would surprise anyone who has listened to what I've said that I would favor such a study And now, like Governor Angell, I don't know where the answer would lead; and Al Broaddus certainly doesn't know exactly where it would lead But I've never really been comfortable trying to control the aggregates by manipulating the federal funds rate because I think the demand for money for any given level of income in the short run fluctuates too much to do that I have some sympathy for those alternatives that have a degree of automatism But I remember that when we had the procedures in 1979-82 and we were supposed to adjust the level of borrowed reserves by half the amount of any miss in the aggregates, about two-thirds of the moves we made were also discretionary So, I'm not under any illusions that we're really about to put [policy] on automatic pilot But a lot of things have come along in the way of studies on this since we last looked at it All I would advocate is that we use the System's considerable research resources to examine this question because I think all of us feel some dissatisfaction with the way we do it But I don't believe there's anybody here who really feels that he knows the answers as to exactly how it ought to be done    8/20/91  It was simple in my mind when we wanted to control Ml; but it's not simple when we're trying to control M2 and only a small fraction of M2 is reservable And we're not paying interest on required reserves, and that encourages further innovations So, where this will lead, I don't know I suspect we probably won't get far from where we are, but we ought to take a good hard look at it And I think Don and Dave have done us a good service in providing us these various alternatives   One of the big reasons reserve targeting has been opposed in the past has been the feeling that it would cause more fluctuations in short-term interest rates And as Al indicates in his letter, there is some evidence now that that might not be the case for long-term rates That could be an important factor, I think    8/20/91   It's awfully hard, even if you know what you want to accomplish, to pick the [appropriate] fed funds rate   You'd be surprised as to what the aggregates are doing with that particular fed funds rate, which we thought would be something very different   And therein lies our frustration, I think   Well, I think Governor Kelley has done us a real service in pointing these things out I've been uncomfortable for a long time with the way we've handled this thing And even though we ourselves don't pay much attention to this, the Fed watchers do pay a lot of attention to it and they think it's an indication of our practice More importantly, if we do change them, they think that means we've changed our emphasis So, if we continue doing that, there's a strong argument for doing what is almost the unthinkable, as you and Jerry have pointed out, of debating this and maybe reaching an impasse at every meeting So, I've concluded that what I think you are all moving toward is that we should eliminate this language and take another route Changing this list, even infrequently, tends to promote the perception already held by many that we are constantly changing our objectives and we're trading off one objective against the other And I don't think considering the list at each meeting would add anything to our policy deliberations; that could hamper us,  -13-    8/20/91  as Don pointed out, and you and Jerry also have mentioned So, my preference would be to adopt what is Governor Kelley's point 3 and Don's example under 4 Don gives three examples and I like the one labeled 4b, which is at the bottom of page 3 in his memo, because it puts long-run price stability at the head of the list And needless to say, I'd want to retain the reference to the aggregates because right now I think that is the best route to get to long-term price stability, although our views may change as a result of this study we talked about earlier But adherence to that approach doesn't necessarily bind us to that every time If we have a particular situation like we have now, with extreme weakness in the aggregates for some unexplainable reason, or like the stock market crash in October of 1987, then we could certainly change it But I would like to start off with saying something about price stability As Don pointed out, there is such a reference in the previous paragraph, but I don't think it would hurt to put it at the beginning of the operational paragraph too and make it a generic reference I would very much favor doing that   I think this point bears on the one that you raised earlier about our not thinking of a change in the federal funds rate as a change in policy and yet the market, or most of the market, does If we had this overall summary statement as in Don's example 4b on page 3 "In the context of the Committee's long-run  -15-    8/20/91  objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, somewhat greater reserve restraint" then we can go into these things But we have said that that is in our judgment compatible with our long-run objective and I think it would reduce the tendency of the public to think of that as a change in policy when it really isn't That's one of the main reasons I lean toward a reserve base measure because if we had that, we could have interest rates go this way or that way and we wouldn't have any better idea as to which way they would go than anybody else I don't know if they would tend to be interpreted that way, but it is just the natural fallout of trying to seek a long-run objective; it may involve lower rates or it may involve higher rates, and that can change all over the place from time to time   Celebration?  END OF MEETING  -42-       Mr Chairman, we're very, very close to the staff, as we usually are, and maybe even closer this time than ordinarily We'd be very happy if we got the outcome that they think is most likely, but from the standpoint of policy the relevant question is where the risks lie I think the staff concludes as we do that the risks probably are on the down side, when you think about the insurance problems--and now we have the casualty insurance companies hit by hurricane Bob--the so-called credit crunch, and the weakness in the aggregates We ought to keep in mind some other things, too There's always doubt when you're in a recession as to what it is that's going to take you out of it I remember that in every single one we've had Mike just enumerated three major factors that had caused the staff to think that maybe this forecast ought to be revised slightly upward the behavior of consumer expenditures, residential construction, and net exports The thing that worries us most of all, I think, is the behavior of payroll unemployment and employment We went back and looked at the behavior of this for all the postwar upturns in the first three months following a trough If you look at that and compare the first estimate that we have now for the last month, it really doesn't look very different from what we've had in the other postwar upturns except in one case So, this may not be quite as alarming as it looks on the surface With these things in mind, I don't think it's time yet to push the panic button But I think we have to be very, very alert to the risk to the near-term outlook that is being posed by the behavior of the aggregates since we simply can't explain by econometric models or otherwise all of this weakness that we've seen in them And that makes me worry somewhat that monetary policy could have been tighter than we really meant it to be   I want to be a spectator, not a participant   Mr Chairman, in most cases I would agree with Lee, but I think there are some special factors at work here So, I would buy all three of your recommendations--"B," asymmetry toward ease, and version II   Well, I think getting a hand on the true state of the economy and its near-term prospects is about as difficult this time as it has been at any time I've ever been involved in it, and I've been doing this longer than I would like to remember Much of the anecdotal information that we've been getting lately has been negative and discouraging Of course, there is some positive news-- especially in the manufacturing area--and similarly the statistics are pretty mixed But despite all that conflicting information, I think the staff has made a particularly strong case for the kind of moderate growth that they're projecting here And I think it's important to bear in mind that this is just a moderate [recovery] and not in any sense a strong one Real GNP, for example, is expected to grow at only slightly above what most people assume to be the long-run economic potential So, if this is all that happens, this recovery is definitely going to be on the slow end of those that we've had in the postwar period Our guess is that the downside risk on the forecast, while somewhat greater than the upside risk, is not as much greater as most people appear to think today We're all aware of the downside risk presented by such things as the weakness in M2, apparently continuing restraint on credit supplies to some industries and in some geographical areas, the fiscal restraint in the federal and the state and local government [sectors], and the heavy overhang of commercial real estate throughout the country But balancing all these negatives, at least to some extent, are strong increases in the leading indicators of manufacturing activity, an apparent reduction in the underlying inflationary pressures--although Mike did explain very clearly that that's not an unambiguous signal--and the substantial reductions that we in the Federal Reserve have effected on short-term and long-term rates  -10-    10/1/91  The one aspect of this recovery that does appear to be clear to me, really, is that we have made substantial progress toward reducing inflation or the underlying trend rate of inflation The staff's projection of about a 3-1/2 percent rate by late next year in the context of continued moderate real growth seems pretty reasonable to us And if we can get 3-1/2 percent next year and then maybe 2-1/2 percent in 1993, then I think we will be closing in on what is effectively price stability Now, I'm certainly aware of the risk that excessive monetary restraint could damage the economy and its apparently precarious position and that we could make it more difficult, if not impossible, to achieve sustained price stability So, we definitely want to exercise a degree of caution But at the same time I think it's important that we not be too cautious We clearly have some momentum in reducing the inflation rate now; our credibility is growing and that will not only increase our chances of attaining our goal but will also reduce the cost of attaining it   It's "B"  -29-    10/1/91   Mr Chairman, I come out right where you do but I really do feel a great loss in seeing M2 lose its meaning I feel almost like a baby who has lost his pacifier! [Laughter]   It took a while!   Mr Chairman, there's another complication A number of us have meetings of our executive committees or full boards on Thursday and we'll be addressing the question of the discount rate And if we know that we're going to cut the federal funds rate 1/4 point on Friday, we can't tell the directors yet They don't have the  -37-    11/5/91  information they need to make a rational decision So, there's another reason for doing it now rather than then, although I have a lot of sympathy for what Peter and his associates have been saying   Sure, I can; but I have knowledge that they don't have that I can't share with them   And I wouldn't--   Well, it is [a concern] to me not to share information and give them my best judgment, which would have to be affected by the knowledge that we were going to cut [the funds rate] 1/4 point the next day We're pretty free with our directors but we never tell them anything about what we're going to do or anything about what we just did that isn't released, and we never will So we couldn't possibly tell them that this 1/4 point [reduction] was pending And yet I think their attitude would be affected to some significant extent by that if they knew   If you hadn't talked so long, maybe we could have! [Laughter]   I know I'm being facetious   Could I ask Peter one question, Mr Chairman? Peter, if we went in before the normal time, which you could and sometimes do, would that alleviate to any extent the problem that you alluded to originally?   I'd favor doing it in the morning, first thing   No, I was thinking about going ahead and doing it through the market tomorrow as soon as the market opens   That's what I think I'd do   No, nor 1130 am   It seems obvious to us that in our District people now think everything is pessimistic; whether they're consumers or business people, [they have] very low expectations A particularly striking [example] came at our last meeting, which was a joint meeting of our Baltimore/Richmond boards, when I heard the most pessimistic statements of the economic conditions I think I've heard in the 36 years or so that I've been attending these meetings And virtually all the reports we've gotten since then have been along that line  From what I read and what I've heard around the table, it's pretty clear that for the most part that pessimism is equally widespread in the rest of the country and may be even more widespread in certain places And then we got--to use Mike's term from a while ago--"a stunning confirmation" of this when we received this downward revision in the Conference Board consumer confidence series But having said all this, I think the question we have to answer this morning is Exactly what does this mean in terms of the near-term prospects for the economy? I certainly think it tells us something namely, that the recovery has been weaker up until now and probably will be weaker in the immediate future than any of us thought it was going to be The current quarter and probably the first quarter are certainly going to reflect this So, the downward revisions in the Board staff's figures are clearly indicated But I think it would be premature at this point to conclude that this apparently declining  -16-    11/5/91  confidence means that the economy is necessarily going to go into a double-dip recession as some people have been assuming Sentiment frequently remains bearish in the early stages of an economic upturn, and it's clearly even gloomier than usual this time if I remember correctly I think the media has added a lot to this because there has been so much more hype on this than in the past  Now, I know there are differences of opinion about what these consumer surveys show, but three studies done by different Federal Reserve Banks have suggested that they are not really very good predictors I would say they probably are a coincident indicator at best So, while we have this October drop in the survey of the Conference Board and this obvious pessimism in the form of anecdotal information, I'm not ready to push the panic button at this point Some of the recent data are a bit on the favorable side at least We had some upward revision in the payroll employment figures for August and September and the M2 numbers have turned around--not as much as I would like, but they've certainly turned around recently And the orders and production components of the National Association of Purchasing Managers [survey] in October were generally favorable So, I think the staff's revised forecast is reasonable And the risks on their projection are probably equally divided, although like Gary Stern--who I believe is the only other one who said this--I think they might even be tilted a little toward the up side So, we ought to approach this policy issue today very cautiously before we make any kind of major move toward ease   Would that be on Friday?   On the federal funds rate?   Mr Chairman, I'd like to suggest a compromise, which I guess would be controversial, though   Mr Chairman, there may be some people who still entertain doubts that Governor Lindsey is actually from the Fifth District, but he is wearing the Thomas Jefferson tie If you can arrange it, I think it would be good if you would call Terry Sandford and tell him you'd like him to come over and meet him; he would recognize the tie!   Mr Chairman, I think Governor Kelley has done us a real service in bringing this question up, and I would strongly support his recommendation seconded by you I'm particularly pleased that he listed price stability and then sustainable economic growth, since I feel so strongly that that is the route by which we reach sustainable economic growth So, I really like the order of those   Well, there were some others too--you included, I think   It will shorten the meetings; that's another advantage of it I wish I had thought to mention that!   What kind of insect is that white fly?   Mr Chairman, I think it's a very difficult time to forecast Of course, it's always hard but it is particularly difficult now Looking back, the vast majority of forecasts--and that certainly includes our forecast--underestimated the strength of the negative forces that are apparently working in the economy But I guess by now we really should realize that some of this restructuring and downsizing that we've seen in a lot of different industries will not only eliminate existing jobs--forever probably--but will also raise a lot of doubts in the minds of others about their job security, with predictable effects on consumer and business confidence I think we've all been aware that there are some important structural changes taking place in the economy, but we underestimated the extent to which they were restraining consumer income and spending And, of course, in this highly uncertain environment, the disinflation process is making it increasingly difficult for businesses to pass on any increase in prices The firms are naturally very reluctant to hire and are cautious about inventory management, not to mention capital expenditures This caution really augurs well for the long run because I think we're going to emerge with a much more competitive society than we had before But certainly in the short run it has some implications for the level of business activity and I think it's going to retard the recovery beyond what we had thought earlier  When you think about the structural changes and couple those with some cyclical changes occurring on top of them, it makes it very difficult to predict how strong and how persistent these restraining forces are going to be and to what extent they're going to be offset by the lagged effects of the considerable easing in monetary policy  -12-    12/17/91  we've done over a period of a number of months The Greenbook projections of the real economy strike us as reasonable and quite plausible, given what we now know We do think the staff might be a little high in their projections of inflation, although those are certainly reasonable But I believe the inflation outcome in [1992] is going to be a tad better than projected in the Greenbook if we can maintain the System's credibility about our long-term objectives That last point is a very crucial one as we move into this policy- setting process today Another measured step toward ease of the sort we've been taking for some time is probably appropriate now, but I think any more aggressive move would be quite counterproductive at this point   Don, I have been one of those who thought that M2 was flashing wrong signals I even went so far as to say in one of my more frivolous moments that it was as if I were experiencing colic like a baby who has lost his pacifier But looking at it now, as Governor Mullins indicated earlier, it might not have been flashing all the wrong signals What has happened has been along the lines of what you would have expected, taking it at face value   I think that's a much better answer than the one I suggested earlier You had warned us that there might not be [unintelligible]   Mr Chairman, I always feel very uncomfortable when I disagree with Tom Melzer, and I'm partly with him because I think we've done almost enough But if we adopt your proposal of moving [the funds rate] 1/4 point--and I would add a gratuitous bit of advice to the Board of Governors that they couple that with a 1/2 point cut in the discount rate--I think, and hope, that the market probably would conclude on its own that we've gone as far as we are going to go And some people will come out of the woodwork when they think rates have gone as low as they're going to go   I would be a little more leery of taking that second step because I think a 1/2 point move on the funds rate, even if it's done later on, might look surprisingly close to these ridiculous suggestions we've been getting with regard to fiscal policy I basically buy what you have suggested, but I share some of Tom's nervousness that we're almost there   I didn't hear it that way I'm sorry   When you invoke the proviso, if you have to, you would go 1/4 point and that's all?   I guess I'm the only one who is confused!   No, it's my fault   He may have thought you weren't up-to-date on the issues  -29-    2/4-5/92   Shall I go ahead, Mr Chairman?   I can't do what he said I would do, but actually he's given me a lot more credit for this than he should have I had put this on the back burner; I had thought about it many times earlier He surfaced the plan and sent it to me and asked for my suggestions and I made one or two suggestions, which he very graciously adopted Then he sent me another version and I made one minor suggestion on that So, the thought of giving me the credit for it is really misplaced Since he has entitled it "The Virginia Plan," I wish very much that I could have Patrick Henry do the defense! There's little doubt that he and Thomas Jefferson and George Washington and George Mason would certainly have a favorite rate of growth of the money supply with the use of "tunnels," if anybody had ever brought that up I do know that they would be a bit worried if they knew the "Virginia Plan" was being defended by somebody who was born in Kentucky My only defense there would be that Kentucky was once a part of Virginia   Yes, it was then, that's right I wish we could go back in time and I could speak at that time; but while I'm a Kentuckian by birth I'm a Virginian by choice--maybe that will give me a certain amount of credibility--and I also have two children who are native Virginians and I married a native Virginian You kind of absorb some of this as you go along  I think Governor Lindsey has already stated quite well the reasons for adopting the multi-year tunnel approach instead of the annual cones and basing this on the level of M2 at the end of 1990 originally Now, we set the data on 1991, but it comes out to the same thing Let me make three additional comments on this, mostly by way of elaboration First, the upside insurance this would give us at this particular moment is really a compelling reason The [beauty] of this tunnel is that it pretty much guarantees that we would get price stability over the long run--which I think should be the objective of monetary policy to the exclusion of all others--as long as we were willing to reduce the rate of growth in the money supply until we got it down to the rate at which the potential output of the economy could increase [over time] Now, everything we know about monetary history tells us that we can stabilize price levels if we get [money supply growth] down over time to somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 percent or so People differ on what the potential growth of the economy is, but I don't think there's any doubt that it would be greater if we had price stability than if we didn't And this is essentially the message of the P* model, which is one of the finest pieces of work I think we've done in the System I wish I'd had a hand in that, but I certainly applaud the others of you who did  -30-    2/4-5/92  I think a continuous unbroken tunnel would be a much more appropriate and powerful device for controlling the long-run rate of growth in M2 than the current cones because it would eliminate base drift And base drift has really been the bane of our existence Whatever base drift has brought us in the way of short-term flexibility in some years, in practice I think it has made it virtually impossible for us to control the long-run rate of trend growth of M2, with the result that we have [not] known and nobody else has known what the price level would be several years down the road Consequently, I've concluded that no matter how strong our intentions are to reduce inflation--and for the last several years this group has had a stronger inclination in that direction than virtually at any time in the history of the System and I don't think that intention has ever been stronger than it is right now--I don't think we will achieve that goal Despite our feelings on that and our best efforts, I don't think we will ever achieve that goal unless we do something about moving away from our present targeting procedures And I think the tunnel would address this Moreover, and I can't emphasize this point too much I think this move to a tunnel would greatly increase the credibility of the System We have said repeatedly that our intention over time is to bring down the rate of growth in the money supply to noninflationary levels This would spell that out in a great deal more detail and yet it would be clear that we would have the necessary leeway in the short run to do what needs to be done And if this did increase our credibility, it would greatly reduce the transitional cost of moving to price stability  Second--and all of this is relevant to the comments that Don put in the Bluebook under the "tunnel option"--it's certainly true as the Bluebook suggests that we wouldn't want to adopt the tunnel option when the relationships between M2 and income and prices are going to fluctuate in the future All we really have to guide us is past experience and, historically, we know that there have been variations in the short run extending sometimes more than a year but that in the long run there has been stability in that relationship V2, by the best statistical measures that we have, has been constant and predictable over the long run Consequently, this tunnel approach makes a great deal of sense to me But the tunnel needs to be wide enough to accommodate a fair amount of these variations in V2 that we normally have over periods as long as one to several years Maybe a 4-point spread, as Governor Lindsey suggested, would be the proper amount, but it's possible that the width should be greater than that It's important to note in this regard that even a very wide tunnel would still constrain the trend growth of M2 over a long period of time sufficiently to ensure price stability  And finally, the Bluebook may be right in suggesting that a substantial further easing of policy might be needed to get M2 up to the midpoint of Governor Lindsey's tunnel But if we had a tunnel that extended our long-run trend objectives to 1993, I wouldn't feel compelled to move M2 up too rapidly from its present position near the bottom of the tunnel to the midpoint by the end of this year if it were clear that the recovery had resumed In other words, this is not a ploy for ease What I'm trying to do here is to suggest a long-run strategy that would give us the necessary flexibility in the short run So, with regard to the width of the tunnel, it might be that it would be better for us to have a 5-percentage point tunnel if we wanted to make sure right now that we accommodate what is probably a  -31-    2/4-5/92  good projection on the part of the staff, which is that 3-1/2 percent M2 growth in 1992 would be consistent with a resumption of the recovery But, again, even a fairly wide tunnel like that would be concerned with the course and control of M2 over a long period of time And that to me is the beauty of the tunnel approach  So, Mr Chairman, like Governor Lindsey, I hope the Committee will give the "Virginia Plan" favorable consideration I did not admit this to you, Larry, but as you were labeling this "The Virginia Plan" I thought to myself it really sounds more Hamiltonian than Jeffersonian And then I thought with your background from New York you could send a "New York Plan" But in my case, although I spent right much time in New York, the first time I went to New York I crossed on the Staten Island Ferry prior to shipping overseas at the end of World War II and I didn't even see the Statue of Liberty I was the only one who went out without seeing it and that was the main thing I was interested in seeing So, I didn't think I could defend a New York Plan, but I do think this may be a little more Hamiltonian than Jeffersonian And I hope the Committee will honor these distinguished forebears of ours who, other than an occasional glass of whiskey, probably would have liked nothing better than a slow, steady rate of growth in the money supply!   Mr Chairman, could I say something in response to that?   I don't hear anything you say that makes anything but sense, but my policy position now and I guess for the short run is that I'm going to argue that we not change the federal funds rate I don't see any reason for doing that at this point If we're concerned that [adopting the tunnel approach] would look like a tightening, then I think we could widen this tunnel, make it 5 percentage points, which would ensure that we would come within our targets And on your last point, in a sense I think you're saying that it wouldn't be so bad to disregard the cone if the money supply were to go over it; and I certainly would want to do that myself if [that began to happen] But I think that would be a bit more damaging to our credibility than if we had a tunnel [because with a tunnel] we would not be seen as disregarding our targets People think that we don't pay a lot of attention to the targets That's the only reason, really, why I want [a procedure] that we could live with and have the flexibility we need and not [unintelligible] And I think with those two changes we could do it okay   Mr Chairman, could I just say one thing in response to that, because I think Governor Angell has hit upon a very important point? When this was first done, Larry had it at 4-1/2 percent and I suggested that we cut it to 4 percent That was done and he carried the 4 percent rate on out into 1993 I would not want 4 percent in 1993; I would want to bend it down to 3-1/2 percent or something of that sort There's a sentence in the letter that he sent me in which it appeared, if someone read it carelessly, that he might be committing himself to 4 percent forever; I don't think that was his intention So, I suggested that we make it appear that we want to bend it down What surprised you is not the way I had suggested So, I'm really where you thought I would be; it's just that we didn't end up changing that particular thing   I would say if [the reason for such growth] is purely technical, it would be permissible to go outside I have not been as disturbed about the low rate of growth in money we've had recently as I would have been had I not felt that there were explanations for it If we have good reasons for why it's growing unusually fast, I think we should state those to the public and use them as justification for staying outside [the tunnel] but say, that if we get into a more normal pattern of money growth, we will definitely get [money growth] back into the [tunnel]   But no matter what form we select, we're always going to have serious doubts about how much we need to move the federal funds rate   We're never going to know the answer to that!   Well, that's the really difficult issue and the reason I wish we could develop some other control mechanism, but I'll be darned if I know what else we can do Most of M2 is not reservable and, given the market's proclivity for designing new instruments that would avoid any reserve requirements we put on existing instruments-- if indeed we did--unless we paid interest rates on the reserves, which is a political problem That would certainly make it legally controllable   Mr Chairman, the one time I dissented on anything since you've been here was when we established the tentative ranges in July of last year But we missed so badly because of base drift, by virtue of this faulty procedure we use, that I think it would be a mistake to do anything other than alternative I So, to show my graciousness, I would argue that we ought to stick with alternative I   I guess it's a Boston thing!   Mr Chairman, I don't have much to add to this very excellent presentation the staff gave us and the fine coverage in the Greenbook Our projections really are not significantly different We do expect a little more real growth and a little greater slowing in the rate of inflation But the broad profile is pretty much the same, with some pickup in the rate of increase of the recovery in the second quarter--but only to a very moderate rate in comparison with what has happened in past recoveries--and continued deceleration in core inflation, even though we are projecting that the overall CPI will come in a tad higher this year than it did last year Insofar as the risks of error are concerned, I guess a carefully reasoned analysis would say that they are about equal on both sides Certainly, there are some downside risks the heavy overhang of commercial real estate; the corporate restructuring; the balance sheet adjustments that are taking place; the restraint on credit Also, all these temporary dislocations that have taken place as a result of declining rates of inflation could produce another year of lower-than- expected growth  But on the other side of that, I think the substantial further easing in monetary policy we engineered in November-December could easily produce a more rapid recovery than we are expecting here, particularly if a fiscal package is enacted early in the year or relatively early in the year For what it's worth, my instinct is that the upside risk is probably a little greater than the downside risk mainly because of the actions that we took in the fourth quarter We engineered a very significant easing in policy; it has not at this point had a very positive effect upon the economy; the stock market really seems to think [it will] over the next several quarters Moreover, we're seeing a decided change in the comments that we hear from our contacts around the District There is not much hard evidence yet that things really have improved, but the outlook for the next six months or so is decidedly better than it has been over the several times we've made contacts; it's quite a shift away from what we heard [unintelligible] It always seems to me that the pessimism is the greatest right at the bottom of a recession So, since it  -14-    2/4-5/92  looks a little better now than it did a while back, I hope that means that we're beginning to come out of this a little faster than most people seem to think   I hope it doesn't get any worse than it is now It would really be bad It's the worst I've ever seen since the '30s and I don't know very much about that   You can imagine how the rest of us felt!   I agree with you, Mr Chairman I might point out that Friday we will get the unemployment report and if we get a surprise on that on the down side you could, of course, schedule a conference call to decide what to do and where to go from there   Mr Chairman, I think Peter has done an excellent job of outlining the history of this for us and he has made an excellent case for a high degree of liquidity That has been needed in part because we have had to offset reserves supplied through the discount window and also through foreign exchange operations The only point I would make is that a lot of us have reservations about how much we ought to deal in the foreign exchange market The changes in the discount mechanism and the law that was passed last year suggested that we lessen our emergency lending through the discount    3/31/92  window So, I think this gives us a little more opportunity after we've sopped up the reserves released by the reduction in reserve requirements and through the "encouragement at the margin"--I believe that's the term you used, Peter--toward getting longer-term securities If there is some premium on those rates, this could help to reduce that premium to some extent, although I don't really buy that argument to any great degree I think we have a little better case now for intervening than we did before but it's only a marginal case, and I don't feel very strongly about it We also would earn a little more from the Treasury if we did more, but who can tell? Maybe, we'd need more liquidity and a further reduction in the reserve requirements It was a good paper; I thought it was very, very good   Mr Chairman, there has been a marked change in the degree of optimism in our area, which seems to be very similar to what is happening in the rest of the country For example, in our recent regular survey of retailers and manufacturers for the Beigebook, we found more signs of optimism, both nationally and locally, than we had at any time since 1989 Contacts with our directors and others since then have pretty well verified that sort of sentiment And we are seeing in the actual figures some pickup in physical activity For example, new home sales and residential construction are rising pretty much across the District; and sales and production in industries related to housing--like furniture, textiles, and homebuilding products--are also picking up in strength At our last meeting, one of our most astute directors said he sees absolutely nobody who thinks the recession is not over The way he put it, the only question in people's minds is what the strength of the recovery will be  So, against that kind of regional background, and taking account of the latest information that we have gotten on a national basis, I think the staff was justified in making the upward revision in the forecast that it did The overall profile of the Greenbook is quite close to what we would expect The key question is where the risk of error lies And on this we come out a little differently from some of the others who have spoken in that we think the risk of error is on the high side even after these upward revisions in the forecast are taken into account That is because we continue to believe that the easing we put into effect in November and December was pretty strong medicine and that its full potential impacts have not yet shown up and probably are not captured fully in the Greenbook and other forecasts But we have less confidence in that now than we did because of the weakening in the behavior of M2 in March One of our economists did a simulation that suggested the widespread uncertainty about jobs probably was reducing consumption by maybe 2-1/2 percent from what it otherwise would be It's really an interesting study; it's econometric but nevertheless pretty revealing, and it sort of verifies what everybody assumed was happening  I'm happy to see that the staff still expects that the disinflation trend will continue and that inflation can be brought down somewhere below 3 percent by the second half of this year As the Greenbook notes, this projection is pretty much at odds with most of the current market expectations It's also at odds with most of the forecasts that we've seen, which call for an early increase in inflationary pressures as the economy improves But the difference between the staff forecast and these other forecasts now is that we can make ours happen if we play our cards right! And I'm increasingly confident that we will   Mr Chairman, I came prepared to argue for "B" symmetric I wanted to point out that we could move in either direction but that if the economy did strengthen, as I thought it most likely would, then we would look very omniscient to have moved at this particular time when this [directive] is released in late May But after absorbing the new numbers on M2 and listening to your other comments, I come closer to where you are The only difference I have  -34-    3/31/92  is that your disinheriting the P* model bothers me a little because I still have a lot of faith in that   That part I agree with; you made that very clear But there was a statement you made in the beginning against giving too much credit to the P* model  LAWARE He was being modest   I have a lot of faith in it because I don't think we have any evidence yet that there's not a shift in the secular trend of V2 But I would comfortably--   Well, I think it is, too As a matter of fact, if you take M2 at face value and say that we thought we had a reason to explain its weakness, it has pretty darn well predicted what happened even without any adjustments So, maybe it didn't lose some of its meaning I did think that we would be [tightening policy] and it would be nice to show that we anticipated this a little But I have some more doubts as a result of the behavior of the money numbers than I had That being true, I can put that off for another meeting At the next meeting I hope we will be able to move to symmetric language if events go our way between now and then   Mr Chairman, I agree fully I've never had very much sympathy for intervention, but I do remember the days that Jerry has alluded to when we had to draw on the swaps to get money to support the dollar And if we are going to continue [to intervene], which I hope we won't, our holdings could come in useful, as he says But I have never been sympathetic toward intervention and I'm glad we're going in the direction we're going   Mike, in reading the Greenbook, I concluded that you thought the first-quarter GNP, or rather GDP--I haven't made that transition completely--increased at a 3 percent rate Then in reading the briefing papers last night, I thought at first you were going to say 33 percent but then I looked at the chart and it appeared that it might go as high as 4 percent What is your best guess as to what that figure really might be?   That really would be something of a surprise to the private economy if it were that much, wouldn't it?   Mr Chairman, the staff forecast has changed really just a little since the last time We thought it was a good forecast then, and it still seems to be a reasonable forecast to us Certainly, most of the anecdotal and other information that we are getting in the Fifth District and also in the country as a whole is consistent with this relatively moderate rate of recovery that the staff is projecting  On the point regarding commercial real estate transactions, our Vice Chairman is a big real estate operator He does a large volume of business and also is a solvent real estate developer, which makes him an unusual breed He has been reporting for about two months now that commercial real estate is beginning to move Nothing new is being built, but it is beginning to move; the prices had  -12-    5/19/92  dropped to the point that they looked attractive He also always adds "and there's plenty of financing out there for it" This was not true a while back, but that's the way he has seen it for some two months And I think that's a pretty [reliable] reading because his firm operates in a lot of cities throughout the country  It's certainly true that both manufacturing activity and retail sales did appear to have decelerated a bit since we had the gains earlier in the year Nevertheless, most of our contacts believe that the recovery is here to stay this time That view was universal at our last board meeting, for example And for the most part they expect their own businesses and industries to grow at a solid, if something less than spectacular, rate over the months ahead These contacts cite a wide variety of leading indicators; they all seem to have their favorites, and those range from increasing trucking activity to reduced loan delinquencies to rising telephone hookups, and on and on  Even though I think the staff forecast is reasonable, it's certainly true that reasonable forecasts don't always come true So we have to ask, as we always should, where the risk lies And I think the risk of errors may be on the down side I'm bothered by this sharp deceleration in the rate of growth in M2, although I think your explanation comes very close to explaining why it has misbehaved, and I'm very sympathetic to that The apparent continued sluggishness in May is obviously a further risk on the down side, and it's a risk I worry about a great deal Still, I believe we can be fairly certain that the weakness that we had results from these special factors such as the lower non-withheld personal income tax payments and the movement into other kinds of assets, this substitution for M2-type balances My 85 year old mother-in-law, for example, is now out in the longer end of the market and that is something I never thought would take place! And I think we'll be better able to gauge--   Well, if we get the lower interest rates that the staff has projected she might take capital gains on that! Anyway, I think to be better able to read the significance of M2 we have to get a little further past April and the tax date  Now, on the other side, I think it's worth noting that the main differences between the staff forecast and most other forecasts is that the staff expects inflation to decline further this year and then hold steady next year Many of the other forecasters think inflation is going to bottom out this year and is going to be higher in the next few years The staff is also projecting, as I just mentioned, lower long-term interest rates over the period ahead and it seems as if most other forecasters expect interest rates to continue on an uptrend I see the Greenbook projection as more desirable, and it is certainly plausible But I believe the chances of achieving this are going to depend pretty highly on whether or not we make the right policy calls in the critical months ahead In particular, I think we have to convince the markets and the public that we are still determined to reduce inflation further even as we try to foster this budding recovery we apparently have under way The credibility of our long-term strategy is at a very crucial point right now and it's really on the line So, I think we need to do all we can to reinforce  -13-    5/19/92  this commitment that I think all of us in this room share to working inflation down over the longer run   Tell them to go long!   "B" symmetric, Mr Chairman, with your clarification about your reluctance to move in either direction unless we had some confirmation in the real economy as well as the aggregates I think you're dead right on that and I was going to throw that [comment] out had you not done it ahead of me Another thing we need to address is this alternative sentence proposed for the directive That sentence indicates we are expecting at least a moderate resumption of expansion in the aggregates, and I'd like to see that in there rather than the old sentence that we had   Bob Parry's question raised something that has been on my mind for some time I think there are two ways to look at these intermediate targets, or the long-term targets as we call them now One is that they are in fact medium-term targets The other extreme is to set these where we think the aggregates are going to be and not really think of them as targets I think what Don has said is that the reason he has suggested lower [growth rates] is that he thinks they are reasonable targets because of the downward shift in the demand for money that we've seen, which makes [lower growth] perfectly justifiable But I think it's a trap we can easily get  -35-    6/30-7/1/92  into setting these where we think they're going to be rather than where we think they ought to be I'm very much in favor of choosing targets and making the aggregates behave the way we think they ought to rather than just putting these out I think the staff has done a very fine job in a very difficult environment in setting forth the numbers that we have here And I think Don would agree with what I'm saying   Mr Chairman, I'm with you about 95 percent of the way, which is a lower percentage than it usually is   But in the absence of some multi-year policy strategy such as the "tunnel" strategy that Governor Lindsey and I so bravely proposed back in December, which we all did not have the wisdom to accept, I think we have to look upon these one-year targets that we set now as sort of a mid-term benchmark We don't know what  -39-    6/30-7/1/92  the heck is going to happen, as you correctly said, so I think it's very wise to stick to the 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent [M2 target] for this year The main reason I would suggest that is not that I think we're likely to be anywhere near the 6 percent, but that there is a possibility we might be there And to have to change [the target] later on by raising it because we chose a range that was too low would reverse what we've been doing over a long period of time There's a beautiful story in Appendix A of the Bluebook showing how, since about 1980, we've been lowering these targets steadily over time, and I think that conveys an important message But if we were to choose the lower range and then for some reason or other M2 or the other aggregates were to strengthen and we had to raise the range, I think that would muddle the thinking of the whole financial market and it would be very bad But by the same token, as we choose our target this time I think we ought to send an unambiguous message to the markets that we have not lost sight of our long-term objective of good economic growth with stable prices And I would favor very strongly adopting for 1993 a range of, say, 2 to 6 percent [or] one of the recommended ranges--say, 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent Governor Angell and I discussed that last night A 2 to 6 percent range would be my preference because of the uncertainty, but 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent wouldn't bother me either unless we got to the point that it really wasn't enough and we had to raise that So, I would really prefer the 2 to 6 percent because I think that gives us enough room on the downside to convince the market of what we really want to do and at the same time enough to provide adequate financing for whatever economic growth we can get   It was higher than that!   Just to reinforce that I was about 95 percent with you, I think your suggestion that you explain this in your Humphrey-Hawkins testimonies is absolutely vital  -40-    6/30-7/1/92   I strongly endorse that; I just forgot [to mention] it But I'm 60/40 if--   Well, like Governor Lindsey, I think there's a limit to how far these things can go, but I don't know what it is I think a lot of [the adjustment] probably is behind us because I don't know anybody who has thought about it at all who has not shifted money out of M2 I cited my mother-in-law who is 85 and has gone long-term And the Chairman asked me if she was holding these for income I said probably but she wasn't averse to taking a few capital gains if they came There has to be an end to this, but I don't know when it will be I think Don's group has done a very, very good job in addressing all the issues; it's one of the finest things they've done, yet I'm sure they feel somewhat dissatisfied with it because it's so complex If this target-setting gets any more complicated than it is today, it is going to mitigate to some extent the disappointment I have in not being able to participate in the next target-setting session I don't think I could find one any more challenging than what we have today   Mr Chairman, I don't see a lot of difference in the approaches the two of you are suggesting except that I think Jerry would favor reducing the range next year because of the signal effect Otherwise it seems to me you have said essentially the same things, as I've understood you That's the point I was trying to make   I would much prefer that if we had the option But if we should take a step toward [ease] either through adoption of a directive that is asymmetrical toward ease or through dropping the federal funds rate, I think we badly need something out there for the future that says we have not abandoned our long-term quest for price stability And that's why I--   I was sure you would feel that way I just feel that some tangible movement in cutting the aggregate ranges would be necessary and make that as believable as I would like it to be   That's my problem   You said you didn't want to put your foot down firmly, Mr Chairman; I think 2 to 6 percent would not be putting your foot down firmly like 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent would be   I understand You're in a very defensible position; you're a very persuasive person; you have higher credibility than anybody in the country But if we don't lower that range, I think people are not going to believe everything you say That is what I'm afraid of   The big economic news in the Fifth District, as I suspect many of you know, is that it may soon be possible to buy a BMW that has a honk with a southern accent! BMW people have just announced that they are going to build a huge new factory in northwest South Carolina that will create jobs for about 4,000 people I wish that had been announced before our last directors' meeting when you had an exchange with our protectionist-minded Mr Chairman, who has been mourning the loss of those high paying jobs and their replacement by this sort of thing But there is an unfortunate side of this in that South Carolina paid about $150 million in subsidies in order to get that factory So, this is not a purely economic decision but it does augur well for that particular part of the country at the expense of some other part Now, beyond that, not much really has changed in the region Gradual recovery seems to be continuing and business people are generally optimistic about the near-term outlook pretty much across the spectrum of sectors and industries The tone of the anecdotal information, though, at our last joint meeting of our three boards was a little less positive than it had been at the meetings immediately before that Against this background, we think the optimism about the future could fade pretty fast unless actual business activity does accelerate at least a little in the fairly near-term future  At the national level, our projections are very close to those of the staff We expect slightly more real growth and slightly less inflation, but the differences are not really significant The question of where the risk lies seems to me to depend largely on how much weight one wants to give to the persistent weakness in M2 as an indicator of what lies ahead We're still inclined to discount most of the recent weakness that we've seen because we feel most of it comes from the portfolio adjustments that are reflecting the structural changes in banking and financial markets with which all of us are very familiar But the longer this weakness persists, the more uneasy it makes us Our uneasiness was heightened by the excellent analysis in the second part of the Feinman/Porter memorandum which suggested that M2 is by no means dead So, on balance, we think the risk of error is now moderately on the down side rather than the other way around, given this renewed contraction in M2 that apparently has been taking place in June  Despite whatever questions there may be regarding the real side of the projections, we are very comfortable with the staff's projection that inflation will come down This is also our projection and in fact we expect somewhat more decline than the staff does both this year and next And we think there's a good possibility that a  -15-    6/30-7/1/92  growing acceptance of this belief on the part of the public would work to bolster real economic activity   Tom, when you said you were an outlier on inflation did you mean on the low side?   You have an awfully big sample in relation to your universe! Let's look at it that way   Uneducated?   Was the private nonresidential unchanged?   Mr Chairman having been in the uncomfortable position of supporting you [earlier] only 95 percent in my estimation,  -67-    6/30-7/1/92  I would like to express 100 percent agreement with this approach I would add only thing I think we ought to include the bracketed sentence on page 23 of the Bluebook which stresses the uncertainty   So, it's 100 percent agreement, not 98!   I'm not sure I'd say the same thing if I were speaking again I supported the Chairman but then on further reflection I thought that if we had lowered the targets for next year I would support him more enthusiastically, if I may put it that way   We can say "slightly" or "somewhat"   I think we could take that last sentence and attach it to the one before and say "in light of the recent unusual behavior of these aggregates"   Mr Chairman, a while ago you said that statutorily the Treasury has the primary responsibility [for foreign exchange policy] I believe it would be safe to say, wouldn't it, that it also has that primary responsibility under the Constitution, just as Congress has the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof, which gives us primacy in the monetary policy area   That's what I was speaking of   Including the 5 percent interest on them, I suppose?    8/18/92   Well, they ought to have some value on accrued interest I would assume   That would seem a right unwelcomed message to send out   Mr Chairman, a while ago Si Keehn's analogy of an airplane reminded me of another mechanical analogy that I think is very pertinent here In the days when we first began to install antipollution equipment on automobiles I used to get terribly frustrated trying to get the car started and running very smoothly I've been experiencing the same sort of feeling about the economy with its fits and starts and near stalls But eventually we usually did get the car to run pretty smoothly, and I'm satisfied that sooner or later we're going to have the economy moving up at a smoother pace But I do think the downward revision that the staff has made in the forecast over the remainder of 1992 is clearly appropriate in view of the lackluster growth we've had in the economy since the end of the first quarter My guess is that the risks of errors are about evenly divided between the up side and the down side On the down side, for example, many of the factors that have been plaguing us in the recovery in recent months--such as the negative impact of this corporate restructuring, which I think augurs well for the long run but is terribly painful in the short run--are still around But it does mean increasing efficiency in the long run And I think the rise in productivity probably means a higher long-term growth potential than the 2 percent the staff is estimating We also have the slowing in defense expenditures; we have situations abroad where the economies are not really growing very fast; we have the oversupply of office space and other commercial real estate And maybe even more important in the minds of the consumer, there are a lot of non-economic worries such as crime and drugs and the breakdown of family values that I think have been making people less inclined to part with their dollars than they otherwise would be I believe this sort of thing is going to be with us for quite a while and is going to exert a drag on economic activity in the period ahead, and the weight of the drag  -22-    8/18/92  could even increase Of course, in addition to that we have the weakness in M2 We've explained a lot of that, I think, but I still have a nagging worry that there's some weakness there that we're really not explaining away by these special factors  But then one can look at the up side of this and say that there are at least some signs now that this might turn into a typical recovery--albeit a much less rapid recovery than we've usually had-- because of the decline in interest rates, which eventually I think is going to stimulate housing My expectations got a little setback with the data released this morning Certainly, sales of durable goods at the consumer level and also of producers durable equipment are going to be one of the stronger parts in the recovery when it comes And that, of course, will stimulate jobs and economic growth But having said that, I think it is important for us to recognize that there's a big downside risk and it's very serious I'm getting at the same sort of thing that Dick Syron was talking about a while ago  If these reduced Greenbook expectations turn out to be true, this could be pretty serious in terms of jeopardizing our strategy for getting to our long-term objectives We need to give that some consideration in our setting of short-term policy goals today Now, in the case of the long-term objective, I think the staff's estimate of the inflationary outlook is [about right]; we will certainly be moving closer to our goal by the end of 1994 That's obviously very encouraging to someone who thinks that the prime goal of monetary policy ought to be price stability But in the context of the staff's outlook, it seems to me that this further progress is dependent upon continued sluggishness of any projected recovery even as far out as the second half of 1994 Maybe this continued softness is necessary in order to get inflation down further But my own guess is that we can get the same kind of inflation results with stronger real growth in late 1993 and in 1994 if we maintain a visible commitment to our long-term objective of price stability, despite the current weakness in the economy And I think we ought not miss any chances to say that that is our ultimate long-term goal even though we recognize that we have some short-term problems on the side of weakness in the economy right now   Mr Chairman, ordinarily I'm biased very much in favor of symmetric language but I think your reasoning on why we shouldn't switch from one to the other and then back again is compelling So, I would say "B" asymmetric   I just want to commend those of you who had a part in the decision for having tried to urge the Treasury not to do this intervention I think you proved your point very well   The latest national reports--especially that of the National Association of Purchasing Managers, the employment figures, and the downturn in consumer expectations--have been very disheartening to say the least In light of those reports, I think the staff was correct in lowering its projection; what they've done seems pretty reasonable to me But I don't think anybody really understands why we are getting this persistent weakness in the economy In such a case it looks to me as if the risks of error on any kind of forecast are very high indeed I would be more hesitant to guess which way the risks of error might lie in this particular period of time  I do take a small measure of comfort in the most recent information we have gotten from around our District The economic picture may not be as bleak as suggested by the national data; some of the District information is [more current] For example, reports of our directors at the September meeting certainly did nothing to suggest that there would be any further decline in business activity in their view in our District The same is true of the reports that we got in our regular survey of manufacturers and retailers In fact, that survey actually suggested a slight improvement in a number of areas such as retail sales, manufacturing, business sentiment, and residential real estate And I think the recent growth in bank credit and money also presents at least a ray of hope about the future Indications that loans are now more available, as reported in the Greenbook, are pretty well consistent with what we are hearing in our District through anecdotal information While the 3 percent rate of growth in M2 in August and September is lower than I would like to see at this point, it's a big improvement over the negative rates of growth that we had for the previous five months I hope this could be the beginning of some sustained period of higher growth  Insofar as the inflation forecast is concerned, as you know, the Greenbook is showing a decline in the CPI down to a rate of about 2 percent by the end of 1994 That seems reasonable to me, given the sharp deceleration in money growth that we've had over the last several years If we were to achieve this low inflation rate, however, then I think we have to be prepared if necessary to let the federal funds rate rise rather quickly when economic activity and the rate of growth of money do speed up, although I hope what Governor Angell described is really what will happen in that case I'll return to this point later when we get to the policy discussion   Mr Chairman, I think the policy decision that we face this morning is, as Don said, essentially a matter of weighing the risk of a renewed deterioration in the economy against the risk that a further easing at this juncture will damage our credibility and might not do any good in any event My real preference, reading the tea leaves the way I do, is to do something now--move a quarter point --but I can accept your formulation of "B" with an asymmetric directive But I want to underscore what Jerry Jordan said This decision would be a lot easier if we had cut those targets back in July Governor Angell and I felt strongly enough about advocating a cut in the [1992] targets [in July 1991] that we actually dissented on [the vote to retain them] But if we do cut them regularly, I think we establish the credibility whereby we can make these short-term lowering [moves] without scaring the market half to death because we would reassure them that we have not lost sight of our long-term targets   But not on the merits of the case!   Thank you very much, Mr Chairman I'll be perfectly willing to send you a letter if I think you're going astray, and I hope you will heed that letter!   I don't have a fax machine but I'm thinking about getting one   What you really want to ask is how we were able to exclude this before we found out it was a sin!   Mr Chairman, I agree with Bob Forrestal I think that Mr Gonzalez's purpose really is to politicize the Federal Reserve, and he hopes to do that by exposing our deliberations So, I think he's not really asking for [earlier release of] our actions He knows those fairly soon, although one could argue that we could make them available a little sooner What he wants to know is the deliberations I was around here when we gave up the memoranda of  -62-    11/17/92  discussion; I hated to see it [discontinued], although I understood the reason why the Committee did it I chatted with Chairman Burns about it at the time and he said he too hated to see them go because they do have valuable information for scholars--admittedly only a few [of them are interested]--but the memoranda do have some valid information for those inside and outside the System I think we would be wise to resume preparing them I doubt that would inhibit our discussions and deliberations at all if they were released, say, three years or even two years later And we would be responding to a point you made which I think is very real That maybe we do have a responsibility for making available to the public something more than we are now doing And I don't think that would inhibit our discussions For example, would you mind tomorrow if someone told people what you had said two years ago at an FOMC meeting? My view is "no"   Well, you mean they would get out sooner than the lag we would set?  SPEAKER(?) Yes   Well, it takes a while to write them! It's one heck of a job Norm will tell you that And I may have lost a friend!   Mr Chairman, we come out very close to the staff projections on the real side of the economy, and they in turn are generally in line with what most private forecasters are saying in that they call for a gradual recovery Our guess is that the risk has now shifted to the [up side] For the first time I think we see some signs that the economy may really be beginning to move a bit For example, a substantial portion of the latest data, both nonfinancial as well as financial, has been at least somewhat stronger than expected Prospects for consumer spending in particular look much better than I thought they would look; they strike us as really rather bright when coupled with the apparent upswing in consumer confidence    11/17/92  as reported in the Michigan Survey for early November And the apparent acceleration in commercial lending at banks is another favorable financial sign Also, the anecdotal information that we've been picking up around our District has been considerably more upbeat lately than it had been for a couple of months Our directors' comments in particular have been better for two successive months than they were before that And their comments for the last couple of years have been pretty darn good leading indicators Somehow or other this group we have now has been better able to call the movements in the economy than almost any group of directors we've had in the past And this is what they're telling us Now, we're all aware, of course, that these developments can prove to be pretty transitory We have had a lot of fits and starts in this frustrating recovery period that we've been through Nevertheless, I believe [the improvement] may be real this time  Let me make just one final comment about the inflation projections that the staff has made Over the last several years, I've often been accused of being much too optimistic about inflation A lot of that stems from my deep faith in the wisdom of this Committee to do what needs to be done I think our policy has been excellent for many years now Now I think we're seeing some evidence that my optimism about inflation is beginning to be realized We've made tremendous progress If you look at the staff projection of 2 percent inflation in the CPI for '94, for example, I think we've gotten very close to what really amounts to zero inflation, taking into account the errors of measurement in that measure And I express one parting hope That the Committee will continue to behave as it has in the past If you do, my fellow pensioners and I will forever be grateful to you for your fine work!   Mr Chairman, I have a strong preference for lowering the ranges by a full percentage point, although I don't think your suggestion of 2 to 6 percent would be all that bad I don't think this is a purely technical issue, though I think this [affects] our credibility Governor Angell and I argued unsuccessfully for such a move back in 1991 In 1992 I did not argue for it because I thought we were clearly in a recession and it would look bad at that point But I do think we would have done better if we had moved it back at that time Now, the technical case is very strong Don and his colleagues, Messrs Feinman and Porter, have done a great job in showing that 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent is technically a very good place for the range to be But that gives us just a little bit of margin We would be just above the 1-1/2 percent lower limit if they're right in their assumption that 2 percent growth in M2 is what we would get and that velocity would behave as they suspect But the 5-1/2 percent on the up side gives us a lot of room for movement in case the economy turns out to be stronger than they have assumed, and I believe that is one of the more likely outcomes As far as the timing is concerned, it would look unnecessarily provocative if we did this now unless we were also to ease our short-term [policy] just a little and couple the two actions I would prefer to wait until February to do it I think we would experience less political flak if we did that  So, I feel pretty strongly that we ought to go with "B," and I would like to see the directive made symmetric If we do decide, though, to change the federal funds rate today and lower it a little, then I think we ought to go ahead and couple that with a lowered long- term range I'm not as skeptical as Bill McDonough is about how the markets would accept this I think there are a lot of people out there who would find that somewhat acceptable But if we lower the federal funds rate, I think we definitely should lower that longer-run range or else we'll be perceived as having thrown in the towel on inflation I guess I end up about where Governor LaWare and Governor Angell did on that   Mr Chairman, I know you prefer to explain it as a technical move, but do you think it's purely technical?   I don't   Well, the technical argument is very strong, but I think there are some people who still entertain doubts about how serious we are about achieving price stability, and I think they will  -45-    11/17/92  take this as a concrete sign that we may be more serious than they thought before   More than we've ever had; I wouldn't argue that   I agree that that's exactly the position of everybody in this room, but I'm not sure that the public is completely convinced at this point But I don't want to let this--   That's right And since that yield sits up there where it does, I think that is some evidence   That's right   I don't think it reflects entirely, but some part of it--   You think you have an ally and so does Governor Angell!
