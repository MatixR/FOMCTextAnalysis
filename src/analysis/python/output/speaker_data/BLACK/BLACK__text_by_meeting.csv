2,1976-03-29,BLACK,  You also have more constraint on your federal funds than you would have  under this scheme  
24,1976-04-20,BLACK,"  Yes, really a simple one  Alan, do you think the efforts of the Japanese to  promote the use of the yen as a reserve currency are going to have any significant long-run  impact on the demand for dollars?    I gather you do not expect to use the yen as an intervention currency,  necessarily, if they did move toward it as a reserve currency    I suggest that he ought to stay at least until we had that  He said [we had]  made such progress that he felt free to leave    Lyle, the thing that intrigues me more than anything else about this is that  all this inventory building seems to have been financed primarily from internal sources  This, of  course, gets into Steve’s area as to what this may mean for credit demands later on and for the  money supply ultimately, too, if inventories are built up     And as I start kicking those figures around, I wonder if the loan demand is going to be  anything like as strong and if there is going to be anything like as much upward pressure on  interest rates in the business sector  Look at the internal flows of cash in businesses--the  financing gap they’ve got looks pretty small, the commercial paper rate of 7-1/2 percent looks  like a pretty sharp jump, yet they’re able to do all this without external financing    I would agree with the line of your reasoning  It’s just a question of  degree  And I guess I was just probably premature in asking that at that point  The gap is so  small in relation to what I think the needs will be that I would not think there would be that much  upward pressure for some unknown reason     Have we ever had this much inventory building, Lyle, from internal sources?  I cannot  remember any time when you’ve had this much swing without some pickup in business loan  demand    Peter, you mentioned in your discussion of what would have happened  under a nonborrowed target that we did run into a problem with overly narrow constraints on the  federal funds rate movements, which we might have expected  Did you see any other  mechanical difficulties that you thought the Desk would encounter if we were in fact operating  on such a target?    Mr Chairman, I think the ranges you’ve suggested are the best possible  ones, and I’d just like to point out one little point that I don’t think has been developed  We  lowered the upper limits to show our concern for inflation, and I share Governor Partee’s feeling  that the economy is much stronger than has been projected by the staff  I think you can make a  case for lowering the lower limits, but in the face of [current levels of] unemployment, I think it  would be unwise to do that now  I think we want to continue to show the markets we’ve got a  concern for unemployment, so I’d leave those rates there  But secretly I would hope that we  move down toward the lower end of it in our long-run targets    I think he’s got a short-run attitude, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, I come out--    I’m still so puzzled over what is meant there that--     I almost have forgotten what I wanted to say    I haven’t had enough mathematics to comment in this group  I think I  come out really closer to Governor Partee than anyone else there  There are several reasons you  might point out for not making any overt move right now  One would be, of course, the  sensitivity of markets, as you pointed out  Another would be that, for the recovery to proceed  quite satisfactorily, it still has got a long way to go  Still another would be that this could create  some problems for our foreign trading partners  These are reasons that we’re going to have  when the time does come to move, I think, regardless of when that might be      4/20/76 - 43 -           The reason that I would prefer not to do it now is basically because I think that a lot of the  strength in the aggregates that we have seen just recently does not stem from any strength in loan  demand  That’s still very weak at the banks, and I think a lot of it comes from tax refunds and  the other seasonal factors that Steve was mentioning  So I would hold off for the time being and  go with alternative B with the expectation, probably, that by next time the move that most people  seem to favor would be appropriate  But I’d like to learn a little bit more about those aggregates   They’ve never expanded very fast unless we’ve had strong credit demand, and we simply don’t  have that yet, so we may be seeing bogeys that really don’t exist at the present time     I would frame the directive in terms of the aggregates, and while I wouldn’t want the  federal funds average to move up by more, say, than 1/8 or a 1/4 or something of that sort, I  would like to see a little more variability introduced  And Alan has made the point many times  that when you [unintelligible] the rates, they really don’t give you any signal at all because banks  assume they’ll be able to adjust their reserve positions at a constant federal funds rate, and so we  lose the advantage of federal funds as a signal  So I’d like to see a little variability there without  the overall average moving up    "
52,1976-05-18,BLACK,"  Point of clarification, question to Art and Tom  Isn’t it true that, if we get  the Government in the Sunshine Act, we will have to publish the fact that we had a meeting, and  secondly the general nature of that meeting?    Mr Chairman, I had two observations on this matter of capacity utilization  which we kind of left behind, but one is in regard to the suggestion you made that we collect  what information we can on this  I would caution that we ought to also take into consideration  the existence of excess capacity abroad and our ability to import  I [raise] this since there seems  to be more excess capacity abroad than there is here  And the second observation is that there  are contained in the Redbook, this time, three references I remember to industries that may be  approaching capacity  steel, paper products, and some chemicals      Yeah, I think that’s true there, too  And this may have implications for  imports and inventories and plant and equipment expenditures that we may not have taken into  consideration adequately yet    I was on the call, Mr Chairman  I would like to commend the Desk on the  way it handled itself  I think they really did an admirable job during this period and would echo  Alan’s observations that this wasn’t even-keel by any stretch of the imagination    Steve, we have touched on this several times in the past, but do you have  any better idea now than we have had [as to why] the monetary base has been growing so fast  relative to other reserve measures?    Let me rephrase--why has currency been growing?  I know what you said,  but why has that been happening?  Do we have any better fix on that?    It’s been going on longer than two or three months, if I’m not mistaken    Mr Chairman, I have sometimes shared the doubts that Governor Coldwell  expressed about the [estimates for the] aggregates, but I must admit, those doubts are becoming  weaker as time passes, and I’m now prepared to believe that there is a substantial amount of the  bulge that is real demand for money  Accordingly I think we ought to move against it in more or  less the manner you described  I would agree with your specified range of 5 to 5-3/4 on the  federal funds rate, and the ranges you suggested for the aggregates strike me as reasonable,  although I could shift a little either way depending upon what the group wants to do      5/18/76 - 48 -        "
78,1976-06-22,BLACK,"  Lyle, I think I come out about where the staff did on business spending on  plant and equipment, but I can’t find too many businessmen who feel that ebullient about it   They seem to be worrying about EPA and OSHA, and you might think that would add to their  spending, but they seem to be having a reverse reaction  Of course, they’re worried about the  effects of inflation and the absence of a firm national energy policy and all sorts of things like  this In the oil industry, for example, one of our directors is a high official and says that the move  to break up the oil companies is practically paralyzing the capital outlays by oil companies  And  since fears of this type tend to be exaggerated in an election year, I’m wondering if we are giving  enough weight to some of these feelings     Well, I come out exactly there, too  The Redbook sort of reinforced what I  was hearing in our own area on that, and I just want to know how much we ought to weight it    Mr Chairman, Governor Coldwell raised pretty much the sort of question I  had in mind about cash flow and the continued restructuring of debts  I guess I come out with  the belief that short-term rates will go up, but probably not as much as you think, from all that he  indicated, and I was just going to try to elicit the sort of comments you gave him    Mr Chairman, today seems to be a day where an unusually large number of  hybrid policy prescriptions are emerging  I guess mine is of the same variety  I would go for a  full 5 to 6 percent range on fed funds  I feel the economy is probably going to be somewhat  stronger than the staff has projected  The international economy is heating up, and the Puerto  Rico [G-7 summit] meeting may lead to some further tightening of foreign monetary and fiscal  policy, and so I want that full maneuverability     At the same time, I really don’t believe that the aggregates are going to show quite the  growth that the staff thinks, and I would be a little happier with 3 to 7 percent on M1 and 5 to 9  on M2  And having said this, I would then do about what you recommended originally and keep  the fed funds rate around 5-1/2, unless one or the other of the aggregates starts breaking out on  the top side  This might suggest that I would favor a money market directive, but my prejudices  lie in the other direction, and I would still stick with an aggregates directive  "
103,1976-07-19,BLACK,"  When you report back, wouldn’t it look about, as you said, we had  reconsidered it?    It’s a question of degree    If words will be just as effective, well, that’s one thing  I would think a  little more discussion might sound not too [unintelligible]    If Mr Chairman, they offered some--    Mr Chairman, just a matter of parliamentary procedure, shouldn’t we vote  not to rescind our earlier action, rather than vote to reconsider?    Tom, does that case that was brought in Billings, Montana, years ago along  these lines--    Didn’t that make essentially the same claim?    Has this reduction--44 percent growth in real GNP in the second quarter  from the assumed 5 percent rate--changed your feeling about the rest of the year?  I know you     7/19-20/76 - 26 -   haven’t probably had a chance to run all of your simulations  I gather from what you said this  probably wouldn’t change  I--    And my second question  You’ve assumed less upward pressure on interest  rates than you were assuming in June, presumably because of a high assumed level of money  supply  And yet looking at growth in domestic investment, and specifically fixed investment,  you have revised this downward from what you were projecting in June  I was a bit puzzled as  to why, because we now have a few more indications of strength in business spending on capital  than we had this time last year    But it is large I was just puzzled by the direction of it because the  Greenbook summary seemed to [emphasize] an improved outlook; on page I-2, that last  paragraph--that looks more favorable than anything we’ve seen other than that    What I’m talking about really is the downward revision of your figures  over the next four quarters    It is not particularly large, Mr Chairman    It’s a $43 billion reduction, Mr Chairman, in the second quarter of next  year, from what they were projecting in the last Greenbook  And a good part of this is in  business fixed investment, which is revised downward from 193 to 1895  I was just curious as  to what your thinking might be on that  It now looks a little more solid to me than it did at that  time  Maybe I’m reading too much significance into small changes  I guess it’s the direction  rather than the magnitude, because certainly, if we left it in, the range of error--    Mr Chairman, I [unintelligible] really, this is over the next four quarters  [unintelligible]  [For] that period, the projections made in June were above those made in July in  the Greenbook  I was really looking at the long runs  I’m sorry I confused the issue by not  specifying the--      I agree, it was mainly a matter of why the change in direction  I realize  that’s well within the range of long [unintelligible]  This puzzled me a bit, and I thought maybe I  might see something I was overlooking    Mr Chairman, I end up exactly where you do on M1, and I carefully  compared these “moving megaphones” and found that there is sufficient overlap, so that if I  move my own thoughts down to a lower rate of growth, they could be accommodated by the  existing specifications     I do get bothered by these changing bases, and I think what John Balles said has a good  deal of merit to it  I personally prefer the sort of approach that Bill [Hooves] suggested in the  memorandum that Frank Morris provided us, where we [would] express the growth from a  midpoint  I think that would be less misleading to the public  That’s something we want to get  into in that longer session     So far as M2 and M3 are concerned, I value your suggestion because I think it is desirable  if we work these down over time  I am a little skeptical about interest rates rising as much as the  staff projects  However, I think it’s at least possible that we might overshoot those, but I would  still accept what you’ve got there  In their assumptions, the staff has provided for an increase in  Regulation Q [rate ceilings], and if the rates do rise as much as they think, and Regulation Q  [ceilings are] raised, this increases the chance that you’d get more growth in M2 and M3  I’m a  little skeptical there, but I think the proper thing to do is to lower them even so    Mr Chairman, as I indicated earlier, I subscribe to what you say, but there  have been columnists that have accused us of that in situations like this  Some of the more  sophisticated ones will say, for example, that we have really eased up more because we are  starting from a higher base now  For this reason, I prefer the sort of thing they’ll approve as  suggested, which is hard to explain    Peter, there were three things that struck me this morning in the news that  might have significant effects upon the market’s expectation regarding interest rates  And I  wonder if you could comment on that--one is a sharp drop in gold prices; [second] another sharp  plunge in futures prices in a number of commodities; and then the third thing would be the  release of GNP figures somewhat lower than I think the market was probably expecting  Will  this have much impact, do you think?    Mr Chairman, I pointed out a couple of years ago that there seems to be  something of a seasonal aberration in the figures in the third quarter, when we typically get a  decline in the rate of growth of M1, M2, and M3  We may not get it this year, but I would be  surprised if we get quite the strength in the aggregates that some people think we may get, and I  would like a little more leeway to move [the federal funds rate] down if, in fact, the aggregates  do come in weaker  "
133,1976-08-17,BLACK,"  Alan, do you think that, through realignment of currencies, [the European  Community] will be able to preserve the [exchange rate] snake for any appreciable period of  time?    Which do you think would be more likely?    I realize that  What would your assessment of it be, Scott?    You plan to notify Governor Holland immediately when we release the  information?    It’s his problem now    Mr Chairman, I don’t know whether I’ve got a quarrel or not  I think what  I’m really seeking is some elucidation of this large growth in the labor force last month  Does  this look like a one-shot fluke, or are there fundamental forces at work there that are encouraging  greater labor force participation?    I’m inclined to agree with you, Mr Chairman  I guess the reason that I  raised the question is the unemployment rate looks kind of high for me for the projection period,  and I am just wondering what they assume in the way of discouraged or encouraged worker  effects or the rates of participation in the labor force for the balance of the year    Well, not in exactly the terms I was hoping, really  I can think of a couple  of reasons why you might have a high participation rate  One would be that inflation has made  the earnings of one breadwinner inadequate in many families, and two people have been driven  into the labor force    No  I didn’t--I’m sorry if I misled you on that--I was trying to get at your  projections for the balance of the year  Another thing that I can think of is the changing attitude  of women toward permanent work  I think that is considerable    Do you assume a continuation of this for the balance of the year?      The participation rate continues to rise, right?  Well, this is the kind of  thing I was trying to get at in trying to come to grips with those projections    Mr Chairman, I think the recommendations emanating from the rested  mind of Governor Gardner and from your allegedly tired mind are very good, and I come out  exactly where you all do on that  I would just like to throw out one word of caution  I’m  becoming increasingly concerned about this divergence in the rate of growth in M1 and M2  M2  is moving up pretty fast, and I think we ought to keep a close eye on that one because I think it’s  becoming increasingly important  We’ve said we would give equal weight to it [and to M1], but  I think in practice that I, along with some of the rest of you, have weighed M1 more heavily than  perhaps we should  But this is a caution for the future, and not applicable for the moment  "
156,1976-09-21,BLACK,"  Mr Zeisel, looking at these two green tables, the first one in the  Greenbook, I’m struck by the capacity utilization projections you have made [and] the pretty  rapid increase in industrial production related to the relatively slow growth in manufacturing  employment  I was wondering if you’ve made any explicit projections in the way of behavior of  unit labor costs    By the end of ’77?    Mr Chairman, I share your assessment on the outlook in capital  expenditures, but more observation might be helpful  In talking to our directors, we have a great  deal of trouble convincing them that this is coming because they don’t see it in place  And I  think the basic difference is they don’t see the plants yet, and the thing we’re looking at are the  leading indicators, which suggest they will be forthcoming  So any survey of businessmen as to  what they see, I think, will reflect what our directors see rather than the point you expressed  We  can’t seem to get that difference across to our directors    We have the same problem on the matter of wage settlements  We  discovered that our directors really think of increases in productivity as implying that the average  worker is working harder, and they don’t see this, and they don’t realize that you can [get] gains  in productivity from a larger input in capital goods  So your survey, as you suggested, is likely  to suggest more inflation  In fact, we really--    Mr Chairman, I find myself in somewhat of a dilemma on the policy  question today  I come out almost precisely where you do  The healthy economic trend seems  to be in prospect, and I think we made definite headway [unintelligible] with the twin problems  of inflation and inflationary expectations  At the same time, after a year and a half of recovery,  we’ve got substantial unused resources, [with] the unemployment rate moving in the wrong  direction for three successive months  This being the case, I certainly welcome the recent action  on the prime rate, and I would like to see mortgage rates come down more than they have     But at the same time I am quite concerned over this rapid expansion in the savings deposits  at banks and other financial institutions  I believe M2 has been growing much too rapidly lately,  and I certainly [do not] want to risk any further acceleration of this by pushing down the federal  funds rate  And I think we ought to bear in mind that there have been a number of institutional  changes recently that have made the savings deposits more like time deposits  I would suggest  that we begin to weight M2 a little more heavily than M1 instead of weighting [them] exactly the  same, as we have done in the past     At the same time, I wouldn’t want to raise the federal funds rate now, and I couldn’t go  along with the wording of alternative C, although I do like the specifications for M2 that are  embodied in alternative C, so I come out about where most of the others had in holding the  money market conditions about where they are  And I think the 5 to 5-1/2 [percent federal funds     9/21/76 - 24 -    rate] as specified would be about right, although I confess to having a bias in favor of a wider  range and more flexibility  But for the time being, I would be prepared to endorse the money  market directive      That’s a dangerous precedent, Mr Chairman    Could we have that read?    Is there an understanding that we would weigh M1 and M2 on an equal  basis?    Well, I can foresee a case where M1 might not grow very rapidly, which  might lead you to lower the federal funds rate, and at the same time M2 might be growing quite  rapidly    I guess that my feelings about M2 having grown too rapidly, I [would] feel  a little concerned about moving down [just] because M1 didn’t come in a little more    That’s my feeling, but there doesn’t seem to be any feeling on the part of  others that M2 ought to be weighted a little more heavily  "
177,1976-10-19,BLACK,"  Mr Pardee, do you share what you described as the market’s assessment of  the revaluation of the mark as being too little too late?    Mr Chairman, I just want to ask a few questions of clarification  Lyle,  what do you estimate to have been the effect of the auto strike on industrial production in  September?  You combine this with a settlement of the rubber strike and the bituminous coal  strike    And my second question, do you have any figures on the implicit price  deflator for the third quarter or the fixed-weight deflator?    What about the fixed weight?  Do you have that?    I wonder if I might ask Mr Gramley one more question?  Lyle, if you had  known that real GNP for the third quarter was going to come in at 4 percent instead of 33  percent as you assumed, would that have significantly affected your projections?      Do you know what real private final purchases look like?  Do you have that  figure?       10/19/76 - 26 -    That’s faster than it was in the second, if I remember right      It is, it was, let’s see  Second, 47, so, you said 47      44      I can make mine very brief, Mr Chairman  I just want to commend the  staff on this analysis with the 19 percent because I have been feeling for some time the M2  balances were assuming a lot of the [role] of transaction balances  I just want to point out that  there would be a tendency on the part of this group to assume that you had also reduced the rate  of growth in M2 by 19 percent, but it’s over twice as large as M1  So the reduction in that rate  would be maybe 7/10 of a percentage point, or something like that      Yeah, I guess that would be right--    SPEAKER(?)  Only to the extent that other thrift institutions--     Well, I shouldn’t have made even that brief remark, but I do commend  them on that      Mr Chairman, I would favor Mr Volcker’s second version, which I  understand to be 4-1/2 to 8 percent on Ml, 8 to 12 on M2, and 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 on the federal funds  rate  But I would take the second alternative you posed as our operating procedure and hold the  funds rate around 5 percent unless the aggregates come in weaker than projected for the next  couple of months  My guess is that the staff is right on this  Our own staff has made similar  projections, and I believe they’ll be coming in rather strong, and I would not start moving that  federal funds rate down until I saw evidence to the contrary      This is regardless of the behavior of the aggregates, Mr Chairman?      Mr Chairman, I would come out where Messrs Morris and Balles come  out and leave the ranges unchanged from what they were last time  I could live with a knocking  off a 1/2 percentage point of Ml, but I believe it would be preferable not to do that at this  particular time, although I would hope it would not get up to 7 percent at the same time    "
200,1976-11-08,BLACK,"  Nor in Richmond, Mr Chairman    Good morning, Mr Chairman  I am almost 100 percent in accord with  your recommendation, and I come out a little bit different, with 6 percent on the listing that the  Board’s staff provided us  In the past year we had an adjusted rate of 63 on the money supply;  [then we] assumed from here on out to the third quarter of next year that we’d get 55, the  midpoint of the range you proposed; and after a 12 adjustment to that, that gives you a figure of  67 net, I think a very realistic measure of what you get if we have acceleration of what we have  had  I personally would hope that we’d get the low end of that range    Mr Chairman, I’m impressed very much by Mr Axilrod’s argument  As I  indicated earlier, the rate of growth of M1 over the past year--third quarter of last year to the first  quarter of this year--was actually 44 percent  The midpoint of the long-term ranges we talked  about was 55, and as I indicated, I was hoping that we could come in toward the lower end of  that  I would prefer to stick with the ranges for M2 and M3 that we have now  "
216,1976-11-16,BLACK,"  You omitted 1973, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, is that in single-family or multifamily?    What would be the nature of the reaction?    Suppose you did lower the federal funds rate and simply announce the  discount rate changes as a realignment of the discount rate to minimize the [unintelligible]  effects    What I was really getting at, I guess, was Chairman Burns’s remark earlier  today about the good rhetoric    Mr Chairman, when the aggregates spurted in October, I think it was quite  wise to resist overreacting by pushing up the federal funds rate  Now that we see the aggregates  are likely to come in less rapidly than they have been, I was hoping that you would show similar  precaution, not overreacting to the downdrift in M1  Regardless of what happened to M1, I think  your time and savings deposits are going to continue to grow pretty fast  Thrift institution  deposits are going to grow, with the interest rate relationship [being] what it is, and I think this  means that there’s going to be a continuous amount of liquidity added to the economy, and I  believe that the liquidity level is very adequate [unintelligible]     I feel that the economy is a little stronger than the staff thinks, but I must confess that I  have growing doubts about my position on that, whereas I think that liquidity is adequate  I  think Governor Coldwell made a very important point  Most businessmen think interest rates are  too high in order to commit on plant and equipment [unintelligible]  So I’d like to see us move  gradually downward a little bit  I emphasize that word “gradual”  I ordinarily favor an  aggregate directive; at this time, I am leaning toward a money market directive  And I would set  a ceiling of 5 percent on that  I just don’t think we should dare move above 5 percent; the risk’s  on the other side  I would put 4-3/4 on that and go down to 4-7/8, like you suggested     Having done that, I think the stage would then be set for perhaps a 1/4 percentage point  decrease in the discount rate  I think this is a good chance for some of us to use some of that  rhetoric you talked about  If the [Federal Reserve] Board thinks it wise, I’d hope you would  consider what you might do on reserve requirements, expressing that this is not really a change  in policy but a structural change, the same way we would change the discount rate to bring it in  line  Because I think part of the lack of confidence we must not [forget] stems from fears of  inflation  If they think we’ve thrown in the towel [with] this little easing now, actually it could  be counterproductive     11/16/76 - 36 -            Mr Chairman, what would you read as the consensus on where we would  move the federal funds rate, say, in the next week--4-7/8?  "
242,1976-12-20,BLACK,"  Mr Chairman,  I believe--    I believe that’s pretty well spelled out in the Memorandum of Discussion at  the time we entered into this and in subsequent memoranda, so we could distill it from that, in  large part    Mr Chairman, in this excellent review which was described, I wonder if  we couldn’t accomplish some of the aspects intended for phase three  You commented that the  new subcommittee would look at [alternative] practices  It may well be that you’ll run into some  changes there in relationships to aggregates and minimize fluctuations in the federal funds rate at  the same time There’s always some [unintelligible]     Lyle, in view of the inventory situation--such things as we picked up in the  Redbook and also the last couple reports of the National Association of Purchasing Managers’  upward revision in real final purchases--I was a little bit puzzled that you don’t show a little     12/20-21/76 - 38 -         more strength in inventories a little earlier than you do  I was just wondering--if we do get  particularly good Christmas sales, if we have this sharp upturn in housing that we expect should  strengthen durable goods sales--how you would rate the chances that you might conceivably  have underestimated that upward rebound in inventories    Could I ask one question about housing  I was a little puzzled, Lyle, by  your figures on housing starts, particularly from this fourth quarter  If I figure right on this, this  is a pretty sharp drop in December    Sixteen percent or so, and I was curious--    Below what permits have actually been running    Well, I’ve got it figured at 1432 million [annual] rate for December, which  is below the permit level, which surprised me    I just guess I would expect a little more strength than that in housing,  though I may well be wrong    I am not much different than that  It’s really mainly the fourth quarter that  surprised me, and I didn’t know whether there was something special in the December situation  that I didn’t know about, or what    Mr Chairman, what is your guess as to how the tax cut will be divided  between individuals and business?    Even before the Federal Reserve requirements were [unintelligible],  insignificant number of market participants in the same deal with rates [unintelligible]    How do you think the markets would react to leaving policy unchanged at  this meeting?  I mean, [unintelligible]    Mr Chairman, I come out almost precisely the way you did  I feel the  same way  There is only one point that I might add, and it underscores the uncertainty of the  projection of the aggregates in this particular season, as alluded to by Mr Axilrod and Mr  Volcker  To further confuse the matter, I would say the Richmond staff projections--which  we’ve been experimenting on for a relatively short time, but with some success--show a faster  rate of growth than the Board’s or the Desk’s estimates  Now you all would say [we] haven’t  had the experience these others have had, and I readily agree, but I also point out that neither do  we have the long record of errors  "
271,1977-01-17,BLACK,"  These at identical rates?  Spot purchases and forward sales at identical  rates?    Lyle, do you have any inkling as to what other parts of GNP may show?   How about real final purchases--do you have a feeling on that?     1/17-18/77 - 24 -            That is a pretty significant margin, really--43 was the highest in the third  quarter    Mr Chairman, I wonder if I might ask you a question?  A while ago you  indicated that you did not think businessmen yet realized the extent of the federal deficit or the  inflationary implication of that  Do you anticipate that this will have a significant impact on  either the timing or the amount of business capital spending?    Any inventory buildup?    Mr Chairman, I’ve struggled with this dilemma that you described so well,  and I reached pretty much the same sort of conclusion that you have, that despite the political  problems that do arise from adjusting these rates down, that we ought to make a small move  I  was a little surprised, really, that you knocked down the lower limits of M2 and M3  My feeling  would be that those are probably all right  We need that much expansion, probably, and my  preference would be to knock 1/2 [percentage point] off the upper ends of those two  But  otherwise, I come out about where you do    I think that’s important    My feeling was sort of that they’re saying, “My gosh, they’re willing to  tolerate only 7 percent growth in M2 with an inflation rate such as we’ve got, that’s just not     1/17-18/77 - 44 -           adequate”  But your reasoning may be better on that  I don’t have a great deal of trouble with  one or the other  Some move, I think, should be made    Steve, you may have answered this--I know you have skirted it very  closely--but I was a little surprised when I remembered that, back in 1975, when we had that  sharp jump in M1 and M2 in May and June, when we had the tax rebate--since we have larger  refunds coming this year, we are going to have a rebate too  I would have thought your second  quarter estimates of M1 and M2 would have been higher than they really were  Is there  something that I’m missing there?     You do have pretty large refunds, don’t you?    Mr Chairman, our projections for January, like those of the Board staff,  suggest that M1, anyway, will come in a good deal stronger than we thought a month ago  But I  think we’ve got particularly difficult problems this time of year, and we have been studying this  pattern that develops around the Christmas season--beginning in November and ending in  February  And it makes a whale of a lot of difference where the weeks fall; you have what  appear to be pretty random factors that make a great deal of difference as to whether the rate of  growth shows up in February or January  And we don’t believe that either the monthly or  weekly seasonal factors take very good account of this, and so in essence we really feel that you  have got to take a look at the two months in tandem before you draw any very valid conclusions  at this time of the year       1/17-18/77 - 62 -           In essence, anywhere between 4 and 7 percent to us would not necessarily mean that you  are getting off your long-run trend--that [it] was accelerating, in other words  So, what I am  saying is, not that “4 is 8,” exactly, but “4 is 7” anyway you look at it now  So I think that I  would value your suggestion on this  I never thought that I would want to go for a money  market directive two months in a row, but because of the particular uncertainty about the  aggregates this time of the year, I believe that’s the wisest course for the time being    Try 4-5/8?  "
297,1977-02-15,BLACK,"  Tom, is it possible we might do that all the time, not issuing our statement  of position but the other actions which we worked on under the Government in the Sunshine  Act?    I was just saying is it possible that it would be better if we did not adopt the  first part of the recommendation, issuing a statement that we don’t think we [are] covered,  [unintelligible] merely acting as if we were    In trying to prognosticate what lies ahead, I guess I generally tend to think  in terms of probabilities, Jerry, and I come out thinking that what the staff has done this time has  a pretty high probability of happening  I am right with you this time, more closely than I have  ever been     What I am wondering about is another scenario, as to how likely you think [it is that] this  might happen  In a period now when inflation expectations seem to be strengthening and you  have had some shortages and fuel problems and so on, what probability would you attach to the  possibility that we might have an inventory cycle built up here, unreasonable levels that might  cause trouble later on    I guess that’s even higher than I would have put it  That is real interesting    You think that inventory explains what’s causing it?    Steve’s observation occasioned me to wonder about something  Steve,  what maturities do you feel really compete most effectively with thrift institution obligations?   I’m wondering about disintermediation here    Yes sir    Maybe I misunderstand the Chairman on it  I was really wondering--    No sir  I was thinking about disintermediation on the liability side of the  thrift institutions and what this might mean, you know, for debt management with this bulge--    Mr Chairman, I’m a tad more hawkish today than you are, but not a great  deal  I’m not particularly concerned about M1, and I recognize these uncertainties involving the  rebates and refunds and the likelihood that whatever does take place may be reversed  I think we  have to be very cautious in reacting to the behavior of M1, and to compound my confusion, the  projections we’ve been doing in Richmond suggest that in February, M1 may actually decline a  little bit, but [may have] a pretty good spurt in March  But that’s, of course, a guess  But  anyway, regardless of what happens, three sets of projections for the first quarter would be in the  neighborhood of 5 to 5-1/2 percent, or something like that  And I think that’s perfectly  appropriate     The thing that really concerns me is something that’s bothered me for some time, and  that’s this rapid rise in M2, and I would hate to see this continue for very many more months  I  think that’s something we definitely have to be concerned about  So I’m inclined to make a little  move toward less ease right now, although I recognize the uncertainties of the weather  I think  that’s going to be temporary, as I indicated a little earlier  But I certainly don’t think we should  do any more than a very gradual move at this time, keeping in mind that the financial markets are  very uncertain and that they could react very sharply to even a slight tightening move       2/15/77 - 31 -           And when we get to the numerical specifications, I would take the language of B and the  Ml specifications of B, which would be 3 to 7 per cent  But on M2, I would like to see that  range reduced to 6 to 10 per cent so that we could trigger some reaction on the funds rate if we  move up to 10 per cent  And I would favor going back to our 1 percentage point spread by  adopting 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 on the federal funds rate  But I wouldn’t make any move toward a 4-3/4  midpoint unless in fact we do see the aggregates accelerating from the sluggish pace that we’ve  been experiencing recently     Could they get as attractive a rate by doing it on their own, you think?   "
324,1977-03-15,BLACK,"  Jerry, I found rather interesting your comments on the outlook for federal  expenditures, particularly so far as regards the shortfalls we’ve had, and was interested to know  that you expect this to continue  Could you elaborate a little, to the extent that you know, why  this has taken place?  I have read everything I can find on it, but I don’t feel like I have a very  good handle    Are any of these letters commending us for our actions, Mr Chairman?    Peter, has market sophistication reached the point--now that they [have]  deemphasized the recent figures on money supply and [have] moved on to monthly figures--that  they also, similarly, [have] deemphasized any bulge in the April money supply, remembering  that this happened last April and was then reversed the next couple of months?  Will they take  this in stride, or are they going to be terribly surprised?    Paul, to compound the confusion, our estimate is larger than yours, too    Mr Chairman, I have a feeling that in the second quarter we are going to  see a pretty substantial bulge in the aggregates  We’ve touched on many of these points, and our  own work suggests we’ll have even a greater rise in April associated with the buildup in balances  by individuals around the April tax dates  Then, with the rebates and, later on, special Social  Security payments, we think it’s going to be a pretty good bulge throughout all of the second  quarter     Now I think we have to be rather cautious in reacting to such tax-related bulges in  aggregates, since as the staff points out these are likely to be reversed later on  The problem  here, to me, is to distinguish between the part that results from these special factors and the part  stemming from an underlying increase in demand for money  I don’t know any way to do this,  so I think we ought to remain particularly alert to increases in the volume of commercial paper  and business loans at banks  My own feeling is that we are going to get a larger demand on the  part of the public for money than was true in 1975 and 1976, when we had similar bulges  But of  course you can’t tell at this point  Overall, I think the aggregates are behaving better now than I  can remember their behaving at any time since I have been sitting around the table     Since these are uncertainties for the present, I’d be inclined to hold pretty much to our  current stance  So, along with alternative B as a general prescription for the March-April period- -but since I think, for tax-related reasons, M1 growth in April could be much stronger than the  Bluebook suggests--I would be inclined to raise that M1 range to 6 to 10 percent and leave the  M2 at 7 to 11  And I agree with the assessment of all of you that we ought to have this fuzzy  midpoint of the range, 4-5/8 to 4-3/4     At this stage, since I think what strength we see in the aggregates may be largely a tax- related phenomenon, I would be reluctant to see the funds rate moving more than 5 to 10 basis  points above that 4-3/4 in any week, even if the aggregates are coming in a little bit above these  limits that we’ve set  But I agree with Paul’s long-run assessment of the problem  It’s just that I  think you are going to have some rather misleading signals in this period  We’ve been fooled a  couple of times in recent years and it could happen again  "
348,1977-04-19,BLACK,"  I wonder if I might ask for some clarification on these revised projections   I was interested in noticing that the result of the deletion of the rebate issue had changed your     4/19/77 - 4 -           estimates for personal consumption expenditures and inventory investments pretty significantly  but that you had showed practically no effect on business fixed investment--it [actually] had  been negative  I would expect the effect on the first two--most any model that used multiplier  accelerator principles [would show it]  I wonder about effects on expectations and interest rates  and what this might do to business fixed investment  I would expect a positive effect from the  abandonment, which is not what you show    That’s what I really would expect, but I may be wrong, but everyone I see  seems to be much pleased by the fact that the rebate was withdrawn--at least the business sector    Mostly that’s a matter of the relative rates on federal funds and the discount  rate, though, don’t you think?  You get complaints if they were more competitive elsewhere     4/19/77 - 16 -            Mr Chairman, I gather, from what you’re saying, that there are not really  any surprises in there that we haven’t pretty well read already    Mr Chairman, I guess I’m going to be the hawk today  I thought several  times that someone was going to steal all I had to say, but I still come out a little further to the  right on this  The question to me still is not whether we should cut the limits but really by how  much  For a long time you have been testifying, and the rest of us have been taking every  opportunity to say, that we want to work down the long-run rate of growth in the aggregates, and  there always seems to be a reason why we can’t do this  And Governor Partee has spelled out  particularly well why this is not exactly the most advantageous time, and I am well aware of that   But at the same time, I think it’s about as good a time as we are likely to get, and to make a long  story short and not draw this out, I would cut the upper end of M1 by half a percentage point and  the upper ends of M2 and M3 by a full percentage point    Mr Chairman, I think we’re presented with essentially the same problem  we had last month in trying to separate out unusual seasonal factors from the underlying demand  for money  In fact, we wouldn’t be surprised to see these aggregates coming in somewhat  stronger than the staff is estimating, but we believe that if this is true, then you’ve certainly got  to strengthen the demand for money  So we’d come out where you did on your M1 and M2, and  here the federal funds range sounds fine to me     One thing I would like to throw out for consideration, however  I always like to go with  the aggregates formulation if we can, but if you notice, on lines 46 and 47, it says “growth rates  over the two-month period were deviating significantly from the midpoints of the indicated  ranges”  Well, I would prefer to change that to say “are moving beyond the limits of the  indicated ranges”  In other words, unless they go above these ranges, I wouldn’t do anything for  the federal funds rate because I think it’s largely seasonal or special factors    It’s page 3, Mr Chairman    Lines 46 and 47, where it says “would deviate significantly from the  midpoints” I would change that to “moving beyond the limits of the indicated ranges”  Now that  may not sound consistent with my hawkish--     Yes, because of special factors at work, really  That’s my feeling   Anything up there--     And I’m sure mine seems inconsistent with my earlier hawkish position,  but I think you’ve got some special factors here that we ought not react to unless they turn out to  be really a manifestation of strengthening demand for money  If it goes beyond that, yes,  I think  it clearly is, but up to that point I’m not sure  I would buy pretty much Steve’s analysis on the  thing    That’s right  I have a bias in favor of the aggregates directives, is what it  amounts to, and I just like to stay there in this particular case  With special factors at work, I’m  willing to compromise my ideals to a certain extent    I think you may well be confronted with a situation where you’ve got to  move up beyond 4-3/4 if you adhere to this language, and it may well not be warranted, maybe it  will, I don’t know  Whether that’s [indicating] real demand for money or these special factors  that Steve’s outlined, I’m inclined to think [it would be] the special factors up to that point  But  as I indicated, we think it’s probably going beyond that    Yes sir  The words “will deviate significantly from the midpoints” would  be replaced with “are moving beyond the limits”    Yes sir  Then we’d strictly have the money market directive, but call it an  aggregates directive  I believe that’s exactly the wording in the money market directive    I’d be glad to, Steve  On page 3, lines 46 and 47, beginning with the words  “will deviate significantly from the midpoints”, replace that with “are moving beyond the  limits”    That’s right  "
377,1977-05-17,BLACK,"  Mr Chairman, I find myself in close agreement with Mr Kichline’s  assessment of the business outlook, in particular for the outlook in plant and equipment  expenditures  I was puzzled about one thing, Jim, on [page] II-15 in the Greenbook, where you  have the Commerce Department series on contracts and orders for plant and equipment    The last couple of lines there show weakness of the last two months,  February and March--and I’m just wondering if there were special factors in the private  nonbuilding area for utilities and pipelines, or something of that sort, that would account for that  weakness there  All the other indicators would be sort of strong in the direction you have  indicated    What I’m really trying to get at is whether the nonbuilding part of it--    But I was wondering whether it was just an aberration or whether that  could be a weakness that might overwhelm the strength received     5/17/77 - 9 -            Well, that’s what I felt  It was because everything seemed to indicate that it  might be, but I just wanted to go ahead and take the information on it anyway    Well, I think Chairman Burns has confirmed my feelings about it, by  pointing these things out, that’s certainly not [unintelligible]    I’d like to ask Mr Sternlight--Peter, a couple of things impress me about  the behavior of the financial markets since our last meeting  One is that most rates, and long  rates, of course, in practice have moved up less than the federal funds rate  The other is, you’ve  had some little strength in the stock market in the face of an increase in the prime rate  And I’m  wondering here, and this is a very hard question to answer, do you read into this any feeling on  the part of the market that inflationary expectations have diminished at least temporarily, [any]  feeling of relief that we have provided evidence that we are moving to stem inflation?    Our work with the aggregates tends to pretty well confirm the staff’s guess  as to where these would come out for the second quarter, around 9 percent on M1, which is well  above our long-run target rates  But at the same time, as Governor Partee has pointed out, we  ought to be careful to note that, historically, the second quarter in the last couple of years has  been rather strong, and the third quarter has been somewhat weak  And I think we ought to take  that into consideration in reaching our decision today  And I think it’s also worth noting that,  while M1 has accelerated pretty sharply in the current quarter, M2 is moving less rapidly and  may move even less rapidly than that in the future     And in view of all of this and our having moved the fed funds rate up by over 50 [basis  points] fairly quickly , I would be inclined to stay about where we are at present  And I would  buy your specifications, Mr Chairman, and the monetary aggregates directive  But I think we  ought to be quite prepared to use the latitude in the federal funds range if the aggregates in fact  do tend to come in higher than we are estimating  I think the economy is quite strong  I would  not be surprised to see more strength than some of my colleagues think will be there  "
414,1977-06-21,BLACK,"  Jerry, could you give us a little bit more on the revised first-quarter figures  for GNP?  I’m interested more than anything else in why it was revised upward and what final  demand did    Were inventories about the same?    But you did mention the figures on final demand in percentage terms, and I  was trying--    That’s the one I missed; thanks a lot    Mr Chairman, I have a question about the revision in your inventory  projections for the balance of the year  You reduced these for the second, third, and fourth  quarters relative to what you thought a month ago  Is this largely a result of the larger increase  than anticipated in inventory building in the first quarter?  Or do you have in mind some more  fundamental factors?  The reason I’m really intrigued by this more than anything else is that I’ve  been playing around with some of the ratios put out by the Commerce Department in terms of  ’72 dollars, which should remove any downward bias from the switch to the LIFO method of  accounting  These show inventory-sales ratios greater than we actually had when the recession  began, and I’ve been thinking all along that inventories were in pretty good alignment  But they  really don’t look that good when you look at them in constant dollar terms     I assumed [that’s] what it was, but I didn’t know  These constant-dollar  ratios are very interesting, I think      They sure do    Would you use the money market directive, Mr Chairman, or the  aggregates directive?    Mr Chairman, I feel that M1 in the second quarter is still going to be  moving a little faster than we’d like to see it  In view of the likelihood that the economy will  continue on upward, the demand for transactions balances is likely to lead to some rise in the  demand for money  But fortunately, it looks like M2, which I consider a lot more important, is  coming in better now, and the prospects for holding that within the target range seem pretty good  to me, so I come out almost where you did in saying we ought to stay about where we are   I was leaning toward the money market directive, which I don’t like to do, either, and if  you are prepared to throw logic to the winds, I’ll go along with you and go with the aggregates  [directive], which I really prefer for philosophical reasons  Like Mr Mayo, I would prefer the  ranges on M1 and M2 embodied in C because our projection suggests, quite surprisingly, that we  may have a little less growth than staff suggests    "
439,1977-07-19,BLACK,"  You do have such a series that does show that the inventory ratios are  higher, I think, than you get on a conventional basis    Yes     Mr Chairman, I held up my hand back when Mr Baughman raised his  question  I was just going to point out the availability of this constant-dollar inventory-sales  ratio figure, so I have nothing more to add    Mr Chairman, I find myself in complete agreement with your assessment  on the economic situation  And I thought we were going to come out with exactly the same     7/19/77 - 35 -    figure because you made precisely the same points in developing your suggestion for the long- term targets that I had intended to make  But I come out somewhat closer to Governor Coldwell  than to the figures that you put out  I would go ahead [lowering] 1/2 point on each end of M1 to  get 4 to 6  Rather than using the 6 to 9, however, that he favored on the M2, I would favor just  knocking the 1/2 point off on the top end of M2 to give you 7 to 9, and a 1/2 point off the top end  of M3  This would have the effect of lowering the midpoint of the M1 target by 1/2 percentage  point and the midpoint of the other two targets by 1/4 percentage point  Now that may be  politically pretty hard to do this time, but that’s approximately where I believe we ought to  move    And you can get what I want within either set  It’s just a question of how  wide it is    I said, either set of ranges would encompass what I really want  It’s just a  question of how wide it is    Mr Chairman, you stated there were no grounds on which to compromise,  and I see one  I don’t think you probably want to consider it, but 4-1/4 to 6-1/4    4-1/4 to 6-1/4     7/19/77 - 44 -      Same midpoint, but--    But I think in this case it really is to knock a little off the top    I believe it would give the same, wouldn’t it? 4 to 6    Yes, yours would, but 4-1/4 to 6-1/4 would give the same midpoint, I  believe, as 4 to 6-1/2    There’s only one reason I would even suggest it, and that is that the upper  limit has not really been cut down    The only reason I would even suggest anything that approximates fine  tuning to that point is that there has been no adjustment in the upper limit    I think Mr Sternlight pretty well took care of my question, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, Mr Mayo has made all the points I’d wanted to make  I  would be right with him  "
494,1977-09-20,BLACK,"  I continue to be concerned about this weakness in net exports that we’re  projecting, and I wonder if I might ask Mr Kichline if we are wrong in our estimates of the  growth that we expect to have in Europe and Japan  Say we’ve underestimated it by maybe 1  percent or so--would that be enough to have any appreciable effect on that sector and GNP?    That’s all I have    Roger, has the appreciation of land prices caused a commensurate increase  in taxes on farms?    That’s another part of the squeeze, to the extent that begins to happen    Mr Chairman, I’m sort of embarrassed to raise my question because the  others have made such interesting observations, but I’m glad you didn’t ask me to ask this  question so that I would stand between us and adjournment  So I do just have a question, it’s a  technical question  I share your proclivities, and Mr Balles’s, for looking at final purchases and  trying to assess the underlying strength of the economy     And Jim, I was just curious about your inventory changes that you’re projecting  You’ve  got a kind of zigzag projection for changes in inventories from the third quarter on through the  second quarter of next year  That’s probably as accurate as anybody could be, and I know I  couldn’t do it any better, but I was just curious, is there some particular reason for that?  I can  see why you have liquidation or slowing in the rate of accumulation in the third quarter and a  speed-up in the fourth  But when we get to the first, is that a [unintelligible]?    Well, thank you  I was just curious about that one    Peter, as interest rates move up closer and closer to the point where we  could expect some disintermediation, do you think it’s likely that volume in foreign purchases,  maturities selected, will give us any additional leeway toward moving the funds rate up without  incurring disintermediation?    You would guess there would be some marginal effect, anyway?    Mr Sternlight, there are not many foreign purchases in the very short end  are there?    You could view that as giving a little more leeway to move your federal  funds rate without disintermediation, too    What was it in August, Mr Chairman?    What figure do you have on that new one for August?    Mr Chairman, I’ve got an eclectic approach, I guess, and I wish I could  give proper footnotes, but so many things have been said by so many people, I’m not sure I can   I certainly agree with the feeling of most people that M2 has been projecting a different posture  of policy than M1 has been  And I think the majority feels that M2 deserves a little more  emphasis, and I certainly concur in that because of the recent changes in financial technology   And regardless of how we look at it, I think, clearly, both aggregates have been moving too fast,  and we certainly want to resist any acceleration there and begin moving these things down  gradually to a lower growth path  And I certainly welcome the sign that M2 is decelerating  some  But I wouldn’t want to see that deceleration proceed too rapidly  I favor a gradual  downward movement in that  So far as the lower limit of M1 is concerned, I guess I am a little  different here  I don’t think anybody suggested, maybe someone did, going below zero  I  wouldn’t mind even going below zero on the lower end of M1    I certainly concur with that    And I wasn’t going to suggest that we publish that, either; I want to make  that clear  We’ve been playing around with the estimates on this thing and we’re probably dead  wrong  I pointed out once that we didn’t have the experience, but neither did we have the long  record of misses that some of the others [did]--we now have two records of solid misses, so I  have less confidence; we are fast approaching that  I’m sure we’ll go even closer, but we think  that probably M1 may come in at 5 percent, or even less than that     So I guess for the sake of symmetry more than anything else, the range I would have  chosen would be 3 to 7, but I like your 2 to 7, although it doesn’t have the symmetrical beauty of  the 3 to 7  For the M2, I think 5 to 9 would be appropriate; [but] I have no particular problems  with the 4 to 8  And for the federal funds rate, 6 to 6-1/2  As I indicated, I think a little bit  earlier, I’d stay pretty much where we are regardless of what happened to M1, but if M2 should  drop down below 5 percent, I think I’d be inclined to back away a little bit from the 6-1/8  I  don’t know what all exactly happened, but I would back down just a little bit from that  But if  M1 and M2 begin to approach these ceilings, then I think we ought to move on up toward 6-1/2,  and if they begin exceeding the ceiling--I guess there’s certainly some possibility they will--I  would hope we would be at 6-1/2 by the time of the next meeting    Clarification, Mr Chairman, is it 2 to 7 on M1 or 3 to 7?    Mr Chairman, I don’t want to make a proposal, but I wonder if I might just  point out, the midpoint for the 2 to 8 [range for M1] is 5 percent, if I figured that right  And this  would trigger action if [M1 came] in above 5 percent  So, some of those who are worried about  the 8 percent, I think, will be accommodated by triggering of the federal funds rate when that  thing hits 5  And I have no problems--    Mr Chairman, may I make one more observation before we vote  I came  in here with the intention of departing from my usual procedure and recommending a money  market directive with a feeling of 5 percent [upper limit] on M1  That, to me, is the same thing  as a range from 2 to 7 on the aggregates directive because it triggers as action on the part of the  Manager at that point  Similarly on the M2, you trigger action at 6 percent  I think, later, with  these you mentioned 5 percent as what you thought ought to be the ceiling, but if you reach 5  percent it does trigger action     9/20/77 - 59 -    On an aggregates directive, you trigger action when it passes the midpoint;  on a money market directive, you trigger action when it passes the ceiling  And I’m just trying  to point out that I think this is almost equivalent to a money market directive with a ceiling of 5  percent on M1 and a ceiling of 6 percent on M2, which is a pretty hawkish position--maybe  that’s not helpful  "
520,1977-10-17,BLACK,"  Mr Chairman, one interesting thing that’s come to our attention lately,  which seems to fly in the face of some of the things others have been saying, is a report from the  vice chairman [of our Bank’s board], who is involved in all sorts of wood and wood products  industries  And he reports that since about Labor Day, lumber prices of all sorts--southern pine,  fir, plywood, you name it--have been coming down quite rapidly  In view of the publicity given  to the role of lumber prices in pushing up wholesale prices in September, this suggest that either     10/17-18/77 - 9 -         next month you’re going to feel some of these effects--they’ve come down about 15 percent or  so on southern pine, which is pretty good--    Starting about Labor Day, yes sir    Mr Chairman, mine’s related to something we have not gotten to yet  It  isn’t on agriculture  Do you--    Earlier, either Jerry or Jim, I’ve forgotten which, mentioned that inflation  for ’78 would be 1/4 percentage point lower if you assume no imposition of the well-head tax   Have you done like computations on real GNP?    I had just one minor one, Mr Chairman, the question of the meaning of a  chart back here on international [developments]; it’s very minor  This second chart in  international shows the ratio of foreign real GNP to US real GNP  What is included in that  foreign?  What is included in that chart?    That’s what I assumed     10/17-18/77 - 15 -          I think it’s a failure of the radial tires to achieve their 40,000 miles  guarantee in most instances      Frank, does your survey show where the funds are coming in?  Are they  coming in the long areas, where you wouldn’t have incentive for disintermediation that you  would have in some of the shorter areas?    I think he was going to give him another month to get it    Rise in interest rates--    Scott, I gather from what you said about the market’s tendency to ignore  any good news, that your assessment of the positive effects of, say, an increase in the discount  rate or moving the federal funds rate up still further would not make much difference    There is some indication that stable rates really aren’t a viable permanent  system    Could I ask Scott one more question?    Scott, has this diversification by the OPEC countries out of dollars  accounted to any significant degree for the movement in the dollar?    [Unintelligible]    Well, that was my guess I just wasn’t--    So a good part of that could stem from fear of [unintelligible] past week or  so?    Mr Chairman, in considering our new longer-run targets this time, we took  a little more careful look than we ordinarily do at the recent behavior of aggregates and continue  to be quite puzzled by this behavior in M1  It just is very perplexing  It’s almost never that you  have anyone moving at the same sort of rate as M2 as we’ve had, as shown for the last three  months and the last six months, for example, on the Bluebook  The only time you get to this  kind of thing is in a period of pretty substantial disintermediation, when M2 has dropped down  to the M1 rate, so it’s very unusual       10/17-18/77 - 44 -         We puzzled about it, and I’m inclined to agree with the staff that it’s due, to some extent,  to the strengthening in the underlying demand for money  And I think the point you made about  the flight in money because of uncertainty has a good role in that, certainly, but nevertheless I  don’t think the full answer has yet been found  And this being the case, we’ve been focusing  most of our attention on the behavior of M2, and I frankly think that behavior is pretty good  now  [I] welcome this slowing that we’ve had, and I believe that we will have slowing in the  future     And in accordance with your suggestion, I think it would be wise to reduce the ranges on  M2 and M3  I would go a little further, however, than you suggested, by cutting the ranges of  both of those a full 1/2 percentage point  And I would prefer to leave the rate on M1 at 4 to  6-1/2 percent  I think cutting that would represent a little bit too much deceleration, although if  you win on the other point, I guess I would prefer then to go 4 to 6    Mr Chairman, I guess my position is sort of a cross between that of Mr  Guffey and Mr Volcker  I had recently intended to suggest a lower range of M1 and leave M2  as shown in alternative B, but I guess really the thing that controls me most would be the  adoption of a money market directive at this time, since the trigger point would involve either  approaching or moving beyond those upper ranges  So I would feel rather strongly, in view of  the uncertainty of the aggregates, [that] we don’t have an aggregates directive this time; and Mr  Guffey’s range of 6-1/4 to 7 with 6-5/8 as midpoint seems most appropriate    I think it depends in part on whether you have a monetary aggregates or  money market directive  "
548,1977-11-15,BLACK,"  Mr Chairman, along the lines of what Mr Mayo suggested a while ago, I  would think as a practical modus operandi in the interim that, when in doubt, we would tend to  lean more towards an aggregates directive than a money market directive  For example, in  today’s meeting, I think a money market directive is appropriate, but if I thought this was going  to be released within three to five days, I think I would want to expand the range a little bit more  and the range of the aggregates a little bit more and make it an aggregates directive  And  similarly, if we’re forced to make these directives available immediately, I think that strengthens  the case for looking further into the possibility of using a reserves target rather than a federal  funds target, so that the interest rate movements in the federal funds market will not have this  significance that they now do  With, perhaps, a proviso to limit the fluctuations beyond certain  ranges    I didn’t mean to suggest that we do it now  I just mean over the future  I  think it does strengthen the argument    Mr Chairman, I’m in pretty close agreement with the projections of the  staff, assuming no significant change in the level of business confidence  But in view of what I  perceive to be excesses in the economy, if we should somehow or another miraculously resolve  some of these doubts we’ve got about energy and regulatory policy and taxation and inflation  and so on, I think we could have substantially more strength than is now apparent in the forecast    Mr Chairman, what would be the figure for M2?    You’d cut 1 point on each end?    Well, I, like everyone else, fall into this B category  I think the question of  ranges depends largely on whether you select a money market directive or an aggregates  directive  If we go with a money market directive, in view of the shortfall we’re expecting in  November, and our staff thinks it may even be a negative number, I’d be reluctant to go as high  as 7 percent [on M1] because that would entail a tremendous increase in December before you  really move  So I would think maybe 0 to 5 percent would be better  I don’t attach much  importance to the lower limit; the upper one is the important one     And 5 to 9 sounds good to me in the M2 part of it  Since’72, we’ve had more stability in  the time and savings deposits portion of that, as banks apparently have been actively pursuing  the portion of time deposits when the savings deposits have run off  So that hasn’t fluctuated as  much since ’72 as we’ve been accustomed to having, so I think it may be a little higher than we  think there     And if we should go to the aggregates directive, I think that 2 to 7 [for M1], or something  in that neighborhood, would be much better     11/15/77 - 38 -          Mr Chairman, may I make an observation?  If you have a money market  directive and the staff is right, and you get a 1 percent expansion in M1 in November, then in  order to trigger any action on that, you’ve got to get 15 percent in December before you begin  moving the rate up    Not too much before that  But to me, the decision [is], if you take a money  market directive, you want narrower ranges; and if you take an aggregates directive, you want  wider ranges  "
574,1977-12-19,BLACK,"  Mr Chairman, most of the points that I wanted to make have been made by  various people  I started off with this point to which John Balles alluded a while ago, on page 2,  where we don’t think the court order ought to be, in and of itself, the reason for adopting  basically a new approach  And I think that ought to be the starting point on this  I guess I felt  initially, although Governor Partee has allayed a lot of my fears on this, that the 1/2 point range  was unduly narrow, and I would have preferred that you say we do exactly what we have been  doing, which sometimes involves a 1/2 point spread, sometimes more than that, but his intention  seems to be sound and pure on that     Now he has clarified that, so my fears are alleviated, but I just feel that human beings  suffer from a certain amount of inertia, and you would have unnecessary barriers to going  beyond that 1/2 point if you had, in fact, set it  So I’d rather at least consider the possibility of  going beyond that if, in fact, you did pass these barriers and change by raising the range, say,  another 1/2 point  I think you could conceivably be accused of having tried to circumvent the  intent of the court     Other points have been made, and I won’t go over those, but I do endorse what Mr Balles  was saying a while ago  I think this is a significant enough change in our procedure that we  really ought to go ahead, as Governor Partee indicated that we would, in reexamining our  procedure still further  I think interest rates and aggregates are both important  I hope we can  move on in that direction  Otherwise, I think we are exactly where we should be in this report      Roger, could I ask you a clarifying question?  On page 13 under the  monetary aggregates directive, aren’t you talking about the second sentence from the bottom in  the Bluebook, where you say, “In the judgment of the Committee, such growth rates are likely to  be associated with a weekly average federal funds rate of about X percent”?     12/19-20/77 - 31 -          If that’s different from what you are now operating at, it would clearly have  very quick market repercussions    Mr Chairman, our sense of the business outlook has strengthened  significantly in the last month or so, and I would come out about where the staff does in the  overall outlook, assuming no change in tax policy, inflation policy, or regulatory policy  But if  we can get some significant inroads in those areas, as you seem to think we might, then I think  this can take off a great deal faster than projected    Mr Chairman, I’m very intrigued by Governor Lilly’s observation that he  thinks we have been able to achieve more efficiency in this  Would you elucidate a little bit?  I’m--    Steve, do you have any clue as to whether this will raise or lower our  estimates of the movement in the aggregates?    I suspected that that was the case    Mr Chairman, you opened your statement by mentioning that the  aggregates had quieted down, and I share this feeling  I would simply like to add one  amplification to that, and that is, if you look at the behavior of M2 in the last couple of months  and subtract out the large time component on that, instead of an apparent rate of increase of 73  percent, that residual has increased at a rate of only 22 percent  And I think there’s a good case  for taking these into account, since they don’t seem to be as closely related to transaction  demands for money as the other types of time deposits     I think in view of the uncertainty and difficulty of projecting the aggregates in this  particular period, we’d be well advised to adopt the money market directive, although I’ll put  your minds to rest to some extent by telling you that Richmond has projected about the same rate  of growth in the aggregates as the Board’s staff    I’m sure it is  Turning to the federal funds rate, I think the specifications of  B are about right  I have a lot of sympathy for what Dave Eastburn was saying [For M1], I  would not even worry about bringing the floor down below the 2-1/2 percent that he specified,  and I would prefer a 7 percent or so ceiling on the other end of that  If you have a 7 percent  ceiling with a 58 percent rate of increase in December, then that would mean that, in January,  you could go up as high as 82 percent before you acted  And I would not want M1 to go up  much more than that  So far as M2 is concerned, I think 6 to 10 is perfectly appropriate, and I  would support Mr Volcker’s suggestion on the modifications of wording in the directive    Mr Chairman, couldn’t you also go with a money market directive and still  lower upper limits?    That would be my preference  I don’t think we are so far apart on our  objectives, but in view of uncertainties, I’d prefer that route     You’re just nervous  "
615,1978-01-17,BLACK,"  I wonder if I might ask Mr Pardee a question  Scott, would you quantify as   far as you can--I realize this is a very difficult question--what portion of the movement against the     1/17/78             14  dollar is in the form of multi-national corporations and others engaged in foreign business and  investors in the normal course of business trying to protect themselves as compared to those who  are trying to make money purely out of speculation against the dollar      When they say “everybody’s in it,” are they saying they are in it just to protect   themselves rather than to speculate?     Yes, I know it’s hard to draw the distinction  But as I see it, and as I   perceived what Scott said, I gather that you think there might be a little more of the speculative  element than he has suggested        1/17/78             15   The line is a very fine line  But I think most people--most laymen anyway--   think of this as a massive speculative attack  Actually a substantial part of it, an overwhelming part  of it, is simply people trying to protect themselves      It’s hard to define, and I realize that     I’d agree with that, Paul  I was comparing December to January     Mr Chairman, every point I wanted to make has been made  I would say   simply that all of us recognize that the uncertainties are greater now than at almost any time in the  forecast  I wouldn’t have a lot of confidence in any particular forecast now for the next six months  I wouldn’t quarrel a lot with the staff’s forecast  It’s probably about as good as anyone could do   Like Governor Wallich, I see no excesses that I think will lead to a recession, but at the same time I  have the same doubts voiced by many people about the strength of housing and plant and  equipment expenditures  So, if I had to deviate any from the staff projection, I think we could have  a period of somewhat less rapid growth than they’re projecting toward the last part of the year  The  thing that impressed me recently more than anything else was the abrupt shift in the attitude of our  directors between the December meeting when they were at the height of their ebullience and the  January meeting when they toned it down considerably  [They were] still fairly optimistic but it  was a marked change, more than I’ve ever seen between two months      Well, I think it’s partly your failure to be reappointed and the absence of any   definitive action on taxes or inflation  Over-regulation on the part of government, all these  uncertainties, and the decline in the dollar I think played a big part  All of these things that we  have all been concerned about I think are just beginning to take their toll a little more      Mr Chairman, I was not clear on one point and I asked Peter Sternlight to   clarify it for me earlier  It might be helpful to some in the group  In the event the New York Bank  is acting as principal in matched-sale purchase agreements, it would make an equal amount of  repurchase agreements in the market  I thought that’s what it said, but I was not absolutely certain   He said that is what it does      Mr Chairman, our best guess is that with current money market conditions,   we’ll get a growth in M1 of something like 6 to 6-1/2 percent in January and February and a rate of  growth in M2 of maybe 7 to 7-1/2 percent  As Steve Axilrod suggested, we too are becoming  increasingly concerned over what we perceive to be the developing financial situation in the late  winter time and early part of the spring with heavy Treasury borrowing superimposed upon heavy  borrowing by state and local governments and heavy private credit demands  So we would agree  with his assessment that it’s very likely that we’re going to have to move the federal funds rate up  to resist supplying reserves necessary to support growth in the aggregates that would otherwise  take place  This leads me to the conclusion that we ought to resist any movement in M1 much  above 6 to 6-1/2 percent and in M2 much above 7 to 7-1/2 percent  So, I would favor narrowing     1/17/78             46  the aggregates spread, as Messrs Mayo and Wallich have suggested  My figures would be 4-1/2 to  8-1/2 percent for M1 and 5-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M2  And I would want to widen the federal  funds range to 6-1/4 to 7-1/4 percent or--to use Governor Lilly’s decimal system--to 6250 to 7250      That’s right  And I would interpret this asymmetrically, as Governor Wallich   suggested, in that I would move up to 7 percent if it appears that the aggregates are moving beyond  the midpoints  But from the standpoint of the international situation and also the past overshoots in  M1 in particular, I would not want to move down below 6750  And I would favor an aggregates  directive and, if we can do anything about it, raising the Regulation Q ceiling by 50    "
644,1978-02-28,BLACK,"  Why don=t the banks report the earnings--the interest they pay on these--to the   IRS?     How do they get away with that?         2/28/78           27   If he did it, it would be prudence; if you did it, it would be cowardice!     Mr Chairman, in your statement a while ago [you said that] if we don=t fight   inflation, who will, [and that] I think provides a pretty good backdrop for this  I share what I think  [are the views of] everyone else here on GNP and inflation and inflationary expectations and that  the accompanying low level of confidence probably poses the biggest threat to the continuation of  expansion  So I think it=s important that we give some kind of reassurance to the business and  financial community here and abroad that we have some intention of trying to prevent any  escalation of inflationary pressures  I think it=s particularly important as the year develops, of  course, that we avoid a repetition of what I now think in retrospect has been an overly rapid  expansion in all three of the aggregates      Getting down to the brass tacks, I would knock a percentage point off both ends of the range   for M3 and 1/2 percentage point off the top end of the M2 range  My economic sense tells me that  we probably ought to knock 1/2 point off the top of M1, but my sense of prudence tells me it=s  probably best to just leave that where it is      What is a normal time frame for the Board=s consideration of an issue like this   one?     Just so they find it compatible     In light of our earlier conversation, I=d say they have been prudent  And now   you think they ought to be courageous?       2/28/78           43     You=re going to have to do more explaining to Congress probably, in spite of   its wisdom     Steve Axilrod has reminded us all that we are approaching a pretty difficult   period if we=re trying to project the aggregates  And this year the [tax] refunds are expected to be  larger and a larger percentage is expected to be paid in March, so I would share Governor  Coldwell=s idea about the prognostication for the March growth in M1  I think it=s probably going  to be right much above the 71 percent that the staff is now projecting  And certainly April, as  Steve indicated very well, is likely to be pretty strong  If we=re going to move toward a money  market directive which I think is probably the best thing to do right now, though I don=t like it in  general, then I would want to pare those figures for the aggregates ranges down from what we=ve  got here in alternative B   [I say that] because, if you=ve got a 6 percent upper [limit] and we don=t  move the federal funds rate until we are approaching or moving beyond the limits, with M1 having  declined 04 percent in February, you could have a 124 percent increase in March [before the  funds rate is moved] and I think that is too fast  And with the 8-1/2 percent ceiling on M2, [its  growth] would also need to be in the range of 12 percent  So I would want to pare those down to 0  to 4 and 3 to 7  If you went for the aggregates directive, I think these ranges would be perfectly  acceptable and ordinarily that is what I would prefer  But these are unusual times, so once more I  would go with the money market directive despite my reluctance to do so      Taking no aggregates--without any ranges?     Yes, it does     That=s a good statement, except I think your figure is a little too high  But it=s   good thinking   "
687,1978-03-21,BLACK,"  Was that with or without duress?     I wondered if I might ask Alan  Do you have in mind a particular change in   the net open position that would do the trick, Alan?  I believe we’ve talked about this at length and  I know a lot of people have worked on a definition and encountered the difficulty that Henry  described      Maybe just a gratuitous comment  The Treasury is rather concerned about   possible losses and I would say that we as a central bank are subject to more criticism in terms of  the amount of losses than they are because constitutionally the Administration has more  responsibility in the foreign area than we do  [Unintelligible]      But our critics will not mention that at the time [they occur]     Mr Chairman, I think one of the things members of Congress are apt to do   is to try to get us publicly at odds with one another  There are a lot of differences of opinion as to  who ought to do the testifying  My feeling is that to the extent possible you ought to do it on this  kind of matter  If [these Congressional Committees] end up with a lot of different opinions, they  are going to ask different ones among us to come and express those opinions and they are going to  play us off against one another, which I think would be a catastrophe      That’s very advisable     Mr Chairman, my statement is distinguished only in that I’ve got slightly   different figures     I can find all the figures I have in mind, but not in exactly this combination   I would lean toward an aggregates directive and I would prefer a funds range of 6-1/2 to 7-1/4   And if we do that, then I think M1 might appropriately be set at a range of 4 to 8 and M2 at a range  of 5 to 9  If we settle on a money market directive, I would want to [lower] those ranges since the  trigger point is somewhat different under the money market directive--that is, we don’t react until  we are approaching or moving beyond the upper limits  So I would want the M1 range there to be  [4] points, 3 to 7 percent and 4 to 8 [on M2] with 6-1/2 to 7 on the federal funds range      You have no comment or none you would like to make?    "
712,1978-04-18,BLACK,"  Mr Chairman, I have a good deal of sympathy for what Ernie has proposed  and yet at the present time, I would have to side with the Subcommittee on the Directive on this  I  think what comes through on both sides is that we haven’t done very well in hitting our 1-year  targets  And I think that is the thing we really ought to zero in on at this particular point  My  personal view is that we are never going to do that unless we widen the federal funds ranges or  unless we adopt some kind of reserve operating target  I would like to see us focus more on that  sort of thing and really do what we want to do  I think we were all fooled last year  We thought we  were going to ease down the rate of growth in the aggregates and we got a faster rate of growth  than the year before--and that year was faster than the previous year  This was a surprise to people  who were genuinely trying to do something different  I just think our methods of operation really  need a serious reappraisal      I don’t really have anything, Mr Chairman  We are fairly close [to the staff’s  projection] except that we too believe, as Governor Coldwell suggested earlier, that there will be  less regular increases and [perhaps] a little more inflation, but all these things have been mentioned      Mr Chairman, my intellectual preference would be to go right down the line  on alternative B  It would seem to me that the reduction in the limits on M3 would be a logical  fallout of the updrift in interest rates we are likely to have if we continue our program of gradually  lowering the aggregate targets in the long run  And it serves as an important reminder that we are  still interested in fighting inflation  But I [understand] the points that you and Paul Volcker made  very well comparatively early in our discussion--that it probably isn’t worth the hassle to lower M3  and that we can probably handle things with the current range--so I believe I would go ahead and  stick with that  But I think we ought to recognize that these ranges are predicated on the  assumption that there will be an increase in Reg Q and if that doesn’t happen, we may not have as  much growth as we are saying here      Mr Chairman, I would continue exactly as you have done in the past  I think  they will try to play us off against each other      Mr Chairman, my governing principle is what we said earlier  In light of the  consensus that we need to get back within the targets, I think we need to take some tightening  action  I remember quite well last year that we were faced with a tremendous bulge in the  aggregates in April and we thought it was temporary and would be washed out  It did not get  washed out as well as we would have liked it to have been washed out  So when we ended the  year, we had pumped out more money than any of us thought we really should have  I don’t think  that was appropriate last year and it would probably be even less appropriate this year  So, I come  down on this a little bit harder than anyone has so far  I would set the specifications for M1 at 3 to  7 percent        That involves, with an aggregates directive, our beginning to move up from  the [6-3/4] percent  We think we are going to have a reversal in May, which we may not have, of  course  On M2, I would want to go 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 and for the federal funds rate 6-1/2 to 7-1/2 with  an asymmetrical midpoint of 6-3/4  We would strongly urge an aggregates directive  We wouldn’t  want to support a money market directive at this time and we don’t think a half point spread is  enough for an aggregates directive  These specifications, of course, are not anywhere near what the  staff has come up with  But we think that ours, on balance, involve a lot less risk of a repeat of last  year’s performance  And if we are wrong, then we believe the error can be corrected pretty quickly  and easily by retreating to a lower federal funds rate at the May meeting  If the staff is wrong,  resulting in excess growth in the aggregates, it may be much harder to correct  On the other point  that was made by the staff on the wording of the directive--on page 2 in that footnote--I think that  would be a desirable change to make  The only thing I would suggest that is different would be to  leave out the word “help” in the third line from the bottom      There is a psychiatrist with us!      Could I have one point of clarification?  Is it understood that we would go  promptly to 7 percent?     SPEAKER(?)  Yes      That was my suggestion, Mr Chairman, but--    "
736,1978-05-05,BLACK,"  Mr Chairman, I think you have made a good case, and Chuck has reinforced  it  [Unintelligible] done the same thing, but it looks to me as if all these options that we face at this  juncture are pretty risky  In view of the recent behavior of the price indexes, though, I really feel  that failure to act pretty decisively in the face of growing evidence that the strength in the economy  is burgeoning and that monetary growth rates and inflation are accelerating might be to some  people the most dangerous [scourge] of all  Mark Willes stated my case and his position  eloquently as well as [unintelligible]  I would be inclined to go ahead  I think there is a real  incentive for banks to go out and [extend] credit on the basis of reserves that they didn’t have  expectations [unintelligible]    "
751,1978-05-16,BLACK,"  Jim, I was impressed that right after the first-quarter GNP figures appeared  there was an unusually strong statistic for March  I was just wondering what odds you would put  on an upward revision of that [Q1 GNP] from an actual decline to a positive figure      Mr Chairman, I think one can make a reasonable case for any of these  scenarios that have been painted around this table  I think the crucial issue is what happens to  inflation and inflationary expectations  We are riding a crest now [where it] seems that everybody  thinks that the Administration, Congress, and the Federal Reserve are all committed to fighting  inflation as a primary target  I think it would be very unfortunate if they shifted their [beliefs] to  something else; I think that could be extremely risky  I would be especially concerned if the  foreigners were to reach such a conclusion--that we had shifted away from this primary emphasis-- because this would lead to a weakened dollar, strong outflows of money, and probably rising  interest rates  I think it could [unintelligible] and also give us a pretty [hefty] burst of inflation      Two wrongs don’t make a right      Mr Chairman, I again end up closer to Mark Willes than anyone else,  although I’m not exactly at the same point  I do think there are a couple reasons why we might not  get as much growth in M1 as we may have been assuming  Our work with the aggregates, for what  it may be worth, suggested that there may be more of a reversal in June than in May--[more] than  the staff [shows]  And I think that we ought to bear in mind that we have had a pretty significant  deceleration in M2  If you take out of M2 the large non-negotiable CDs that are in there, we’ve  had even more [deceleration] so that’s one we don’t want to see decelerate too much  But having  said all this, I still think the way M1 has gone that we ought to move up  My specific figures come  out to be for the federal funds range 7-1/4 to 8 with a midpoint of 7-5/8 to which I would want to  move right away and for M2, 4 to 8--Chuck is going to throw up his hands in horror at this again  but I’m thinking along the same lines as Phil Jackson--and for M1, 1 to 5 percent  And Chuck, if  you trigger that one, you go 1 percentage point past the midpoint and that would still give you  8-3/4 if you average the three rates in M1 for [unintelligible]         No, not necessarily      I do have one technical point--and I hate to prolong this--but it says here that  the Manager shall be guided mainly by the relationship between the latest estimates of the  aggregates M1 and M2 and “the following ranges…”  But when we use a money market directive  we have a different trigger point  When we have a monetary aggregates [directive, the Manager]  acts when [money growth] deviates significantly from the midpoints of the indicated ranges  When  we have a money market formulation, it’s when growth appears to be approaching or moving  beyond the limits  I think we could take [care] of that very easily by inserting in there “the  midpoints” of the following ranges or “the upper and lower limits” of the following ranges   Otherwise, I think we act at the same trigger point      Well, if you use an aggregates directive it would be the midpoints of the  [following] ranges, and if you use a money market it would be the upper and lower limits      Yes, I would criticize our earlier discussion for that ambiguity, Steve  I  thought that was one issue we didn’t settle, and that’s one reason why Chuck and I see it so  differently on the appropriate ranges  I see a different trigger point than he does    "
779,1978-06-20,BLACK,"  I just had in mind a question, Mr Chairman  Jim, were there any  significant revisions in the GNP figure or just minor ones?      Mr Chairman, I share some of the apprehensions that both Phil and Chuck  have expressed about what I perceive to be some surge in speculation  If you look at the  Redbook, you get a pretty clear indication there of accelerating inflation, increasing demands for  credit of all types, pressure on interest rates, tightening labor markets, scarcity of certain skilled  labor, developing shortages in some commodity markets, stepped up demand for capital  equipment, and a worsening balance of trade which frequently occurs before you do have a  downturn  Having said that, I don=t see the inventory excesses yet  I know those figures are  notoriously bad, and a strong increase in business loan demand suggests to me that there may be  more building of inventories than the figures now show  But absent further evidence of that, I  think I would come out fairly near where the staff has come out, although I don=t think it is  beyond the realm of possibility that [activity] could drop off before then  I would be a tad higher  on prices and I would not expect much change in the unemployment rate      Mr Chairman, I asked Art Broida if he would distribute a table here which I  think brings into focus the major problem as I perceive it  It=s not a very complicated table, and I  think we=re all aware of what it says  But it does go back to the first period when we set our target  ranges a year ahead, back in March of 1975  And it goes on to the last one that=s completely filled  in--the one that we have projected for the current quarter, the second quarter of ’78  If you look at  this table, you can see very quickly that M2 as of late has been doing pretty reasonably, I think to a  large extent because of Reg Q  But look at the performance on M1 for the last 3 complete periods  and it looks pretty lousy and the projection for the period ending this quarter is worse  I think this  has certainly increased inflationary pressures on the economy and I think it has done real damage to  our credibility     There are several ways to deal with this  What I=m really suggesting is somewhat along the  lines of what Phil Coldwell suggested and also what John Balles was saying  I would propose to  deal with this mostly in the next quarter  Specifically, I have in mind trying to get this last line, the  third quarter of ’77 to the third quarter of ’78 down a little bit more toward the top of our target  I     6/20/78                34  think it=s foolhardy to suppose that we could get it there, and I=d take 73 as what I hope it comes out  to be  That=s 08 percentage point above the top of our range and this would imply third-quarter  growth at 56 percent, if we hit it, and 77 percent when you compare the third quarter to the first  quarter  Now, if you assume that the monthly pattern of June and July is something like we have  had in the past, a rate of about 52 percent would be consistent with that  So I would think of an M1  range of 2 to 6 percent and M2 of 4 to 8  I=d like to emphasize that this is in the spirit in which you  said last time that these ranges should be viewed, Mr Chairman  I don=t expect that we=ll hit these  [ranges], but I would expect, as others have, that this would [result in] some upward movement in  the federal funds rate through our failure to achieve them  So far as the federal funds rate is  concerned, I would think a range of 7-1/2 to 8-1/4 would probably be about right, with an  asymmetrical midpoint of 7-3/4 and the Desk moving soon--if we wait a day or so, I wouldn=t  object--right to 7-3/4 and going as high as 8 without checking back with the Committee     I might add that I realize, as Dave Eastburn pointed out, that there are risks in doing this, but as  he also pointed out there are risks in the other direction, too  The choice is either a risk of a  relatively mild recession in the near future versus a more serious recession down the road  So I  would opt for this sort of approach in the period right ahead  And so far as the form of the directive  is concerned, I think the change you suggested last time was excellent and in fact made a  [difference]  To me that really dealt sufficiently with the problem that you wanted to deal with  The  new formulation goes beyond that to me, emphasizing money market conditions to the exclusion of  the aggregates as trigger points for action, and I would prefer to leave it just like what we ended up  with the last time      “Somewhat” in the direction      I=m not sure the question was clear to some      Maybe that=s part of the plan      One minor thought, Mr Chairman      John, would it be safe if you transmitted the wire over the facsimile--over the  land lines rather than over the Federal Reserve communication network?    "
808,1978-07-18,BLACK,"  Mr Chairman, at this point I have to declare my sympathy with Barry  Bosworth’s observation the other day that it is very difficult to distinguish between a forecast and a  prayer these days  I think the real outcome is pretty well indicated by the degree of inflation that  we end up with, and I can’t help but echo the remarks of Mark Willes about this  They struck a  very sympathetic cord  We don’t disagree strongly with the profile of the Greenbook for the  balance of this year, but we do believe the staff is a little low on the inflation side  And when we  go to the longer run, we would become considerably less optimistic than they are on that end We  think the underlying rate of inflation is about the 72 percent or so that they are talking about and  we think it will probably accelerate to 8 percent or so as we move into the next year      No  Well, I guess it’s pretty close to it  But if this is the case, then I think we  will see more disorder in the foreign exchange markets and we will see further sizable increases in  interest rates and a correspondent deterioration in business and consumer confidence  And if this is  the case, then I certainly would [forecast] lower real GNP growth than they are projecting and my     7/18/78              16  best guess would be that we would slip into a recession early next year  So when you get down to  the specific figures, I would like to emphasize the prayer part on this  I come out at 3 percent on  the real GNP and [for the deflator] pretty close to 8 percent--maybe 7-3/4 to show my sense of  moderation, Chuck, on that  And if we do succeed in getting away with only a growth recession,  I’d say 6 to 6-1/2 percent on unemployment  I’m not sure it will be that favorable if inflation gets  away from us  I think it could become worse than that  If you want some spurious accuracy, I’ll  put 62 in there      Mr Chairman, I distributed a table similar to the one that I did the last time  which I was also pleased to see was quite similar to the one Bill Poole prepared for Frank  It is a  tribute since I very much admire your work  To get down to it very quickly, I would propose that  we try to work the rates of increase over the yearly period down from the 79 we had in the quarter  just ended to 75, then to 7, and then down to 68 and then 64  That is about 3/8s of a percentage  point drop [for each quarter]  That is certainly gradual, but it’s certainly a perceptible move  At  the same time, I don’t think anybody could accuse us of slamming on the brakes  And if we follow  this course with M1, I think we can do the same sort of thing with M2  So on this basis, we would  recommend leaving the M1 range unchanged, but I think we probably ought to announce publicly  that we expect the rate of growth in M1 to be coming in near the top of the range or maybe even  above the top of the range for a while  This approach would keep us from having all the  unfavorable effects that Henry described in announcing a change in the range and at the same time  make it possible for us to counter either the charge that we intend to tighten too sharply--because I  don’t think this is too sharp a tightening--or that the target is so low that we don’t have any  intentions of hitting it  As you will notice in this last line, we do come down to [a growth rate of]  64  So I would leave them all unchanged  I’d rather work toward hitting them      Mr Chairman, I would go for 4 to 8 on M1 and 5-1/2 to 9-1/2 on M2  I’d  adopt the federal funds range for alternative C, move immediately to 8 percent, and use an  aggregates directive    "
860,1978-09-19,BLACK,"  Given the recent behavior of the aggregates, the social security and   minimum wage increases scheduled for the first of the year, the likelihood of strikes that Phil  Jackson mentioned, the bottlenecks that Ernie mentioned, and wage/price pressures, I think the  staff may be a little low on inflation  I think 8 percent would be a little closer  I think the rate of  real growth is apt to be more like 2 to 3 percent, and I would not rule out the possibility of a mild  recession beginning sometime next year  And if so, then unemployment might be in the  neighborhood of 65 percent      Mr Chairman, I find the recent behavior of the aggregates very disturbing   It seems to me that we are repeating experiences we had back in ’76 and ’77 when, despite our  vowed intention of bringing about a gradual deceleration in the aggregates, we acquiesced-- inadvertently to be sure--in letting the aggregates accelerate  I think some of those past mistakes  have come back to haunt us now in the form of a lot of inflation, which we're experiencing this  year  The problem all three years, as I see it, lies in our inability to predict the level of money  demand on the basis of the given federal funds rate  The proper solution, I think, has to be to move  relatively more toward some kind of reserve target rather than a federal funds rate  I realize we  can't debate that here and now but I believe we're going to have continuing problems hitting the  aggregates unless we move in that general direction      Now, despite these long [held] doubts of mine about the operating procedures, I've been   hopeful that we were making some progress toward a gradual deceleration but these revisions of  the aggregates shattered those hopes  Even the pleasure that I got out of the downward revision in  the M2 series was more than offset by the acceleration in August and the projected acceleration in  September      So in short, I feel that we ought to make some further move to slow the aggregates  I would   favor the “B” specifications on the federal funds range; I would cut the limits on M1 [to] 4 to 8,  recognizing as Mark and Chuck did, that this would trigger upward movement in the rates  [I’d  set] M2 at 5 to 9 I would favor an aggregates directive and I would move promptly to 8-1/2    "
885,1978-10-17,BLACK,"  Mr Chairman, my view on the long-run economic outlook, like the staff's,  has really not changed a great deal since last time  It's somewhat tempting when you see the  strength that we've got in residential construction and business fixed investment, and also the  pickup in retail sales, to think that things may be a little bit better  But then when the producer  price index comes in at a double-digit rate, I get quite discouraged  I think the main factor in the  long-term outlook is going to be expected and actual rates of inflation     As I indicated last month, if the Administration comes up with something that is perceived to  be rather effective--including dealing with a reduction in the deficit--and if we're effective in  getting the aggregates under control, then I think we might get growth of 2 to 3 percent in real GNP  by the third quarter of next year  I would hope that we could also keep the rate of the business  fixed-weight price index below 8 percent  And I think the unemployment rate might be around  6-1/4  If we are not successful in dealing with inflation, because we don't handle our monetary  policy as well as we might or the Administration doesn't do as much as it might on the fiscal, then I  think we could have inflation coming in at a higher rate and in that case I would expect a lower rate  of real GNP and a higher unemployment rate      Mr Chairman, I share the temptation of most people to use a money market  directive  But I don't really like money market directives, even though there's a lot of uncertainty  now, because I believe there would be a lot of uncertainty next time and if we do it this time, we  may do it again  Despite that, I would go ahead and change--      Rise above principle?  No, I'm not really going to do that  I'm going to stick  with principle and say that I'd really rather go with an aggregates directive, although I don't object  to anybody else feeling the other way  The problem I have is that the short-run ranges to me don't  really tie in very well with our long-run targets  I’ve distributed a couple of times before a table  that shows the rates of growth in M1 and M2 for successive yearly periods  For example, for the  third quarter of ’77 to the third quarter of ’78, as Steve pointed out, the money supply narrowly  defined grew by 8 percent  If in fact we have the amount of growth in M1 projected by the staff,  for the period between the fourth quarter of ’77 and the fourth quarter of ’78--if you take the  November figures as a good proxy for the fourth quarter--the rate of growth would be 92 versus  the 8 percent And I think we need to work down gradually from the 8 percent     And when you go to M2, the last figure we have would be for the third quarter of ’77 to the  third quarter of ’78, and that comes out at 82  If you let the November projection be a proxy for  the fourth quarter--the fourth quarter of ’77 to the fourth quarter of ’78 would be 85  So what I'm  really saying is that I think the short-term objectives, or targets, or whatever you want to call them,  are too high if we're to make any progress currently in moving down to a slower rate of growth  over time  And I would hope that in a couple of years or so they could be down  So I would want  to set those a good deal lower than that  I was hopeful that we might be able to get down as low as  7-1/2 for this yearly period, and this would call for practically no growth in M1 if we have the  automatic transfers        10/17/78 49                So, using the aggregates directive, I would say -2 to +2 [for M1]  M1+ comes out to 2 to 6  and M2 to 3 to 7  I would use the federal funds range in alternative 2, 8-3/4 to 9-1/2 percent, and  I'd edge it on up to 9 now    "
913,1978-11-21,BLACK,"  Mr Chairman, is this third quarter to third quarter?       11/21/78              13    Well, Mr Chairman, I feel that we are not going to be able to accomplish as  much on the inflation front as would be desirable, so I think there's going to be less strength than  other people do and that a recession is likely  Along with this, of course, there will be more  unemployment  I've already indicated that I think real GNP might be 1 percent to 2 percent  I  think unemployment might be in the neighborhood of 6-1/2 to 7 percent and the inflation rate at  7-1/2 to 9 percent      Did you round off whole numbers or was there a margin on either side?     SPEAKER(?)  Was that exactly 29 percent or did you round that?     11/21/78              20      Mr Chairman, my position is fairly close to that of Mr Willes and Mr  Balles  It's very important that we don't flash a signal now that we are not backing up what we did  on November 1  And as I look at the figures that have been provided by the staff, even on the  toughest one, alternative B, that still provides really no improvement over a longer period of time   So I think we ought to set even lower figures on the aggregates than they have there  For  arithmetic reasons that I won't go into now, I come out with -1 to 3 on M1, 5 to 9 on M2, and I'd  rather leave M1+ out of it  A federal funds range set as in alternative B sounds fine to me, but for  the reasons that Scott Pardee mentioned in his presentation, I would go on to 10 percent now  The  market has been [disappointed] that we backed off from that; they thought we were there  And I  think that will reinforce their feeling that we really mean business  But I would sit there until the  aggregates dictate that we should go beyond that    "
939,1978-12-19,BLACK," What are the implications of that for monetary policy, Peter?      Mr Chairman, we were a bit surprised by the strength in the fourth quarter   I don’t think it has really altered our overall picture of next year except to push a little further in the  future the weakness we thought might occur somewhere around the second or third quarter  As far  as the year as a whole is concerned, we still hold our early forecast of the rate of growth in real  GNP of 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 percent  We are still less optimistic than the staff regarding inflation and we  put that somewhere in the neighborhood of 8 to 9 percent  We would also come out ahead in our  own [forecast] on the unemployment rate at the end of the year, putting it at about 65 and maybe a  little bit higher than that      Now, for the approach to the policy decision, we follow this procedure that we have been  using for some time that I described in that memo we distributed to you  In using this, we  recognize that there has been a lot of weakness or slowdown in the growth of the aggregates  recently, which is very encouraging  But I think we have to bear in mind that these are low partly  because of the effects of ATS  They also may be low for the reason Steve stated--that there may be  a downward shift in the demand for money relative to GNP  And we also have to bear in mind that  they are built upon this very rapid rate of growth in M1 early in the year      So with these points in mind, we continue to think that our main objective should be to try  to bring down the long-term rate of growth in M1 somewhat gradually  We described the strategy  that we’ve been following in that memorandum of mine  This calls for a rate of growth in the year  ending the third quarter of last year of 8 percent and in the fourth quarter of this year of 75 percent,     12/19/78          20    which incidentally looks like exactly what we’ll get  The implied deceleration reflected the  relatively slower [unintelligible]  Let me move on to the first quarter  We had suggested that it  come out at 7 percent and we think looking back to the first quarter of last year maybe that’s too  much deceleration, so we raised that to 7-1/4 percent      Yes, year-over-year      That’s right  To take care of it, we raised this from the 7 percent we had to  7-1/4 percent  But even with this adjustment, we have a path of the implied growth rate in  December-January of 4-1/2 percent  Against this background, the rates of growth that are the  trigger points in the Bluebook are too high for us  Alternative A calls for 7-1/2 under a money  market directive and alternative B calls for 7 percent  And if you put back in the effect of ATS,  that means that we’re willing to accept double-digit rates of growth on an old basis before we  actually act  So translating that into measurements that we would use, we would favor an  aggregates directive and we would put the range for growth of M1 at 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent  We  would really rather not specify at this juncture a rate of growth in M1+ and M2 because at this  stage of the cycle typically we have a slowing in these, and I think it could lull us into a sense of  safety and prevent our reacting in case we do get an excessive rate of growth in M1  Turning to the  fed funds rate, we would [prefer] 9-7/8 to 10-1/2 with a highly asymmetrical midpoint of 9-7/8  It  is a little further on the midpoint than anyone else has suggested     It’s quite asymmetrical  But seriously, we don’t foresee any circumstances  that would suggest we ought to lower the rate below that, particularly in view of [the current]  situation and the recent OPEC price action  But we do want leeway to move that rate up in case the  M1 does go beyond 4-1/2 percent  Now, we really don’t expect this  Our guess is that we could sit  right where we are and the aggregates will come in at this lower rate  So we would anticipate  remaining about where we are, but we’d like to move in case we are wrong in that        To put it in slightly different terms, the base drift would become more overt  and less covert       Mr Chairman, could I [ask] whether we could consider changing the May  meeting to the 30th?  You have seven weeks between the May and July meetings and five weeks  between the May and April meetings       I’d rather go to six and six       Won’t most people observe Memorial Day on the 28th?        We have Confederate Memorial Day in Virginia        12/19/78          49       Mr Chairman, there is just one element of unhappiness about Memorial  Day  I don’t know if anybody observes Memorial Day on--       You’ll just not have as good input from me if you have it on that day       Not a hangover, but I’ve got some complications       We don’t observe it except in spirit; we don’t actually leave the Bank  And  there is logic to making these intervals six weeks instead of five and seven  I wouldn’t have  brought it up if there wasn’t       I think we ought to go ahead and say that because they are going to be  waiting for the policy record three days later       I am prepared to move in either direction; it’s that particular time that  causes me a problem         I was just going to say that I agree the committee didn’t have time to  address this  But I would hope that it would continue to push on and address it not so much as a  target but as an operating variable in lieu of, or in combination with, the fed funds rate           I know it is  But there’s a substantial volume of opinion that this will be a  better way to [operate] and I think we need to explore it       Well, I think this addresses many of the same questions       And I really prefer this method of doing it  The reason I couched it in the  form we had it before is that that’s the way we’ve been discussing it       Oh, yes     12/19/78          69         In Larry’s case, the mechanistic tying of the short-term [growth] rates with  the long-term rates did not bother me quite as much because I do think it will force out into the  open a more conscious consideration [of the] relationship    [Secretary’s note The raw transcript ended at this point  It seems likely that the meeting ended  here, but there may have been additional discussion]      "
967,1979-02-06,BLACK," Scott, suppose we only had continued weakness in  the aggregates and we edged the fed funds rate down Do you think we  would still get the kind of reaction you are talking about?   But I was really asking, other things equal,  would the market think [weak money growth] was sufficient reason for  our lowering the federal funds rate?   Our assessment of the economy pretty much  parallels what I think Paul Volcker was saying We come out with  about the same growth in real GNP as the Board staff but we feel that  the inflation rate is going to be above the staff’s estimate We  expect the rate for the full year to run somewhere around 8-1/2 to 9  percent So far as the economy for the year is concerned, I have a  lot of sympathy with the views expressed by both Chuck and Nancy I  can’t view with equanimity even the lower inflation rate that is  forecast by the staff because with that kind of rate it seems to me  that the economy is bound to develop excesses either domestically or  internationally that might well tip it downward But for the time  being I come back to Paul’s original statement that inflation is the  main problem at the moment So we would advocate the same policy that  we‘ve been suggesting for the last several meetings of a gradual  deceleration in the rate of growth in the aggregates We have couched  this more in terms of M1 and would suggest edging the growth of M1  down in the four quarters ending in each quarter of the year And for  the fourth quarter of last year we had hoped M1 growth would be down  to 7 - l / 2  percent before adjusting for ATS accounts and about 72  percent after As luck would have it, we ended up almost exactly at  that point   Well, an accident really But we would now  suggest that for the fourth quarter of ‘78 to the fourth quarter of  ‘ 7 9 ,  we ought to be thinking in terms of 6 percent [Ml growth1 before  ATS Of course, the question of what we really want depends on the  estimate of what ATS accounts will do We think the staff is about  right with its estimate of a 3 to 3-1/2 percent [effect on that  growth] rate, so we would favor about a 3 percent midpoint [in the  range] for growth in Ml This leads us to favor the range under  alternative B of 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent We have a lot more trouble  with M2 because there is so much uncertainty surrounding it, as has  been mentioned by several people The growth in money market funds  may be the main factor at work here, but we have [uncertainties  regarding] unit trust accounts, C D s ,  Eurodollars, money market C D s   [at] S&Ls, and Treasury bills All these things make this very  difficult to figure out But we think M2 clearly ought to come down  and we can’t think of anything better than what the staff has put  down, so we would buy the 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent M2 range in “B” We  would also buy the staff’s “B“ ranges on M3 and bank credit   Mr Chairman, I was just going to ask for some  clarification and maybe offer an alternative solution If I  understood what Steve was saying, we would treat it on the down side  as a money market directive; that is, we would ease the funds rate  down if the rate of growth in the aggregates came in below 4 percent  Now, at the top, if we used a money market directive, that would not  trigger [action] until [Ml growth reached1 9 percent But if we  treated that as if it were an aggregates directive, the midpoint would  be 6-1/2 percent and it would trigger action at 7-1/2 percent So as  an alternative, it seems to me that if we took a straight money market  directive, using 4 to 7-1/2 percent [for the M1 range], we wouldn't  have to think about treating it asymmetrically Action would be  triggered at the top and the lower points at the two extremes   M r   Chairman, Mark has said that he would go for  a money market directive and I dislike them as much as he does But  to me something like 4 or 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent would make sense, so  that we wouldn‘t let the aggregate fall below 4 or 4-1/2 percent  without doing something about it I think that’s really the crucial  issue on the low end at this time If they should grow at 1-1/2  percent, in view of the [recent] weakness we would still be pretty  much around that 3 percent long-run growth path that we projected; in  fact we wouldn’t be up to the midpoint   Did you specify a range or not?   M r   Chairman, could I just ask if we shouldn't  elaborate beyond ATS and also mention money market funds? That has  been a very powerful force  "
994,1979-03-20,BLACK," How far do you want to take this, Mr Chairman--  up to the point of giving specifications?   Right, short of specifications   Mr Chairman, I come out somewhat less optimistic  than the staff Like many, we've been impressed by the strength we've  had in the economy It has been much greater up until now, as far as  the statistics show, than we had expected But I'm becoming  increasingly concerned by the appearance of scattered signs that we  frequently do see before a major downturn The Redbook mentioned a  number of these, [including] a lengthening of delivery times, high  capacity utilization, tight supplies in the market for skilled labor,     3 / 2 0 / 1 9  -13-   and the inventory figures The last inventory figure, though partly  explainable, coupled with an apparently heavy shift toward short-term  borrowing on the part of businesses is certainly the sort of thing one  might expect And I'm especially concerned about the probability that  in view of the petroleum situation we'll have some spawning of a  general shortage psychology, which will lead to inventory buildups and  probably heavy demands for short-term credit And that will make it  pretty difficult to keep M1 under control without pushing interest  rates up rather high Coupling this with the latest price data and  the impending labor negotiations, I have to rate the possibility of  stagflation or worse as pretty high So my figures would come out  lower than the staff's, somewhere in the neighborhood of what Chuck  Partee said   Turning to the policy question, I think we have a difficult  choice this morning The weakness in the aggregates has persisted for  about five months and this weakness has been a source of increasing  concern to many of us, both within and [outside] the System It seems  to me that one could make a pretty good case for some easing this  morning But on the other side of the coin, there are three reasons  why maybe we ought not take any action this morning One, of course,  is that we really don't know what those aggregates are saying We,  like so many others--John Balles and Dave Eastburn as well as Steve  Axilrod--have tried to see what we could do by adding back in the  things that might have been reducing the aggregates And some of the  arguments that people have made don't seem to us to hold water But I  don't think we can rule out the possibility, indeed the probability,  that there has been a downward shift in the demand for money If so,  that's an important reason for not doing anything at this particular  time The second point is that historically we often have had a burst  in the aggregates in April because of faulty seasonal adjustments, and  I don't think we can rule that out We could also have a temporary  spurt in economic activity And finally, the improvement in the  dollar in the foreign exchange markets has been so fragile that I  think any reversal of policy now could certainly jeopardize that  That gets me to the point where we work on [the specifics of] policy,  and I won't say anything about that until after the break   Mr Chairman, I guess it’s most accurate to say  that I want a foot in each bed I’m worried about both inflation and  recession I‘m worried about what a recession might do in speeding up  inflation later by causing us to throw in all our chips So I think  we have to be sensitive to both concerns in reaching a policy decision  and I believe we ought to let the behavior of the aggregates guide  what we do in the weeks just ahead We [at the Richmond Federal  Reserve Bank] tend to do that more than perhaps most people around the  table I believe we could do this pretty well with alternative B  coupled with an aggregates directive As I read this, that would give  us a midpoint [on M11 of 6-1/2 percent and would trigger some action  to lower the federal funds rate if the aggregate came in at 5-1/2  percent or lower Growth at that rate would mean--if we look at this  on a 3-month moving average basis, which is the way we like to do it--  no further deviation of M1 from the path that we’ve set from the  fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of this year; it  would continue to be about as much below the path as it has been For  a change, I‘m less concerned on the up side and wouldn’t be bothered  if we hit a 9 or 9-l/2 percent rate of growth in M1 I suppose what I  said is tantamount to saying I want an aggregates directive on the  bottom and a money market directive on the top The M2 range in  alternative B would suit me fine, but I have even less faith in that  than in M1 because I think the tightening of money has depressed M2  more The money market funds have been coming mostly out of M2, I     3/20/79 -27-   think, rather than M1 So far as the federal funds range is  concerned, I would prefer to see that stay at 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent   That would be ""B"" I'd buy those specifications   It averages Out to 9-314   I would go along with it, Mr Chairman I would  like to point out that with the 4 to 8 percent M1 range and a money  market [directive], we would not do anything until we got a rate as  low as 4 percent on M1 I'd rather see that [trigger] a little  higher, but I can live with it If one looks at those charts, that's  not--   It's a tick up, but I'd go with it   It changes the trigger point   M R   MAYO Yes, but not much   Is this with a money market directive?  "
1020,1979-04-17,BLACK," Alan, what do you think the reaction would be in  exchange markets if the aggregates should come in weak and we nudged  the federal funds rate down a little?   You think they would pay more attention to the  federal funds rate, though, than the behavior of the aggregates?   There has to be one in every group! I have more  doubts than usual about the staff's forecast, which is really one of  stagflation for eight or so quarters I don't deny that there's a  possibility that can happen, but to me the weight of past evidence  suggests that we're more likely to get cumulative effects and slip  into a recession [than to achieve] the kind of soft landing that the     4/17/79 -13-   staff is projecting My own feeling is that we’re probably near the  end of the current expansion and fairly close to a turning point  Inflation has [contributed to1 a pretty severe attrition, I think, of  real incomes and wealth positions We see some convincing signs of  this in the behavior of consumer and residential outlays Some people  take comfort in the strength that appears to be developing in the  investment sector of business, but that is a lagging indicator and I  don’t think we can take much comfort in that I’m more impressed with  the scattered signs that are reported throughout the Redbook of  lengthening delivery times, of some anticipatory inventory building,  and a strong current preference of businesses for short-term versus  long-term debt When one talks to those in the business community  there is an unusual unanimity in their views They all seem to say  that things are very good now, but they are scared as the devil about  the future I suppose that translates, Steve, into a belief that the  real rate of return on capital is probably dropping   So, I think we’ve arrived at the point in policy where we  have to be seriously concerned about the steepness of the deceleration  that is taking place in the rate of growth in the aggregates Some  slowing of the excessive growth that we experienced in 1976, 1977, and  a good part of 1978 was clearly needed in an effort to have an  effective anti-inflationary policy I hoped we could bring the rate  of expansion down, but at a more gradual rate of perhaps 1 to 1-1/2  percentage points a year I thought it was the best way in which to  wring inflation out of the economy and I still think so But the  deceleration that we’ve experienced since September has not been  gradual Even after allowing for ATS, NOWs, and a likely downward  shift in the demand for money, in my view this has been an overly  steep decline If this is allowed to continue, I think we risk  aggravating any recession that may be impending If my feeling that a  recession is close at hand has any merit at all, then at this stage I  think we have to face up to the question of whether we want to risk  adding to its severity by reacting to the recent inflationary figures  I have doubts about [the wisdom of taking that risk] for two reasons  In the first place, I think we probably will see some abatement in  inflation as a result of the past slowing in the aggregates  Secondly, I’m not at all convinced that a severe recession would add  significantly more to the reduction of inflation than a mild  recession And as a matter of political reality, if the recession is  more serious than it otherwise might be, I think the political system  is such that we’re likely to have the kind of fiscal policy fallout  that will aggravate inflation rather than help   Mr Chairman, given my views of the economy and  how I perceive monetary policy to work, strangely enough, I think all  these aggregates ranges are really too low I'd prefer for M1 a range  of 5 to 9 percent--which would trigger action under a strict monetary  aggregates directive if the rate came in under 6 percent--and perhaps  6 to 10 percent for M2, which would trigger action at I percent I  emphasize that strict monetary aggregates interpretation because I  would not move initially I would sit right where we are until we see  something happening If we adopted these specifications, we might  well see the funds rate move down a little before the next meeting  I'm aware of the risks of that, but it does seem to me that the recent  action proposed on reserve requirements might have at least some  offsetting effect Lest some of my more hawkish friends around the  table think that I'm a late-hatching dove, I would hasten to add that  if I'm fooled on this and the aggregates begin to grow rapidly, I  would be just as quick to move the rate up a little, too But I would  sit still until we got some evidence   Yes, I was   I neglected to say it, M r   Chairman I had 9-314  to 10-1/4 percent, but I could leave it unchanged without much  quarrel, really   It's 9-314 to 10-112 percent, but I wouldn't want  to use the top quarter   We were reasonable; we just weren’t persuasive   Mr Chairman, I think I said the 5 to 9 percent   I don’t want him to get the credit!   I could come down to 4 to 8 percent on M1 M2  doesn’t make a lot of difference to me really   Oh yes, I’d like that even better   I can live with that part of it, but I--   If we have a money market directive, I would want  it that high If we have an aggregates directive, I could go with 3  to 8 percent, I guess   Yes   Four is the lower limit for me   Yes, Mr Chairman, up to that [ $ 2  billion] point  "
1045,1979-04-27,BLACK," Mr Chairman, this looks like another case where the aggregates have  gone through their usual April acrobatics and I don’t think we really ought to be so surprised by it  These deposit shifts that have been incident to the tax payments and refunds seem to defy all our  efforts to get a statistically reliable seasonal factor So I don’t think we ought to attach a great deal  of weight to these April figures, particularly in view of the 7 to 9 points that Steve mentioned a  while ago was the extra [estimated effect] I’d be inclined to wait to see if we get some unwinding  in early May And even if we didn’t, we still wouldn’t have gotten above the 1-112 percent growth  target we set So I think we’re okay at this point and I would hold off   It’s fine with me, Mr Chairman  "
1070,1979-05-22,BLACK," Mr Chairman, most of us don't have as much fat  in our budgets as Chicago does to buy these T-shirts!   M r   Chairman, we have various [developments], all  of which have been mentioned but in slightly different combinations  For some months now we have been fearing that [the economy] might be  near a turning point, and we could argue that conceivably we might  have passed it now We could see a little more weakness in consumer  spending because of attrition in real income and less [strength] in  residential construction This flurry of indicators that we have had,  ending with a decline in new orders that you reported to us, creates  more than just a mere suspicion that the economy has weakened     5/22/19 -24-   significantly So, our guess is that it is right at a turning point  or even beyond it   Now, having said that, I end up in roughly the same position  as Governors Coldwell and Wallich in saying that I think inflation is  still the major policy problem that we have to confront I think it's  good to bear in mind the fact that following the November 1973 turning  point inflation accelerated for some time, credit demand expanded,  there was a lot of upward pressure on interest rates, and M1 grew  fairly rapidly So I think we've got to be concerned about this and,  as Chuck was suggesting a while ago, our objective ought to be to get  the rate of growth in the aggregates down--gradually, but nevertheless  down So far as the discount rate is concerned, M r   Chairman, I  recognize the arguments posed by the current spread [between the  discount rate and the funds rate] I wish that in the past we had  adjusted the discount rate more promptly to keep it more closely in  alignment with the federal funds rate, but we have not done that If  at this particular juncture we are in fact near a turning point, [to  move the discount rate up now] would look rather bad on the record, so  I would not favor it for that reason   Well, it's for unusual reasons; I didn't get  there by the same route he traveled   Yes   I cannot [agree to it], Mr Chairman, if I  interpret it correctly that this would mean we would raise the federal  funds rate if M1 started coming in at 3-112 percent That would be a  tightening If we had a money market directive on the top and an  aggregates directive on the bottom, I could live with it a lot better  I would not want to tighten If we tighten [with growth in M11 at  3-1/2 percent, we don't even approach--   At 6-114 percent, the way I figure it   I would vote against that, Mr Chairman As I  interpret an aggregates directive, this is much tighter on the top  side and it's easy on the down side I'm more concerned about the  weakness in the economy and I wouldn't want to tighten that soon   Mr Chairman, I'd rather cut it in half I worry  about the Constitutional issues on this since the executive branch of  the government clearly has the responsibility in the foreign area  And I worry about the point that Chuck raised about criticism we would  get from taking any losses on this   I'd rather not go this far  "
1118,1979-07-11,BLACK," Mr Chairman, for some months we have felt that a  turning point was near and I think we would buy what seems to be the  consensus forecast, or the assessment that we have passed that point  So far as severity is concerned, I think the developments in the  petroleum market do strongly enhance the possibility that this could  be a worldwide downturn And if this is true, I think our downturn  may well be more severe than the staff is projecting I would also  add to that Frank Morris's fear that the consumer will be another  source of weakness here So, given our inflationary problem and the  recent emergence of the downward pressure on the dollar, we of course  have to be very careful in trying to cope with this downturn In  particular, we have to avoid any conclusion on the part of the markets  here or abroad that we have thrown in the towel on inflation   I would be especially concerned if the downturn did turn out  to be an international [one] I'm remembering back to '15 and ' I 6   when the recovery began and Japan and Germany opted for a slower  recovery than we did and we pumped in more money in late 'I1 and ' 7 8 ;   I think that has exacerbated the problem we have had with the dollar  In a similar situation I think we can count on the Germans, the  Japanese--maybe with a change in government--the British, and the  Canadians too, to exert more restraint in trying to come out of the  recession If that scenario should develop, and if we adopt overly     7/11/79 -25-   vigorous anti-recession policies, we could have a very, very serious  foreign exchange situation   So when we get to the long-run part of [our decision], I  think what Steve has suggested is just about what we view as  appropriate We had slightly different figures in mind We agree  that we ought to adjust the old targets because of the revisions in  the estimates on the ATS and NOW effect Our original thought was  that we would simply accept those specifications for 1979 outlined in  alternative B I say that but I also express the hope that we are not  creating another form of base drift here And if we do get enabling  legislation, I hope that we will be just as quick in reducing those  [adjustments] on the other side   The 1980 targets pose a particular problem because we don‘t  know what the base is, but I think the main effect of those is really  psychological at this point So I think we ought to be very careful  to point out as we explain the ‘79 objectives that they have been  raised because of a mechanical problem and that we have not raised our  targets at all Similarly, I believe it’s important that the ‘80  targets be somewhat lower than those we had for ’79 So our feeling  was that it would be best just to take 1/2 percentage point off the  alternative B specifications for 1980 But, again, we could live with  Steve’s specifications quite well, though I might want to play around  with that 6 percent top on the range he has on M1 People will look  at that and not go beyond it to find the explanation of why it really  represents a 5-1/2 percent midpoint excluding ATS transfers, as  compared with a 6 percent midpoint in ‘79   That's correct   Mr Chairman, as one who advocated adjustment, I  think your plan is really better and I would go along with that     1/11/79 -34-   I think that’s an important consideration, as  Paul pointed out very clearly It also gets to be a consideration, I  think, when we select the range for 1 9 8 0     I would want that [1980 range] on the surface to  appear to be somewhat lower; others wouldn’t, but I would for  psychological reasons I think it could have a very therapeutic  effect on the market   Mr Chairman, we refer to those old rates as pure  rates in Richmond, before we fool around and adjust them   It's not very descriptive, but it's easy to  recognize what we are talking about when we use that term   M R   PARTEE It seems to me you'll do a better job than the  DOW Jones ticker does   Yes   Is this just for '79, M r   Chairman?   Mr Chairman, I don't want to dissent on this and  I wonder if you could throw a few crumbs to those of us who would like  to see some little move toward slowing because of our oft stated  position that we want to get growth of the aggregates down over the  longer run   Well, if we just knock a half point, say, off the  top on each one of those [ranges], I think that would psychologically  give us a big boost in the market We might want to change the ranges  later on, but I would certainly like to see something in that general  direction   But if we did only that, wouldn't people say why  didn't you put the ranges a little lower?   Oh, you're just saying depart from that during  the recession   You know, strange as it may seem, I think we've  decelerated a bit too rapidly, and I wouldn't like to see it  continued I think the market is going to be watching that very  carefully   That's pretty darn fast, really   It's faster than I would like   well, I think maybe we can improve the faulty  procedures of the past and do a little better in hitting what we say  we [want] That's what really deserves criticism rather than the  other, I think   Mr Chairman, could we point out pretty clearly  that we've had a rather rapid deceleration [in the growth of the  aggregates] and that, as you indicated before, maybe we can pause a  little for now? But we still have that goal   If we can show that clearly, I can live with what  you are suggesting, but--   You should say, therefore, that it isn't foolish  inconsistency   M r   Chairman, I guess my preference is based more  on intuition than anything else My inclination is to hold the funds  rate where it is and hope that the aggregates do slow from the  excessive pace that they recorded in June But more than most people  around here, I think our [actions] ought to be guided by the behavior  of the aggregates; that ought to be what triggers our operations on  the funds rate In that connection I think we ought to recognize that  the aggregates are well within their ranges However, it’s not  entirely the points at which the aggregates rest, but rather in part  the slope of the aggregates And for the last four months there have  been some pretty steep positive slopes If that continues, which I  don‘t really anticipate, I think we ought to be prepared to move on up  [on the funds rate] So, in short, I would buy alternative I1 with  the money market directive   I tend to think we ought to have different ranges  when we have a money market directive than when we have an aggregates  one because the trigger points are different Others apparently don‘t  see that distinction, which I see   No, in view of Regulation Q If that were  removed, I think I would  "
1143,1979-07-17,BLACK," Yes, I'm here, Mr Chairman With the situation as fluid as it is now, I don't believe it's wise to move at this particular point I think a move could be interpreted as a lack of confidence in the President's program, which some of us may feel, but nevertheless it would not look good as a policy action And we've not yet reached the trigger point on the aggregates although, as Paul Volcker pointed out, we are quite close Like Paul, Willis, and Henry, I'm afraid that this is the tip of the iceberg But I would wait until the weekend and no later and then if we see signs that it is snowballing as Governor Coldwell suggested, I would be prepared to move at that time  I'd just as soon wait and vote by telegram, Mr Chairman "
1163,1979-07-19,BLACK," Mr Chairman, I lean toward the hawkish side on this I think we ought to put the fed funds rate up perhaps a half  -2-    7/19/79  point and move the discount rate up a full percentage point And I'd raise the fed funds rate range to, say, 10 to 11 percent or something of that sort  I would favor it, Mr Chairman "
1186,1979-08-14,BLACK," It shatters his hopes of having an offset, though  Most of what I wanted to ask, Mr Chairman, has been asked But, Scott, in retrospect do you think we would have been significantly better off so far as the dollar is concerned if we had moved the discount rate one point instead of a half point?  Mr Chairman, were you not more original and more articulate than I, I would have assumed that you had borrowed my notes to make that talk of yours I guess the only point on which I might differ with you is that I tend to attribute more of the oncoming recession--if that's in fact where we are headed--to inflation than you did and less to the energy situation In any event that leads me to the same conclusion that we ought to approach the recession problem very carefully or otherwise we are going to lay the groundwork for more recession or inflation, and then more severe recessions down the road And I think we have to deal not only with this recession but with the problem of recurring cycles  This leads me to the point where I conclude that we really have to do something about the rate of growth in the aggregates I concur with Mark Willes' remark in that all the ranges [in the Bluebook] seem too high I'll offer two brief bits of evidence in support of that If we go back to March, when growth in the aggregates began to spurt, and look at the period from March to September, under alternative B with a money market directive, for example, M1 could grow over that period by as much as 9 percent before we really acted And that's a pretty long period of time M2 could grow as high as 12 percent before we acted, and with ""C"" it's just a tad different from that The second point is that we ought not to lose sight of the necessity for mentally adding back in 1-1/2 percent to the top of that adjusted 3 to 6 percent range for M1 because it's really comparable to 7-1/2 percent; and we are very near the top of that range now  A money market directive or an aggregates directive, Mr Chairman?  Well, the trigger points would be very different, as I view it anyway  Mr Chairman, I think I make a lot more of these trigger points than most people do, and Henry's and Mark's points are important to me in selecting the ranges because they do trigger [action on the funds rate] at different points In one case it triggers when [the aggregates] get near the top or move beyond the top of the ranges and in the other it triggers when they move significantly beyond the midpoints So with an aggregates directive we would have wider ranges than we would with the money market directive, necessarily just by the sheer arithmetic of it My preference, which I could alter to some extent, would be an aggregates directive that would trigger at an upward [move at] somewhere around 6-1/2 percent on M1--which would be a range of 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent --and at around 9-1/2 percent on M2, which would be a range of 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent I don't know what federal funds rate is consistent with that, because I despair of ever picking out of thin air some range that will give us predictable behavior of the aggregates But my best guess, which is certainly uninformed as I think everyone else's is, is about 10-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent And I would favor moving to 11 percent now and once we get there, and get that rate firmly established, following with a half point increase in the discount rate  This is alternative number one?    8/14/79  Yes, let's do that I think it makes a whale of a difference "
1217,1979-09-18,BLACK," Mr Chairman, it's not all that unusual to have a  burst in bank credit as the economy moves into recession The cash  flow of business is--   Mr Chairman, do you want us to do that now or  when we get to the specifications?   M r   Chairman, I don't have any serious quarrel  with the staff's projections on the economy But I think they are  probably on the optimistic side, if they've missed, because it seems  to me that this trouble we have is more in the nature of a worldwide  problem with the petroleum shortage, inflation, and turmoil in the  foreign exchange market So I would not see nearly the improvement in  the foreign trade sector that the staff has projected I think all  these problems are going to intensify the domestic problem In  dealing with the recession that we are in, I think we have a unique  set of problems here that we really haven't [encountered] in the  postwar period, as Dave Eastburn indicated I don't think the past  action in earlier recessions gives us much of a guide as to how we  ought to proceed in this one There was an excellent article by Paul  McCracken in The Wall Street Journal yesterday that spelled out the  sort of procedures I think we ought to follow What I believe we have  to do, since I think inflation is the main problem, is to address that  problem almost entirely More troubles are going to build up and we  also are going have more serious problems on all fronts, including the  unemployment front down the road And to me dealing with inflation  means getting a hand on the aggregates   As we set our targets today and as we approach the end of the  year--when we are going to be judged as to whether we have hit our  long-run targets or we haven't--we ought to bear in mind that there is  a good deal of confusion among the public and probably on the part of  some members of Congress I find it confusing myself [as to] what our  M1 targets really are for the fourth quarter of last year to the  fourth quarter of this year You will remember that in July we  decided we would not change them; we left the M1 range at 1-1/2 to  4-1/2 percent but the consensus around the table as I read it was that  for internal purposes we would think of that as being 3-1/2 to 6  percent since we revised downward our estimate of the ATS/New York NOW  account effect from 3 to 1-l/2 percentage points Now, this spurt in  the aggregates that we had in August and September is going to make it  very difficult for us to get a good fourth-quarter rate And under  all three alternatives in the staff's projections they are talking  about a rate from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth  quarter of this year of 53 percent If we add to that the 1-1/2  percent ATS/New York NOW account [effect], that comes out to 6  8   percent, which I find is sufficient evidence to indicate that we have  been too easy Although I sympathize with Bob Mayo's position--it's  hard to judge these things sometimes--when I see bankers out fighting  for loans as they are now and I see a lot them adding to their  investments, I have to conclude that credit conditions may not be as  tight as they appear [on the basis of] interest rates alone   Looking back in the history of economic thought, when we  didn't have all the statistics we now have there was considerable  feeling on the part of economists at the time that you could look at  the behavior of the foreign exchange rate and the price of gold and  that would tell you whether you had too much money or not [Those  indicators] clearly say to me that we are much too easy But I view     9/18/79 -23-    these long-run targets that we established in July as calling for a  midpoint of 6 percent pre-ATS and 4 - 1 / 2  percent post-ATS, and I think  we ought to endeavor to come as close as possible to these midpoints  I think this use of homeopathic doses of federal funds rate increases  in the past has pretty well ruled out any hope we have of achieving  this if indeed we can control the aggregates by manipulating the  federal funds rate I have some doubts about that and some sympathy  for Larry Roos's approach, but I do think we want to offset as much of  the second and third quarter overshoots as possible, and I would--   This is M1, Mr Chairman   That's right, without any ATS I believe that's  what we were thinking about Then you remember we went to 1-1/2 to  4 - l / 2  percent, which gave u s  a 3 percent midpoint when we thought the  ATS effects were--   That's right   May I ask a question about the ATS effects? Is  that for the whole year, Steve, or were you talking about recent  months?   Phil, what would your preference be on ranges?   Use an aggregates directive and it becomes much  more acceptable to me with those ranges   Well, if we move it to 11-1/2 percent, I think  we’ve done it for the time being and we can wait until the projections  come in and move further I would align myself exactly with John on  his specifications, with an aggregates directive I have the same  problem with a money market directive That takes us further off  target than we now are   Well, I don’t think it’s that, Mr Chairman I  think it’s a question of how serious we are about the aggregates And  as I guess everybody knows, I’m right serious about them   I do too, Bob, but we have had year after year of  excessive growth and at some point we have to act in the short run if  the long run is going to come out right And I don't think we have,  though recently we've done pretty well   I hope you're right, Bob, because I don't want to  see interest rates go up But I'm afraid they'll have to if we're to  avoid [even] higher rates, a more serious recession, and more  unemployment further down the road   Just to show my flexibility, Mr Chairman, I‘ll  say that I would go along with that  "
1242,1979-10-05,BLACK, How is this memorandum coming to us?  
1257,1979-10-06,BLACK," If we give them the adjusted figure for M1--  remember we cited the 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent--   We are going to have to clarify that one, I  think   They might arbitrage out some of the fluctuations  we would otherwise have in the federal funds rate, too     10/6/79 -33 -    CmIRMAN VOLCKER No question that the federal funds rate  will be influenced by the discount rate It is now, but it will be  more so   It seems to me that the main [objective] ought to  be to set the discount rate at a level--if we can figure out what that  is--that would reduce the volatility of borrowing, which would enable  us to get at total reserves more precisely I think that would mean  that we should try to keep the discount rate at a penalty rate most of  the time That, of course, has implications for our--   I agree that this is not going to affect it a  lot, but conceptually it isn’t in the bag yet   Okay     10/6/79 -38   Mr Chairman, do you want the growth rates [we  prefer] stated in terms of the growth for the year or not?   The quarterly average would hold it to around  that, I think   It seems to me that we can target better on what  we want the growth for the year to be than on September to December   Well, I know it has to be translated into [the  rate for the September-to-December period] for purposes of the  operating technique, but it’s hard--unless you know what the pattern  is apt to be between September and December--   My point, Mr Chairman is that the staff started  with the numbers on the left-hand side, 4-1/2, 6-1/2, and 7-1/2  percent, or 53, 8, and 8 percent And then they went back and  produced a September-to-December figure It’s very difficult for us  to produce the figures here that would be compatible with what we  might want for this   That‘s essentially what I am saying   I ‘d  rather see it wider   M R   COLDWELL I think we ought to have some sensitivity to a  16 percent federal funds rate   I think that‘s clearly true   I do, too   M R   MAYO Paul, one of the problems with the alternative is  that we either adopt a wide range or start with a funds rate that's  already above where it is now In other words, if it's at a little  less than 12 percent now, and we put our range at 12-1/2 to 14 percent  or whatever you suggested, that raises another difficulty Maybe it's  mechanical But from a realistic standpoint we almost have to widen  the range on the alternative   Is this just in favor of the approach or does it  have the specifications tied to--   I concur, Mr Chairman I certainly would like  to see it shaved down a bit because I think it is very important that  we come within the ranges And remember, we just announced 1-1/2 to  4-1/2 percent as the target on Ml and we are going to have to tell  people that it‘s really 3 to 6 percent   You mean the statement of policy actions?   There isn't any safety on M2, Chuck   It may well come in less than that anyway with  disintermediation  "
1279,1979-10-22,BLACK," Mr Chairman, Dave Eastburn came closer than  anyone else to saying what I think is appropriate We do have a major  credibility factor on both the domestic and foreign sides if we don’t  hit our targets I don’t think many people realize that the figures  that were published for the money supply for the week ending the 10th  allowed us only the 9th and the 10th to work on them [under our new  approach] They think [those figures are] an indication of the  failure of our policy At some judicious time it might be wise to  point that out to the market I certainly wouldn‘t want to try to get  the funds rate back down to 14-1/2 percent unless it just goes there  of its own accord I wouldn‘t want to abandon the reserve target even  if the funds rate has to go above the 15-1/2 percent upper limit we     10/22/79 -1-   set at our last meeting I would be prepared to go up to 16 or 17  percent if we had to I think it's very crucial that we establish our  credibility at this point   How about the idea of pointing out to the market  that we really weren't [using the new approach] on those money supply  figures but for two days?   Well, it's a subtle point and even if pointed out  at the meeting, people around here have not picked it up I haven't  seen any reference to it   I would think that's one reason rates are as high  as they are  "
1301,1979-11-20,BLACK," Scott, you said that the only thing the  foreigners thought we had going for us was our monetary policy Do  you mean in the short run? Do they not see the improvement in the  balance of payments that has been projected by the staff?   M R   PARDEE They see the projections They’ve seen the  projections over the last few years--the forecast of an improvement on  our trade and current accounts and improvement in our inflation  picture And they’re still waiting to see when it will come   They don‘t believe it, in short   Suppose that is accompanied by a clear control  over the aggregates Would they have pretty much the same reaction?   It sounds as if they accepted that as a  reasonable outcome   M R   WALLICH They're not stupid I think they have to  accept it as reasonable, but they also figure that it means there will  be dollar weakness   They're hoping the aggregates will slow and  interest rates will remain high--both   Could I ask one brief question, M r   Chairman?  Steve, you mentioned that under ""B"" you have a 9-1/2 percent increase  in M1 from mid-November to year-end What is the comparable figure  for ""C?""   Mr Chairman, I think it's pretty obvious that  the Iranian crisis has potentially great implications for the domestic  outlook--[morel than the mere availability of petroleum supplies But  absent that problem, I would think the staff's forecast would be about  right If I had to guess which way the error might be, I would think  the economy might be somewhat weaker than they are projecting It's  certainly true that the economy has shown amazing resilience up until  now I guess inventories are in better shape than they were this time  in the 1973-74 downturn But when I look at the weakness in housing  and hear a talk like Frank Morris gave us on the resistance to rates  and about the lack of availability of funds, I think housing is going  to be quite weak   I think the consumer is pretty well over-extended I  gathered an interesting observation from the chief executive officer  of He said that consumer loan  demand had virtually dried up at is their consumer  financing company, but was still present at the bank I asked him if  this related to the type of customer the two institutions have He  allowed as how he didn't know but said that might be part of it   And finally, I would think that if we made an error on the  [forecast] of net exports, they would probably be weaker than we had  guessed because of the increasing restrictiveness of monetary policy  abroad and the generally unsettled international climate   Turning to the policy side, I think the most important task  is for us to hit our long-run targets I agree, as someone said  earlier, that we can probably do that pretty well with any of these  alternatives Certainly we ought to hit the M1 and M3 targets with  any of them and I believe we'd come pretty close on M2 with any of  them Bank credit I guess we are going to miss altogether So I  don't think that there's a lot to choose from in view of the short  period left, as Emmett Rice mentioned I have a marginal preference  for ""B"" My only concern with ""B"" is that the lower limit on the  federal funds rate range might be a little high at 11-1/2 percent  Now, last time I argued that we ought not to put that below 11-1/2  percent because I thought we had a credibility problem And I felt  that if [the funds rate] came down before we demonstrated any control  over the aggregates, we'd have a real problem But I do think we have  gained considerable credibility at this point and also the economy  looks weaker So against that background, although I'm somewhat     11/20/79 -32-   concerned over what Henry and Scott said earlier about the foreign  reaction, I think the reserve growth needed to achieve alternative B  may well entail more federal funds rate movement on the down side than  some might expect I think the rate might have to go below current  rates by a fairly significant level so I would want to lower that  lower limit to 10-1/2 percent I guess I’d stay with 15-1/2 percent  for the high end, but I surely wouldn’t object to raising that I  might be wrong on this and I would suggest that maybe we ought to have  a telephone conference if the funds rate approaches either of those  limits   I don’t think that’s responsive to John’s  question, really     11/20/79 -41-   If I understand what it is   Better than it sounds     11120179 -45   We could reschedule that   M R   ROOS Would we if we move [the FOMC meeting date]?   Yes, sure   Yes; we could shift it to January and Ernie  could preside instead of me   M R   ROOS So if we did that, it would be the 8th and 9th  "
1331,1980-01-08,BLACK," Mr Chairman, the physicists have always had a rather neat way of dealing with problems such as this by saying Well, that's an engineering problem In a sense, I think there's a good parallel here in that the Committee decides what rate of growth it wants in the aggregates--that's the problem for the physicists--and then it's an engineering problem to translate that it into the volume of reserves So, I would come out very close to where Frank Morris did on that in suggesting that the staff ought to allow for these things in absorbing the least reserves to make their best estimate of what volume we need out there to support the rates of growth in the aggregates that we have chosen  Well, our engineers will be working on the problem continously, and I didn't mean to suggest otherwise  For similar reasons you would object very strenuously to M3  But lately they don't get as much snow  Until [the shifting] disappears  I think a few people will understand it much better and a lot will undersand it much less  Could somebody tell me exactly what the Humphrey-Hawkins Act says? I thought it indicated Ml, M2, M3, and credit  Mr Chairman, I come out very close to Ernie Baughman in feeling that we ought to stress our range in 1980 and not indicate specifically what the ranges will be for future years but indicate very clearly that we still hold our oft-stated intention to reduce these ranges gradually over time until we get them down to what we hope to be a noninflationary basis So far as these new aggregates are concerned, M3 is probably the worst because it seems to be the most interest sensitive I think M2 is going to be rather interest sensitive, too, because we have taken out of it all the nonnegotiable CDs at weekly reporting banks and all the large CDs--whether negotiable or nonnegotiable--at the other banks I would think, John, that would probably more than offset the advantage from [including] the money market funds, but I'm not sure about that I believe M-1A leaves out an increasingly important part of the transactions balances, so I would settle on M-1B as the best one of all I would favor narrowing the width of the ranges We have had 3 points suggested at times in the past; we have had 2 points I would favor 1 point for the two Ml ranges and probably 2 points for M2 and M3, which I don't think we can control that precisely anyway The main thing that I want to do is to set these targets below what we achieved in 1979 In terms of M-1B, which is what I build all this around, we had a 73 percent rate of growth in '79; I'd say 6 percent might be a reasonable rate in '80, so [a range of] 5-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent would look about right to me on that one If we can explain satisfactorily that M-1A really was not 5 percent as the figure shows but 63 percent, then maybe 5 to 6 percent would be reasonable for that For M2 I'd suggest 6 to 8 percent and for M3 6-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent  Jim, I was a little surprised about the magnitude of the announced increase in real GNP for the fourth quarter Where would you guess that will end up after the final revisions are in?  As I indicated yesterday, Mr Chairman, my preference on the long-run targets would be to go mainly with M-1B It increased at a 73 percent rate last year and I think 6 percent is a reasonable rate for [this year] If the relationships set forth over the next year between the old M1 and M-1B hold in the future, this would suggest that the appropriate long-run range for M1 would be about 5-1/2 percent Against this background, I think we ought to be working down our target growth rates and I would favor alternative B Now, that does specify rates that are below what I've indicated I thought was probable for M1 and M-1B, but I would be prepared to support that for three reasons One is that I think we still have a very serious credibility gap I find few people in the financial markets who really believe that we're going to stick with the policy we announced October 6th So, I think we need some low growth rates very quickly in order to better establish our credibility The second reason why I would favor being somewhat lower in the beginning is the point that Frank Morris made yesterday This seems to be about the only time we can get the growth rates down That may be in part because the market used to determine to a greater degree how much money it got than it presumably will under this new system, but there's still an element of that in there And then, third, past experience has shown that we usually get bursts in the aggregates in the second and third quarters While that may have stemmed from bad seasonal adjustments or the old methodology, I'm still suspicious that it might happen [again]; so I would like to get some pretty low figures under our belt before it does happen, if in fact it does So far as the range for federal funds is concerned, philosophically I'd like very wide ranges and would be tempted on purely philosophical grounds to widen that range, particularly at the low end But this is not a time to stand on pure philosophical preferences because it's undoubtedly true that foreigners and people in this market, too, are paying a great deal of attention to what interest rates are doing So, I think it's important that we not let the rate go below 11-1/2 percent, and I would put that as a floor until such time as we have better credibility than I think we now have  Henry, did you say you would change the top of the funds range to 16 percent?  Mr Chairman, I come out right where Frank did It's not only the matter of borrowing, it's a matter of what liabilities the banks use up or [whether they] release reserves that are not part of the money supply All those things have to be estimated and there are a lot of them To me borrowing involves the same sort of problem I see it just the way Frank does  That's implicitly assuming no change in excess reserves, Mr Chairman I don't think that's right  For once, Mr Chairman, though Governor Rice and I voted at [opposite] ends of this spectrum, we have agreed that either of us could accept the other's position "
1358,1980-02-04,BLACK," Mr Chairman, in deciding whether lagged reserves are good or bad for policy, I think we have to decide whether the likely errors in hitting the money supply stem from a lack of responsiveness to changes in the volume of reserves or whether they stem from unexpected changes in the appetite of the market for money of the type that Frank Morris assumed If it's the first, then one can make a case that we get a little quicker response under lagged reserve requirements than under the other in the sense that if we inject a given volume of reserves, required reserves don't rise immediately, so the banks feel a little easier and they kick this off a little faster In the case of unexpected deviations stemming from a shift in the demand for money, then we do have an automatic braking that comes about under contemporaneous reserve requirements that tends to stop this unexpected change in the demand for money I think it's this latter type that's really the most troublesome for us under our present mode of operation So that does give a slight edge to contemporaneous accounting under the present procedures But I don't think we ought to overemphasize that I come out very close to where Alan Holmes and Peter Sternlight did At most, I would think the delay would be two weeks And if you accept any of the points that    2/4-5/80  Irving Auerbach was raising in his debate with Bill Poole in the American Banker, then you may conclude that it may take longer than most people assume for these multiple contractions or expansions in bank credit to take place In the kind of environment in which we are trying to bring about a steady rate of expansion in money, and given all these other slippages in the monetary multiplier, it's hard for me to see that it makes a great deal of difference under present procedures But I do think that it is good for us, if we can, to quiet this criticism that has been stemming from the monetarists I have two reasons (1) It would divert their efforts toward trying to help us achieve a monetary target and they would stop assuming that it's as easy to hit as most of them have assumed; and (2) it would remove any excuse that we have for not hitting the targets And both of those [results] would be rather salutary, I think  As far as the other side of the coin is concerned, bank relations, a lot of the academic commentators assume that it's easier for a bank to adjust under contemporaneous reserve requirements because it does not involve as large a change in excess reserves But they are not talking to the bankers I've talked to I think most of the Reserve Banks now provide each of their banks with a daily statement on reserves, which shows their required reserves as determined from deposits two weeks earlier They subtract from that any vault cash they held two weeks earlier, either add to that or subtract from it the amount of carryover from the previous week, and then show how much the banks must hold in their reserve balances for the remainder of the reserve period In fact, we even show that on a daily average basis So far as the small banker is concerned, all he has to worry about is looking at that statement that comes every day, early in the day--it never misses its schedule except when the carrier doesn't run, which is very seldom--and he knows exactly the reserves he has to hold on a daily average basis for the balance of that reserve period And if he misses it a little, he has the 2 percent carryover Most of them, if they watch it very closely, can get pretty darn close to zero excess reserves But I wouldn't favor the adoption of alternative one--moving to a one-week lag--which I think is the best of those Steve outlined, for the reason that John Balles and Frank Morris and many of the rest of you have stated It would be a major problem [of implementation] But as we move ahead, we might think about how we could go to contemporaneous reserve accounting and yet solve this bank relations problem The problem doesn't stem entirely from not having all the banks as members I don't think we'd want to burden the banks unduly even if they were all [members]  So, what appeals to me most would be a month-long period of contemporaneous reserve accounting I think that would have practically all of the advantages of the [weekly contemporaneous accounting period] It would involve less rate volatility because banks would have more opportunity to engage in interest arbitrage within the reserve period It would also give more time for this adjustment to the changes in the demand for money--that multiple contraction or expansion that some of the commentators seem to think occurs almost instantaneously It would reduce the work of the Federal Reserve and the work of the commercial banks a great deal if we didn't have to put this out on a weekly basis It would reduce the emphasis on the weekly figures that now cause us so much problems And if we eliminated the carryover in the process--and I think we    2/4-5/80  probably could get away with eliminating that if we went to a month- long period--it would eliminate a form of slippage But there are some disadvantages to a month-long period without the carryover in terms of unexpected reserve movements toward the end of the period And this would not be simply the last day in the case of many banks that don't know their required reserves until five or six days later But if we did have an unexpected movement toward the end of the period, it would have an effect on only 1/28th to 1/31st of the whole period because of the month-long period as compared with an effect of 1/7th as we now have with a seven-day period We also could not provide as much help to the banks through giving them statements of their required reserves, and that removes one of the inducements for them to report more promptly to us Certainly that is important to us Finally, with a long period of time, in a sense one could argue that the banks wouldn't have to come to grips with a change in reserve availability quite as promptly, and we might have some slippage there But on balance, if we combined these two, that might conceivably be the best of the two worlds But I would urge that we not move to that at this time for reasons others have already stressed  Peter along those same lines, all the new definitions in January would show greater growth rates than we had for those same measures in September to December whereas all the old ones show less in January What is the market going to say to that? This is very closely related to what you were saying  That's what I am afraid of, really  Stress the long run Go back to the [previous] six months and it will look a little better as you explain it  You mean you're not simple-minded?  Mr Chairman, the Greenbook revision resulted in a move from a V-shaped decline to a sort of saucer-shaped recession, which is probably in the right direction Despite this, I think the underlying foundations of the economy are quite weak What strength we have had recently has come mainly from efforts on the part of households and some others to beat inflation Now, I am aware of the argument that the rising wealth of households stemming from such things as appreciation of the value of housing may produce a wealth effect that will cause them to hold their expenditures at higher levels But I think that is really a pretty weak reed on which to hang the forecast Sooner or later, this artificial prop to spending that stems from inflation is going to fall apart, and an inflationary economy is not a healthy one And if it does fall apart, then at that time I would expect, if inflation is worse, that we would have a greater decline because of the attrition of real income and the high interest rates that would discourage business investment Also, I think we would have a clamor for wage and price controls If, on the other hand, inflation is showing signs of abatement, then the effects of this decline are going to be diminished So I think Chuck's observation a while ago that a lot depends on what we do is a very significant point That will affect the outcome to a great degree And I think we're going to have a very difficult job in the months ahead because, like John Balles, I feel we're going to have more stimulus from the fiscal side than most people seem to be assuming But I do think we are dead serious about our stated intention to bring down the rate of growth in the aggregates, and I think we'll stand firm But since I won't be voting next year, I have a little less confidence in that than I otherwise would have  To get down to the figures, I think the drop in GNP might be nearer 3 percent than the 2 percent the staff has projected Since I expect us to do well in the policy area, I would put the fourth-quarter rate in the consumer price index a bit lower, at 9 percent I would guess their unemployment rate is not very far off; my guess would tend toward 8 percent As I indicated, I think the deficit is understated--the stimulative effects are understated-- and I certainly would not favor a tax cut at this juncture  Mr Chairman, my feeling hasn't changed a lot since our last meeting It is true that the economic outlook has changed somewhat from what most of us expected In particular, the government's demand on resources appears likely to be much greater than we earlier thought But far from providing the reason for relaxing or delaying this long-run task of ours of lowering the rate of growth in the aggregates, the inflationary dangers posed by this fiscal stimulus suggest to me that the System needs to stick all the more firmly to the goal that it has often stated in the past The midpoints of alternative II look good to me I was one of those who preferred the narrower ranges last time I would much prefer a 1 percentage point range for M-1A and M-1B and a 2-point range for the other aggregates, M2 and M3, because of their interest volatility  -46-    2/4-5/80  Now, one can certainly argue that we need more flexibility since we may be moving into a recession and we may be moving into more inflation I recognize the validity of that argument, but it seems to me that the narrower range would do a lot to enhance our credibility Therefore, it would enhance a great deal the beneficial expectational effects that I think we'll get if we do in fact announce lower targets than what we have achieved in the past I would be rather unhappy if M-1A and M-1B, which are the two aggregates I consider most important, came out at the top of their alternative II ranges So, my figures would translate to 4-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent for M-1A, with a midpoint of 5 percent, the same as in alternative II My other ranges would be M-lB, 5 to 6, with a midpoint of 5-1/2; M2, 6-1/2 to 8-1/2 with a midpoint of 7-1/2; M3, 7 to 9 with a midpoint of 8; and bank credit, 6-1/2 to 8-1/2 with a midpoint of 7-1/2  Well, I have said most of what I felt along that line I would emphasize M-1B because it catches the transaction balances better; M-1A has lost a lot of the transaction balances  Is that for M-1A, Phil?  And a pretty good inflation record  I would prefer that  This just means acceptable, not necessarily preferable?  It's [as if we] perceive more [differences] than there really are  You sure did And that was a preference, not just acceptable  That's not a bad idea  But it appeases some of the rest of us  -62-    2/4-5/80  But it's the way it is perceived  SPEAKER(?) It is the way it is perceived by the public, Paul, that's important I agree there isn't all that much difference but the perception by the public--  SPEAKER(?) It's the top of the ranges that scares me to death  I think that's a correct appraisal I think the market will look at it that way, too  That's really what it was, when you come right down to it  That would be 3-3/4 to [6-3/4 for M-1B]  M-1B is ""misinformed bunch""  That's the end of Balles, et al  Seven? Doesn't it make you two even a little happier?  Maybe I ought to reactivate my proposal?  What about bank credit? Are we going to have to put that in?  Maybe we can just vote without any statement from anybody It might be better "
1404,1980-03-18,BLACK," Scott, at what rate do we get these marks back [from] the Treasury, if we need them?  The important point really is the one you made a while ago, Chuck, about the need for reassessing the nonborrowed reserve target more frequently I was on the call and I sensed that we really ought to be doing that; we did speed it up last month, but I would like to see even more  Mr Chairman, we are in general agreement with what the staff has [projected] If we were to shade it a little, we'd shade it along the lines that Frank Morris described because of the unrest we see in financial markets, along with weaker housing and also probably weakness in investment, all of which we think may be more than the staff is estimating I would add one other caveat and that is the feeling on our part that the international situation may be weaker than is generally being assumed So we would shade the forecast toward a little deeper decline than the staff has indicated By the same token, we would expect perhaps a more rapid recovery The  -24-    3/18/80  staff is actually showing no growth in real GNP between the fourth quarter of '80 and the fourth quarter of '81, and we think [GNP growth] will probably be positive  On the policy side, it seems to me that the best thing we could do is to continue the policy we've been following I think you said it all, and very well, yesterday before those bankers when you stressed that the backbone of our policy still remains our efforts to control the aggregates Not everyone heard you yesterday; there may be some general doubt that we'll do that and some expectation that we'll back away So, one could make a case for going with alternative C But it seems to me that alternative B is strong enough to underscore our determination The rates of growth in the aggregates for the last part of that six-month period are substantially below what we actually had in the first three months, or think we had in the first three months They are below our targets, so ""B"" seems to us to be the best of the alternatives  So far as the federal funds range is concerned, I would prefer to drop the top and also the bottom of that range I think we are now to the point where we can do that I would not want to raise the lower end, a possible alternative suggested in the Bluebook, since I would like us to be in a position to let rates come down pretty fast, if they do tend to do that in the face of a controlled set of growth rates in the aggregates I am sure that the Committee is not going to agree to abandoning that range; against that background, 11-1/2 to 18 percent looks about right to us  We began to have as many misses as the Board's staff, so-- "
1428,1980-04-22,BLACK," Scott, how would you rate the relative importance of the declining rates and prospective declines in rates vis-a-vis the Iranian situation, so far as weakness in the dollar is concerned?  But if we kept the aggregates under control successfully for the next several months, would interest rates and prospective interest rate movements mean as much as they do now?  Has that mix changed any? I know that has been true for a long time  Mr Chairman, I can think of one small technical factor that might have affected [money growth] The delay in mailing out the [tax] refunds might have made the money hit balances a couple of days later, but probably no more than that If we figured it correctly, that would account for maybe $800 million or something like that but the estimates for the week of the 16th were revised down to about $4-1/2 billion However, one thing we wondered about was whether or not the high interest rates and the greater availability of money substitutes such as the money market mutual funds may have led people not to build up their balances in anticipation of the tax date quite as [early] as they have in the past How to measure that, I don't know But we also were wondering about this great weakness, and that's all we could come up with as a possible explanation for it  I gather that there wasn't anything more than the availability of more data that led to these downward revisions  Yes, for the week of the 16th  Mr Chairman, I agree with the staff's further downward revisions in the projections for the forthcoming period And if I had to guess, I would say that they still haven't got them quite low enough, because I just don't see any area in the economy that seems to have significant strength Housing is headed much lower, I    4/22/80  think The consumer is grossly overextended We are getting grass roots reports of growing personal and business bankruptcies The Redbook, and particularly the addendum that the New York Bank sent in, suggests that inventories are not as closely in alignment with needs as we had thought earlier, and that was the main thing we were counting on to keep this recession relatively moderate And I would guess that there is probably going to be greater-than-expected weakness abroad, so that this recession might well take on more of an international cast than I think most people are assuming at this moment If I am right on this, then prices will probably come down somewhat more rapidly than the staff and most other people are assuming I have a lot of sympathy for what Henry was saying, primarily because I think we have made errors in the past By the same token, when it comes to policy, I think we would be well advised to stick to the targets that we adopted last time, which inclines me toward ""B"" The only thing that causes me problems is this estimate of a sharp decline in the aggregates in April If that [occurs], in order to stay on this targeted path we have to have growth in May and June in the principal aggregates of over 9 percent, and I think that would scare the devil out of the market and lead people to conclude that we had abandoned our October 6th policy So, if April does come in that weak, then I would want to hit the midpoints of the ranges sometime later--maybe in September or somewhere down the line rather than try to get [growth] back to the midpoints by June What I'm really saying, I guess, is that we ought to stick to the reserve target And I would like to see rates come down, if that's the natural fallout of this That should help prevent April from being so low and would permit us, hopefully, to hit the midpoints by June  Well, probably so  Which one is illegal? Excuse me, Henry  SPEAKER(?) That takes the fun out of it, if you--  Well, I always favor ones that are unpopular or illegal! I just thought I'd save some time "
1450,1980-04-29,BLACK," This is Bob Black and I agree, too, Mr Chairman I would be very careful in announcing that if we tried to do it I'd say there's no change in policy but this is a pursuit of aggregate targets that we set out for ourselves in your recent public statement "
1470,1980-05-06,BLACK, Same in Richmond  Yesterday! 
1490,1980-05-20,BLACK," It will be a little longer this time because we don't have a June meeting, won't it?  SPEAKER(?) This comes out earlier [than the Policy Record]  Mr Chairman, I recognize the possibilities that Governor Wallich has outlined, and he outlined them very well But I feel that if we don't [do something to] be on target before long, we may get almost impossible pressures against us to ease later on [by more than is desirable], at about the time the economy is recovering And that's the time when we usually make our mistakes So I come out about where Governor Partee and Mr Eastburn did, and I would align myself very closely with the remarks they made I have some specific [recommendations to make] later on regarding the federal funds rate ranges, the level and width of the ranges, and also the wording of the operational paragraph  We have very little basis for knowing where the lower level ought to be, or the upper level really The problem is likely to be on the lower end, but it could be on the upper end  That's probably right I'd hate to see us narrow that, though, while we had an 8-1/2 percent--  The range is being narrowed from [6 points] to either 5 or 4 points, which is a whale of narrowing  Mr Chairman, there's another question we need to deal with, and that is whether we mention specific short-run numerical targets in the directive If we narrow the ranges and don't mention any targets, it's going to be viewed as more than cosmetic when people find that out I think they will conclude essentially what Larry has stated I would urge us to put down whatever we agree to in the way of numerical targets rather than leave that blank and specify merely the federal funds range  Yes we have  We can say ""growth over the first nine months of 1980"" or something like that, essentially what we've done in the past "
1537,1980-07-09,BLACK," Mr Chairman, our differences with the staff forecast have widened a bit this time For 1980, we believe that the drop in real GNP will probably be greater than the staff is projecting This concern stems mainly from three factors the growing evidence that the international situation may be weaker than we've been assuming, the conditions in the construction industry--and specifically housing--and retail sales If you plot housing starts and retail sales in real terms opposite similar periods of other postwar downturns, this time they practically drop off the chart; the drop is far greater than anything we've had before And we don't believe that that weakness has yet spread to other parts of the  -20-    7/9/80  economy to the extent that it likely will So, expecting this greater weakness, we think the unemployment rate will probably be higher by the fourth quarter than the staff is projecting, though we think the rise in the deflator will be less We have estimated the deflator at 85 percent versus [the staff's] 94 percent for the four quarters ending in the final quarter of this year And in 1981, more differences [emerge] because we firmly believe that if we stick to our targets on the aggregates, as I think we will, then the outcome will be much better than the staff is projecting We are guessing that we might have an increase in real GNP in the neighborhood of 6 percent as compared to the 25 percent forecast by the Board staff This would mean a good deal less inflation and it also should mean less unemployment Our forecast is a guess too, of course, but we feel [the results could be] quite different from what the staff has projected  Well, we keep the money supply under better control  Yes, I would think so If we make progress on the inflation front, I think people's expectations are going to turn around very markedly And we have [projected] more private investment than has been assumed, offering commensurate increases in productivity  Mr Chairman, like several of the others who have spoken, our preference for 1981 would be the retention of the existing ranges I come out pretty close to where Dave Eastburn and Larry Roos came out but, of course, I wouldn't want to overstate my case as you said Larry was close to doing So, I feel pretty much the same without overstating it Just attribute [the overstatement] to him! If we lower our targets now--and because of where we are I know there is a real temptation to do that--people are going to interpret it as meaning that we have just forgiven our misses as we have done in the past That's just one step away from their concluding that if we overshoot on the up side as we come out of this--which is where we usually have made our mistakes in the past--we will do that just as readily [this time] So, that is the principal reason I would stick with these targets But we ought to recognize that there are other aspects of credibility involved, and one is that to achieve these targets--to get anywhere near the adjusted midpoints of the ranges for M-1A and M-1B--we have to have pretty darn rapid rates of growth in those aggregates between now and the end of the year And I'm convinced that a substantial body of the financial public is apt to conclude that we have thrown in the towel [on fighting inflation] unless we do a very good job of explaining that I think you, Mr Chairman, and the rest of us will have to combat that in talks if indeed we do decide that is what we want to pursue  I am also aware that this course will probably weaken the dollar temporarily, but if we don't go ahead and move our aggregates up [into the ranges], the intensification of the recession here will probably damage our trading partners to a considerable extent and there will be feedback effects here And those effects may even be more serious so far as domestic activity is concerned We also ought to bear in mind that the real way to deal with the foreign exchange problem is to deal with inflation rather than to worry about temporary differences in interest rates And I do think this policy will be the best way to deal with inflation over the long run So on these grounds, we would favor approaching the adjusted midpoints--maybe I should say asymptotically or rather slowly anyway--of the ranges for M-1A and M-1B and we would weigh M-1B considerably more heavily than the others We also would favor shorter-run specifications that would be consistent with that kind of long-run policy  For 1981 I think it's vital that we follow through and announce that we have lowered our targets, as we have been promising to do every time we have [testified] I'd make an effort to lower these gradually, but steadily I think Frank Morris made a good point in suggesting that we ought to avoid saying much about the technical adjustments now I would favor lowering all of the ranges about 1/2  -35-    7/9/80  percentage point but point out that we will have to make adjustments later on I know that's not going to eliminate all the confusion that will emanate from this statement, but it might reduce it  So far as the last question you asked, I would not favor a tax cut but it seems inevitable given the political situation, so I am assuming that one will take place And I agree with Frank Morris that jawboning is practically useless I would say it might have a marginally positive effect if monetary and fiscal policy are doing what they are supposed to be doing But a tax cut is probably inevitable, so I imagine we will have it in some form  I think he understated his case, Mr Chairman!  Mr Chairman, if we are satisfied that M-1B will come in fairly low in its range, are we going to be willing to have it come in higher in '81?  If we have the maximum shift on M-1B of 5 percentage points, with a midpoint of 5-3/4 percent the midpoint could be 10-3/4 percent If we have the maximum shift on M-1A, the midpoint would be 1-1/2 percent  Mr Chairman, could I make an observation? On M- 1B, if we had known when we set these long-run targets that we would hit the midpoint or the revised midpoint of 5-3/4 percent, I think we would have been reasonably happy with that We had expansion of M-1B in 1978 of 82 percent and in 1979 of 76 percent And if we get it down to 5-3/4 percent [this year], that degree of deceleration seems plenty rapid to me If we do that, then I don't have any problem with decelerating further in 1981 But if it comes in at 2 or 3 percent or something like that [in 1980], we have a problem for 1981 I would like to see us push that [growth rate] up toward the midpoint [while] we're in a recession which I think is probably going to be as serious or more serious than any postwar recession And then next year, I think we can do what we said we would do  That suggests to me, Mr Chairman, that we ought to take a look at the low end of that funds rate range We may not be getting the shift in demand that we thought; we may have our equations misspecified  Steve, what does July look like?  It's easier to remember!  All I can conclude is that the other members of that subcommittee were more influential than the two who are here!  -72-    7/9/80  Mr Chairman, if we don't at least hit that lower part of the ranges--and in fact if we begin to report month by month what the market is apt to perceive as pretty rapid [money growth] rates--I think we will have an extremely severe credibility problem  I'm saying that during the next few months, if [money] growth comes anywhere near what we're projecting, as we approach the midpoint of the target range we're apt to have a problem if we don't explain very carefully that we're just trying to get growth back up within the target range If we do that and then when Paul testifies he doesn't say something about a lower range for next year, we're going to be hit by both sides on the credibility problem, I'm afraid I'd really want to emphasize lower [ranges] if we could possibly persuade everybody to do that  They called us outliers and then took our [projections] out of the figures "
1565,1980-07-25,BLACK," So does Richmond  This is Bob Black I think 1/2 is about right, Mr Chairman "
1584,1980-08-12,BLACK," Mr Chairman, the main point of difference we had with the staff continues to be that we expect less inflation than they have been forecasting recently The Greenbook analysis places almost all the emphasis on the supply side It talks about the effect of rising oil prices and food prices and unit labor costs causing inflation, but it really doesn't address this question of the continued deceleration we have had--and that we see prospectively--in the money supply Nor does it address the shift toward a greater surplus in the high employment budget We would place great weight on this slowdown in the money supply and some also on that shift in the fiscal mix This will represent about the third year of deceleration in the money supply if [it continues] next year If anything was right with that October 6 policy, somewhere along the way we are going see some effect on prices And we think it will come sooner than the staff does It's easy to forget that the rate of increase in prices had hovered at double digits before the last downturn and we got [it] down to 4-1/2 percent but we let the aggregates get away from us and [inflation] went back up Most people don't remember that We also think that if we are partly right on this, we will have less upward pressure on interest rates than the staff expects, both because of the removal of the inflationary premium on long rates and probably less growth in nominal GNP and more growth in real GNP than the staff is projecting  Mr Chairman, I never meant to imply that we had at this point All I meant to imply was that by next year, with a continuation of the policy we've begun, I would expect some significant effect on prices, or else our actions have been completely futile And I don't think they have been  Mr Chairman, I come out very close to the [approach] you advocated I don't see much difference between ""A"" and ""B"" and I have a slight preference for ""A"" I lean, like most here, toward M-1B for the reasons indicated, although I duly heeded your admonition that we ought not to take this at face value There's a temptation, I think, to go with ""B"" because of the inflation we see But if the staff is right in its projections on M-1B, that would mean that its growth would decelerate to a rate of 55 percent this year from 76 percent last year and 81 percent the year before That seems to me sufficiently fast deceleration to work toward gradually reaching a noninflationary rate of expansion in the aggregates And it would set the stage for a further reduction next year, as we have promised every one we would [seek] I do have a little concern about the overshoot in M2 because of the credibility problem, but the overshoot is very small; and as others have stressed, the [narrow] aggregates are looked at much more carefully than M2 And I think the points that Ed Ettin made about M2 are quite valid But if for some unexpected reason M2 did come in high, we might want to take another look at it I also have sympathy for your position that maybe we ought to [reduce] the lower end of that funds rate range I have long stated that I don't favor any range on the funds rate, but I think we might be having in the aggregates the kind of [pattern] Chuck Partee was stressing on the behavior of consumer spending, where we have very rapid declines and then a bounceback So with the abandonment of the special credit restraint program, the aggregates may have taken off more than they ordinarily would have If that is the case, we might have to come down a little more on interest rates in order to keep the aggregates on target Therefore, I would be inclined to drop the lower end to about 7-1/2 percent "
1625,1980-09-16,BLACK," If we hadn't overshot our targets, [the funds rate] would have been up more, too, more than likely I wonder if that didn't contribute to some of the rise in the other rates  Mr Chairman, my point is related to the one that I believe Henry was making It seems to me that we may have held off making the adjustments to the nonborrowed reserve target too long because we expected, on the basis of our projections of the demand for money, that we would get certain behavior That's very hard to [predict], as all of us know It's almost next to impossible to do, I think, so I would favor a little more prompt adjustments to the hard data we have in terms of setting our nonborrowed reserve targets  Mr Chairman, could I just make a brief statement? I think Tony is right that we would get a lot of criticism from the market for more movement in interest rates, but I believe we would smooth out some of these abberations in the money supply  Most people believe that, I think  Mr Chairman, I wonder if I might ask Jim What was the selling rate for automobiles in the first ten days of September?  Mr Chairman, we have no serious disagreement with the Greenbook forecast for the remainder of 1980 As for whether this flurry of favorable news we have seen constitutes an upturn that is already in progress or near, we are inclined to doubt that We think it might be, as Jim Kichline suggested, in part a bounceback from the abandonment of the special credit restraint program And I don't think we have yet seen the full reaction to the deceleration in the aggregates that we have brought about and that we have committed ourselves to doing So the main difference we see from the staff's viewpoint is that we have more damping of inflationary expectations and less inflation than they do As for the reasons, I'd just have to summarize by saying that we have more faith in our post-October 6th actions than I believe the staff does It's easy to forget, as John Balles reminded us awhile ago, that we had a pretty significant deceleration in inflation as late as the '75 downturn before the aggregates got away from us I'm also a bit encouraged by the flurry  -24-    9/16/80  of indicators in the Redbook that we have had some weakening of price pressures at both the retail and the commodity levels Finally, if the staff is right on its forecast of inflation, as most people seem to think--which I guess is more likely in some ways to be right than ours--then I would be very skeptical that we would have as much strength in the real economy as the staff projects  Mr Chairman, I think a very good case can be made for using quarterly averages for two reasons One is that our targets are set in terms of quarterly averages, and the second is that the figures look a little better in a sense If, for example, we were to hit the 5-1/4 percent midpoint that we originally had, it would require a rate of growth in M-1B of only 3 percent between August and December But it would require 49 percent between the third and the fourth quarters because August was very high If we take the 5-3/4 percent midpoint that we talked about earlier, that would involve 48 percent growth between August and December but 68 percent between the third and the fourth quarters That is, what I'm doing is assuming a steady progression from August to December  Well, we set our targets in quarterly figures  Yes, but it's difficult to know what to do with August to December because we don't know what the configuration of the last quarter will be And the figures I use just assume an equal progression  But that assumes we don't do anything about a bulge that appeared early Then we'd have to wrench it later But if we take action promptly, we don't necessarily have to wrench it later  I'm talking about in the future, Nancy My personal feeling is that we're not going to have as much upward pressure on rates as people think because I don't see that much strength in the economy But that's a guess We really can't forecast that with any degree of certainty  I didn't say anything, Mr Chairman, but I will--  Mr Chairman, I really made my main point I come out around ""C,"" [which some speakers have proposed] The main point I want to get across is that there's a lot of repetition in these figures And if we say we want to hit that midpoint of 5-1/4 percent, for August to December that translates to about 3 percent but for the third quarter to the fourth quarter it's a great deal more than that, about 49 percent That doesn't sound so bad  Yes, M-1B And if we hit the 5-3/4 percent midpoint, that would give us a quarterly growth rate of 68 percent, which sounds fairly high But that translates into growth from August to December of 48 percent if you assume equal [monthly] increments  That's what it amounts to And I'm saying that without much growth, because August was so high, we can get a good quarterly growth rate with figures that look scandalously low on an August-to-December basis That's the point I wanted to get across  The other point I was going to make is about credibility If [monetary growth] comes in as high as a lot of people expect, I think we're going to have a pretty serious problem We may have not only high inflation but high interest rates as well Whereas if we [hit our target], I think we're going to see some effects on inflation and we may end up just with higher rates, without as much inflation But this route is going to give us both "
1650,1980-10-21,BLACK," Mr Chairman, looking over the economy sector by sector, I don't see much fundamental strength in the short run So I wouldn't be surprised to see one quarter between now and the spring that might come in with negative growth What happens beyond then I think depends on whether or not we have any discernible success in dealing with inflation We [in Richmond] have been expecting less inflation and more real growth than the Board staff over most of this recent period because we thought it likely that the aggregates would come in significantly lower than they have Since they've come in higher than we thought, and in view of the deteriorating budgetary prospects, we've come closer and closer to what the Board staff has been projecting in the way of inflation and less on real economic growth But my feeling still is that we're probably going to have a little less inflation and a little more real economic growth than the staff has projected  So far as the overall policy posture is concerned, I think it's imperative that we do what we can to hit these long-run targets on M-1A and M-1B, although I think we can tolerate some overshoot on M2 But if only M-1A comes in within the target ranges, then I doubt --no matter how much we justify it by the rapid growth in other kinds of transaction balances--that we'll stand much chance of maintaining any credibility Also, I would say that the recent rise in interest rates we've had might be due largely to the public's perception of a deteriorating budgetary situation, more than just an expanded demand for money There's also a feeling, given the rapid growth in the aggregates, that we will have to react to that  By changing the nonborrowed reserve path or borrowings?  But you would not lower the nonborrowed target under that? "
1675,1980-11-18,BLACK," Scott, would you say that our trading partners are estimating our current account improvement at close to the same magnitude as the staff estimates?  Thank you  Second  When we publish these figures, are we going to break down the reserve figures for the old members and then the new reporters separately?  -15-    11/18/80  That is what I was thinking about  I was just thinking about the problem of interpreting these for people on the outside  Let's just publish them when they're good!  Mr Chairman, we have gotten right far off [the topic] My comment was related to a technique on monetary policy I don't know whether you feel we have time for anything more on that or not I can ask at a later time It's an important point, but we have spent right much time, so I'll wait  It seems that way The first question is How much confidence can we have in the relationship between the rates of growth in the aggregates and the federal funds range as specified by the alternatives? Everybody realizes that [estimating this relationship] is a very risky business at best and that we probably ask the staff to accomplish the impossible there The second question is What are the risks involved if we miss the paths specified in the alternative we choose, whatever that happens to be? I would consider a further miss on the up side to be pretty significant--much more so, of course, if we go with ""A,"" less so if we go with ""B,"" and maybe not so significant if we go with ""C"" But perhaps the most important issue of all is the likely effects on inflationary expectations of whatever policy option we select They would be clearly worse under ""A"" That would involve raising the path for M-1A for the fourth straight month in the face of overshoots I looked back and found that we had raised the December target figure for M-lA by a total of $57 billion over the last three meetings If we do more of that, it certainly would not augur well for inflationary psychology Alternative B would involve not adjusting the target in the face of some overshoots and would, of course, be less detrimental to inflationary psychology I think ""C"" would work positively [in that regard], and although I don't think there is any earthly way we could hit the target as specified by the end of the year, we could conceivably be within the range for M-1B  In any event, I think it would be better if we were perceived as working toward a range even if we miss it, as I suspect we necessarily will Finally, there is the question of what this implies for the 1981 targeting problems, which we've talked about All of these options are going to involve some upward base drift, a problem with which we have contended for many years Presumably ""C"" would involve less upward drift, although I doubt there is going to be a great deal of difference So, I would come out for ""C"" I wouldn't object to widening the federal funds range; I have never objected to that I don't like a range anyway, so to cover both ""B"" and ""C"" 13 to 19 percent would seem good to me So far as the borrowing figure is concerned, I would start off where we are now on borrowing But then if borrowing deviates from the figure we select initially, I think we ought to adjust the nonborrowed reserve target in the opposite direction by that full amount In looking at the reasons for misses in the past, I think part of the blame lies with the Committee in not having selected the proper range, but in retrospect I believe we have not been sufficiently active in adjusting our nonborrowed reserves target to compensate for misses in the borrowing figure  -34-    11/18/80  That's whacking it lightly "
1700,1980-11-26,BLACK," Paul, we did a lot of the small [unintelligible] We project that correspondents might be tightening in that direction; it depends on where the borrowing really is But I agree in that I think we ought to go 18; I hope we don't have to go higher "
1741,1980-12-12,BLACK, Same in Richmond    12/12/80 
1759,1980-12-18,BLACK," Mr Chairman, I think the behavior of the economy in '81 is going to be determined more than anything else by what happens to inflationary expectations If we can somehow or other convince the public that we are dealing effectively with inflation, or trying to, I think expectations are going to improve and we may have even more [growth] than the staff is projecting, although I certainly agree that we're likely to have a dip in the first part of the year as the staff is projecting But I think we'll have more real growth, and I hope less inflation, in the last half This point is made very well in paragraph 9 of the Bluebook And I would like to emphasize that, because to me the key factors in determining the outlook are the people's inflationary expectations and how the public views the stance of Federal Reserve policy Because I feel so strongly about that, I'm concerned about the possibility of base drift, although we thought we had eliminated it when we went to the Humphrey-Hawkins Act and got away from the quarterly shifting of targets I am concerned that that could be a factor  As I know all of you noticed as you went through the Bluebook, most of it is written as if we would use as our jumping off place the actual behavior of the aggregates--where they actually ended  -33-    12/18-19/80  up at year-end And like Frank Morris, I would make a pitch that we should avoid doing that at this time My reason, if we use strategy I, just to take an example, [can be seen] in the charts that I distributed yesterday I suspect most of you probably don't have them before you now, but I have shown the long-run targets for '80 on the left-hand side of each of those first two charts, in the first case for M-1A and in the second case for M-1B We have adjusted those ranges for the ATS and NOW accounts as we think they actually affected those [aggregates] during those years And then there is a second cone on each chart, which uses as the end points the end points that the Board's staff has shown in strategy I But, of course, the base was the actual behavior of the aggregates, which is quite different from what you would see if you drew the cone to the midpoints And like Frank, I think we really ought to eliminate this base drift  So I would suggest that we put the jumping-off place as the midpoint of the targets for 1980, although one could certainly argue that it might be moved up somewhat so long as we had it within that 1980 range I worry that if we don't do something like that, then our critics are going to confront us with pictures like the one I've drawn here, though maybe in a different form And I think that could be rather damaging to our credibility So far as setting the '81 targets, if you look at charts 3 and 4, you'll see what I would like to see us do I think the most reasonable thing is to reiterate the targets that we selected in July, lowering these effective rates by 1/2 percentage point in both cases The cones on the right show what we would have in the case of both M-1A and M-1B if we came down 1/2 percentage point  Yes, I think [I could] address it a little better, Henry, when we get to the short-run part, which I was not going to go into here But we obviously have to take off from where we are And what I would suggest for the short run is that we try to move the aggregates back somewhere within those ranges, or whatever ranges we agree on, which as Nancy points out does not involve much growth for the first three quarters of the year But if you go back and look over a longer period of time, back to August and September, it involves ironing out the excess Viewed in reference to that longer period of time, that's not a very restrictive policy particularly  Well, it's even less It depends on how we come back; it can even be negative, Mr Chairman But what I was saying--  -34-    12/18-19/80  Well, I think we're in a downturn right now And I would guess--  Well, I think one of the main reasons rates are high is because we have put out what the public perceives as too much money If we show that we are going to deal with that, I would expect interest rates to come down largely in response to the elimination of part of the expectations effect problem  Yes, I really do I think that's the main reason rates are high But that's certainly a debatable point In any case, I would recommend that we stick with the ranges we decided on before And I've shown that in the form of cones on the last two charts That brings down the effective [growth] rate by 1/2 or 1 percentage point I think it would be unwise to widen the range as Steve suggested-- although I know exactly why he suggested it--because our critics would say we were trying to obfuscate or that we really didn't have any targets in mind And, of course, we do have targets in mind, but we don't know exactly what the figures are; I realize that I'm sympathetic with that and also with what Steve perceives as a great deal of difficulty in explaining this NOW account effect to the public or even to those of us in this room I find myself getting confused every time I go around on it! So when we announce the targets we decide on, [I would] express them in terms of effective rates as the staff is advocating and as Frank advocated I would differ a little from Frank in that I'd put out a statement at the time saying that it looks to us as if the actual figures for M-1B might run, say, 2 percentage points higher And if [the adjustments turn out] as expected, then the ranges we are setting for M-1B really ought to be tilted up about 2 percentage points or whatever the incoming evidence suggests And similarly, in the case of M-1A we would suggest that the rates might come in around 4 percentage points [lower] If we don't say something like that, the people who are trying to track what we are doing on a week-to-week basis--and I'm talking about professionals here to a large extent--are going to see incoming figures that are affected to whatever extent they will be by the NOW accounts And if they try to plot those figures in cones or what have you that haven't been adjusted for what these likely [NOW] effects are, then they're going to reach incorrect conclusions about--  I understand that But I'd favor being a little more open than you suggested, although when we are so confused here there's certainly some argument for perhaps not being that open But I do think the data will be misinterpreted unless we at least make some mention of that, as we've always done Mr Chairman, when you testified on this, you said that we would have to adjust these data And I believe we ought to say it even a little more strongly than we have in the past People are going to be tracking them and the figures are not going to look like our targets--even assuming we get perfect success--unless we have told them something about how the targets have to be adjusted It's going to be confusing as the devil I'm under no illusions that it will be simple, but I just don't see any alternative to doing that sort of thing  What is the magnitude of the decline the markets seem to be expecting? "
1786,1981-02-02,BLACK," Steve, you made the point a while ago that under the existing institutional set-up the main thing--or maybe even the only thing--that brings the money supply back to target, if it deviates, is a change in interest rates If I understand the way you view this, my guess is that you would think about that mainly as the effect of interest rates on the level of money demanded Do you also think that the changes in the level of interest rates have any significant effect on the supply function of money by affecting banks and other financial institutions' attitudes with regard to how much money they create?  I think that probably is a lot of it  Yes, but they know that when they go into the reserve period because that's lagged  Well, rate volatility could be involved, too  Mr Chairman, I was just going to say that the people with whom I have talked would bear out what Governor Gramley suspects That these fluctuating rates made it very difficult for them to plan But I think the key issue, if we are successful in this experiment we began back on October 6, 1979, is whether over the longer run we really would have more fluctuation in long-term rates My feeling is very definitely that we would have less But I do think unquestionably that [the greater fluctuation] has affected business planning Those are my comments  Some people plan ahead  Mr Chairman, I think conceptually we can control the rate of growth in the aggregates with either a federal funds handle or with a reserve handle of some sort However, it's not only the unwillingness to move the federal funds rate that makes it an impractical way of doing it, but also that we don't know how much we ought to move it The federal funds rate that is compatible with some reasonable rate of growth in the monetary aggregates somehow defined is not a single level; it's a pattern of rates over time And I just despair of ever knowing that, so I think we ought to stick with more or less our same procedures I would like to suggest at the appropriate time a couple of modifications that I think would improve the procedures The problem with the [funds rate] to me is that we don't know how high or how low it ought to be at any time; and I know nothing in past experience, either empirically or in theory, that would give any basis for selecting that level  Well, I'm going to take care of that in the next exercise!  Mr Chairman, may I make a statement on that?  It seems to me that all these points we've been making have a good deal of merit under the lagged reserve accounting system Anything we can do to make the volume of borrowing more predictable within reason is certainly to be desired I think it's important that we adjust our nonborrowed reserve target more promptly, as we agreed, to offset unexpected changes in borrowing And I would say we have to be prepared to use a pretty wide federal funds rate range But all of these things certainly seem to me still to engage us in the very difficult practice of trying to produce a demand curve and trying to say something about what the nature of that demand curve for money really is And I don't think we are going to be able to do that very successfully So to me the only real solution out of our dilemma, if we really want to control the aggregates, is to move toward contemporaneous reserve requirements There is a way I think that can be done--and this is just a tentative thought--that would be palatable to our constituents That would be to make the period about one month but still require them to report their deposits daily That would reduce some of the burden of shifting from the lagged [accounting], which is certainly easier for them to handle And it would also make it easier for us to control the total supply of reserves because then our deviation in the volume of borrowing could be offset more easily, particularly if it occurred in the first part of the period So, I think that's really something we ought to move toward  Just accept it on faith, Mr Chairman!  Well, I think it makes it possible to hit a total reserves target And if we're going to control the aggregates, I think we have to be able to do it We really can't do it as well as I would like under lagged reserve requirements, although I think we can  -59-    2/2-3/81  do better than we have been doing And I say this as somebody who was involved in introducing lagged reserve requirements; I have a bias in favor of keeping them But I think we now have a situation where we can give the banks something that's almost as palatable and not have a bad public relations effect and at the same time improve our control  Well, there are a couple of positive things One is that I think we've tended to hide behind lagged reserve accounting sometimes and used that as an excuse for not really pursuing our aggregate targets very actively I'd like to eliminate that little temptation, which I think we all share The second thing is that if we did this, we'd get the monetarists off our back on that particular issue and maybe they could then make some positive contribution toward improving the control mechanism  Yes, it does  It seems to me, Mr Chairman, that if we did this, we wouldn't have to go through the process of trying to estimate what the demand for money looks like, what it's shaped like, and all those things We would make our best estimate of the reserves it takes to give us the [desired] growth in the aggregates And what happens is that the demand for money, whatever the shape [of the curve] is, will determine the level of the federal funds rate  No, I'm not ruling that out; I recognize that there are slippages But I think we'd come very close to hitting a total reserves target, particularly on a monthly basis And I don't mean a flat, identical percentage increase each month I think we would have to adjust that total reserves figure for the non-monetary liabilities and what they used up or released in the way of reserves We'd have to construct the target path very much as we do now But we wouldn't have the problem of the banks being able to borrow and [raise] the reserve targets  Well, they wouldn't [raise it] all that far, though, because--  Well, I think they could [raise it] to some extent But just the lengthening--  Well, the point that you frequently make is that the banks are going to get the total reserves that they need that are based on deposits two weeks earlier And in this case, if a bank is hell bent to make loans because it has loan demand, it's going to go ahead and probably borrow some at the window But we can offset that during the period because we can cut the nonborrowed reserve part of that And that's going to set in motion a process regarding bank credit that is going to reduce required reserves during that period There's no way we can reduce them under lagged reserves  Yes, I know It's a matter of degree And I think we can operate under lagged reserves; I never would have advocated that originally if I hadn't thought so But I believe we can do it a good deal better under contemporaneous; and I think the longer period gives banks a chance to do some arbitrage over time that might iron out some of the interest rate fluctuations that are of concern to a lot of us around the table  It was a bank relations move, basically, Tony We conjured up a lot of reasons  Not to the same extent We were also operating on a net borrowed reserve target, too And we could hit that more precisely [with lagged reserves] It didn't have the same meaning, to be sure, because required reserves had been determined on the basis of deposits two weeks earlier But it was easier to hit it But the basic reason was that it was very difficult, as Bill Ford said awhile ago, particularly for the large banks with branch systems to know what their required reserves were even by the end of the period So they estimated And it's still--  It was done for bank relations purposes mainly  I don't think there's any doubt about that  But we can squeeze them by cutting the nonborrowed reserves  Do you think we can't really do that now?  We've got to let them have the total reserves they need to meet their requirements  There's nothing in this procedure that would preclude putting in a range on the federal funds rate if we did not want to offset the borrowings that the banks would have the option of entering into We would not have to do that fully I'm just saying that we could do it virtually 100 percent over a monthly period if we wanted to Now, that might involve more volatility in interest rates than a lot of people would like to see But at least the mechanism is better because we don't have to fool around with trying to estimate the demand for money, which I just don't think we're ever going to be able to do The appetite in the short run for money is just unpredictable in my judgment And to me the necessity of doing that-- coming up with a federal funds rate that would tell us what the borrowing is going to be--is a key part of the present processes And  -66-    2/2-3/81  we've been notably unsuccessful in that I think we can improve it, but I don't think we can ever be terribly successful with it  I agree with that, Mr Chairman; I didn't mean to suggest otherwise And I didn't mean to suggest that a one-month period was absolutely right because we haven't had a study on that But under the present procedures, we have to estimate a demand and a supply function for money to operate, if I understand correctly Under CRR, all we have to do is estimate the supply We have eliminated the most difficult estimating problem But far be it for me to say that the estimating problem would not still be difficult I think it would be, but I think it would be more manageable It takes a lot for me to eat crow on this because I was involved, as some of you may remember, in this [move to] lagged reserve accounting And I now think we probably were wrong on it But it was done to make things easier for the banks, basically  That's right We figure out what volume of reserves we think it would take to get the growth in the money supply we want and put out that volume of reserves There are things that can offset it, as we all know Borrowing can go up and we'd have to offset that; or we could have an unexpected change in the level of float and we'd have to offset that I don't mean to suggest that we can hit it with perfect precision But if we do [go to CRR], it seems to me that the demand for money basically determines the level of the federal funds rate I recognize, as I said earlier, that some might want to put a constraint on that But we could certainly--  Yes Not everybody wants to do that; I'm just saying that some want to put a constraint on it But we could do that, which means that we would not pursue the supply of reserves as actively as, say, Larry Roos would like or as I would like We would at least tip our hat toward what this procedure was doing in the way of creating volatility in the federal funds rate We would diminish the ardor of our pursuit for a while in deference to what it was doing  -67-    2/2-3/81  to interest rates I think that's perfectly compatible and a person can argue for that As I admitted to Lyle a while ago, I think these large gyrations we've had in interest rates have been very upsetting to businessmen who are trying to plan, and I would like to see those gyrations eliminated The best way to eliminate them is to do what we've said we wanted to do Get the aggregates down to a lower rate of growth so that we get rid of some of the inflation I think that will do more to remove volatility in long-term rates than anything else That's something I can't prove empirically but it certainly seemed to be true in 1960-64 when we did have a relatively low rate of growth in the aggregates  I hope none of you will tell [Irv] Auerbach how I voted!  Yes, that's what I had--  -71-    2/2-3/81  I think Governor Schultz has come up with a sensible suggestion for most of us Going with what he said is all we can do for a while anyway We could not switch to this any time soon  No But in the meantime, I would favor doing what he suggested as an interim step And if things turn out better, then maybe we don't need to do it I have long had a bias in favor of lagged reserve accounting, but--  This would be lowering requirements  But they have a one-month long lag  Isn't there some conflict between that and adjusting the nonborrowed reserve target to a larger extent and perhaps more frequently?  Yes, I see the distinction I was somewhat confused on this  Henry, if we had contemporaneous reserve accounting and no limit on the federal funds rate, I'd be with you 100 percent  [With no such constraint,] we really wouldn't be telling the market anything They would know as much as we know; we wouldn't know which way rates--short-term rates anyway--were going to go on that basis  Mr Chairman, I think your comment a while ago provided a good backdrop for the statement of these guidelines We have to show some lowering in the ranges Trying to get at how much that ought to be is a very difficult question It's helpful if we go back and look at what we got in 1979 and 1980 I'm not sure I have the right figures on this, because I'm not sure exactly what the NOW account adjustment should have been for 1979 But as best we can estimate--Steve, you can correct me if this is wrong--it looks as if M-1B was running about 65 percent in 1979, abstracting from NOWs and that sort of thing, and came out at about 68 percent in 1980 Comparable figures for M-1A would have been 6-1/2 percent--although I'm not quite certain of that one--for 1979 and 6-1/4 percent for 1980 On M2, we don't have that adjustment problem; M2 grew 9 percent in 1979 and 98 percent in 1980 So, in general, we could say that there was a small deceleration in M-1A and there was a small acceleration in M-1B probably  They are not in there  What we did--and I'm not sure we are right--was to construct that, but the latest information we had was that about 45 percent was assumed to have come [from] savings I wouldn't put too much stock in the figures I got; the main point I am trying to make is that there has been either no deceleration or comparatively little  I don't think that changes my point, but I would like to know those figures and would welcome having them Anyway, there hasn't been a whole lot [of deceleration], so I would opt for  -114-    2/2-3/81  alternative II One could argue that that's too much deceleration, but another point--the matter of base drift, which I think our critics are going to raise on this--is that lowering the range by 1 point in a sense compensates in large part for that upward drift in the base for both M-1A and M-1B since the ranges in alternative II would encompass a 1/2 percentage point downdrift in our [tentative] '81 targets, using the midpoint of the fourth quarter of last year as the base For example, if we came out right at the midpoint of the target I'm suggesting, it would involve actual growth of M-1B from the fourth quarter of 1980 figure of about 32 percent, which would be within the range of 3 to 5-1/2 percent But to a large extent it's to get rid of that base drift that we advocate this I don't think we could really say that we want to raise the rate of growth expressed from that midpoint That just doesn't make any sense We are up here somewhere and we can't say Well, the targets start down here But in choosing how much we want them to come down, I think we have to consider that  So far as what we publish for the public, that is a devilishly difficult question I reached a point that is somewhat of a compromise of what Larry Roos said in that I think in choosing our targets we have to abstract from the NOW accounts But in expressing these targets, I can visualize all the close Fed observers out there setting up megaphones in charts like those in the lower tier of the ones in the Bluebook and putting in the figures as they come in And unless we give them those ranges at the bottom, with all the caveats that ought to go with them, they are going to have problems fitting the figures into anything like this I think we ought to say one further thing, which relates to something I believe you were trying to get at as we closed yesterday That we think this is loaded heavily on the front end That is, we expect to have excessive growth in M-1B early and then to see it come back within the target, we hope; similarly, we expect very weak growth [in M-1A] in the first part of the year and we are going to be outside our range but hope to be in [by year-end] I don't know of an easy way to do it It's going to be awfully confusing But on balance that seems to me the best way to do it; I think it is what Nancy was advocating  That's right, yes sir  I would just accept the ranges that the staff has worked out as compatible, as indicated in alternative II  No, I don't really have any insight that would lead me to suspect their figures I'd rather trust theirs than ours If it were not for the base drift, I would opt for alternative I I think that would be sufficient deceleration It's not implausible to argue [for a deceleration] since we overshot In a sense, we can't get away from that and we shouldn't slow it down too fast But I do think people are going to raise that matter of base drift; and unless  -115-    2/2-3/81  we can say we somehow considered it, I think we are going to have some problems on that from the public This seems to me an easier way of doing it because the only kind of growth rates that are going to make sense to a layman are the growth rates from where we ended up That's about all I believe any layman is going to understand Tomorrow, I'm not going to understand!  Bob, do you mean that each week you would publish a figure abstracting from NOW accounts?  Mr Chairman, if I understand what you're saying, it's what we originally thought about presenting to this Committee and decided it was so complicated we couldn't explain it  No, I'm not talking about what I said here  -133-    2/2-3/81 -134-  What we originally thought we would do in the way of presenting charts is what you said, I think I have some sympathy for it, but we decided we couldn't explain it to the Committee But maybe we can explain it to the public The public could--  What you have is a kinked two-year megaphone  The Act requires it  Mr Chairman, I would favor ""B"" That's the alternative that would have gotten us to the midpoint of alternative II, which I favored Since the Committee voted for alternative I, I wouldn't want to go quite to the midpoint of that So I'd stick with ""B"" And I think there's a great deal of merit to keeping that federal funds ceiling at 20 percent I haven't much sympathy with ceilings but I don't think this is the time to raise it  -159-    2/2-3/81 "
1823,1981-02-24,BLACK," Mr Chairman, I'm trying to guess what we will do when the money supply strengthens And not knowing that makes it difficult for me to decide My sympathies lie with what Larry Roos said, but I suspect that we might be inclined to drag our feet a little too much on the up side If that tended to be correct, then what you suggested might be the best position with which to temporize "
1845,1981-03-31,BLACK," But we're going to say that a lot better than we were saying it  Well, a lot of them are not even offering NOWs but are sticking with ATS accounts because that stays in for that very reason  I can't answer that question, Mr Chairman I had something in mind I wanted to ask and get an answer on Bill Ford made the main point I had, but I would add that what really concerns us is the bulge that we ordinarily get in M-1B in April on an unadjusted basis If the NOW account portion is not somehow seasonally adjusted, that bulge is going to be overstated and the psychological effects on the market concern us We were going to suggest that we try some kind of ad hoc adjustment on that, Steve, along the lines that you were playing with, just to avoid that adverse effect We played with it by applying the demand deposit seasonal adjustment to that portion of the NOW accounts that we thought came out of demand deposits and the savings deposits seasonal adjustment to the other portion We estimated that in April, which was the month that concerned us, it would probably be overstated by about 3-1/2 percentage points, and that seemed to be a very bad time for that  -29-    3/31/81  figure to be appearing because we seem to be making some progress toward our ultimate objective We were hoping we could do something about that, although--  No If we don't seasonally adjust the NOW portion, the seasonal will pull [it up] April has a very high seasonal adjustment factor and if we don't apply that to the NOW account portion, then we estimated--this may not be exactly right--  --that it would be overstated by about 3-1/2 percent above what it really was in fact, as nearly as we could estimate at all I'm well aware that we don't have all the information we need for any kind of rigorous seasonal adjustment, but that one month really concerns us It doesn't make that much difference in what The Wall Street Journal is covering, I don't think But it could at that particular juncture  This futility that we all encounter in trying to forecast the economic outlook is perfectly understandable That reinforces my basic belief that we ought never to lose sight of something that I think we all agree on That we have to get these aggregates down over the long run If we work in that direction, then we have an automatic stabilizer in place And that is something we sometimes forget, I think If the economy does turn out to be stronger, as it may, then that would tend to exert some kind of braking action; and if it turns out to be weaker, which I think you made a good case for, Frank, then we have an automatic stabilizer on the down side So, in choosing our short-run targets, we always ought to bear in mind the risk involved We have had three years in which we haven't been able to reduce the rate of growth in the aggregates as much as we wanted We came in a little above target last time, so that leads me to suggest that we ought to resolve the risk by choosing a little lower rate than we otherwise might And I think around 6 percent on an unadjusted basis, as Larry suggested, would be about right between February and June  -38-    3/31/81  Right Unadjusted  A little above ""C"" or between ""B"" and ""C""  Yes, I'm talking about February to June  Let me get my [Bluebook]  Page 7 is what I'm talking about  You want to look at February to June or March to June  Yes, I thought I was in between ""B"" and ""C"" [with] the 6 percent on the unadjusted The unadjusted is at the top, isn't it, and the adjusted is at the bottom? I meant 6 percent on an unadjusted basis    3/31/81  Well, I did not mean to be below ""C"" I'm confused on this It's devilishly confusing anyway I thought what I was choosing was something between ""B"" and ""C"" on M-1B on chart 1  Okay Well, somewhere in between there, erring a little toward ""C"" is really what I had in mind  I [understand] this well periodically and then I get myself confused It's tricky business "
1871,1981-04-28,BLACK," Mr Chairman, Bob Black I commend you for this I think this really ought to be done  But if we end up with 136 percent in April, that will look a lot better than 18 percent  Mr Chairman, he said what had been done couldn't be undone He must know what the April figure is!  Mr Chairman, could I ask Steve one minor technical question? Steve, it looked to us as if the 18 percent April figure was based on a 72-1/2 and 27-1/2 percent break rather than a 70 and 30 percent break If we are right on that, you'd get a little lower figure than this with a 70/30 split  Right, [unintelligible] comes out 74 I don't know exactly what it would do on that seasonally adjusted figure that had been previously shifted; we figured about 06 of a percentage point on that one  Okay  This is Bob Black I do, too I think these seasonals will scare the devil out of the market even though they're a touch below what we originally thought  -12-    4/28/81 "
1911,1981-05-18,BLACK," Mr Chairman, I wonder if I could ask Jim Kichline to indicate those areas where he thinks the first-quarter GNP will be revised upward?    5/18/81  What kind of percentage are you thinking it will change to?  It will be interesting to see if we get any dissents, given the nature of the decision!  Peter, you say the [concept of a] checkpoint is there, but I don't read it quite that strongly  Mr Chairman, I feel this May-June period is very crucial in our efforts to convince the market that we are bound and determined to hit these targets that we've set And given the large bulge we had in the April numbers, I feel we simply can't tolerate any more than a modest expansion in M-1B Along with the fiscal stance that the market perceives, the behavior of the aggregates is going to be the most important thing determining the business outlook rather than all those things we hammered through in our go-around earlier this morning So, I think we really ought to try very strongly to hit these March-June targets that we established at our March meeting, which would incline me to favor alternative C  I think that's right  But wouldn't 3 percent itself be inconsistent?  Mr Chairman, the way you have separated that and made it into two statements to my view and Lyle's--he and I were chatting--eliminates the problem he raised of the 3 percent not really being consistent If you say the Committee would also accept a lower figure, which in a sense would be consistent with the 5-1/2 percent, I think you have eliminated the problem--assuming that you can get people to vote for the 3 percent  Which would be consistent  Yes, that's what I was thinking  I like this, Mr Chairman It's a logical step in the process of moving where I think we eventually ought to be, if we can get the aggregates under control, of not having any limits It  -46-    5/18/81  fits in with the step where we define the limits as a consultation point and it allows the Desk to move a bit before we have that consultation rather than delaying it maybe for a couple of days  I mean that if you decided to have a consultation, you might notify us a day or so ahead, and meanwhile the Desk might go ahead and go outside [the funds range]  But this makes it clearer to the market  I think that's right  I don't think there's a difference, but I think it's worded a little better  There's an exception  6-1/2 percent is [unintelligible] "
1950,1981-07-06,BLACK," Paul, how did you interpret this ""3 percent or lower"" [reference to M-1B growth in the directive]? Was there any floor in your mind on that ""or lower""? When we voted on the 3 percent or less, most of us would not have anticipated the kind of weakness we had in the aggregates, nor probably would we have voted for that ahead of time had we known it Yet, as the aggregates began to come in more weakly, you lowered our nonborrowed targets to account for that weakness, which seemed counterproductive to me if you had in mind some floor not too far below 3 percent If you had in mind no floor, that seems appropriate  After you constructed the path on 3-1/2 percent and you got persistently [low] figures, you still moved it down somewhat after that, didn't you?  Didn't you?  Mr Chairman, I think the key is what happens to inflationary expectations If we keep the money supply on target, as I think we will, I believe we're going to see lower interest rates and drastically improved inflationary expectations So, I come out fairly close to John Balles and Jerry on that My figures are a little different I didn't have to contend with a speed-up in velocity, John, because we put our nominal GNP at 8 percent, which is a little less than the Board staff [forecast] But we come out with real growth of about 3 percent for '82, about the same on nominal GNP both years, and an implicit price deflator of 5 percent in '81 The latter is probably whistling Dixie, but I think we could see some drastic improvement there  To hit the bottom part of the present range of 3-1/2 percent--  Mr Chairman, I am very sympathetic to your expression and Larry Roos' expression of the way in which we ought to err if we have to I would take a different position on the ranges, however, and suggest that the more prudent thing to do in light of the weakness in the aggregates in the first half may be to take the bottom half of this range that we previously adopted That would mean that if M-1B could grow 104 percent, it would hit the midpoint of the present ranges; it would end up considerably below that, of course, if [second-half growth] came in below that The reason I think this is important is that even to hit the bottom part of that range, we have to have a pretty good rate of increase in terms of how the market judges that We would have to have [growth at a rate of] 74 percent between now and December And since they remember what we did last year, if they start seeing figures like that and we have not taken any explicit action to lower that range, I think that would disturb them more than if we do lower it It is quite true, as Larry says, that if we explain this at an early stage, that will help some But all too often the market doesn't seem to listen to these explanations; they just look at the cold figures So, I would say we really ought to  -41-    7/6-7/81  make [our objective] explicit and try to come in somewhere in that lower half I would rather come in a little above the lower part of it, though, and would want growth a little higher than that of alternative 2, which would bring us nearly to the lower part of the M-1B range So far as the ranges for M2 and M3 are concerned, I'd leave those unchanged If we come in somewhere in the lower part of the existing M-1B range, that would enhance the chances that M2 and M3 would come in within the ranges that we specified; if they should turn out to be lower than that, then we have plenty of range to accommodate that, too  Yes, I'd cut it off at the midpoint of 4-3/4 percent and have the range be 3-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent and try to come in somewhere within it If we had had stronger performance in the aggregates up until now, I would not be as sympathetic to that, but--  Next year I would cut [the range for] M-1B down to 3 to 4-1/2 percent That's not exactly what any of these alternatives specify  Yes, 3 to 4-1/2 percent for M-1B and then I would take the alternative III [ranges for the other aggregates] but I'd clip the top half of M2, M3, and bank credit by about 1 percentage point and leave it there Most of those ranges might be pretty reasonable They are not all that far apart so I don't feel as strongly about that as I do about the desirability of emphasizing, either through explicitly cutting the range or through stating it very clearly, that we are aiming at somewhere in the bottom half this year That's really the important point  You'd leave the upper part of the range unchanged then, Fred?  If he wants to get rid of M2, he can do so  Even I have that much!  Mr Chairman, I think the near-term growth rate [for M-1B] shown in alternative B would be about right and, as Steve indicated a moment ago, that would give us a fourth quarter '80 to fourth quarter '81 growth rate of 39 percent, which would put us a little above the floor of our current range I think the more important question may be what we do with the federal funds rate range As I have stated several times, I favor elimination of these funds rate ranges, and we have moved several steps in that general direction We first widened them, and then we had the top and lower limits as points where we would check, and now we have moved into the realm where they are points where you may ask us to consult I'd like to go a step further and just eliminate those altogether But I recognize that that's probably not going to be the consensus of the group So, I would put the range at about 14 to 20 percent  Mr Chairman, to put this in a slightly different light, but I think it reinforces what you're saying If we had drawn our cone not from where we ended up in the fourth quarter but from the midpoint of the range, [unintelligible] is 3-1/2 percent, which is now the lower part of our 1981 range It would be a little above the midpoint of that range--  If we go with ""C,"" we need to lower the bottom of the M-1B range  That touches upon the reason I want to lower the top of that range somewhat because I foresee that we would have to have very high rates And if the range had been dropped, it would be more acceptable to the market  If we don't lower the top bound, we could have 124 percent growth between June and December on that  Well, I would just like the market to know we aren't even thinking about that And if we hit the middle of the range, we could have, as I suggested, 104 percent  I was trying to help you with your problem; I was saying that it doesn't look as bad against that background as it does if we don't lower that top  If we get 7 percent, it's still coming in below the lower limit of our long-term ranges It takes 74 percent to hit the lower limit I don't know whether we really want to set it that low just from the standpoint of appearance because it's deliberately saying we're not going to hit our target  Well, I prefer Fred's suggestion Or Willis' suggestion could take care of that aspect, if that's what we want to do with it  One thing that has been overlooked is the assumption that the inflation rate will be as high as the staff has  -88-    7/6-7/81  said If it's lower than that, one doesn't have to make such heroic assumptions about the increase in velocity  Well, then you have to be really--  I'd like to make one statement What we have--  No, I am going to leave that one alone What we have voted for would involve a rate of growth of 39 percent between the fourth quarter of 1980 and the fourth quarter of 1981 No, wait a minute; I'm okay I got mixed up "
1977,1981-07-17,BLACK," We're still above the short-run range but below the long-run range  Right  Mr Chairman, this is Bob Black Under ordinary circumstances, I would agree with Chuck and Lyle and Tony But bearing in mind what happened last year, I think the market is watching pretty closely And some little move now, even if we have to reverse it shortly, would probably be pretty wise, much as you suggested "
1991,1981-08-18,BLACK," This is just the way you treated First Pennsylvania  Is it two weeks or ten days?  Ten business days  We'd have to call them something other than Federal Reserve notes!  Commercial paper  Well, as a practical matter, does the Humphrey- Hawkins legislation really give us the right to abandon one of them completely?  Mr Chairman, I think Lyle is getting at the heart of the issue If we should get some change in inflationary expectations and lower rates, we could see a much lower rate of growth in M2 than we're projecting, although I'm a little fearful that what Chuck suggested might really happen But it is dependent upon an interest rate assumption that probably will not hold If we convince the public [unintelligible] that we're really serious, I think some of those rates will come down  Well, if the rates were lower, I don't think people would be quite as anxious to go into [M2 deposits] They would just as soon--  Yes, or they'd hold money There wouldn't be as much incentive to--  That's what I was thinking  -13-    8/18/81  That's what our small bankers think is happening At every one of our board meetings the two small bankers say people are fooling themselves if they think it's coming partly out of savings; it's all out of demand Of course, that's based on their own experience and nothing else  Mr Chairman, I've been a little puzzled by these various statistics showing more strength than I [anticipated] It seems to me that both consumer and business pessimism is at a fairly high level right now I know it was particularly marked at our directors meeting this last time; almost everybody there was pessimistic for some reason or other And there was a very somber note in the Redbook this time Also, the point that Si just made about bankruptcies is part of the tip of the iceberg; there may be some repercussions when some of these begin to appear, as they inevitably have to, with the small business situation and the high rates that people are paying So, my guess is that the apparent strength in employment and sales in July may be temporary We've had a pretty sharp deceleration in the aggregates, and real interest rates are pretty darn high, so I would expect the economy to weaken somewhat further in the third quarter I think the staff's forecast of an essentially flat economy in the third quarter is about the best that we could expect and my guess is that it will be a little weaker than that But looking at it out a little further, I think we might get a little more rebound than they are projecting, too, particularly if inflation continues to moderate If this sluggishness in economic activity that I think might happen does materialize, there ought to be some downward pressure on interest rates and that ought to help And if we can get any significant move toward deregulation, that's a further factor So, I guess I'm pessimistic in the short run but maybe a little more optimistic in the long run than [the staff]  Well, action in going from is probably significant  They're thinking in terms of 60 stories and not 75; that is what I was--  How many strange new accents do you hear in Dallas?  That's a good indicator, I think!  And if we are wrong about rates--  Mr Chairman, I agree with that substantially But the directive will be released on Friday and I would like us to authorize you to explain that 7 percent when you go on MacNeil Lehrer --to point out that the 7 percent on the face of it looks higher, but it would only take us to the low point of the range  But it did from last month Now we've got to have 8-1/2 percent  By the end of the year That's all I meant  That's right But the 7 percent is what they are going to look at, Chuck And if the Chairman can say the 7 percent is not a ridiculous number--and in fact I would have preferred it to be higher than that myself and I'm usually quite tight--  To some extent  Mr Chairman, I'm with you one hundred percent on this but I wonder if it wouldn't make some sense--this is the point I was trying to develop awhile ago--if we added a sentence in the draft directive right after that sentence at the top of page 12 in the Bluebook that said something like ""In view of the shortfall in M-1B in July, this would imply growth in M-1B at an annual rate of 8-1/2 percent between July and September""  Well, I think we ought to tell the public more about what we're doing If they see 8-1/2 percent growth coming in, they're going to interpret that as easing unless they understand that's what it takes to get to the low point of the range by the end of the year It's the same reason I suggested awhile ago that we ask you to say on the McNeil-Lehrer program that we adopted a 7 percent rate [for the third quarter] but people must not think that that is an easing of policy because all that would do, if it's achieved, is get us to the lower limits of the long-run range we indicated in the testimony in July  I think that's partly because we have never said as clearly as we should what this implies month by month  I think they will understand it a whale of a lot better than if we get 8-1/2 percent growth [over August and September] and we haven't put that in the proper perspective  Unless we've said something about what those numbers are ahead of time, I think we'll scare people to death  What I'm saying is that I don't want someone to think that in choosing 7 percent last month we made a move toward ease I don't think we did  I think we tightened, too; I would rather it had been above 7 percent But when the market sees 7 percent, unless we say why it is 7 percent, they are going to oversimplify things and look at that one number I'm trying to say we should tell them how we look at those numbers so that they'll interpret them right  I agree they don't understand, Fred, but that's why I think we ought to be trying to explain it to them And that's where we differ I think this will help a sensible person understand it whereas [now] they misunderstand it in every possible way, as the Chairman indicated awhile ago  Paul, are you going to stick that number in the first part? No, I guess not; in this version we have 7 percent Okay  We're leaving the ""or moves within"" in there, Mr Chairman? "
2047,1981-11-17,BLACK," Steve, do you believe pretty confidently that if rates had come down M2 would have speeded up in view of the rate sensitivity that's so much in [evidence] now?  That would be interesting to watch over time I'm not sure that that will [continue]    11/17/81  Mr Chairman, I have to align myself with those who think that the downturn is apt to be more serious than the staff  -24-    11/17/81  has suggested With a sharp deceleration in M1-B growth and the very high real interest rates here in the summer and the point that Willis Winn made that there seem to be a lot of [potential] bankruptcies-- which many of our contacts are telling us will surface pretty soon-- the downturn may be somewhat greater than the staff is projecting By the same token, I'm somewhat encouraged by the reaction of some of the labor unions in the softening economy and [by the fact that] the money supply has been kept under good control So, I would be a little more optimistic about how much we might be able to do in the way of containing inflation  Now, when we get to the policy issue, I think there are two clear alternatives here Everyone recognizes that we can't do much about the aggregates issue [this year] But what we do will make some difference for next year Most people have focused on the first choice, the desirability of maintaining our credibility by not appearing to have thrown in the towel by overreacting and letting interest rates come down too fast But that deals with only one of the two credibility problems we have That one relates to the belief on the part of a lot of people that generally we've erred on the side of ease [in the past] But there's another credibility problem and that is that we haven't had a very good record of hitting our targets And that is the one that impresses me more So, I'd like to focus on the risk that the continuation of the shortfall in M1-B might worsen the recession and thereby impede our efforts to reduce inflation over the longer run If this downturn is really serious, the pressures are going to be pretty unbelievable for us to ease later on So, I would favor this second course of action And if we do follow that, it's certainly likely that we're going to have to let rates fall significantly I don't know how far and no one else does But I don't think the market would necessarily conclude that we have thrown in the towel if this is the path that we follow, so long as M1-B is not moving above what we set as our long-run target So, that's the way I would like to go I'm well aware of the limitations of M1-B; but even with its imperfections, I believe it's a better target than anything else we have And that preference of mine has been strengthened by the considerable weakness we've had in the economy following the weakness in M1-B We've had strong M2 growth and yet the economy has weakened pretty considerably So, my preference is for alternative A, Mr Chairman  That's why a shortfall--  They'd never get it from Henry  The only alternative is to put a short-term range in and I don't want to suggest that  And you can control that  Don't forget bank credit "
2074,1981-12-21,BLACK," No, I'll withdraw, Mr Chairman, until tomorrow  Well, I think the recession that we are in might well be more severe than a number of other people seem to believe Nevertheless, there is a real limit as to what we can do in monetary policy to cushion the decline We have tried a lot of times in the past to do this and we have gotten ourselves into a progressively more vexing web of problems in the process Really, the difficulties that we will have for the next few months are foreordained, so to speak, and inflation is still the underlying problem that we have to deal with So it seems to me that if we make any significant moves toward trying to accelerate the aggregates, we run a very high risk of reintensification of inflationary pressures and another debacle in the long-term bond markets That would be very, very bad for some companies that need to tap that market fairly soon and [would lead], I believe, eventually to a deeper recession and more unemployment down the road than we otherwise would have  But there are two issues that I do think deserve some special priorities that haven't been [addressed] in exactly this way by anyone One is the issue of multiple targets; [the other is] the width of the target ranges My feeling is that the combination of these multiple targets and wide target ranges quite legitimately raises doubts in the minds of quite a few of our critics about the seriousness of our efforts to control the rate of growth in the money supply I continue to believe that M1 is the best of the aggregates to target on and I really would prefer to target on that one alone, although I realize I won't get you all to agree with that Further, I would favor setting a relatively narrow range for M1 and then if we should find that there is a significant change in the demand for money and we can agree that that has in fact taken place--although I share Chuck's apprehensions about that--I think the best way to handle that is with an overt and publicly announced change in our targets Now, I recognize that there are some technical problems in moving from an adjusted M1 range to an unadjusted range It seems to me that this target problem is reasonably manageable Actually M1-B looks as if it will grow about 47 percent from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981, and it seems to me that that should be about the upper limit for 1982 So, I am thinking in terms of something  -30-    12/21-22/81  like 3 to 5 percent But I would want to aim at the midpoint of that and make a determined effort to hit it That midpoint, incidentally, is the same as the midpoint of the 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range that we tentatively adopted in July  We don't know when it would [go into effect] either, do we?  It won't be until April or May sometime  That's right  I bet a lot of people will borrow money in April of 1983  Mr Chairman, I find very little to disagree with in either Lyle's or Tony's statement, and since it sounds a little poetic I'll say that I'll just go with the wisdom of Solomon  That is right  I've said something but apparently it didn't--  And praying a lot!  True  It's M1  That's why we all--  Well, M1 for last year is estimated to come out at 47 percent, and some little downward movement looks a little better cosmetically I think the 4 percent is a little better than 5 percent and I am forced to settle on it for that reason But I wouldn't be disturbed if it hit 5 percent  And other unknown phenomena!  I think Henry has detected a trend "
2104,1982-02-01,BLACK," We always hear more of these things when the economy is near the bottom  Mr Chairman, we had very little in the way of differences in the forecast for '82, although a slight difference in quarter-to-quarter performance The main difference we had was the one that Jerry elaborated on more than anyone else With the projected decline in inflation, I think rates have to come down more than what we see projected here And on the point that Mike Prell developed a while ago If long-term rates did come down, I would expect short-term rates also to follow as people use the proceeds of that long-term borrowing to liquidate some of their short-term debt So, our guess would be that we are underestimating the amount of real growth and overestimating the amount of unemployment that we would have in '83  To the extent that inflation comes down, that nominal rate does not have to go up as high  Well, the [reserve] requirements were not yet phased in  Mr Chairman, before we leave this, I wonder if I could ask Steve if he could give us any further explanation on the projection for the week of February 3rd, which shows a further rise New York shows a decline from the previous week on M1 and you show a pretty significant increase there  Well, if that's his answer, then that leads me to my final point No matter how much we rationalize, I don't think we can explain all this away And if we can't explain it away, we had better assume that there's some reality to it and act accordingly  One can make a clear case if you think about rising rates back when we had ceilings on some of those items in M2--  -31-    2/1-2/82  Well, it clearly slowed down then and there are no ceilings now, so--  Right  Mr Chairman, I have three points, probably none of which will prevail The first is that I would raise the lower limit of M1 to 3 percent and I would put the top at 5 percent I think 2-1/2 percent is too low and I have long favored narrowing that spread because I think doing so would give additional credibility to what we say we're going to do But I sense that we'll go for 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, so I would suggest that we ought to aim definitely at 4 percent regardless of which of those two routes we follow The second    2/1-2/82  point is that I wouldn't favor what the Bluebook called rebasing I had some sympathy for it back when we had overshot our targets, but then I started trying to contemplate how difficult it would be to explain to the market how an aggregate was going to grow at a certain percentage rate from where it really wasn't at the moment and I decided that it was best just to adjust the rates And now, since we've come in on the low side in the case of M1, I think we'd really catch a lot of flak if we tried to do that Furthermore, with our shifting from M1-B to M1, which is going to be very difficult to explain, if we had to explain rebasing on that, too, I just don't think anybody would really understand what we're trying to do My final point is that I'd really rather solve this problem of running over on M2 and M3 by not setting ranges for them I realize we don't know all we would like to know about M1, but I think we know more about it than we do about M2 and M3 So, I'd get rid of these multiple targets and focus primarily on M1  I don't know for sure, Peter, whether you or Steve ought to handle this question I just wondered if you had given any thought to possibly changing this automatic reaction mechanism The rule of thumb you have, when you force the banking system to borrow any total reserves above path, is on a one-to-one basis Have you considered other combinations? Looking at this period, one would think running borrowing up from $300 million to $17 billion [in the most recent week], with the target of $15 billion, would be a whale  -53-    2/1-2/82  of a move Still, the money supply did spurt Have you monkeyed with the idea of maybe changing that automatic part?  Well, you actually made two ad hoc adjustments, if I understand it One was on the 4th of January and then one was on the 15th What I was talking about, really, was not those ad hoc adjustments but whether you had considered making the automatic [response] a little stronger or weaker I just wondered what you--  Well, I think that's reasonable; I certainly can't suggest anything--  And the way we construct the path, the timing of the first indication of the overrun determines the pattern of borrowing for the whole period  Well, I was just expressing some hope that maybe somebody had some ideas on how we could try an automatic mechanism that might work a little better than this had But I guess that's probably expecting too much  Well, that's one way  Mr Chairman, I think what you have more or less suggested is an excellent fallback position, and if it developed in that way I'd be just tickled pink about it But looking at past experience, these trends that develop are so like runs in stockings They sometimes keep going on It's like trying to drive on the ice, as I have been recently If you don't correct until you're way off    2/1-2/82  toward the ditch, you sometimes have to make a pretty big correction We have looked at this as carefully as we could and tried to find out whether this burst was an aberration or permanent, and I don't think we know the answer to that So, I think it's safer to minimize the risk by assuming for the time being--though we may be dead wrong--that the bulge is permanent, and I would be inclined to move more strongly against it now, along the lines of what Larry was saying But by the same token, if it comes out the other way, which is probably just about as likely, then we ought to be prepared to let the federal funds rate come down and use the whole range for it if [M1] comes in overly weak  I don't think we could get that in one month, but if that persisted for a while it could cause--  Until recently, I thought the economy was going to be much weaker than I now think it is I've begun to wonder if it might not be bottoming out, which is something I never thought I would think at this point But if you look at what happened at the bottom of the previous two recessions, the [M1] growth was not unlike what we've had, so I don't think we can rule that out I don't know what probability we should attach to it, but I just believe that's the course of lesser risk, because I think further growth now is a little more dangerous than moving the rates up temporarily to try to bring M1 growth down  I think that's a good point, and it does add strong support to what you're suggesting The only thing that keeps me from doing that is remembering that it is so darn hard to hit these short-term targets And we have missed them so often, despite our best efforts, that I just shift a little in the other direction But I think your position is a perfectly reasonably one and I would expect most people would think that's the better one to follow  I second that  Mr Chairman, in view of what you said earlier about being very anxious that we not go above that rate, would you want it to be purely automatic if we did get a continued spurt or would you want some discretionary adjustment in the nonborrowed path?  Yes  -72-    2/1-2/82  Would you want that to be an automatic adjustment?  I thought that's what you meant, but I just wanted to clarify it  That's fine  Well, we must not forget that that forecast implies a certain assumption about inflation If we are lucky enough to do better on that, we can do still more on the real side  Well, I agree with that too  Expectations of which way that will go depend on what we decide to do, presumably  Did Meese say he or the President?  I thought it was Meese who was going to do the talking "
2132,1982-03-29,BLACK," We might have to bring up only one agenda item next year!  I don't see any reason for not doing it  I so propose  What kind of figures would it take for the market to relax?  Peter, what do you think the range of their projections is now?  I think Chuck has raised an excellent point, Mr Chairman, and this could change the whole situation around, but when I get at the bottom line I believe it's a question more than anything else of whether or not we can sustain and extend this recent progress that we've made on the inflation front I think the staff is about right on the [cyclical] trough; I believe we're either there or very near it and that we have in place some key elements of good recovery in the form of the July tax cut and stepped up defense outlays But we're going to have to have some kind of rebounding bond market and more generally an increased optimism on the part of businesses to spend on capital outlays before we're going to have any real kind of improvement And it would deliver a lethal blow if inflation does pick up It would be bad news for the bond markets and for the mortgage markets and in addition I think it would dilute some of the pickup that we would get from the impending tax cut And if that's the case, then the recovery is not going to be as robust as the projection But if we succeed in getting the kind of inflation that the staff is projecting, then I believe the recovery may be even more robust, particularly in the first part of 1983, than they are projecting And I believe they're about right on the inflation figures  What time?  SPEAKER(?) What day of the week was that, Bob?  Larry, are you suggesting that we pinch the April bulge off so we can let it grow faster after that?  Steve, do you feel pretty comfortable about your projection of the aggregates for March at this point?  You think you're as close as you usually are?  Mr Chairman, given the market fears that the deficit and the recession might push us off the target paths, I think    3/29-30/82  it would be a mistake to let M1 stay above the upper limit for any extended period of time If such a result were to occur, I think it would reignite inflationary expectations and maybe even more importantly it would weaken long-term markets, which I believe would be a pretty disastrous thing to have happen at this particular point So, I think it's very important that we react promptly to any out- sized bulge in the money supply in April January's bulge hasn't washed out completely, and if we are not perceived as reacting pretty promptly to a bulge in April, then doubts about our anti-inflationary resolve will increase So, I would prefer ""C;"" I could go somewhat toward ""B"" if there's an understanding that we're going to react pretty promptly against any large sized bulge in April that is greater than the short-term figures that we're looking at And I think it would be desirable to widen the federal funds range; I would suggest 12 to 18 percent  Widen it at both ends?  Let's stick to the one we all can agree on!  I think we ought to consider leaving that sentence in the directive that we debated about and put in last time, to implement that thought you just expressed, Mr Chairman We said in effect that some slowing in the rate of M1 growth, associated with reduced pressure in the money market, would be okay  I share Roger's concern I think he expressed it very well  Nancy, my concern is not with the short-term rates, but what I think it might do to the long-term rates  They're moving down to some extent  They're higher than I want to see them, and I surely would like to see them come down But if we relax much, we may see them go the other way and that would be really bad at this point  Well, I think a lot of that is psychological, Chuck  Well, they will know what the figures are coming in at Last week borrowing was $13 billion, and if we come in  -58-    3/29-30/82  anywhere near $11 billion, in view of their expectation that we will have a bulge in April, I think that will be interpreted as Roger expressed it I may be wrong; it's just my feeling I think we really have them believing us now, and we have to appear to be moving against that bulge if it's greater than the market is expecting it to be I'm hoping and rather expect that it's not going to be as big as the market thinks and that we might even have short-term rates coming down I hope that happens, but--  Yes, I wouldn't want to force it down; but if that falls out as a result of the aggregates being within what I would consider a reasonable range, I would certainly welcome that  Well, I think so too And I hope that's what happens  That's right  But we knew we were guessing at what the rates would be at the time we projected that  -59-    3/29-30/82  Well, the big difference is in expectations, I think  Is the M2 figure 8 percent?  Oh, that's okay That's March to June you are talking about?  I would not be either on that [aggregate]  M1 too  At one point Don't count on that, either "
2159,1982-05-18,BLACK," I told you all not to trust those M2 figures!  It would be my guess that he hit every sort of financing he could get  I think the point that Ed Boehne raised is one that probably concerns us all The economists seem to think things are a little better than the businessmen do I was struck at our last board meeting how differently our directors look at this from the way we tend to look at it The answer lies at least in part in the fact that they are comparing what they're doing now with what they once did or what they did a year ago, whereas we are looking at the possibility of a seasonally adjusted upturn on a monthly basis And that's always a problem in interpreting the Redbook figures They always seem to be the worst right before a turn I guess I'm a little more optimistic than most people on this, if we continue to make progress on inflation Of course, I'm assuming away this financial crisis; that would make all bets off But if we continue in that direction, as I think we will, then interest rates have to turn [down] pretty soon and the upturn in housing that we've had should become still stronger I would think consumer durables also could change very quickly, and even business spending on plant and equipment could turn around rather fast--faster than any of us has been assuming--if expectations are improved by a decline in interest rates that I sincerely hope is just  -13-    5/18/82  around the corner But the developments that Chairman Volcker informed us about this morning are the main consideration now that could blow it all out of the water I would have stayed with an estimate about like the staff's of about a 4 or 5 percent increase in real GNP in these last couple of quarters I believe they're about right on the second quarter But of course, we're all guessing on this  Yes, I think that's a fair assessment But I still believe we will see some strength there That [concern] would certainly weaken [the demand for housing] People no longer feel sure that they're going to make a profit when they sell a house to upgrade The behavior of house prices has made everybody who has a house worry a little  Pittsburgh II!  Is that stock publicly traded in their name? [Unintelligible] a chain  Peter, you say the ""other"" firm Was that reference to still another firm? When you talked about the uncertainty in the market rise earlier--  I thought for a minute that you might be talking about another firm  Mr Chairman, I think everyone agrees that the economy is in a bad predicament now and that lower interest rates are a prerequisite for any kind of sustained recovery But where we have the point of difference is how we think we ought to get those rates down It seems to me that there are two main reasons why rates are staying up The first would be the uncertainties concerning what might be done by Congress on the present budget impasse; I guess all we can do in that area is to jawbone, as I think you've done very effectively from time-to-time, with the rest of us chiming in whenever we could But the second reason is a fear that the System at some point may be forced toward some materially easy monetary policy And against this background, I think the best way to reduce inflationary pressures, and with them interest rates, is to get these monetary aggregates back within the target ranges and keep them there for the balance of the year So, I think we ought to stay with ""B,"" which we adopted last time But I would regard that ""B"" part on M1 as the upper limit I would be glad to accept maintaining the language in the directive about a lower rate or an actual decline in M1, if that's accompanied by substantially reduced pressures in the money markets  I have two other points The first is that I would be a little concerned about leaving in the sentence in the directive regarding M2--the second sentence in the operational paragraph We included that last time mainly to cover the effects of the tax-related flows into M1, and we are now well past the tax date And I wouldn't want to see M1 come in above the ""B"" specifications even if M2 were on path The second point is that paragraph 10 in the Bluebook states that the staff's best estimate is that an $800 million borrowing level would be compatible with ""B"" The borrowing level in the first four- week period of our intermeeting period averaged $13 billion And since the demand for borrowings is notoriously volatile, I think it would be a little better to start out a bit more conservatively For lack of a better figure, I would throw out $11 billion And then I'd have a clear understanding with the staff that borrowing would be adjusted down quickly if new data suggested that we had greater-than- anticipated weakness in the money supply and a lessening of pressures in the money market  Peter, as to our operations, you said yesterday on the call that the Desk anticipated that we would hit our borrowing targets of a week ago  But would your guess still be that you'd come out about on the borrowing target? Or has that changed since yesterday?  The only reason I asked the question is that I was on the call yesterday and the staff thought at that time that we'd probably be about on target I just wondered if that had changed "
2185,1982-06-30,BLACK," Mr Chairman, I share many of the concerns that Lyle expressed about the risks in this economy And I come down to  -10-    6/30-7/1/82  the bottom line that the most likely outcome is very near to what the staff has projected We actually come out a tad more optimistic in expecting a little more real growth, a little less inflation, and a little lower rate of unemployment But we were assuming a 4 percent rate of growth in the money supply So, to show our versatility and flexibility, we tried it at 4-1/2 percent and came out pretty much the same way It really didn't change the [outcome] appreciably But I do have a lot of differences with most of those who have spoken about what we ought to do with our long-run targets I'm disappointed, of course, as I'm sure all of us are, that we're ending the first half with M1 and M2 apparently above the upper limits of our ranges And depending upon what this new revision does to M1, that aggregate might be well above the upper end of its range  [This week M1 is] moderately down I hope that what the staff now forecasts is what happens; in that case I don't think one can say ""well above,"" but I don't know whether that [projection] really will hold up I recognize the possibility that this burst in M1 may well reflect unusually strong demands for liquidity on the part of the public or it may be partly a reflection of the unusually sharp drop we had in interest rates toward the end of last year But it's at least equally plausible that it has resulted from our having put out too many reserves, as I think John Balles' memorandum suggested very cogently We're now in a situation, of course, that to stay within our targets we're going to have to decelerate the rate of growth in the aggregates And that puts us between a rock and a hard place But even though it isn't a very comfortable choice to think about having to slow down the rate of growth in the aggregates somewhat from where they've been, I think it would be a serious mistake to raise the long-run targets It seems to me that the key to the sustained recovery has to be an improvement in the financial conditions of the business sector And I don't really believe we're going to get that unless we have an improvement in the long-term capital markets--a reduction in long-term rates And as you, Mr Chairman, and others have stressed very well, we have a commitment to lowering our targets gradually over the long run to get them to a noninflationary rate If we were to move the targets now, as Larry's survey suggested, I think most people would interpret it as an abandonment of our stated objective And such a change in the public's perception of what they think we're doing could postpone indefinitely the strengthening in the capital markets that I think we so urgently need So, I would opt very strongly for retaining our present targets and hope that we don't overshoot them So far as next year is concerned, my inclination is to cut those ranges by about 1/2 percentage point  But he's looking for a justification to be flexible, Nancy  Will we have the letter signed by Treasury officials before we actually extend the money?  Mr Chairman, I'm very happy, as most of you might suspect, by this revision in the June M1 figure If I've computed it correctly, this will allow us to bring M1 by September to the top of the upper band without having to slam on the brakes The figure that I've computed from June--and what I'm doing is using the May figure for June since we're assuming a zero rate of growth-- would allow us to hit the target while letting the money supply grow at 46 percent I think that gets us out of the dilemma I suggested we were in yesterday--being between a rock and a hard place--because if we did that, it would preserve our credibility by coming in at the top of our target and we wouldn't have to say that we deliberately plan to overshoot the target, which I think would be [ill advised] At the same time, we'd be aiming for a higher rate of growth in M1 than we appear to have gotten over the last three months, so I don't think we'd have to risk any severe tightening in money market conditions and the dangers that might entail So, I would urge very strongly that we aim to be at that top part by September, and I would take whatever M2 figure Steve thinks is compatible with that I'm guessing that a borrowing level of about $900 million might be about right and, as usual, I would like to widen the federal funds range Just in case July is wild, I'd like to be able to go to 17 percent and then hope like the devil that we didn't have to [go that high] At the same time, I'd like to reduce the lower end to 10 percent and hope that we get a better performance than we expect in July and could let the funds rate come down  Well, let me make a couple more points, if I might What I'm really interested in is getting back to the top of that line [shown in the Bluebook chart] by September  That's 46 percent  It's 46 percent, if we figured it correctly  Assuming June growth is zero, that means the level is the same as May [The implied growth] is 46 percent, which is surprisingly good I think that's something that we all--  We checked on that If I alone had calculated it, I would be very suspicious of it; but Al Broaddus did it too, so I feel more confident If you put the June figures at the level of May, I believe we figured it would be about 06 of a percentage point above the upper bound at that point  So, if approached almost asymptotically, one can see it has to be--  Asymptotically--a word that I learned back in high school!  $4515 billion  Well, I know it is going to change, and that is the reason I'm stressing that what I'm interested in is hitting the top part of the range by September Whatever that number would be, that's the rate that I think is about as high as we ought to go One other suggestion, if I might, Mr Chairman At times like this when we have soft numbers for our base, I wonder if it would be worth considering using the May figure, which is a hard number, for expressing the rate so that we all have some reasonably firm number in mind It's rather tricky to come up with rates if the number does change in the middle of the meeting and we have to make these computations I have my calculator here, which I probably couldn't operate, but in case the number is different and I can't figure out--  Well, that's the reason I really favor point targets That gets back to my--  Boy, that's a relief! That's the best news I've heard since the money supply figures were revised  I was trying to be helpful, Mr Chairman I'm sorry if I muddied the waters on that I happen to have been on the call, which is the only reason I had access to that figure ahead of some of the rest of you, and I thought it might be helpful to throw that number out  Mr Chairman, just so I don't appear to be too much of a Simon Legree, may I say that I'm just as interested in getting rates down as anybody else but I differ on the method for doing it  Well, that is not the method I am suggesting We may have been a little too tight last year [unintelligible]  About 11 and a fraction percent, I believe, is what we figured out  Well, 5 percent approaches the upper limit and 6 percent moves slightly away from it  Let me point out something that may be perfectly obvious Anything above 5-1/2 percent moves us away from the upper limit Anything less than 5-1/2 percent moves us toward it  -67-    6/30-7/1/82  Roger, it seems to me that if it's above the target, regardless of how much above, anything less than 5-1/2 percent moves us back toward it, doesn't it? Am I mixed up on this?  Well, if growth is anywhere above it [through June], anything below 5-1/2 percent is--  But looking at Lyle's suggestion in perspective, it might be helpful to [note] that if we did use a May base, we would hit the top line by September if M1 grew at 3-1/2 percent So, at 5 percent, we hit the top line somewhere between September and the end of the year  Yes, I realize that I was just trying to put that in focus because, as I indicated earlier, ordinarily I'd think the idea of using a May base was a good one In this case I would have to be pragmatic and say I'd rather use the June base because that would enable us to do what I think we ought to do and express it in terms of a high percentage increase, which I would like to do  Anything below $4 billion, you would lower it?  If we release our money supply figure a little earlier than usual, we might be able to move it the way you want  Well, I don't know what time it is firmed up, but the markets would have time to move a little if it's released earlier  I was just being facetious It wasn't interpreted that way  My wife tells me repeatedly that people don't know when I'm joking and I've just demonstrated the validity of that  I think 15 percent is [not] high enough I think we won't have to go above it, but I'd feel much more comfortable if we had the leeway to do so if we needed to I would hope we would not have to use it  Well, I said 17 percent, but since I'm in a compromising mood today, I can stop at 16  Just the upper limit?  And I'd rather see it go down than up, as I vote that  I don't mind  No, it couldn't be done twice!  I move it, Mr Chairman "
2216,1982-07-15,BLACK," Mr Chairman, Bob Black I'd rather knock off a half point at the top I just think [retaining the 1982 ranges for 1983] might raise unnecessary doubts about the degree of seriousness we attach to the targets At the same time, we could also pull up the bottom I don't think anybody would want anything as low as 2-1/2 percent I realize this would narrow the range from what most people prefer, but I believe 3 to 5 percent would have a more salutary market impact than what you have stated  Chuck, this is Bob Black [Unintelligible] on your position that we have room to do what we want in the existing ranges The thing that bothers me is what the market will think if we haven't made at least some little move in the direction we've all stated we wanted to move  Let me emphasize that I'm not talking about the lower end, Larry, in case I misled you on that I'm talking about the high side  I agree with Chuck  Mr Chairman, Bob Black Let me try something; I don't whether it will appeal to anybody or not After the comma say ""and indicated that it would tolerate growth somewhat above the target ranges temporarily, should extraordinary liquidity pressures arise""  What bothers me, Mr Chairman, is the precautionary part One can certainly make a good case for it, but I don't think we can prove that I think we have clear liquidity pressures; we all know that I guess I'm worried about our rationalizing too much of an overshoot by saying that demand for money has shifted when we really don't have any empirical evidence that it has  Mr Chairman, I'd put in the adjective ""extraordinary"" liquidity problems I think that really restates our willingness, as always, to serve as lender of last resort either through the discount window or by supplying reserves I think about financial institutions and businesses in real trouble beyond what we've yet seen, whereas the idea of precautionary balances--  If it gets that bad, I'd have no problems with doing this; but if we just think we have a shift in the demand curve and we really don't have any statistics to [support] that-- I'd be reluctant to leave that precautionary demand wording in there because what we have had was not enough to make me want to overshoot the targets up to now But I can easily see, as you seem to be concerned about it, that we could have problems where I'd want to overshoot  I was saying that there are some institutions that might have liquidity problems which we couldn't reach through the discount window because they don't have eligibility to borrow and that we might have to put [more liquidity in the market] for somebody else to supply their liquidity to them  I think that's thoughtful, Chuck, but most [unintelligible] advantages there are Last year we were saying that financial innovations justified a low rate of growth in M1 and I wasn't convinced of that And when I see the same people on the other side of the issue, I'm not convinced this year of that  -11-    7/15/82  SPEAKER(?) What's the precautionary lag?  [Unintelligible], I think We probably had done it last year and it was too low That's, of course, something that I can't prove; but no one has disproved it either  If we think the demand curve has shifted and we try to offset it and it hasn't--if it has shifted back--we are going to create a monetary disturbance If it does shift and we don't detect it, we will create a monetary disturbance  Either way, we're going to mess things up!  One comment, Mr Chairman, and I'll say nothing else at all The language that I threw out was intended to suggest that we would abandon our targets only in case of a clear emergency I guess I didn't do that with my language and I would accept gladly any language that would do that "
2235,1982-08-24,BLACK," Mr Chairman, I'm not clear on one thing Is it anticipated that we would use the funds from the IMF to settle that $700 million drawing?  But in setting our share, they made that assumption I gather, didn't they?  Peter, what is the borrowing level so far this week through Tuesday in relation to our target?  Well, Peter, your handling of the $61 million that you transferred over [to extended credit and hence treated like nonborrowed reserves and] took out of [adjustment] borrowing is a situation like the one Chuck is describing  I wonder if a lot of the difference we see isn't that the businessmen we're talking to are not assuming as low a rate of inflation as Jim and his associates have assumed here If they were assuming that, I think we'd see a much stronger capital picture And if we do obtain that, I would think long-term rates would have to come down some, and that ought to have a salutary effect on capital spending My guess would be that next year might be a little stronger, but heaven knows it could be a lot weaker  Well, Mr Chairman, now that we're back inside the target range for M1, I think we ought to concentrate a little on trying to keep it there I recognize, as everyone does around the table, that there are severe risks inherent in the situation and that we need to reverse the declines that we have had in the money supply in May, June, and July You can go back even further than that in fact to February when we had pretty weak performance But we also ought to take account of the possibility that this very rapid decline that we have had in the federal funds rate in recent weeks could well give us more growth in M1 than we would like to see Alternatives A and B don't differ a lot numerically, as several have pointed out, but I would much prefer ""B"" simply because it states that we have in mind staying within the target range, and I would hate for the record to show that we were aiming at something above the range I'd much rather go above the range than for us to say that we are trying to do that I'm as anxious as anyone here to see a permanent decline in interest rates, but I have to confess that the sharp drop in the federal funds rate in the last six weeks does cause me some concern If you look back at the post-October '79 period, there have been three distinct periods where we had a pretty rapid drop One was in connection with the credit control program and is probably an invalid [comparison] But in the other cases we had a pretty rapid acceleration in money growth after that So, I think it's possible that we have set in motion forces that may be adequate to give us ""B"" or for that matter ""A,"" and maybe even something more than that So, on these grounds, I'd feel a little better if the federal funds rate held or maybe even backed up a bit until we get a better idea of how the impact of what we have done will show itself So, like Emmett Rice and Steve Axilrod, I would say that a small back-up now probably would be preferable to risking the possibility of a larger back-up later on I think $350 to $400 million might be the proper borrowing range on the assumption that the discount rate remains unchanged But  -25-    8/24/82  if there is a strong likelihood that the discount rate will be reduced in the immediate future, then I think we ought to have a little higher borrowed reserve target  I'm very much opposed to that happening, Chuck I just was suggesting to Paul [that we wait] to see what was going to  -26-    8/24/82  happen If what you think will happen [does occur], I think we ought to let rates come down  Well, I don't really disagree with that I just think we ought to wait a while to see what is really coming  What you're really saying is that on the old procedures you would favor a money market directive I think that's essentially what I said, really  People in St Louis!  SPEAKER(?) If not 100 percent of the businesses  Mr Chairman, there has been some speculation, incorrectly, in the papers that we have moved away from aggregate targets to interest rate targets So, I would feel a bit like Chuck does on that, although I agree with what you want to do So, maybe 7 to 12 percent with consultation at 10 percent or something like that [is the way to go]  That does present a problem In view of these articles that have been appearing--I'm just picking up on Larry's point, I guess--I'd rather hate to change the wording right now  I know That's my feeling, although I agree with what Paul suggested we do  Yes I always favor no range--no limits really  Yes, all volatility is unusual but some is more unusual than others  I suppose it's conceivable that they could think this ""unusual volatility"" wording was a widening of the range or an elimination of the range if we haven't specified any range They could come out that way I don't know  A kind of footnote, which means a certain--  6-1/2 to 11 percent? "
2256,1982-09-24,BLACK," Mr Chairman, Bob Black It seems to me that we have real problems in interpreting these borrowed reserve figures because we don't know what part is interest sensitive and what part isn't It's a task, really, to know how the federal funds rate [might move] more than anything else If I interpret what you're saying correctly, you would anticipate that this lowering of the borrowed reserve target a little would lead to a decline in the federal funds rate    9/24/82  Would you anticipate that the actual level of borrowing would decline somewhat from where it is now?  Yes, I can't see any great [need to change] the borrowed reserve target even though we are running pretty strong But I'm not sure it's wise to lower it a bit at this junction It looks to me as if it's moving in the wrong direction, really  [There is a risk in moving it] to any extent from where it is now, with the aggregates running so strongly If we hold it, I think the market will understand that there probably are reasons for not raising it; but if we let if drop, I believe we might get some negative reactions in the long-term bond market  Well, I was thinking about excluding the special borrowings That was my thought; the interest-sensitive part was the one that I was not sure we should hold  I wouldn't suggest raising it; I was just saying I'm not sure we ought to lower it It's [unintelligible] this week, if I'm correct on my figures And if we came down to $500 or $600 million, it would be lower than that I was saying further that I don't think these figures mean as much now because of the uncertainty about what part is interest sensitive and what part isn't And maybe this is the time really to look at the federal funds rate The bottom line of what I was saying was that I don't think it would be too wise to let that drift down from where it is, in view of the strength in the aggregates  I agree with that, Lyle I was just saying that I don't think we ought to take any action that forces the federal funds rate down at this point That was the only point I was making when I got down to the bottom line "
2272,1982-10-05,BLACK," Mr Chairman, Larry rescued us from the straits of desperation and said some of the things I had in mind There are two things that might be helpful to remember here One is that it always looks very, very bleak right at the bottom and we all get very pessimistic, and I'm much more pessimistic than any of my associates in Richmond The second point is that there's a very low pickup in velocity projected over the next four quarters And traditionally most forecasters at this stage of the business cycle--maybe I should say at this apparent stage--have underestimated the pickup in velocity We ought to bear those things in mind as we move through the meeting  Mr Chairman, Tony touched on my question I was just going to ask Steve if he would elaborate a bit more on conditions under which this might increase M1 as opposed to decreasing it  I'm talking about the money market account  I have been assuming that the instrument would not have that much in the way of check-writing privileges and it would probably depress M1  Mr Chairman, would you comment on the likelihood in your judgment that it would have that much check-writing ability?  That's what I had in mind That might limit its use to no more activity than present money market mutual funds, which have a very low rate of turnover relative to the NOW accounts and other kinds of transaction balances as currently defined That's what I was thinking was the most likely outcome  Even $500, Tony, might give it characteristics more like M2 than M1 But one could certainly debate that  You're prejudging our conclusions!  Mr Chairman, we are all in agreement on only one thing, I think that we would like to see interest rates come down I would like to raise the question of whether it might not be reasonable to suppose that a little resistance now to the strength we've had in the aggregates might not save us from a bigger move later on We have engineered a pretty sharp reduction, almost 400 basis points, in the federal funds rate from its level back in July Historically when we've had that [kind of decline], we've had an explosion of the aggregates And if that does happen--though, of  -37-    10/5/82  course, all of us hope it doesn't--we may find ourselves in a position where we are going to have to move against that We have just finished a discussion of countries that have delayed taking wise steps and they have gotten to the point where they have to take very drastic steps I have a whole collection of quotations from members of the Board of Governors who have stated very eloquently that this is the point at which we've lost it, usually, in the past  Okay Well, it may be a delay of timing, but I'm not going to quarrel with you  My feeling is that we can't pay too much attention to the aggregates right now but that we ought to nudge the federal funds rate [up] a little as a way of showing that we're concerned about that I don't expect that to have much effect But I think it could keep us from having to move [rates] a whole lot later on, which really would worry me a great deal But maybe I am dead wrong on this It may be that the aggregates will come into line very beautifully and we will have no worries That would be the best of all possible worlds But that's not what I think is the most likely case So, I'm opposed to what you have suggested here, although I understand full well how a reasonable person could be expected to--  A little I wanted to do that between the last meeting and this meeting  Then the issue is whether we're symmetrical around [the current level]  I demand equal time!  Mr Chairman, what does the unemployment rate look like now?  Would we take Midland Bank out of that $300 million, Steve, or would we leave it in there as we did on the $500 million?  Well, that will solve the issue then  Well, as nearly as possible it ought to be there if it's interest-sensitive, it seems to me, if it's to give us any guidance on federal funds rates That's all I was hoping we would do  If that happens, Mr Chairman, I would think you all were doing the right thing  But there is some sentiment for eliminating those sentences  Demand is a lot lower  Ask how many are indifferent You might get a majority!  It just says that the Chairman may call for a consultation; it doesn't say he has to "
2299,1982-11-16,BLACK," Mr Chairman, would it be in order to ask Steve a procedural question somewhere along here? He might not want to do it at this point  Well, with our new targeting on M2 and M3, I think there are some interesting questions about whether these procedures work the way they did when we were targeting on M1 I don't know whether you would like that issue raised here or at some other point  Yes, the steering mechanism I've been on the market call and I've been intrigued as I watched this develop It has been a very interesting period to be there We are following the same sort of reserve targeting procedures from all outward appearances We still set a nonborrowed reserve path and we have a borrowed reserves target; and we've made some adjustments to the borrowed reserves target As this period unfolded, I began to ask myself whether this really makes a lot of sense when we are using M2 and M3 as our targets They include a pretty broad confluence of assets Some are subject to reserve requirements and some aren't; some have interest rate ceilings and some don't; and some seem to move in the same direction as the federal funds rate moves and some seem to move in the opposite direction So, I'd like to ask Peter if he really thinks it    11/16/82  makes a lot of sense to use this kind of reserve targeting procedure while we are using M2 and M3 as our primary targets, or even for that matter if he really thinks there is any effective way we can control M2 or M3 The bottom line on this is that I am asking whether the federal funds rate under current procedures is an effective operating instrument or whether it tends to become a target in itself  But the ratio between total reserves and M2 or M3 is so low or, to look at the other side, those so-called multipliers are so high Therefore, if we miss our target--say we overrun the target--and we adjust by making the banks borrow that portion by which we have overrun the target, that's a pretty weak increase in the borrowed reserve target Even if we do it on a one-for-one basis and even if that were the right way, I would wonder whether necessarily driving up the federal funds rate at a time like this would slow down a good part of M2 I think we would count on it affecting the M1 portion and probably the part of M2 that is subject to rate ceilings or reserve requirements But some of these components are really money market instruments and they seem to move in the same direction This is the kind of thing that has concerned me about it I felt as we went through the period that the old apparatus was rather out of date when we were using this particular kind of target and that maybe we ought to go directly to [targeting] the federal funds rate, which probably sounds like heresy to a lot of people who have listened to me in the past, but--  I don't think we can slow it down except through affecting M1 and those few assets in M2 that are subject to either reserve requirements or interest rate ceilings  I think that's a good way of putting it The whole thing just bothered me and I was hoping for some--  Well, that's very helpful I did not mean in any sense to be critical of what was done I think Peter and Steve did a fine job in implementing exactly what the Committee had in mind, which really was a sort of money market directive I was just getting at the kind of problems we would have if we continued this for some period of time I think Steve and Peter both elucidated those very well That was very helpful Thank you    11/16/82  One thing we could do is to make the change in the borrowing target some multiple of the overrun or underrun  It doesn't have to be one-for-one; that's rather arbitrary  It would inevitably have to work that way  It is neutral so far as the money supply is concerned  That's finished goods Jim?  That's low income housing in Texas!  Bob, doesn't your housing information support Pres' statement that the strength is going to be in the low income part of the market?  Is that 9-1/2 percent you are talking about for M2 for September to December, Tony?  Mr Chairman, I think you expressed very well the dilemma that we face in trying to decide what to do today I don't think there's any real difference among any of us around the table as to the objective we want, but we have some obvious differences about the means At the last meeting I understood full well why we decided to deemphasize M1, given the international situation, the precarious domestic situation, and the noise in the M1 statistics I thought we made a bad mistake when we did that but in retrospect I think it had a pretty salutary effect upon expectations, and it accounts to a large extent for this improvement we've seen in attitudes But I do think a caveat is in order Despite its having been maligned a great deal, it seems to me, from what I can understand in the literature, that M1 over the long run is still the best predictor of inflation and nominal GNP Money thrown out to satisfy these high demands for liquidity in  -36-    11/16/82  a period of recession like this remains around; and when the demand for money shifts in the other direction, it can come back to haunt us So I'm very much concerned about the [money] growth we've had in the last several months and I fear that this may go on into November Bill Ford and Chuck Partee after him expressed much better than I my feelings on this I believe the battle today--if there is a battle or if one can call it that--is going to be fought over the question of whether we move the federal funds rate down deliberately or whether we are going to stick with a steady money market directive somewhat like we did the last time My choke point is right at that point If we decide to keep the federal funds rate about where it is now, I can buy that If we decide to deliberately push it down in the absence of a weakening in the aggregates, I choke over that  Could we ask Peter and Steve to tell us what they think would happen to the fed funds rate with this kind of directive, in the absence of a change in the discount rate?  You are saying we really have a money market directive--a very tight money market directive, probably--if there is no move on the discount rate  Not even in NOW accounts, Mr Chairman?  Get me another sandwich, please!  If we ever get into contemporaneous accounting and we really are targeting total reserves and controlling total reserves--    11/16/82  That's an ""if"" If we have a very wide federal funds rate range, I wouldn't worry about telling the market except for one thing, and I think that's the first argument against it I'm very sympathetic to what Nancy says, but [I don't like] the idea of political pressure being exerted upon the Committee to change before the policy is fully implemented And asking anyone who has dissented to justify his dissent when there's [as yet] no [written] explanation as to why he or she dissented in that directive, I think would be very divisive That is what bothers me, although all my predilections, of course, are for releasing it because I hope we do get to that kind of total reserve targeting some day  That's what really worries me That's the very point that tips me against releasing it  Yes, that would be a lot better  Two flexible people and one inflexible one!  SPEAKER(?) You people with conscience! "
2325,1982-12-20,BLACK," Mr Chairman, I'd like to begin by commending Steve and his associates for what I think is a very good paper I might add that I've heard everyone who has discussed this say the same thing I agree with a lot of its major conclusions, particularly that we just can't use M1 as a target in the intermediate period I think M2 is probably the best target that we can use I don't see where we can really throw M3 in there But I believe there is some difference between the staff position and my own as to the emphasis we ought to give M1 at this point The paper clearly recognizes, it seems to me, that it is desirable at some time to return to maintaining some kind  -15-    12/20-21/82  of relationship between M1 and our policy But [the paper] seems a bit vague to me [on that point], and I would like to see us make that a little more definite Most of you probably are not going to buy that view at this point, but I'd like to see some kind of commitment to return to M1 targeting by mid-1983 unless it clearly is not possible to do so I don't think we really know whether it will be clearly impossible or not I favor this for two reasons One is that I think the pricing policies of Super NOW accounts and money market deposit accounts is going to be pretty well set by midyear and the lion's share of that shifting is going to be behind us From then on out we should be able to use M1 itself or develop some reasonably good shift-adjusted M1 that could serve for targeting purposes My second reason is that in the past--it may not be true in the future but presuming that it will--M1 has been a better predictor of the behavior of nominal GNP and prices over the long run, despite all these regulatory changes that people thought would destroy its validity I think it's quite possible--in fact, this is what I think will happen-- that the money market deposit accounts and the Super NOWs will be priced so that most of the savings and investment money will go into the money market accounts and most of the transactions money will go into the Super NOWs And in that case I see no reason why M1 wouldn't continue to bear a pretty good relationship to nominal GNP and prices So, I would like the presumption to be that we will go back to M1 unless we find that we can't do it That would be my main emphasis  I have two more points beyond that One is that I would recommend very strongly that we devote whatever resources are necessary to see what we can do in the way of developing a reliable shift-adjusted [M2] I realize that is not an easy thing to do but I think it's something we have failed to try My second point is that I like the idea of the shadow target but I reach a somewhat different conclusion from Jerry on that I'd feel a little better if we bumped it a little higher because it's not practical for the Committee to participate in these ad hoc adjustments made to the borrowed reserve target between meetings So, I would like the automatic part to be larger than it has been in the past I think I'll stop right there  Well, one other point If the interest elasticity of M2 is less than that of M1, as it probably will be, and if the elasticity of M1 is less than it has been in the past because of this innovation, then I think we necessarily would have some larger movements in interest rates than we've been willing to tolerate, if we're going to stay on whatever path we finally end up with So, all of these things lead me to suggest that the automatic adjustment mechanism ought to be made as strong as the Committee is willing to accept  Do they have a percentage change there, Mr Chairman, on final sales [in the fourth quarter]?  I think that's better, Mr Chairman  We'd better check with Mr Edwards before--  Steve, could you read the last part of that again? I got most of it but not--  Mr Chairman, could I ask Steve one clarifying question on this?  Could I slip him a note? Steve, on this second alternative, suppose we settle on ""B"" Would you put in there for M2 11 percent or 8 percent?  That's about what it says, as I read it  It's the other way around, Lyle And this is a hybrid anyway; it has 1-1/2 [percentage points] in shift adjustment not taken out  Despite all this discussion of what the aggregates might do and despite my strong predilection toward targeting aggregates, I don't think we have much choice other than to target interest rates in the short run  But I must say that my feeling about what are the appropriate rates is conditioned by four months of what I think has been very excessive growth in M1 I don't pretend to know what caused    12/20-21/82  all that; it may have been precautionary demands for money But every time the federal funds rate has come down by 6 points or so, as it has over the period since June, we've had a spurt in the aggregates And I think that drop in the federal funds rate must have played a pretty significant role in itself I'm very reluctant to go lower on the federal funds rate than we are now I would want a floor, a lower limit of 8 percent on it If the aggregates come in weak, I would not mind the rate coming down to 8 percent, but I'm very leery about going beyond that  Did you say it was revised up to 6 percent?  We might have to go through this again, Steve  Is this for leaving it in or taking it out?  I would like to have a copy because I can't get the words down as fast as they pour out  -92-    12/20-21/82 "
2355,1983-01-14,BLACK," The same is true in Richmond  Paul, Bob Black We have [responses] from only 17 banks so far on our survey, but it appears that 13 percent came out of old Ml  Yes, that's right It's only 17 banks, but we do know--don't we Steve?--that the shift-adjusted rate was probably well in excess of 91 percent in December  I'm just saying M1 was somewhere in the double- digit range for December How high, nobody knows If any change--  We just did some figures on this and [I don't know] if they amount to anything, but we came up with some shift- adjusted figures that were way up in the double-digit range depending on what assumptions we used One came out 25 percent and one came out 28 percent But I wouldn't put much credence in those because this is a very small sample  You have more data; that's probably more realistic But [unintelligible] on the shift-adjusted rate for December, unfortunately  It sounds useful to me, Mr Chairman  SPEAKER(?) I agree "
2382,1983-02-08,BLACK," Mr Chairman, we come out on the high end of most of these forecasts We're assuming a rate of growth in real GNP fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter of about 5-1/2 percent, and we believe it will be front-end loaded--more growth in the first couple of quarters than in the last two We're a little more hopeful on the unemployment side; we have that pegged at about 10 percent But we are less optimistic on the GNP deflator; we are projecting about 5-1/2 percent on that versus 4 percent in the staff forecast And underlying this is an assumption of a rate of growth of about 6 percent in Ml We are influenced primarily, I think, by two factors One is that sharp recessions in the past have tended to be followed by a little faster recovery; [the second] is the sharp acceleration in growth of the money supply in the last half of 1982 We are well aware of the inferences that are being drawn from the reported abnormal behavior of income velocity of money and the inferences that are being drawn about the demand for money But we did some experiments on this; we lagged money by one quarter and by two quarters in computing the rates of change in velocity If you do that, it really illustrates some rather interesting things--that the drops are not that abnormal by past standards, reflecting the tendency of the money supply's effect to be lagged some time a couple of quarters later So--  Well, okay This does get to that But it does affect the velocity forecasted  We lagged it one and two quarters And in either case there were several postwar periods--  Well, I hadn't worried too much about the components of it, Mr Chairman I would think that it would be mostly in consumer expenditures, government expenditures, a pickup in inventories, and not much improvement in capital and equipment But we really expect that velocity is going to come back I'd like to look at those figures of Steve's, because what we did was probably not as sophisticated as what he did We had a decline in the fourth quarter, if we lagged it 2 quarters, of 16 percent in income velocity for Ml; and for the third quarter the decline was 27 percent  Okay Anyway we projected about a 5 percent pickup in velocity and that led us to a greater increase in nominal GNP than the staff has been projecting    2/8-9/83  [Yes], and I think there's going to be a big jump in profits I don't know whether it's 40 percent--that sounds awfully high--but I think profits ought to rise quite rapidly  Mr Chairman, my position probably will not surprise many people, but you may see that I have an unusual degree of flexibility this time I think we ought to continue to target the aggregates and I think we ought to include Ml in that for a couple of reasons For one thing, it has been less distorted That may not hold over the long run; I don't know We can address that if it doesn't I think it's important for our credibility that we put M1 in if at all possible, but I do think there's substance in the arguments made by those who say that it's going to be a little different kind of beast than we've had in the past So, I would widen the range on the up side because it's probably going to contain a larger element of savings and also because it has grown so fast that I don't think we can risk decelerating it that fast without jarring the economy and knocking off any recovery that may be developing And if we should try to use Ml, then I think that ought to be the main basis for constructing our target paths because we found out M2 doesn't work very well We could, I suppose, use a target shadow reserve requirement, as Steve suggested in the memo last time, of 4 percent or something like that But the truth of the matter is that even though we've gone through the motions, we really have not been doing any kind of reserve targeting during this period In fact I argued that we really ought just to admit we were pegging the federal funds rate, which is what I think we've done and I think that was appropriate during this period of uncertainty But if we're going to get back to reserve targeting, it has to involve something that is to a large extent reserveable  Could I make at least one observation, Mr Chairman? Steve, I don't think there's anything incompatible with what we did [in Richmond] and what you did here You have not used semi-logs on this scale So, on the vertical scale, an absolute drop there would be comparable to a much smaller drop down here In the figures that we had looked at back to '54 and '49, the change in velocity lagged one or two quarters was really not that different So, we were talking about two slightly different things  Mr Chairman, could I circulate a memo to show something differently?  Okay I think there are precedents Steve is right that nobody knows what velocity is going to do in this upturn It may come up and it may not; I don't know I'm just saying that I was surprised to find out, as I read this, that there were precedents to this kind of drop But they were in periods before this chart begins; they were earlier in the postwar period And they may or may not be indicative--  Yes  Steve, if we've made our computations right, an assumed M1 growth fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter of 6 percent implies a 14 percent rise in velocity of M1 over that year  That's right, with their forecast  That's the reason I went into that issue awhile ago, Mr Chairman, and you thought I was premature I was trying to explain why ours was high and it was based upon an assumption that it would bounce back, which it may well not do  No, we assumed about 5 percent That was really the reason I went into what you thought I was going into prematurely to justify our high forecast  Well, we know everybody is wrong We just don't know who is the most wrong  Then you'd have to [marry] alternative II into alternative I  Well, I mean that we've taken a couple of the figures out of alternative I and set them into alternative II  Mr Chairman, I didn't express it very strongly but I feel it very strongly I wouldn't go as high as that I think 7 percent is as much as we dare risk And the only reason I'd be willing to go as high as 7 percent would be that I think there is probably going to be a higher element of savings in M1 than we've had before Otherwise, I'd say 6 percent is as high as we ought to go  One percent is too low even for me Even three percent is too low  If we vote on these, as I've figured it, we've now substituted all the specifications of alternative I and the rate of growth from a February-March base for M2, and we're calling it alternative II    2/8-9/83  I was just thinking on the mechanics of voting I might say I favor old M2 and you might say you favor the new M2 I was just pointing out that a transposition has sort of taken place, rightly or wrongly  Mr Chairman, let me see if I may help on this point We would lose the automatic adjustment mechanism to a large degree  The Committee sets the initial borrowing target and after that all the Committee has is the automatic part because we don't participate in any ad hoc adjustments I sure would like to have that automatic part fairly strong  Could we say that some members will monitor it fervently?  SPEAKER(?) Closely  Shouldn't we spend a couple of hours discussing whether [evaluated] carefully or not so carefully?  [Unintelligible] true, but it's--  I'm with Karen, Mr Chairman  Mr Chairman, it seems to me that we have to compare that slower growth to something If we don't, somebody might conceivably think that we're referring to the last part of '82  Oh, I thought you took that out  Does it leave open the possibility, Mr Chairman, that if there is an unusual strengthening in the aggregates, we would consult?  -96-    2/8-9/83  We have to promise we're not going to! "
2410,1983-03-28,BLACK," Did you have to try more than one lawyer?  It's been pretty bad the whole time you've been there  Mr Chairman, I always feel very uncomfortable when I make a forecast on anything This whole Committee ought to feel uncomfortable because I think if you look at our Humphrey-Hawkins testimonies, most of the time the majority has been wrong There is usually somebody who is right each time, but--  --the one who is right usually differs from meeting to meeting  That's right And that's why I feel very uncomfortable I hasten to add that that is why I have less and less sympathy for discretionary monetary policy too, but that's another issue But I'm very much in sympathy with the points that Lyle made; my guess would be that this is going to be front-end loaded a little more than the staff has projected It does follow a deep recession, and historically deep recessions usually have been followed by relatively fast recoveries We've also put out a lot of liquidity in the economy It's also at this stage historically that most people have underpredicted the amount of economic growth And I think the swing toward optimism, though certainly it may well be fragile, has been the most abrupt swing that I can remember It may be because people were so fearful it wouldn't come at all, but it seems to me to have been more abrupt than it has been in the past I think businesses are unusually lean now and if we do get any kind of pickup, profits ought to rise more rapidly than most people think and again ought to help the outlook So, my guess would be that growth is going to be a little faster Like Lyle, I think the error may be on the side of [the staff forecast] being slightly lower than what really will occur  Is that from us, Mr Chairman, or all imports?  -34-    3/28-29/83  Alternative II, I think  Mr Chairman, we continue to be concerned about the growth of Ml It seems clear to us that the reported growth has not been inflated Jerry raised some interesting points If we look at the money market deposit accounts, in our analysis that provides a big offset, which suggests the shift-adjusted figure is really bigger And Steve's group has suggested that it's probably largely unaffected, which is probably the most reasonable of all because I'm sure they've looked at it much more extensively than the rest of us have If there has been this upward shift in the demand for money, it seems likely to me that we've pretty well accommodated, if not more than accommodated, the overshoots that we've had I continue to have a lot of difficulty in understanding why we're placing our main emphasis on M2, which is the aggregate that seems to be most distorted by these new accounts and one over which we have very little control while Ml in contrast is now generally thought to be the one least affected And it's the one that's most controllable All the empirical studies to me suggest that Ml has the best past record for predicting inflation and nominal GNP Of course, that may change; it certainly is a different instrument now But my feeling would be that the burden of proof    3/28-29/83  ought to be on those who think it's going to change that much, though I realize it certainly can  So, with these points in mind, I feel very strongly that we ought to move back toward the old operating procedures, as far as we can persuade the Committee to do so, that we were using before last October And in particular, I think we ought to allow the borrowed reserve target and the federal funds rate to vary in reaction to any overshoots or undershoots above or below the stated path that we have Now, it might well cause the federal funds rate to rise a little in the short run, but I think it's unlikely that a moderate increase of that sort would seriously undermine the recovery since it seems to me to be pretty firmly [entrenched] The real issue, as I see it, is that if we fail to act now, we may have to take a lot stronger action later when business confidence and the bond markets may be a lot weaker And they may be weaker because I think we'll have a revival of the inflationary expectations--even more so than we have now So, I lean toward the C alternative and, for obvious reasons, prefer the language of alternative II as shown in the Bluebook and alternative B as shown in the handout I would like to eliminate the wording in that first bracket there; I think that's really unnecessary And, obviously, I would like equal if not more importance attached to M1 "
2450,1983-05-24,BLACK," Peter, why don't they think it's a federal funds rate target?  But, given the variation in the apparent borrowing target every time the federal funds rate threatened to deviate, I am beginning to think that we are putting more emphasis on the federal funds rate than on anything else  Yes, I can see that distinction that they wouldn't think it was as tight as it was before October 1979 I am rather surprised by the answer  Jerry, if you exclude the CCC payments from the fourth quarter and also from the first quarter so that you get final demand of roughly the same magnitude in both quarters and make some allowance for the point that John Balles made about the possible overstatement of that implicit price deflator, wouldn't it look a good deal stronger? It would look somewhat stronger than average if it looked about average before you made those adjustments, wouldn't it?  But if in fact the point that John raised has some validity, as we're inclined to think it does, and you made those adjustments, I would think real final sales may well be higher in the first quarter than they were in the fourth quarter  Mr Chairman, I've been skeptical for some time that this upturn was going to be as modest as I think most people were assuming, for a couple of very basic reasons One is that a sharp downturn like we've had is typically followed by a pretty sharp upswing And then we've added so much to the money supply that even if one assumes a pretty significant increase in demand for money, it seems to me that there is enough liquidity out there to finance a pretty good pickup Chuck and Ed and Lyle and Henry touched on the recent burst of statistics, which lends further support to that So, I am in agreement with them about the strength of the economy I think the staff has made the revisions in the correct direction by raising the projections Specifically, I think the second quarter may even be significantly higher than they're projecting But the main concern that I would have is that if we're right in our supposition  -11-    5/24/83  that this is a strong recovery, we may well find that those projections of price increase in 1984 are unduly optimistic  I thought people always felt bad about west Texas!  Mr Chairman, I deliberately waited until Bob Boykin had spoken before I made a statement, because not very long ago he made a glowing compliment about my statement by saying he would have agreed with it all until he heard you speak And that sort of wiped me out, so I thought I would wait this time! I suppose it won't come as a real surprise to anyone that I think we ought to continue to give greater emphasis to Ml One of the reasons we abandoned Ml is that we felt MMDAs and Super NOW accounts would affect Ml; I think that was proper But the growth rate has fallen off pretty sharply in recent weeks and the original reason for shifting away from Ml to M2 seems to me to have largely dissipated There remains the argument that the demand for Ml balances may have increased because the OCDs introduced an element of elasticity in the demand and also an element of savings I think there is some substance to that, but we are not really going to know the answer to that for many, many months down the road And there's a risk that it might not have changed that significantly In view of that, I think we have to weigh the risks in deciding what policy ought to do To me there is some risk that if we do not move somewhat now, we may have some unwinding of this good effect we have had on inflation And I would be particularly concerned about the adverse effect on long-term debt markets So, I would favor going back to the old procedure, of course, where we adjusted our borrowing target automatically as Ml varied off the target But I know we are not going to get that I would next fall back to ""C,"" which I also know we are not going to get So, if I were voting, I guess you all would probably push me up to maybe ""B minus"" But I definitely think we ought to make some move now  -30-    5/24/83  It was a half point lower?  I think it's reasonable to assume the elasticity of demand for Ml may have increased to some extent and the demand for M1 also may have increased But it strains credibility, it seems to me, to assume that that can explain all the burst It's just too large for me to think that it could be all of it  Roger, the staff says 24 percent for May but if I'm not mistaken, that assumes no further growth in M1 during May Doesn't it, Steve?  And if we have a reasonable amount of growth, it might well be above 30 percent  In the interest of conciliation, after Tony's offer, I'll come down from $600 to $500 million  Gosh, I hope so  I think we ought to have--  Our error has worked out better than we thought!  Don't give them a chance at it!  That's all it says  Hitting it intentionally is snugging from hitting it accidentally  Do you think we ought to put that ""only"" in there?  I think it's as close as you're going to get  That will eliminate the dangling participle too  I'd be willing to vote for one that won't hold  No, we didn't  -57-    5/24/83  The thing for you to do is go for $350 million and then dissent  Would you vote for [$350] million, Ted? It's better than the alternative  I'll put a sentence in every one of my talks! "
2474,1983-06-23,BLACK," Bob Black, Mr Chairman I agree with you completely And I would favor showing it in the record It will look a lot better if it's as strong as it appears to be to show that we met and did something "
2487,1983-07-12,BLACK," Mr Chairman, we have been for some time more bullish than the staff and we still are a tad more bullish for 1983 It seems to me that every time we get a wave of new statistics they suggest that there is more strength out there than we had previously assumed So, we end up with a slightly larger real GNP for 1983 and a bit more inflation, although as the days go by and the [inflation] figures have come in better than I thought, I have less confidence in that for the short run We do not have significant differences in 1983 but when we move into 1984 we begin to show many more differences because we believe we're going to have to pay the piper somewhere along the way for the large growth in Ml So, we end up with approximately the same kind of real growth but a larger implicit deflator I don't know really how to answer [the question of] what is most likely until we deal with this policy problem We're assuming certain things in regard to the behavior of the aggregates and we also assume more or less a return to normal velocity behavior, which may or may not occur Until we know the answer to that, I don't think we're going to know the answer to where we will end up But so far as the implications for policy that you asked us to address earlier, the implication I draw from that is that we're going to have to move to some degree against this burst in Ml that we have had  Steve, excuse me, but are you saying that you think the velocity forecast may be a little higher than you really believe?  -20-    7/12-13/83  That's the one  I agree with all this talk about cosmetics, but I certainly would like to see somebody say something about taking the ranges seriously, too, along the way  -32-    7/12-13/83  I'd like to see a large element of that in the talk But I do think it has a cosmetic or--  Yes, it is  Nobody says it's the level of--  And it moves the midpoint only 1/4 of a point  What would you--?  Frank, that's going to lead you down a primrose path on Ml, to something you don't want, if you look at what it usually does  Mr Chairman, I had in mind figures very similar to what John Balles mentioned, but I think the real issue is how the market will react best to what we do My feeling is that it's better that we not rebase, although I understand fully the argument for it Since you said you thought this would imply more emphasis on Ml, which is what we also had concluded before we came here, that does argue in favor of [rebasing] from my viewpoint But I believe the market would react a little better if we kept what we have and you just said that we doubt that we will hit it  We either rebase now or, if we overshoot our target, we rebase at the end of the year  The great unknown is what is going to happen to the velocity of M1  Let me call your attention, if I might, to the last sentence in Dave Lindsey's memo in which he says it's not clear that Vl will be less predictable over time than V2 even though Vl may take on behavioral characteristics that are different from earlier postwar years  It has been more predictable over most of our history; it may not be in the future, but I believe the burden of  -44-    7/12-13/83  proof is on those who say it won't be That's a biased viewpoint, as you all probably can guess  I agree with that, but the risk--  Is that rebased, Mr Chairman?  -46-    7/12-13/83  Particularly for next year, I think  What may explain some part of that is a different policy [assumption] or something  Well, you can cut that 9 percent down to 8 percent by assuming a little pickup in velocity rather than no change  You could stress the point that Jerry just made a minute ago in that way, which is not an unreasonable thing to assume  We could go to 10 percent and assume a small drop in velocity  I think that is where the risks lie  A lot of the reasons for that uncertainty have disappeared, Roger It may well behave more predictably now than it has in the recent past I hope so and I know you hope so Of course, none of us knows  One interesting thing that makes it a little easier is that under any of these short-term alternatives, the third quarter looks fairly high in an absolute sense Any of these short- term alternatives that we're looking at would imply a third-quarter rate that really doesn't look like much drop from the second-quarter rate It's just pure arithmetic If I can find the darn table--  Here it is It's on page 14 [of the Bluebook], Mr Chairman Under the short-term alternatives for Ml, ""A"" gives you 108 percent for the third quarter; ""B"" gives you 10 percent; and ""C"" gives you 92 percent That may be obfuscation to a certain degree, but it is probably a more meaningful number than the rates from June to September in a sense I don't know whether it's a wise thing to do  -56-    7/12-13/83  or not, but I don't think anybody could deny that that's probably a more meaningful figure than the behavior over a particular month in the period Any of those involves some deceleration but not what most people would think of as a terribly fast deceleration I don't know what the fourth quarter looks like at this point  That's going to be a lot less You run into a few more problems You assume that's within your target and then you start talking about the month-to-month--  You have faith on that, Steve I know they would be low, but I don't have those [numbers] in front of me  It is pretty low  That's another reason why Ml may well slow down  Mr Chairman, what bothers me more than anything else is that when we stopped tracking Ml we lost a lot of that automatic correcting mechanism we had before I don't think the figures we choose here are as important as that we agree that we are going to change the borrowing level and federal funds rate--and maybe in rather prompt steps--if the actual growth deviates from what we expect That's the point I'd like to see us zero in on if we could, because all we can do now on the present procedures are ad hoc adjustments That makes me a little uncomfortable  Also, borrowing has been so low that there's less reluctance [by banks] to come in, so it's probably going to be high  And Ml  Are you talking about the short run still?  If we rebase and take 5 to 9 percent for '83, it looks to me as if we ought to go a little below that for '84  But if we really look at our ranges for '83 and a rebased 5 to 9 percent for M1 from the second quarter looks appropriate, then I'm just saying the targets for next year--  Well, looking at the year as a whole But from the last half, if we come within a 5 to--  The difference is that that's not my principal target, Tony  Yes  Or put the footnote on another page where nobody could find it!  That is right  You have to rewrite this "
2514,1983-08-23,BLACK," Mr Chairman, I thought John Balles was going to make my speech for me He started off pretty much the same way, but we come out with less real growth next year than he did, though a tad more than the Board staff is projecting The main difference is that as we looked at prices next year, we paid right much attention to the behavior of money in recent months in addition to the effects, as the Board staff suggested, of a great firming of labor markets, a depreciation of the dollar, and the drought this year And we believe that's going to result in somewhat higher prices than the staff is projecting If I figured it right, they have the implicit deflator [rising] about 4-1/2 percent from the fourth quarter of '83 to the fourth quarter of '84; we think [the increase] might be near 6 percent That's really the significant difference between us and John  I hasten to add that I hope we [are wrong] I thought we were going to end up the same place but that's exactly the difference  -10-    8/23/83 "
2543,1983-10-04,BLACK," The press has been devoting a great deal of attention to discussing the possible slowdown occurring in the economy But as we've gone around the table here, I think Jim Kichline and others have captured this very well with regard to the straws in the wind, which leads me to think that this a pretty normal, healthy sort of recovery and one that still doesn't need an undue [effort] on our part to prop it up It looks as if the recovery is moving into a more mature stage now, and even abstracting from the shortage in automobile inventories and the elimination of some of the  -11-    10/4/83  sales rebates, I think consumer spending has slowed some and housing has clearly slowed a great deal and probably will slow more But now we are moving into the stage where I would think that inventory rebuilding and some expansion in capital expenditures would begin to assume part of that role Really, the only weak thing of any significance that I see in the economy is the export sector Even that looks a little better in that we have more signs of a pickup abroad now than we had maybe a month or so ago I think we are in pretty good shape I do agree with Jerry that there is a growth in protectionism in places we never expected to see, and I share his fear that these wage pressures are going to mount before we expect them to, although they do look darn good at the present time  The scales are a lot different  Mr Chairman, we had $647 million one week; and that was the week before we went to a $650 million [objective]  That's right  I liked your starting position better than the one you moved to subsequently, Mr Chairman  I thought it did--just a tad, it seemed to me  Should I put that down or will you change it?  -36-    10/4/83  They might think it means the discount rate  I'll just say symmetrically, Mr Chairman  Mr Chairman, you did ask one question about how we would treat overshoots and undershoots and I said symmetrically I wonder if everybody agreed that we ought to react as quickly to an undershoot as to an overshoot or vice versa  I don't think they did either There was a range of [views]  The language sounds fine but the--  Well, I didn't read it that way In that case, it doesn't sound fine  Well, I'm not voting, obviously  Be more symmetrical  Yes, in the other direction "
2568,1983-11-14,BLACK," If I understand the Phillips curve analysis properly, your inflation forecast depends upon the markup over cost Is it possible that international competition could intensify to the point that that could be very difficult to accomplish and significantly affect your inflation forecast?  Reduced  Well, didn't Henry put his finger on it a while ago in pointing out that we can't incorporate expectations in there to the extent that we probably should? That's the great missing thing, it seems to me  You mean land changing hands three times?  John, are they domestic orders or a combination of domestic and foreign?  Mr Chairman, I'm very much in John Balles' camp Or, to put it in a slightly different way, he has returned to a camp that I never left We've heard a lot of criticism of Ml during recent years and a lot of it I think has been warranted, but nobody has put forward anything that seems to have any promise, from my viewpoint, of being a better intermediate target Just to cite one case The only thing that would have led anybody to predict the amount of strength we've had in the recovery was growth of Ml So, I still focus most of my attention on Ml, but I'm very pragmatic about it If Steve's probing into the behavior of M1A or anything else turns up something that will behave better, then I'll gladly switch Given that position, on the basis of past experience I think there's a legitimate reason to be concerned about this deceleration that we've had in M1 and to conclude that it conceivably might have a negative impact on business next year if it continues So, I can understand why John has some sympathy for easing up a bit to stimulate the rate of growth in the money supply I would have a lot of sympathy for that point, particularly if I thought that if it turns around the other way we would move as quickly to snug up But there are a couple of reasons, or maybe three reasons even, why I don't think that would be very wise right now One, of course, is that the economy does seem to be very strong I will buy pretty much Lyle's and others' argument on that And after the kind of growth we've had in the money supply, again narrowly defined, I think it's probably inevitable that we will have a few bumps and grinds as we try to get this back down to where it ought to be  SPEAKER(?) Bumps and grinds?  -57-    11/14-15/83  That was a Freudian slip! But in more technical terms, we've been playing around inadvertently with the seasonal adjustment factors I think it's at least conceivable or plausible that the introduction of the MMDAs and also the advent of the OCDs and the inadvertent seasonal adjustment that seems to have gotten into our monetary policy the last several years may have biased our seasonal adjustment factors upward for these last three months, in which case the reported figures are going to be lower than they really ought to be If that analysis is right, then that's a reason for not being quite as concerned about the weakness we see there So, to get to the bottom line, which I probably should have gone to directly, I would go for alternative B  If you think of this seasonal adjustment thing--  Mr Chairman, do we have 8-1/2 percent for M2 and M3 growth? "
2602,1983-12-19,BLACK," That's a bad omen!  Mr Chairman, if we don't make any more changes in our procedures than Steve and Peter have suggested, I think we're missing a mighty good opportunity on our control mechanism At least some of us supported this [change to CRR] primarily in the hope that eventually we'd be able to control total reserves better than we could under the lagged system It's rather painful to me since I had something to do with the lagged system and I hate to see the one contribution I thought I had made go down the drain and turn out not to be a contribution! But in any event, I became persuaded that we could control total reserves better under this system than we could under the lagged system I recognize, of course, that the two-day lag imposes some of the same problems that we had with the full lag, but not quite as much And if we deemphasize Ml, then certainly we pretty well have to stick to the procedures that Peter and Steve were talking about But I hope that this is just an initial step toward moving eventually to emphasizing Ml If we assume that the present nonborrowed reserve target procedures are going to be continued under this new regime then, as I think Steve has indicated, with this greater variability in federal funds we ought to be prepared to let that much show through to the extent that [the variability] results from unexpected changes in required reserves stemming from demand- induced changes in Ml That would be a self-correcting brake on whatever might be happening [to Ml] I also think we ought to install as much automaticity in this as we possibly can Right now, under our    12/19-20/83  present procedures, the Committee is really out of it once it chooses its initial borrowing target unless we have another meeting And this puts a tremendous burden on you, Mr Chairman, in deciding the extent to which the borrowing target will be altered I would greatly favor a more automatic procedure because it would probably operate better The only alternative is an ad hoc procedure So, I think the 25 percent is unduly low  Finally, it seems to me that if the system is going to work very well at all, we have to force the banks to adjust during that part of the reserve maintenance period that overlaps the other period This would mean that in the last two days of that reserve maintenance period we ought not to let federal funds be subject to overly strict control or else the banks and other depository institutions are not going to adjust during this two-week period at the beginning If we don't do some of these things, or move in that direction, we really have put the banking system and now the thrift industry through a tremendous amount of pain and suffering for something that's really not going to make us that much better off We are not only going to have a lot of trouble computing these things but, in my judgment, we're apt to get a lot of errors because it's frightfully complicated We have to make use of these potential improvements in the mechanism, it seems to me, or else it's all for naught  Steve, this gets closely at the point that Chairman Volcker was raising a while ago Two kinds of demand deposits are in there that are [not] normally in Ml government deposits and interbank deposits I would think one could pretty well estimate what they are going to do over an extended period of time; at least what little work I've done on it suggests that Insofar as shifts between large banks and small banks [are concerned], yes, in the short run that is important; but over the long run I wouldn't think that really messes us up very much The whole thing has been designed--at least I've perceived it this way and I'm sure others have also or it wouldn't have [been adopted]--to control Ml because, as you mentioned, that's the only aggregate that is subject to contemporaneous reserve requirements All the rest, M2 and M3, are subject to lagged reserves So, we go into a reserve period and supply what reserves are needed against those liabilities that have been lagged Then we put in an additional amount to take care of the interbank and government deposits plus what we think is necessary to achieve the right expansion in Ml I believe that's manageable, although, of course, we have to agree that we want to control Ml before we can do that  If you thought that was my [predilection], Ed, I misled you  We should get more variation in the federal funds rate concomitant with that If we hit our target on a more regular basis, I wonder if we'd really have that much volatility in other short-term rates I can see very easily that we would in the federal funds rate And I'm not sure it follows in longer-term rates  But we didn't hit our targets as regularly as I am talking about  Mr Chairman, could I make one more observation? On this automatic part, suppose we've agreed that Ml deserves a little more emphasis than it now has; if it runs above target and consequently required reserves are higher than the path, we can either adjust the borrowing up automatically or we can do it on an ad hoc basis Since we've not been emphasizing Ml to any great degree, these adjustments in the borrowed reserve targets have all been on an ad hoc basis There's no way the Committee can realistically participate in those decisions That has to be left up to you in consultation with Steve and Peter or however you want to do it And that is the point That is the only alternative to some kind of automatic adjustment mechanism, if in fact we're going to pay any attention at all to Ml I think we ought to focus on that part of it I'm quite willing to delegate that to you, but I'm not sure whether I'd be that willing to delegate it to your successor, whoever he might be  Mr Chairman, could I ask Steve about that point? Steve, what do you think about the merits of the experimental [seasonal] versus the regular one? We've done some work that suggests that the seasonals are probably bad for the last part [of the year] Hence, we didn't have as much of a burst in Ml earlier and we haven't had as much of a slowdown since then What one believes on that makes a lot of difference, I think, in where one comes out  It's hard to argue with that one!  Mr Chairman, I think we really have two questions that we have to address today The first, of course, is which aggregate or aggregates we're going to emphasize And the second is what the numerical ranges for those targets ought to be over the coming year As I suspect most of you would think, I strongly favor returning to Ml or increasing the emphasis on it I'd make it the primary target It seems reasonable to me to suppose that, given the sharp increase in the velocity of Ml in the fourth quarter, the probability is much greater that the traditional relationship between Ml and GNP may be resuming In addition, I think one has to judge Ml against the alternatives And it seems to me that the case for M2 and M3 and almost anything else I can think of is really not as good as it is for Ml, despite the imperfections that Ml obviously has had in the past If the Committee does agree to increase the emphasis on Ml, then I think we ought to consider lowering the 8 percent top that we tentatively set for next year If we approach the target from the standpoint that the Bluebook does in paragraph 12--the paragraph Steve was mentioning a while ago--an 8 percent growth at the top, given the projection of nominal GNP of 91 percent from the fourth quarter of this year to the fourth quarter of next year, would imply a rise in velocity of only 1 percent That is not a figure to which I would attach a very high degree of probability given the recent resumption in velocity [growth] of Ml and also the probable absence of any further major changes in the regulatory area More fundamentally, 8 percent seems to me just not really consistent for any long period of time with our stated objective of dealing over the long run with inflationary problems So, what I'd really like to do is to knock a couple of points off that That's probably not going to be acceptable to this group, in which case I would argue that we ought to put the top maybe at 7 percent, or if we want to be a little devious say 4 to 8 percent but that we're just going to use the [lower] half of the range But I don't like that [latter] approach, really  So far as M2 and M3 are concerned, I could accept keeping the preliminary ranges where they were set in July, although as Steve pointed out a minute ago and as the Bluebook mentioned, that doesn't really represent any reduction in the rate of growth in M2 for 1984 So, I think 6 to 9 percent would be a preferable figure and would give a stronger signal to the market of our anti-inflationary resolve They will look at that and will be aware that if we stick to our tentative 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent range, we really haven't made any effort because of the way the base was set So far as M3 is concerned, if there are these technical reasons for raising that range, which seem plausible to me, then I wouldn't mind having it at 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent For 1985, clearly, the purpose ought to be to cut whatever ranges we adopt still further, in keeping with our often stated objective of working down the rate of growth in the aggregates  -37-    12/19-20/83  over the long run So far as figures are concerned, I think we have to wait until we decide what we want for 1984 before we try to put any [specific] numbers on that  Could I ask just one brief question, Mr Chairman? On your experimental weekly Ml seasonal, Steve, do you have a figure for December? I gather it would be not too far off from--  Only 23 percent in December?  Mr Chairman, I've been waiting in hopes that someone would say all I wanted to say, and Ted Roberts came very close No economist is going to agree 100 percent with anybody, so I would come out right where he did except I'd rather use 5-1/2 percent than 6 percent on a quarterly average basis [for Ml] I would stress mainly that if we don't get this growth in Ml in December, we really  -62-    12/19-20/83  ought to have a conference call and take a look at it because if that happens, I believe the slowdown might be more real than I now think it is and that maybe we ought to move a little against it So, I would really go with your original position  I have some figures here that I think support both positions, depending on the period you take In the four years before 1979, 7 percent is the least squares rate of growth; since then it's 68 percent But the first part of that latter period--that would be from '79 to about mid-'81--it was 51 percent And since then to the fourth quarter, it is 105 percent So, that supports your position It also supports Lyle's  I'll support Mr Roberts on that "
2628,1984-01-30,BLACK," You're looking at the short-run [alternatives], Ted  Mr Chairman, a while ago Chuck said that he thought he agreed with Henry and Lyle; I might go even further and say that I think I agree with parts of what even more people than that have said I started off this morning thinking the staff was pretty nearly right on real GNP and the unemployment rate, but then I joined Lyle and his cohorts when I concluded that inflation probably will be building over the 1984 period as a result of the usual cost/price pressures we get in an upswing and also as a result of the delayed impact of the large growth in the money supply that we had earlier That gets to the question--if indeed that's right about what is going to happen--as to the best way to finance that I think we have to be concerned about the risk that Ted Roberts outlined--that we might in fact have slowed the aggregates down too fast But I don't believe we've captured all the seasonal factors in that yet, Ted I think money market mutual funds and MMDAs were used to take care of Christmas payments instead of demand deposits, and since the buildup of demand deposits that we ordinarily had before Christmas didn't happen we took it out [in the seasonally adjusted numbers] I think we probably will find out later that that was still understated, despite the upward revisions  Also, I think we ought to be concerned about what Lyle said about inflationary pressures and the economy looking pretty strong I think both possibilities are risks for us So, I would go with alternative I, which I think is broad enough to take care of both of those risks I like the idea of restoring this balanced proviso in the directive Since we're not sure which way the aggregates will behave, we ought to be prepared to act if they go one way just as we should be prepared to act if they go another way And I like Arabic alternative 2 [in the Bluebook] for the long-run portion of the directive, which would restore more emphasis on Ml  We split evenly on that and you didn't vote, Mr Chairman  Not if you have flexible discipline They can't push you but so far  For the last half of last year; I think it's in chart 3  I think he meant just for the last half of the year  A rebased 4 to 8 percent is what he's talking about instead of rebasing to 5 to 9 percent, I believe, Mr Chairman  It looks as if it's a mysterious act or something  -38-    1/30-31/84  It's more weight than what?  I wish you hadn't brought that up, Si; they may want to change that now!  Change [unintelligible] in there  That's his fallback position!  I think we ought to decide which sheet we're going to read from It's close  We could have a long coffee break  In face of the evil [unintelligible] at all times  It's 2 percent or--  Just think of it as an elongated carry-over "
2655,1984-03-26,BLACK," New York has already got a Vice Chairman!  Bob, I don't think we addressed the issue of whether they had to be officers or not; it just ended up as officers  Bob, in our case, since we had to give up one, we decided that the first vice president would not be one of the four unless he was substituting He can give it up more easily But if you were out of the Bank, you could made an ad hoc exception for him That was the way we were planning to do it I'm sure that will differ from Bank to Bank It seems rather bad to have to deny access to your first vice president, but I don't think we have any alternative  I think it's a good improvement, Tony I would go along with that In fact, I was planning to send Norm a telegram saying I'd like an ad hoc exception for just that purpose when I am out of the Bank  Staff members, I think  Don't your people work on weekends, Ted?  We would get it Monday morning that way  It might make it a tad easier to resist buying something else if we are going to get any pressure to buy something we don't want--some favored security somewhere  -19-    3/26-27/84  Mr Chairman, I agree with those yesterday who indicated that they think the economy is currently very strong and that we will be lucky if we hold inflation down to the level that the Greenbook is forecasting Accordingly, it seems to me that our main objective ought to be to deal with the aggregates I would focus, of course, mainly on M1 and try to get that to the midpoint of our 4 to 8 percent range and hold it there in order to reduce the risk that inflation would really be a problem in 1985 I like the M1 path of ""C"" because that would get M1 to the midpoint by midyear But the Bluebook associates that with a federal funds rate of 11 percent or more and I would feel a little more comfortable--and here I am assuming no change in the discount rate--if we let the federal funds rate move up to the neighborhood of 10-1/2 percent and hold it there until we have some additional information on the behavior of the aggregates I like the ""B"" specifications for the federal funds rate and the borrowing I have to say, though, that I have no confidence  -58-    3/26-27/84  in my ability to tell you what kind of growth in the aggregates we're going to get under current procedures if we push the federal funds rate to that level or indeed to any other level I just don't think that there is really any way for us to know under our current operating procedures But we've now had 2 months of experience, roughly, under contemporaneous reserve accounting and I was happy to hear Steve suggest that he thought there might be some merit in looking at the idea of introducing some automaticity into that I would strongly endorse that and would express the hope that somewhere along the way we get as close as we can to something approaching total reserves If we do get to that point, we ought to think about the discount rate as a penalty rate at all times I think that kind of procedure would greatly enhance our chances of controlling the aggregates and inflation and help us maintain this hard-won credibility that we have finally gotten  Yes That's right--in order to control total reserves more closely  Mr Chairman, one comment There might be some [complication] in April It looks as if there might be a seasonable adjustment problem on M1; that came in so weak last year and that was more than made up--  That's precisely my point I think we're going to see a number we really can't trust in April--maybe even more so than in most months  That makes sense to me, but I didn't want to say it again  No, that would be very bad! "
2688,1984-05-21,BLACK," Mr Chairman, I share Mr Boehne's qualitative view that the economy is probably moving into a more mature phase where we will see some slowing But if you search the evidence, it's pretty hard to find anything in the statistics other than an apparent plateauing of housing that really suggests that that's taking place So it looks to me as if the Greenbook is probably about right in its forecast for real economic growth in the last three quarters of 1984 I fear, however, that they may be underestimating inflation for the last half of '84 and for '85 Pres just cited some interesting developments in productivity that I think will ameliorate that to some extent, and I would add to that the increasing foreign competition and domestic competition I have now reached the point that I don't ever pay list price on anything I think almost everybody has that same mentality and that's bound to have an effect that had not been there before Nevertheless, with the tremendous--I would say tremendous, although one could argue--amount of monetary stimulus put out in late '82 and '83 and the pickup now taking place in velocity, it seems to me that we're probably going to have more inflation than in the Greenbook forecast I think the market behavior, which Karen has reinforced with some interesting anecdotes, suggests that the expectations are just that As I read the market, we have a little way to go before we get rid of those inflationary expectations  I have one other point It's the main one I think it is important that we monitor current economic developments very carefully But at the same time, I think it is important that we  -12-    5/21-22/84  avoid giving too much weight to the short-term economic data that we see in trying to set short-term monetary policy Undue emphasis, for example, upon the strong first quarter of this year could lead to our aborting the recovery if we were to take action related to that But perhaps more realistically, the economy is going to slow down somewhere before very much longer, I think And when the data begin to show this weakening, if there is a perception on the part of the public that we are trying to fine-tune the economy to any great extent, that is going to intensify the pressure that we have to ease significantly at a time when such a degree of easing may well not be compatible with our longer-term objective of working down the rate of inflation and getting back to a completely healthy economy So, my bottom line is that I would not let the latest bit of economic information influence what our policy decision should be today  It always has been in our District  Remember, we are reporting on our own Districts  We are not ever front-sided; it's always back- sided  Mr Chairman, we are all worried about a lot of things, and more people seem to be worried about the state of the financial markets than about anything else I don't think we ought to overlook that A lot of this seems to stem from some doubts on the part of the market that we're going to be able to deal successfully with inflation over the months ahead, and we obviously have to pay some attention to these transient factors that are present right now But my caveat would be that we not let this deter us unduly from our basic longer-term mission I lean a little toward ""C"" but the  -33-    5/21-22/84  difference between ""C"" and ""B"" is not as great as usual and I would be perfectly comfortable with ""B"" But the most important thing we should do is to try to get some agreement if we can as to what kind of action the Desk will take or as to when you would call a conference by telephone in the event that these aggregates behave in a way that is way outside what is now projected That's a more important part to me than the ""B"" or ""C"" part  I think that's the way they would interpret it "
2712,1984-07-16,BLACK," Ted, is this off the deflator you are talking about?  Mr Chairman, I have very little confidence in economic forecasts--my own in particular--but forecast we must, so I guess I will have to bare my soul Like most everybody else, we ended up pretty close to the staff's forecast for 1984 But when we got to 1985 we differed in the same direction that Jerry Corrigan did, only more so We came out with a little higher real growth, but the main difference was on the inflation side We were on the high end of that and we would stress the factors that he stressed, but also would point out that we still have not yet paid the piper for the rather rapid growth--or what I view as rather rapid growth--in the money supply in the past And even after allowing for the possibility of a rightward shift in the demand for money, I still think we're going to see more inflation probably than the staff is projecting This, obviously, is one argument that I don't want to win  No, keep them and explain  You mean 1985  Mr Chairman, we had a little trouble with the [draft] wording of the continuation of the credit and policy stance, or whatever it was I can't find it right now But after we have voted on our long-run target ranges, I think this might bring us a little closer together  Leave out the interjection in the testimony!  Mr Chairman, Karen has pretty well made my talk except that I feel comfortable with a 4 to 7 percent range I would go with all the ranges under alternative III But I'd just like to emphasize a bit more perhaps than she did that I think equally important is our decision on the emphasis that we will put on Ml With velocity picking up and the money market models tracking M1 much better than usual, that suggests to me that M1 may be reassuming its more traditional relationship with GNP So, I would like to make another quick pitch to restore M1 to at least its former full position of equality Of course, I'd like to push it a little more  We also would be operating for at least a month, or more than a month, before we really decided what our targets for that period were  Well, to put a little meat on what I think was a very excellent statement by Lyle, we rebased last year and went to 5 to 9 percent on M1 and we came out at about the midpoint If we're lucky enough this year to come out somewhere near the midpoint of 6 percent, that would be two years in a row that we are moving in the direction we want And if we come out somewhere near 5-1/2 percent next year, that will add a lot to what I think is already a very high credibility of our anti-inflationary stance But I do think it is vital that we continue to move in that way because, as Lyle said, we still have a long way to go to get where I think we all ultimately want to be  Fight for your rights, Sam!  You were saying the level was approximately what it was in June rather than the rate of growth?  Yes I think maybe Ted thought--  Mr Chairman, I have a strong preference for the aggregate targets in alternative C As I mentioned before when I latched on to what Lyle was saying, I think it's vital that we continue our stated long-run policy of working the aggregates down There are obviously risks if we try to push M1 down too fast after this rate of expansion, but I think there are also risks if we let it grow at a rate of 7-1/2 percent for the last half of the year as it did in the first half And I hope, of course--and I even have some faint expectations--that the rate of growth in the economy will slow somewhat so it won't be necessary for us to take any action to try to deal with the aggregates I'm very much encouraged by Steve's projection of M1 So, despite my ordinary predilections to do a  -62-    7/16-17/84  little now in the hopes of avoiding a more disruptive and stronger move later on, I would stick with the $1 billion borrowing target now and raise that only if the aggregates show greater strength than it now appears that they're showing  That's what shifted my position right there  I hope you would "
2742,1984-08-21,BLACK," Peter, do you regard this recently widening spread between the discount rate and federal funds rate as a transitory phenomenon that's likely to be reversed fairly soon? If so, how would the Desk react to that?  If it did happen pretty soon, would you hold to your borrowing target and let the federal funds rate come down?  That would be the mechanical [response]    8/21/84  We took a cursory look at it--and this is by no means definitive--and it looked as if there was reluctance to borrow by large Chicago banks more than anything else  We figure the Chicago banks wanted to make darn sure nobody felt they were in the same situation as Continental and they might be more reluctant to borrow  That was the most striking difference that we found in just a quick look at it  I can imagine some of them are reacting that way    8/21/84  We might see some more, given Financial Corporation of America's problems  When banks are out of Federal Reserve notes we just send them coins!  That's not the problem, I don't think  They had 300 people doing that, didn't they?  It's 1,000 now?  The press reports have been inaccurate on that too, then  Just one short question, Jim [Unintelligible] Do you have a gross domestic business product fixed-weight index for the second quarter now?  They're probably capturing improvements in quality, as I understand it What do you think?  And there are no changes in the implicit deflator It's an unusual phenomenon  But, Frank, it's interesting if you look at consumer prices So far in this expansion they have been 56 percent, which is the second largest amount of increase in any of the 6 postwar recoveries And the fixed-weight price index is up 62 percent versus 65 percent in the 1970-72 period, which means more is going to profit despite wage restraint It doesn't look that different It's rather scary as a matter of fact looking at some of these, which I have done on a preliminary basis but not as thoroughly as I need to Producer prices look a lot better; they are half as much so far as in 1970-72-- 23 percent versus 46 percent for the first six quarters That has food in there; if you look at the nonfood part you might get a different impression I just happened to run across these right before the meeting  Except on their own salaries!  At the risk of sounding somewhat complacent, I think our policy for 12 months has been just about as good as anybody could have dared hope it would be We came pretty close to the midpoint of our revised target range in the last half of last year and, with the behavior of the figures in July, we're heading pretty close to the midpoint of the present target range So, we're in a good position to finish the year somewhere near that, regardless of which of these alternatives we adopt And with velocity apparently picking up, it looks to me as if that's about where we ought to come out I really prefer the [aggregate] specifications of ""C"" because they get us a little closer; by the same token I recognize there's not a whole lot of difference in these things So, in my usual display of eclecticism I would opt for the other specifications of ""B,"" which would leave the federal funds range unchanged and the borrowing target unchanged And, like Tony, I would prefer that we go ahead and make this directive symmetrical "
2766,1984-10-02,BLACK," Peter, do you think that it would work a little better if we used only adjustment borrowing for our borrowing targets and eliminated seasonal borrowing?  You'd come out on balance for leaving it?  In the recent period, adjustment borrowing would have given you a better idea of what the federal funds rate was going to do, wouldn't it?  I was thinking you would have cut the adjustment [borrowing assumption]  I would have thought that it was so much less sensitive that the other conceivably might work better If you think the federal funds rate--  Being more confused than usual about the economic outlook, which is a state I imagine most people around this table find [themselves in], it's hard to contemplate but I didn't say very much during the first part of the meeting [Unintelligible] Boehne, Partee, and Gramley axis, for lack of a better term But I think a point that Henry made does deserve stressing and that is that if we are fortunate enough to get the 4-3/4 percent inflation rate that the staff is projecting for next year, that would look good only in relation to the late 1970s and early 1980s; in any other time that would have been considered a major economic problem So, in formulating our short-term objectives, I think we need to keep that longer-term objective in mind and try to hit our targets for what would be the 18th month in a row right on the button If we could come out near the midpoint of the target, I think we would do  -28-    10/2/84  something that would be very beneficial from the standpoint of the whole economy  To get to the bottom line Like Chuck, I would go with all the provisions and specifications of ""B"" Unlike Chuck, though, with M1 growth picking up in September albeit not as much as I thought, given [the report] this morning that it's apparently somewhat more elastic with respect to interest rates than we thought earlier, I think it's unlikely that we've seen the full response to this decline in the fed funds rate that we had earlier So, I would be inclined to let it sit there for a while or maybe move it down a tad at most and then wait and see what happens  More than fragmentary indications "
2791,1984-11-07,BLACK," Are you rounding, or is that--?  Well, the staff's projection for the fourth quarter is about in line with what most private forecasters have been saying; it's certainly plausible and maybe even the most likely forecast But I have to agree with Preston Martin and Emmett Rice and Ed Boehne and Si Keehn I believe the risk has shifted to the low side since we last met As Jim Kichline pointed out, there are certainly some statistics that suggest that growth picked up in September--the employment figures and the figures on retail sales But I think we have to bear in mind that given the export/import picture, even if final demand strengthens, that doesn't necessarily mean that we are going to have equivalent strength in domestic employment and demand People may, as you said, Mr Chairman, be lining up to unload those imports Moreover, the lack of growth in M1 since midyear certainly makes it less likely that there will be any sustained resumption in growth any time soon In short, I see some serious risks in the near-term economic future and I think we ought to keep those in mind as we address policy today  Mr Chairman, I think it is important that we try to get M1 back on a moderate growth path as quickly as we can Unless someone is prepared to make pretty heroic assumptions [about] shifts in demands for money, then it strikes me that a zero rate of growth over a four-month period is just about the maximum that we ought to tolerate But I think we have to be very careful here and in particular take account of these lagged relationships that traditionally have existed between short-term rates and M1 We have pushed short-term rates down some 200 basis points, and in the past such a move usually has led to a very sharp spurt in money growth It could be that this lagged response to the rate reductions we have already had will produce a fairly good pickup in M1 in November and December I think it would be very desirable if we could finish with M1 close to the 6 percent midpoint at the end of the year But at the same time, we have to keep in mind that the actions we take now affect reserve pressures over the next few weeks and are going to affect M1 in the early part of next year I can see a danger that an overly determined effort to try to get near that midpoint could start us off in 1985 with an unacceptably rapid rate of money growth But if you look at the quarterly rates of growth in M1 or the other aggregates for 1984 and see how much M1 in particular has decelerated, a fairly rapid growth in the first quarter of next year would not look all that bad to me The bottom line is that I think our reactions should be rather cautious and measured  I prefer the aggregate outcomes anticipated by ""A,"" but at the same time I am not at all sure that it's necessary to push the borrowing target immediately down to $400 million with whatever reduction in the federal funds rate that might imply I would feel more comfortable if we moved somewhat more slowly with a higher borrowing target initially for the next couple of weeks or so; if it becomes clear at that point that M1 is still below path, then I would be prepared to reduce the borrowing target accordingly I would favor [the language in the Bluebook under] alternative Roman numeral II with certain changes in the second sentence for the wording of that and I strongly endorse Frank Morris' suggestion that it really is time for us to look at our procedures I think everybody wants to get the money supply growing again, but we have no earthly idea how much we will have to reduce the borrowing target or how much the federal funds rate will have to come down to accomplish that And I think that means that our procedures are pretty faulty I doubt that I would end up with the same recommendation as Frank but I certainly do endorse his idea In view of all these unexpected things that have happened this year, our control mechanism leaves a lot to be desired and I think we can improve it  Mr Chairman, if you haven't written off alternative II altogether, I think you can do essentially that same thing fairly easily if you change the second sentence right after the semi-colon and say something like ""which would partly offset the unanticipated decline in October""  That's exactly right  You just have a short-term attitude ever since you got through-- "
2816,1984-12-17,BLACK," It's hard to explain that you're aiming at a rate of growth from someplace you aren't  Mr Chairman, I end up very close to John Balles on this I'd like to say first of all that I agree that Steve has done a very fine job on this memo and, as some of you might suspect, I think he is right in saying that M1, despite all its imperfections, is probably still the best target So, I would favor tightening up the targeting procedures on that so that we could more nearly hit our targets, which leads me to favor, as he does, some degree of automaticity I think Steve's suggestion of about 50 percent of any deviation of required reserves from path would be a pretty good place to start But I still entertain hopes that someday we're going to get to a total reserve target and a penalty discount rate, because I believe ultimately that that's the best hope we have for really getting to the point we want to go I'd also like to mention the point that Steve made about the difference between a net borrowed reserve target and a fed funds target I think that's a point that has escaped many of us There are some differences there; maybe they are differences of degree But if in fact there is a greater degree of fluctuation in the federal funds rate under the borrowed reserve targeting, I think that can give us good information, as Steve suggests, unless of course the change in the federal funds rate comes because of a shift in the borrowing function or something of that    12/17-18/84  sort To me the main point that really comes out of this paper is that it generally underscores the need for not less fluctuation in the federal funds rate but more fluctuation in order to achieve our targets And that in turn calls for more frequent and maybe larger adjustments in the borrowing target to reinforce these desirable movements in the federal funds target In short, I think that the present procedure, when we restrict the limit on fluctuations in the federal funds rate, is not that much different from targeting the federal funds rate I would like to strengthen it so that we really do take more advantage of the differences that exist between those two basic procedures  I'm sorry, Mr Chairman, but I was so busy a while ago making a case for automaticity that I neglected to say that I did not mean to rule out discretionary adjustments in the borrowing targets I think those we've made recently have been very appropriate I would want to augment the automatic part of it, if we vote for that, with discretionary movements such as we've had, if it appears those are desirable  Mr Chairman, when we made a 100 percent adjustment we did have these ad hoc adjustments made and I think we should continue those And if this is Mickey Mouse then I'd like to kick it up to 100 percent and then--  Jerry, I think that's an empirical issue There is reason to suppose that but, if the market saw us hitting what they thought we ought to hit a little more regularly, I'm not sure that we'd have that wild a gyration We might But I don't think it would hurt a lot if we did have it in the federal funds rate--  Mr Chairman, I think the Board staff forecast is about right in terms of the level of economic activity, but I would side very much with Pres and Chuck and Emmett on the risks on that, particularly concerning Chuck's last point I am fearful that the foreign trade deficit is going to take a bigger bite out of our production and employment than we probably have assumed If there's any risk, this strength of the dollar in the face of the narrowing interest rate differentials has impressed me a lot and that's where I would think the main risk lies I think Jerry made a very important point on the inflation side in saying we ought not to be complacent about an inflation rate of 4 percent I remember that in 1971 when President Nixon put on the wage and price controls that [level of inflation] was serious enough to be a national calamity By the same token, I think we can pretty well count in our own productive capacity that which is abroad since we have such an open economy now that we're not apt to hit bottlenecks quite as quickly; I think the threat of foreign competition and actual foreign foreign competition have been one of the key reasons why inflation has not risen as much in this upswing as some of us thought earlier that it would Jim said about the risk of inflation that he thought it would be less next year; I would guess it would be roughly about the same, but certainly less than I earlier thought it would be at this stage  On the long-run targets, I would come out about where Karen did and would leave those ranges unchanged So far as the aggregates are concerned, I'll take a page from Orwell's Animal Farm and say that all aggregates are created equal but some are more equal than others and I would emphasize M1 since I think it really, despite its limitations, conveys more information than all the others do and certainly more than any one of them does To your fourth question  -42-    12/17-18/84  about whether 29 or 3 percent growth is satisfactory or not, I think Emmett gave the appropriate answer when he said that that's fine if that's all we can get without inflation Historically, our long-run growth rate has been around 3-1/2 percent and 3 percent would not be that unusual at this stage of a recovery But in the peculiar circumstances in which we have found ourselves, I believe that we probably could stand a little more than that But anything much beyond 3-1/2 percent or so I think would spell problems for us down the road  And to your final question about how this fits into the world situation If we don't provide the impetus for expanding world trade, who is going to do it? I suppose that foreign economies look a little better now than they did the last time we met but they still don't look very strong So, I would expect we're going to have to carry the brunt of that burden; and for that reason I would agree with Chuck that we ought to take a little harder look at exchange rates this time than we've traditionally done around this table  I think what you've said is very sensible, Mr Chairman This illustrates quite well why I favor a total reserve target Under current procedures, we choose a borrowing level and we expect a certain federal funds rate; and to predict what is going to happen to the money supply necessitates a knowledge of the demand function for money that I don't think we will ever have So, whether this will do what I want, I don't know But if we were operating on the total reserve target, I would feel that we knew what was going to happen And I was glad to hear you say that we need more emphasis on total reserves I think that really is what has been our problem lately  Line 85 on page 4  What about that bank in St Louis, Joe?  Do you agree with Lyle because he paid you a tribute? Or is that an honest--  I think you've each given each other a quarter!  Watch him, Lyle, because sometime he will pay you a tribute and then he will turn around--!  Maybe the best thing to do is to say that $250 million was the target and say ""seeks to maintain""  I think that's a better way to do it  -73-    12/17-18/84  Do it on this one instead of whole numbers and a fractional number  I'll third it  It seems to use the expression of Minneapolis or New York  [Unintelligible] asymmetrical range of $250 to $300 million "
2856,1985-02-12,BLACK," In the third year of an expansion that's really not much of an increase  Mr Chairman, I think the staff's projection is certainly plausible and we can't quarrel much with it I believe, like Frank Morris and Ed Boehne and Bob Boykin, that the risk is that the economy will come in somewhat stronger than that Underlying their forecast is the assumption that the income velocity of M1 is going to grow a little more than 1 percent That may well be right, but to me that seems on the low side of what is likely to happen I would think it is more likely that we'll have more growth in nominal GNP as a result of a faster rising velocity, and I think that would be distributed partly between real output and prices So, we come out at 44 percent on those So far as the unemployment rate is concerned, I wouldn't be surprised to see that drop a bit lower than what we projected originally or what the staff is projecting I think the demographics of the situation and improving real family incomes might well limit the increase in what the staff is projecting for labor force participation rates and bring that down maybe a couple of tenths of a percentage point below what they have  Mr Chairman, I always have had problems with telling someone we're aiming for a percentage rate of growth from some  -25-    2/12-13/85  point we haven't reached, but I always have had sympathy for these moving lines around the midpoint rather than the moving megaphone  Well, that's part of the--  Okay  I am, too, as you currently define it  Mr Chairman, are you aware that there's a brand of golf balls that has truncated-cone dimples?  Mr Chairman, I come out in a different place than most of the others I think we've done remarkably well with monetary policy the last year and a half, so far as M1 is concerned in particular We've about hit our targets right on the button; we were a little off last year, but not a great deal Accordingly, I think it's important that we continue this progress that we've made and I would go with alternative II I accept the staff's suggestion that we increase the monitoring range [for total credit] But I would strongly prefer that we omit any reference to coming in at the top part of that [M1] range If we hit the 5-1/2 percent midpoint, that's a little pickup from what we had this past year and with the economy still apparently strong, I just don't think any useful purpose would  -38-    2/12-13/85  be accomplished by suggesting that we were aiming for the top portion of the range I think it might undermine some of the progress we have made in increasing our credibility in the last year and a half  That augurs well for next year!  Well, the faster the rate of growth in money the lower the velocity is going to be, necessarily; it's just an arithmetic truth If we hit the top part of the target we're going to have lower velocity If we hit the midpoint, we're going to have higher velocity I think either way we can finance it But if we hit the top part, then somewhere along the way velocity is going to return  -47-    2/12-13/85  to a somewhat normal pace, I would assume And that's where the trouble comes in  Mr Chairman, I think it is desirable for us to try to end the year at the midpoint of alternative II, so I tend to favor the short-run M1 path of ""C"" By the same token, I have some leanings toward ""B"" too, because I don't believe it would be desirable necessarily to move to the kind of borrowing target that ""C"" contemplates in the Bluebook Edging on up toward the $400 million borrowing level would be as much as I'd want to do Perhaps more important than that, I'd want those words on lines 93 and 99--where we have the choice between ""would"" and ""might""--to be ""would"" in both  -49-    2/12-13/85  cases I don't think we know which way it's going to be and I'd like to see us be prepared to move in either direction, if the aggregates are not staying on the target I think the phrase at the beginning should be ""increase slightly;"" that would be preferable to what is shown in ""C"" And I would go with the funds rate range of ""B"" because I'm not thinking about very much action at this point and that ought to be fully adequate to encompass anything I have in mind  Yes  I favor symmetry but if we must be asymmetrical, I think this is the right direction  If you want to get a chuckle, say it just that way  -56-    2/12-13/85  We could have it on M1 and drop it from M2 and M3  With a truncated band  Where are you thinking about beginning the line? You explained that yesterday and I thought I understood but I wasn't quite certain  Right  -60-    2/12-13/85  Yes, that's what I understood you to say  Or upside down!  We rebased on the second quarter  The base became the second quarter  Chuck, only those that take demand deposits  Ones that aren't supposed to take deposits-- "
2884,1985-03-26,BLACK," Mr Chairman, it seems to me that the Greenbook projections for the first quarter and also for the rest of the year are pretty reasonable I think, as Henry Wallich stated, that there is a tendency on our part to look at the most recent news in particular, and I think people have been focusing on the flash report for GNP But if you look behind that and see that the survey on  -10-    3/26/85  employment was taken during a bad week, it suggests that employment is probably a little stronger than the figures showed As you mentioned, the consumer seems to be fairly strong and is spending with confidence, so that looks fairly good So all in all, it looks to me like a pretty darn good performance for this stage of a business cycle; and it would be particularly good if we can count on inflation staying down  To me the policy implications stemming from that are that we ought to continue the same sort of policy we have been following the last several years I wouldn't claim that the entire favorable outcome in the economy generally has been due solely to [monetary] policy, but I think it has done an awful lot to overcome the negative effects of the federal deficit on business confidence and the financial markets And it probably also has helped to hold down inflationary pressures, although I think it is always important to keep in mind that a 4 percent inflation rate--or whatever the real rate is--is not really success over inflation in any sense So, with that relatively optimistic view in mind, in relation to what some of the others have said around this table, I think a high priority ought to be given to trying to maintain the same sort of policy we've been following in the past I would be very concerned if M1 were to move up above the upper band--not just out of the cone but above the upper band--or if we were to target something above that I would be willing to tolerate a little less accommodative policy if necessary I think the strength in the dollar is more or less preordained by the fiscal situation; if we try to resist that very much, we may find ourselves unleashing inflation a little more So, I guess I'm considerably more hawkish than most of the people who have spoken thus far  Does this mean, Jim, that you think the real part might be a little larger?  At about the same real--?  Karen, if a person has an account in his or her name and a joint account with a spouse--  Each account could get $750  As I mentioned earlier, I think a lot of the economic success that we've enjoyed in the last year and half or so stems in part from our having done very well in meeting our M1 targets In the last half of 1983 we came in about on target and we came in pretty closely on target for 1984 If, after our next meeting, it becomes apparent to the markets that we have aimed for a point such as ""B"" or ""A,"" which both are well above this upper band, then I think that's going to lead people to assume that we've thrown in the towel on inflation I'd be very disturbed by aiming at any point above that upper band As Roger suggested--and Steve and others made the point--if we do get to that point, then we have to make a pretty wrenching effort to get back to our targets and that involves obvious risks So, as Steve stated very well, I think a little move now might go a long way; so I would come out preferring a path something like ""C"" I could live with something a little higher than that as long it weren't above the upper band and I think Si's suggestion of a borrowing range of $500 to $600 million would be about right But what is more important to me than anything else is the reactive mechanism What are we going to do if we find that the money supply isn't doing what we think it will do? It may be that we can actually stay within that range with falling rates We really don't know because when the market is that tight the money supply is pretty hard to predict So I think it would be a good idea to use an asymmetric directive that would require us to react much more strongly if we start showing too much [money] growth I'd use ""would"" on the up side and ""might"" on the lower side, if it becomes weaker  Well, shouldn't we then consider using that figure?  Mr Chairman, could I ask Steve to elaborate a little more on what he thinks the federal funds implication of that might be?  Yes, but--  Yes  Mr Chairman, what about the ""woulds"" and ""mights""? "
2908,1985-05-21,BLACK," 150?  Can you take it out at the time you sunset it, Steve? That would be the only graceful way to do it  Mike, do you have the figures for gross domestic purchases and domestic final purchases for the first quarter as a percentage increase?  Well, you alluded to it  Down by 04 on the first one and 08 on the [second]  What were those figures, Lyle? Do you have them?  Mr Chairman, I have long since abandoned any hope that anybody can do very well in projecting the economic outlook over any extended period of time I am particularly uncomfortable in trying to do that today because the signals are so mixed But having said that, my guess would be that if the staff forecast is wrong, it may be a tad bit on the low side As we see it, domestic demand is still pretty strong and the sharp growth in M1 back in the winter is likely to keep it fairly strong The real question is What's going to happen to imports? And I don't think we know the answer to that I agree with the staff's assessment that the dollar probably has peaked and will continue on down When that will be felt by some slowing in the rate of increase of imports, I don't know; it may be in 1986 as Mike suggested We were thinking we probably would see some effects before then In any event, we think that by the last half of this year GNP might be somewhere around the 33 percent growth that the staff is projecting for the last half of this year  On the implicit assumption on velocity that the staff has made, if we had the kind of growth in M1 that they seem to be talking about--say, 6-1/2 percent from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of this year--that implies a slight decline in M1 velocity If we get a more rapid rate of growth in Ml, that would of course mean more than that, and that would be very unusual for this stage of a business expansion I certainly wouldn't say it can't happen, but I don't think it is very likely So in short, I don't believe the general economic outlook provides any very compelling reasons at this point for any significant move toward ease It is tempting to think in terms of ease, as we see all these worries that Pres has outlined But to me at this point that really would exacerbate most of these problems It was excessively easy policy, coupled with some other things, that I think created most of these in the past To me it is time, even though the statistics seem to be flashing danger signals, to keep our eye on our long-run objective I would try to keep the aggregates under control; specifically, I had in mind trying to get M1 back somewhere within these target bands that we set for ourselves  We would be glad to put them all in there, if you will take it out of that figure, because it is like extended credit on those that [unintelligible] for a short time; [the institutions are] not feeling the adjustment pressure that is ordinarily felt in adjustment credit  The rate is higher  Mr Chairman, my wife tells me I'm hard to please and if she were here today she would say that my actions would prove that because I don't like any of the alternatives I am mindful of the risks involved in this, but all of these alternatives would put us above the upper band and also above the upper cone for M1 And I just don't think anything would be gained by pushing M1 above the long-run target range; on the contrary, I think we have a lot to lose The financial market participants are well aware of these parallel bands and if they see us running short-run targets above those bands, I think they are going to question our anti-inflationary resolve Therefore, I couldn't accept anything above 5-1/2 percent, which would put us about at the top of the band Actually I prefer 5 percent, which would give us a little breathing room I don't know what kind  -26-    5/21/85  of federal funds rate it would take to do that--it might take a little bit of an uptick from where we are now--maybe where we were right before the discount rate was cut But if that had to be, I would rather see that than encounter the kind of scenario that Chuck outlined earlier, where later we find that we were wrong and have to push it up still more And if an increase is necessary, I think that might be some indication that the economy is really stronger than the Greenbook suggests  On this matter of not changing policy If the Committee does adopt alternative B, as I suppose it will, I think most people would regard that as a clear easing of the short-run policy stance that we adopted at the March meeting Now, there is nothing in the directive language to indicate that any easing has occurred but we have taken a small step in that way And in particular the term ""maintain"" in the first sentence of alternative B would be somewhat confusing I recognize the system we use and that the term ""degree of reserve pressures"" refers to the level of borrowing But I don't think that the outside world looks at it quite that narrowly, so they might not understand it So, I think that's at least a question we ought to address if we go with ""B"" as I would guess the Committee probably is going to do  No, I prefer ""would/would;"" I always prefer that so that we don't make a mistake  ""Would/mights"" That sounds infectious!  That's what it sounds like!  6 to 10-1/2 percent "
2932,1985-07-09,BLACK," It's about time for us to miss in the other direction!  Mr Chairman, I think there is one element of uncertainty that possibly overshadows these other uncertainties that others have mentioned and that is the issue that Steve outlined in his very fine paper the question as to whether we have had this permanent one-time drop in velocity of money or not The truth of the matter is that none of us knows I am inclined to think that we have had some of that; but if we have not, then I think there is a definite risk that with this much money, we could have more growth than is being projected I think that's the key to the uncertainty to all of this and I don't know how to find an answer to that one  The second permanent one in very few years  Just a question of clarification, Steve I thought at first that you were referring to a shift in the demand for money, but as I read it more I thought you were talking about a movement on the existing demand curve for money, weren't you?  How do you define radical, Mr Chairman? I would like to see that M1 slow down a little  I could probably live with $100 million  Actually, the level has been above our target for some time  I think the best solution, Mr Chairman, is to rebase this It probably surprises a lot of people that I say that But I'd rebase, in a sense forgiving part of this on the basis that there is probably some substance in what Steve is saying If we were to rebase, for example, and keep the 4 to 7 percent range and hit the top of that, that would result in an 89 percent rate of growth in M1 for the year, which seems adequate even if M1 has changed in meaning I would think that would be enough liquidity to keep the economy going pretty well  No, we don't  That's one thing--delayed rebasing--that we haven't considered  Of course, that's part of my motive  It would be hard not to; it grew over twice as fast as our target Of course, they don't know what the target was  Of course, we are not going to know whether M1 really has lost its meaning until several quarters down the road anyway I think there's a good possibility that it has lost a good part of it, so my inclination is to hedge the bets and assume it has lost some but not all of it That gets me to this rebasing But if we are wrong and it means what it used to mean, then we are in for a lot of trouble I hope it has lost a lot of its meaning  71 percent is the way I figured it  You get very different conclusions because of the arithmetic in this too If we did raise the upper limit to 9 percent, if I figured right, from the second quarter to the fourth quarter the growth rate would be around 7 percent; I think Steve's [estimate] was slightly different If you look at June to December, you are looking at the 5 percent; but if you look at the growth on a quarterly basis, it does not look like that much deceleration from the 10-1/2 percent or whatever it was in the first half The arithmetic can always be so troublesome on this; I don't know whether it's better to look at it on a quarterly basis or not I guess I would like to look at it in a chart and put least squares to it; that's the way I tend to think  No  What bothers me about raising the upper part of the range as opposed to rebasing is that when we get to next year and we want to work it down a little--if indeed we want to, and certainly over the long run we have all agreed that we want to--if we start with 8 percent, we have to work it back down to where it once was before and then down beyond that And in this political environment in which we live, if we had 4 to 7 percent on a rebased basis, it is easy to work it down, if that is what we want to do then If we had a 9 or 8 percent top, I think--  -37-    7/9-10/85  That is a good point I think we probably will end up about the same place at the end of the year, in terms of the level, regardless of which course we take The important thing is what we do in the shorter run  And was accompanied by declining interest rates  Well, I sense that the Chairman felt somewhat like that in posing the question first as to what we do in the short run I think he was saying something perfectly compatible with what you are saying, although his answer might not be the same as yours But I think he was saying that's where one ought to start    7/9-10/85  No, I agree with you It's just that I didn't want to be associated with you in any way, so I didn't say that! I did really; I thought that was your best statement to date, as a matter of fact  I pretty well agree with you, Mr Chairman, that there isn't a lot of difference, but one minor issue is Which one would make it easier for us as we work over the long run to lower those ranges? That's why, frankly, I came out in favor of the 4 to 7 percent range, rebased I think it would be easier to get it down, as I assume we are going to have to do over time, if we have a top of 7 percent rather than a top of 8 percent But that is a very minor point, probably  That's my point, really  Mine too  You meant real GNP didn't you?  There is a cosmetic aspect in this If we voted 4 to 8 percent this year, then 4 to 7 percent looks better to me for next year than if we vote 4 to 7 percent rebased and 4 to 7 percent for next year I think we ought to appear to be working toward our long-run objectives; I'd like to see it a little lower than whatever we select  But if, by the time we get to 1986 we have that information on the velocity of M1, as I assume we will--and if it looks as if it has permanently declined--then I would be willing to go up at that point I don't see that evidence now When we had the last episode in '82-'83 we had a decided decline in inflationary expectations and there was reason to expect the trend rate to decline We haven't had that this time, as I read it So there is less reason to expect the trend to decline, although there certainly does appear to have been that one-time downward shift in velocity  If it keeps happening, it's going to become more or less permanent and then I'd be willing to have higher ranges That's what I'm saying By that time I think we would have the evidence, and I would favor higher ranges if that is in fact true I'm a real pragmatist, despite what you may think  I'm a pure pragmatist  Not knowing what we're going to do this year, but assuming we might rebase with 4 to 7 percent, I like 3-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent [for 1986] I think a lot of people are going to say when we rebase that in fact we have eased And if we don't wave the flag and show some determination to deal with inflation down the road, then I think we've got a problem there That's why I'd put it a little lower than whatever we select for [this] year It might be merely a statement of pious intention, but I think it might be important  This gets back to your point, Bob  If we got 5-1/2 percent [M1 growth] from June to September, and then to December, that would mean for the year as a whole it would be something in excess of 9 percent That seems a little too rich for me I just don't think we need quite that much liquidity  Well, on a quarterly basis, the second quarter to the fourth quarter would be 76 percent  Yes  I think that's where I am, Emmett  Well, as another pragmatist, I'll take the other side on that because I think that that 9-1/2 percent, even with all these things going on, might be a little too much liquidity  No, you see--  -61-    7/9-10/85  Yes, but it's not--  7 percent  That's no tighter than 9 percent if we don't rebase It's the same; well, it's 1/10th of 1 percent different, if I read it right  Well, that puts you back down to 7 percent then, Chuck, I think  Yes, it does  7 percent for me, Mr Chairman  The Committee members didn't do a particularly good job; maybe you ought to listen to them  It's 5 percent  That's a little sneaky  Well, you could break the tie, Mr Chairman  There are 6, and if the Chairman is going with it, there would be 7  I don't object to the 3 percent; I object to the 8 percent  I guess so  3 to 7  4 to 7  Does this mean you would say somewhat lesser reserve restraint ""might"" be acceptable rather than ""would,"" Mr Chairman?  Yes I usually like ""would"" on both of them, but this time I--  That's what I would prefer  7-1/2 percent and 7-1/4 percent, I think  Some other people might be calling!  I thought it was the 17th "
2958,1985-08-20,BLACK," Are you suggesting that as a new control device?  Steve, some time back you were experimenting with the predictive qualities of M1A Have you played around with that lately to see whether it has any promise?  I don't think that there is anything out there now, but I think it is going to be out there some time, with a later lag In 1982-1983, velocity behaved very unusually and yet we had a very strong pickup in 1983 and nobody expected that The only thing that predicted it was M1 So, I am a pragmatist, and my faith is being shaken to some extent, but I still believe I am going to be vindicated on that somewhere down the road It would be very unusual if it didn't happen  Well, I'll have to [unintelligible] and find when that went in I don't remember exactly  Lyle is already pumping us for information! He asked me last night if I thought we would still get 8 percent in the fourth quarter, and I told him that it might be as late as the first quarter before we got that  Mr Chairman, I am very close to Emmett Rice on this Even if we are in the midst of a one-time downward shift in M1 velocity such as apparently occurred in 1982-83, or if we have a one or two percentage point drop in the long-term trend of velocity, still I think by any measure that a rate of increase of 115 percent since last October has to have provided plenty of financial underpinnings for expansion I am concerned that we will run into this credibility problem that Emmett outlined very clearly, so I think we ought to take  -25-    8/20/85  an unequivocal action to try to bring M1 down somewhere near at least the top of its long-term range Alternative C seems about the right sort of alternative to me But in addition to selecting this path, it is important that we also think about our methodology a bit, because merely choosing that path doesn't insure that we will hit it I think that we ought to be prepared to take some kind of action to hit this The relationship between the level of borrowed reserves and the growth of M1 is very tenuous and we keep getting fooled by that I think it is going to be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to predict that, so I would like to see us insert in our operating instructions to the Desk something a little more explicit We have provided that actions will be taken in the light of what is happening in the economy, what is happening in the domestic markets, the foreign exchange markets, inflation, and the like And I would like to pass on firm instructions to Peter that we would raise our borrowed reserve target if we start exceeding that unless the economy shows decided signs of weakening beyond what we now expect It has been very hard, at least for me anyway, to know what was going to be done once we left this meeting in the way of actions in the intermeeting period And I would like to see us tighten up those procedures if I can persuade you to do so  But I dissented in May because I thought 6 percent was too much; we got twice that much and so--  We are neutered?  Even with the period half done  -42-    8/20/85  SPEAKER(?) [Unintelligible] third quarter  It's 6 to 10 percent, I guess, Mr Chairman "
2986,1985-10-01,BLACK," Could you supply us with a written statement of these simulations you ran so that we could take a look at them at a more leisurely pace?  Mr Chairman, I held up my hand right before we got into the discussion of these foreign exchange simulations and we were trying to grapple with the idea of what accounts for the strength of M1 Everybody has been searching for that, even those of us in Richmond who don't always take that [aggregate] completely at face value, as you may assume we do I guess we reached the conclusion that this had to spell trouble for us unless one of two things has happened One would be that there has been a downward shift in the long-term trend of velocity--and I think there probably has been something of that as a result of financial innovation But it seems to me unlikely that this decline in velocity will be of such a magnitude that we can stand growth of anything like the 10 to 12 percent we have had over the bulk of this year without running into problems The second way in which it would not be inflationary would be if these sharp drops in nominal rates have been accompanied by a corresponding decline in either inflationary expectations or the real interest rate as a result of some autonomous weakening in some part of aggregate demand Actually, what little information we have on inflationary expectations suggests that there really hasn't been much of this One can't rule out these two possibilities at all, but on balance it seems to me that these two explanations--if indeed they are the only two, as we think they are--are insufficient to justify [M1] expansion of anything like what we have had So, we need to do something to get back to more normal growth rates It may be, as you said, that we are going to do that without any effort on our part But I do think that it is imperative that we slow this down to some extent because we just cannot explain away that much growth, in our judgment When we get to specific policy points, I would be glad to make some later; but I sense that it's probably not the best time to do it now  Well, I would think that it is important that we go ahead and move the borrowed reserve target up some This may prove to be totally unnecessary, but I would think something like $650 to  -10-    10/1/85  $750 million would be appropriate That might, of course, cause some increase in the federal funds rate--to 8-1/2 percent or so If [money] is still growing fast, I would be prepared to accept that If it isn't, then I would want to back off from it But I don't think that we ought to be so over-zealous in our efforts to get the money supply back on target that we aim even at the top of the range that we revised at midyear I think that clearly would be overkill in view of the rapid expansion we have had thus far But something like this 8 percent quarterly rate that is projected for the third quarter would seem to me to be reasonable in light of the kind of growth we had before the second quarter  Well, I am talking about the quarterly rate  The third quarter--if I don't have my figures wrong--would be about 8 percent It's 8 point something or other-- 83 percent I am just talking about the quarterly rate there  Of course with our procedures, we always have a risk that we are not going to get what we think because there's a pretty loose connection between the rate of growth in any of the aggregates and the borrowed reserve target  But I think we maybe ought to err a little on the side of tightness to make sure that we get some progress toward decelerating M1 But I would not push it so terribly hard that we get into--  Certainly couldn't be more descriptive!  I think it's a more accurate description of what we have been doing, but the old one gave the aggregates more primacy and I'd hate to see that lost But I sure agree with you that it's more [descriptive of] what we've been doing  I think people would read that second variant as saying that we are targeting nominal GNP, which is what I'm afraid we're doing I wouldn't want to be accused of dishonesty, since Chuck said this is more honest, but--  Yes, but they sure are downgraded from where they were  That's what markets do when we change--  On the one hand, we hope so but--  Even I think it will be a marked decline  How many people don't give a whit?  I think John Balles has a good point on the market's reaction to any change Partly I think it's a good point because I tried to make that same point earlier and--  Maybe we can weight the votes by the intensity of the feeling and come up with an algebraic average of it  Well, Mr Chairman, this is an argument I don't want to win, obviously, because if I'm right we have done the wrong thing My objective is to do the right thing So I hope I'm wrong Usually I don't hope I'm wrong on arguments, but I do on this one  Run it by Joe Coyne and let him tell you how the news media would or could react, and I guess--  Well, hush! That's the wrong answer! "
3012,1985-11-04,BLACK," Mr Chairman, I wonder if I might ask Jim a couple of questions Jim, you made some passing reference to the introduction of IBM's new Sierra mainframe computers I was struck by this weekly publication of Citicorp the other day that estimated there are 400 or 500 already on order to be delivered in the fourth quarter That would cause a pretty sizeable increase in total producer durable equipment expenditures; it seemed huge to me, just looking at it I wondered if you had made any estimate of what that might do The second thing is that I'd taken some encouragement from the nonfarm payroll employment figure and you suggested that ought to be averaged with September, if I understood you correctly Do you think that is a seasonal adjustment problem there or what?  And also partly offset by declining shipments of others  What they must have done in that Citicorp report, which was not clear to me, was to look just at the gross effect  It was surprisingly large; I wish I could remember that percentage because it shook me I ought to remember it, but senility has overtaken me and I can't  I may be too old for that!  Oh, it might be kind of fun!  Maybe we can get the post FOMC questions pre- lunch today  I just said ""maybe"" I didn't--  We could just say ""Growth in M1 over the period at an annual rate of around 6 percent is also anticipated""  It is if you go with--  I think we create less problems if we always keep them as ""woulds"" so it is symmetrical in both directions  I know you all don't But symmetry is one of my favorite attributes You can't tell by looking at me!  Make them both ""woulds""  It's more important to me where we start off Is it anticipated that we will start at $500 million? That was sort of the tenor of the discussion, as I read it  I am really talking about the path I recognize that those points you make are very valid points  What is the alternative, Mr Chairman?  I don't have any problem with that, considered asymmetrically, but I just don't know on which side the other one is going to be I guess it is going to be a lower level, isn't it?  If we have the choice of staying right where we are, that's the one I would prefer rather than this one If this is the higher--  Well, if we're reasonable about it, I think I'll join the majority this time That's what I am trying to do get something I can agree with  That's the midpoint  Just as an added bit of information, could we ask Steve and Peter to give us some idea of what they think the federal funds rate associated with that might be?  I think I would even advocate  That's what Mike Keran says our target is, now that he is out of the Federal Reserve System  You do that and we may not get unanimity!  They don't matter when they are over; they shouldn't matter when they are under either  If you are right, Pres, you have just changed my whole view  this?"
3037,1985-12-16,BLACK," Would that be possible in the case you were talking about, Jerry, where they are limited? As long as they are covered, are they okay?  I was just thinking about these institutional pensions having a 10 percent limit on their dollar [assets] But if that is covered, that limit is not--  No, I'm going to admit, Mr Chairman, that it has been rather sick; I guess in retrospect I should have recognized that it was sick sooner than I did But I don't think that's the key issue I think you just put your finger on the key issue What it is going to do from now on We have been through a very unusual period We have had a sharp decline in inflation and inflationary expectations; we have had extensive deregulation in the depository markets; and we may have had a decline in real interest rates This certainly has done something to change it for the time being but it may be the case that in the future it will resume some of its former characteristics It may be that it will proceed at a lower rate of secular growth For example, if we have had an element of savings introduced into the NOW accounts and other checkable deposits, as I assume we have, and if this has brought about some improvement in cash management policies, as I think it has, then that may mean that all we are really going to have after we are through this period--which is largely behind us, I think--is a slower rate of growth in velocity on a secular basis And if that is the case, then that can be as predictable as it has been in the past The paper certainly implies that just because it's slower, it doesn't mean that it is worthless The truth of the matter is, of course, no one knows for sure what it is going to do So that suggests that we ought at least to weigh with caution the idea of throwing it out completely, because for long periods of time in the past it has been a rather useful thing to look at I agree with Pres that a divisia index makes sense conceptually; I have always felt that that made more sense than anything else since obviously M1 is not the only thing that has some characteristic of money There are a lot of things that do And if we could somehow or another get the right weighted average, conceptually, that to me is the kind of thing that we want Because if we don't target something of that sort, then all we have left is interest rates and that involves a necessity of saying what the appropriate level of interest rates is That is very difficult for anybody to do and there is  -12-    12/16-17/85  nothing in theory or in empirical studies that suggests what the appropriate level ought to be But when we get to these divisia indexes I guess there is going to be a problem of data availability and also probably a problem of control of these--although I am hopeful that we can move in that general direction because that's what all my instincts tell me is really the best way for us to go  Well, they would be very akin to that You could have free reserves, you could have borrowed reserves, but--  Well, but to achieve a given price level, you have to have some way of moving the economy one way or another; I think that ought to be our goal ultimately, but you have to have a handle to move it in the right direction The exchange rate certainly would be one; I probably should not have not oversimplified to that extent  Mr Chairman, it seems to me that we are talking in terms of widening these ranges much more than they would have to be widened under any set of reasonable circumstances For example, if we should say that 4 percent real growth next year is a reasonable target--and I think we would all be very pleased with that--if M1 [velocity] should resume its historical rate, 3 percent being the normal rate, then a 4 percent rate of growth in M1 would be enough  -22-    12/16-17/85  In the past if we had no trend in velocity at all, if it was zero, then 7 percent growth in the money supply would be enough to finance that 7 percent rise in nominal GNP So 4 to 7 percent would encompass a pretty broad range there  Well, I was going to say In the case you cited, Chuck, where you talked about 12 percent, that would imply an 8 percent drop in velocity--which might happen for a year--to give you a 4 percent rate of GNP  If you had a 2 percent--well, there's no use running through all this arithmetic But 4 to 7 percent with zero percent [velocity growth], which seems about as low as you could possibly have it, is what I meant to say a while ago  I am not saying that it has to be; I am just saying that it seems like a reasonable floor You can certainly go beyond that, but to go to 12 percent as Chuck suggested awhile ago, facetiously I think, implies an 8 percent drop if you have to--  It could be, but I don't know what the reason for that would be  It's anybody's guess as to what those rates are going to be  Pres, they are also talking about a much lower rate of growth in real GNP than the 4 percent I said might be reasonable I am just saying that you can get 4 percent real growth with comparatively little M1 unless it really is misbehaving, which it may be  At a minimum, we can use these sometimes to justify what we want to do  If you choose prices, you still have to have some mechanism that you play around with to do that You have to have some tool or handle  That or some aggregate Exchange rates, interest rates or aggregates, or some combination I think that is exhaustive  We'd be accused of withholding useful information  Mr Chairman, I don't know where we are and I don't know where we are going, but it didn't stop me from talking before so I don't expect it to stop me this time! I think Jim and his group have done a usually good job in dealing with a very difficult period Their position is certainly plausible, particularly when you consider Gramm-Rudman, but I think it's a little more likely that with the kind of decline we've had in long rates, particularly mortgage rates, the surge in stock prices that Chuck mentioned awhile ago, the decline in the dollar, the substantial recent growth in money and liquidity, and the prospects of further declines in oil prices, that the errors will be on the high side of their forecast rather than on the low side I just have to conclude that the economy has to respond at some time--I would think in the not too distant future--to this convergence of favorable factors I don't have any great confidence in that view, but that's my best guess  Mr Chairman, I was very close to what I take to be your position and that expressed by Bob Forrestal And I thought for awhile that I might make history by agreeing with Frank Morris, but he went a little too far for me! I was very much encouraged by the slowing we thought we saw in the aggregates at the time of the last meeting But I'm equally discouraged by what has happened since then, and in particular by the rapid growth in currency and demand deposits as well as OCDs--the M1 target And that really scares me, as far as the implications for down the road So I think ""B"" is as easy as we really ought to think about being at this point As the Bluebook points out and as we all know, of course, it's particularly difficult to judge what's going to happen to the aggregates with a given borrowing level So I am more interested, I guess, in what our response would be to deviations in the any of the aggregates in the event that they don't come in on target For example, if M1 should come in at 12 or 13 percent instead of the 7-1/2 percent projected under alternative B, then I would hope that we would move the borrowing target up Similarly, if M1 came in weak, I'd be glad to lower that [target] somewhat And I would prefer ""would,"" obviously, in the directive wording rather than ""might,"" although I know you don't see a lot of difference in those As long as you would interpret ""might"" to mean that you would move the borrowing target up I could go along with ""might,"" but perhaps it--  I'm aware of that But you did paint a picture of a lot of liquidity that we had pumped into the economy, or so I interpreted your remarks So I would hope there would be a bit more sensitivity to additions in liquidity on top of that  Remember, you're going to be on a fixed income!  If those are the only two alternatives, I'll take the 1/4 point If there's a third, I have another thought  It will be February before anybody knows what we said anyway, so I think we ought to go ahead and mention it  Since we don't mention the borrowing target, it's kind of hard to mention the discount rate, since the two are linked, and I think--  I like what Jerry said, Mr Chairman "
3064,1986-02-11,BLACK," Mr Chairman, I always feel very nervous at times like this since I don't have much confidence in anybody's ability to forecast And with the Gramm-Rudman effects upon us and a [potential] drop in the oil price of unknown magnitude, we have two additional complications Our reading of the tea leaves is very close to what Jerry Corrigan has just described We're guessing that we'll be a little higher on real growth and inflation than the staff has projected, and I guess we have more confidence in our projection of real GNP than we do in prices We have a figure of 34 percent for real GNP; essentially, we think that the rapid growth in M1 last year, the recent declines in interest rates and in the dollar, the substantial recent increase in employment in January, and now the drop in oil prices are all going to combine to give us greater real consumer spending and greater business fixed investment than the staff has projected Indeed, I think the latest monthly data suggest that this could be upon us right now On the price side, we put in a figure of 4 percent for 1986, 4th quarter to 4th quarter; we are basing that upon this exceedingly large rise in Ml the acceleration in real activity that we seem to have had recently, and now the declining dollar, which is going to put increased pressure on prices Of course the drop in oil prices would have a mitigating effect on    2/11-12/86  this but nobody knows how much If it persists for a long time, it could well be that the staff's projection is going to be closer than ours From the standpoint of policy I think we have to realize that this oil price decline is a one-time effect in a sense and is likely to be short-lived And all the other factors that I see out there suggest that the pace of inflation is apt to be up somewhat from where it has been So, we are getting a little more nervous about that than we have been  CHAIRMANVOLCKER Governor Martin  Minneapolis certainly did improve when Jerry left, didn't it?  What led you to that conclusion? I do think it's good at the time we set these long-run targets to take a longer-run look at this and the reasons we are setting these ranges We have been at it now for 10 years and I don't think anyone would claim that they work perfectly But I do think they have helped us focus our attention on our long-run objective of trying to return to price stability The remark that Steve made a while ago about the importance of avoiding signals to the market suggests that the prudent thing for us to do at this point probably is to reaffirm the ranges that we had adopted tentatively at the middle of last year Now, even though Steve made a very excellent case for using all of the aggregates, I still believe--rightly or wrongly, and maybe just on the basis of blind faith--that, of the three that we look at, M1 is going to end up over the long-run being the best one to use A lot of these institutional changes are behind us and I don't think we have the same sort of change in inflationary expectations that we had in the past that affected the behavior of the aggregates I am well aware that the velocity of Ml may behave the same way it did last year, maybe even worse; but I think it's also reasonable to think that at some point it's going to resume some part of its normal behavior and I think that we ought to bear that possibility in mind, at least, in setting our targets And I think the 4 to 7 percent range does encompass those possibilities We have language in the Bluebook on    2/11-12/86  the long-run objectives that I think gives us enough flexibility to take care of that if we do have this aberrant behavior of Ml velocity If we want to recognize it explicitly, then I think we could use something like the 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent range suggested in paragraph 10 in the Bluebook I would be opposed to using the 4 to 8 percent band because that would involve widening the range only at the top, which I think would be noted by the markets and probably interpreted by them as some weakening of our anti-inflationary resolve So, I would stick with what we did at midyear  Just as long as it doesn't get to the point that everyone tells you the same thing about Ml, you'd be pleased!  It would rationalize a narrower range too  I do too  I think Steve makes a good point, Mr Chairman The language says M1 is subject to substantial uncertainties I wonder if it wouldn't be better to say the velocity of M1  Mr Chairman, I agree with you completely on that I would also like to agree with Pres on something He talked about the need for symmetry a while ago, and in view of what you have said, I think we ought to put a ""would"" instead of a ""might"" in that last part of the clause I know you don't think this makes any    2/11-12/86  difference It does to me We now have a ""might"" and a ""would,"" and the emphasis of your comments suggests to me that a ""would"" ought to be where ""might"" was  I would go with ""B""  That would be fine, Mr Chairman  I would stick with that ""Volcker $350 million,"" although if we run into these problems with the federal funds rate not being what we expected, we get the borrowing that you are talking about I think people very properly understood the context of the Committee's remarks the last time, saying that the Desk should give a low preference to the federal funds rate and it did so What is the borrowing related to that? What has it been coming to?  That's with an expected federal funds rate of around 7-3/4 percent?  Absolutely  Can we ask Steve what the expected federal funds rate would be? Is it still 7-3/4 percent or--  That's an awfully good question Could we ask Peter and Steve what they think about it?  I thought I deserved equal time since Pres had made that charge of asymmetry  I favor symmetry  It's better than what we had--let's put it that way "
3090,1986-04-01,BLACK," You didn't give us enough time, Mr Chairman We'd have objections to that one!  Mr Chairman, this is turning out to be a very pleasant meeting for me since I frequently have been an outlier in recent months, but I think I will end up somewhere in the middle of the pack I thought it was real interesting that Jim Kichline--  Well, I was going to say I was closer to you than anybody else, but I thought you would go into shock if I were to say that, so I refrained from it! It's interesting that Jim Kichline's forecast for real GNP is what we turned in for the Humphrey-Hawkins  -10-    4/1/86  report I know this will probably put Jim into a decline knowing what my forecasting record has been, so let me add that if we were doing it today, we would probably boost that to somewhere in the neighborhood of 4 percent I think one could make a case that it could be stronger than that, but out of deference to Bob Boykin's friends in the Southwest and the problems they have, I would temper that But I believe, like Frank Morris does, that the errors are probably going to be on the high side rather than on the low side, given all the financial underpinnings that we have for recovery declining interest rates, dropping oil prices, and also the apparent housing boom So I am really rather optimistic But as you said yourself, Mr Chairman, it's kind of based on faith because the statistics [don't show it yet] Every time I think they are coming out solidly on the good side, they jump a little the other way; but I still believe that we are in for a pretty darn good year  We have one foreign car dealer who puts in a $1,300 adjustment to market to push the asking price way above list-- in addition to the dealer enhancements, which are far above any reasonable cost So what appears to be the list price to every customer is about $2,000 above the suggested manufacturer's list Everybody thinks he is getting a big discount In fact, people are paying above list right now on many foreign cars It's very hard to buy them at list  Well, one would think so, but that's in fact what happens There is another dealer who gives you dealer list on one side and all of these dealer additions There are right many of those and they add up to right much So you are under the impression that the price at the bottom of that is the sum total of all of those, but there's about a $1,300 discrepancy there It's just an adjustment to market that he is not really showing honestly  Mr Chairman, a lot of the commentary one sees in the press and elsewhere suggests that this reduced inflationary rate gives us an opportunity to stimulate real economic activity without reigniting inflation I think we might well get away with that in the short run, but I would be quite concerned about an approach such as that in the long run The effects of the oil price decline are not going to last forever; once they are behind us we are going to be exposed to the risk that we will have a renewed outbreak in inflation, particularly if the economy is growing strongly and the dollar is still dropping I think we need to keep that in mind in establishing our policy; indeed, I would like to propose something I think Governor Angell came very close to saying a while ago--that rather than look at the current situation as a chance to stimulate the economy, we look at it as a chance to consolidate these excellent gains that we've made on inflation in recent years in the hope that somehow or another that will give us lasting price stability and a chance for sustainable growth in employment and production over the long run  With those thoughts in mind, I would come out the same as Tom Melzer did ""B"" with a $300 million borrowed reserve objective, with the federal funds rate expected to be in the neighborhood of 7-1/4 to 7-3/8 percent I would be quite happy, as you might suspect, if we got the kind of M1 growth embodied in ""C,"" but I think we probably ought to leave money market conditions where they are for the time being I think it is important, though, as we move ahead--from the standpoint of our longer-run credibility--that we try to hold M1 closer to its long-run target than we succeeded in doing last year, unless there is a definite weakening in the economy or a continued decline in the velocity of M1 For that reason and since Ml is right close to the top of its range--in fact, a little above it--I would be inclined to indicate a greater willingness toward restraint than toward easing in this intermeeting period Just one comment I am suggesting the $300 million borrowed reserve target on the assumption that the discount rate is unchanged If the Board should decide to cut that, under our present operating procedures we would expect the    4/1/86  federal funds rate to move down by roughly a commensurate amount That to me would be an easing of money market conditions, or ""reserve restraint"" I guess is the term we use So, if we should do that, I think we would want to take another look at that borrowing target "
3114,1986-05-20,BLACK," But if you look back a little farther, Ted, you wouldn't say that they had been as stimulative as we have been, though, would you? This is just recently  Jim, do you have the numerical figure on final sales?  Mr Chairman, we all seem to be pretty much of like mind this morning In view of what we know now, I guess that is not unpredictable We wouldn't have any difference at all with the staff's forecast for the balance of this year Our guess would be-- and of course it's purely a guess--that if in fact we do achieve those figures, we might be moving a little more strongly as we go into next year than the staff has projected, but just a tad more than what they are saying I am somewhat cheered by the feeling that inflation will be down over this period, but I do think that we might justifiably have some concern about the sharp rise in the price of nonfuel imports in the first quarter of 1986 That was not the first quarter in which that has taken place It is pointed out in the Greenbook, page 21 in the second part, that this could be a first step in the inflationary feedback we might expect from the substantial depreciation in the dollar that we have had over the last year or so That is something that I think bears watching  Do you think it would help to relieve the situation if you took a bunch of Texans up there?  Did you settle on yours?  You pretty well have said it all, Mr Chairman  Mr Chairman, as you indicated in the beginning-- and I think you pretty well said it all--the economy is being pulled in a lot of different directions And it seems to me that this is a time when perhaps we should stay about where we are Looking at the economic factors, there doesn't seem to be any reason for easing if we're half-way right in our assessment of what the economy is doing And Ml, as we know, has been going through the ceiling and now the broader aggregates seem to be picking up a good deal We have these special problems with particular sectors like agriculture and other manufacturing, but as you pointed out those are not things that we can address very well with monetary policy If we tried to nudge the dollar down, for example, it might well backfire on us and we'd really achieve no improvement in our balance of payments So, I've come down to the point that I think we ought to stay about where we are I would go with ""B,"" although in the absence of a sharp deceleration in economic activity I'd be real happy if the aggregates came in at ""C"" or even below that But if we get a clear signal that activity is beginning to accelerate beyond what any of us seem to expect and if the aggregates also are strengthening more than we anticipate, then I think we're going to have to be prepared at some early point to think    5/20/86  in terms of moving in the direction, anyway, of restraint I would not say restraint, but in that direction I think alternative III-- and this probably will surprise most of you, knowing my past views-- really captures the posture I think we ought to take it at this point; I hasten to add, however, that I would want to reinsert the short-term numerical targets for the aggregates when we get around to addressing the longer-term aggregates at our July meeting  10 to 8 percent!  All the time or just some times?  SPEAKER(?) Most of the time "
3141,1986-07-08,BLACK," Jim, isn't that a typographical error on that chart? Shouldn't it be ""FOMC projections for 1986"" instead of 1985? We are bad [forecasters] if it was for 1985 and we missed it that much!  That's a thought!  I reach a rather different conclusion, Mr Chairman I think Don Kohn set a very good stage when he said the real question was not what we do with M2 and M3 but what we do with Ml Even someone who has thought, as I have, that M1 has been so important has to admit that it has been behaving very strangely So, I think it does deserve somewhat special treatment at this point; but I think it would be a decided mistake to downgrade it completely, since it is the aggregate that we can control better than any other If we downgrade it, then that might jeopardize--and certainly would be perceived by a large part of the market as jeopardizing--our chances of attaining our long-run objective of permanently restoring price stability I think we have to recognize that [prospective role] at some point--that is, after the more normal relationship is re- established between M1 and the economy With interest rates having fallen the way they have, and with the general expectation that there won't be a great deal of movement in the last half, I think we might be at the point where we begin to see those relationships resuming in some form or another So if you buy that part, that gets to the question of whether to take these wider ranges beginning from the first of the year or whether to rebase As they are set up in the Bluebook, it really doesn't make a whole lot of difference so far as the end point is concerned, because rebasing from 3 to 8 percent results in a growth rate of 102 percent above the fourth quarter of 1985 which would be sort of in the middle of these two alternatives-- raising the ranges or rebasing back on the fourth quarter of last year But to me it would be much more logical to rebase, because my guess is that this unanticipated further substantial decline in the velocity of M1 in the first half of the year was due largely to this sharp decline in interest rates; and since we don't expect that to continue, to me it would make sense to sort of forgive that and rebase But a second and more practical reason to rebase is that if we are going to move this range down over time, it is going to be a lot easier--from a public relations standpoint--to move it down to something that eventually is compatible to price stability if we come down from a rebased 3 to 8 percent than if we had 5 to 9 percent or 5 to 10 percent and then suddenly said next year we want 3 to 8 percent or whatever it is we decide on I would definitely rebase, and I think 3 to 8 percent might be a good place to put the range And I would hope that in 1987 we could move it down somewhat from that point  It's not necessarily the old relationships that would have to re-emerge but predictable relationships I think the trend of velocity is going to be lower in the future than it has been in the past  I agree with that  We need a lot of future information so we would know what to do next year too That's really what it comes down to I don't think we have to have the whole relationship resumed but we have to have predictable relationships if we are going to use any kind of monetary target But the alternative, which you posed very well a while ago, Frank, is choosing a level of interest rates, unless we do something like Chairman Volcker once suggested when I made a similar assertion that we can stabilize the exchange rate But basically in a country like this, we have two choices use some aggregate or pick the appropriate level of interest rates And the question, I think, is on which path we'll make the smallest mistakes  It seems to me that whatever numbers we put in there ought to be predicated in part on what we think we are likely to want next year If you think we are likely to want a lot of growth in money then 5 to 10 percent makes more sense; but if you think by next year a lower figure would make more sense, then the rebasing argument comes into play Then it comes down to 3 to 8 percent or 3 to 7 percent or whatever we might decide looks more logical from a public relations standpoint  When you have a spate of bad news such as we have had the last month or two, it's very tempting to focus on that part alone; I think all of us tend to do that The good news is that the same thing happens on the other side and I think it's good for us to step back a little and try to take a little longer perspective than we sometimes do If I remember correctly, back in April we were all pretty bullish because we had several fundamental factors that we thought were going to oil the wheel for the last half of the year we had the declines in prices; the depreciation in the dollar; and then the continued low inflation All this seemed to suggest to us that things were going to accelerate And that was a very short while ago Now, of course, we have reached the point where the depressing effect of the oil price decline on the producers is apt to be replaced by or surpassed by the positive effect on the oil users So putting all these things together, it still seems reasonable to me that we ought to have a pretty fair increase in the second half of this year We have revised our figures downward as a result of the bad news that has come in, but we are still just a tad above where the Board staff is and about where the consensus is of the Reserve Bank presidents' forecasts If we get some more information that is below par and in particular if we don't see some improvement in the trade situation,    7/8-9/86  then I think we are going to have to take another look at it But for the time being we think that we might have [growth of] 3-1/2 percent in the third quarter and maybe 4-1/4 percent or something like that in the fourth quarter  It looks like the string we're pushing on is a wet string!  Well, the thing that bothers me, Mr Chairman, is that nobody wants M1 growth of 3 to 8 percent That's not really operationally very significant As we closed yesterday, I thought Jerry was making a very good point in arguing for wider ranges and higher ranges I personally prefer to rebase But I'd prefer what he was suggesting to this because if by chance--and maybe it's a very remote chance--Ml does reassume some of its previous characteristics, we really don't have anything operational that we can do with this 3 to 8 percent target at all, but we could with a larger one We could try to come in under that, if that should happen  Yes  Well, I misunderstood that I knew you suggested that, but I didn't realize we had settled it  I guess I misunderstood the point that you were making  -47-    7/8-9/86  I agree completely with Tom, but I think the discount rate decision precludes our doing that, so I think we have no alternative but to go with ""A"" or something akin to it But I think his case is persuasive; we have done all we can, I think  That has the elements working against each other  Couldn't we approach it this way? The consensus of the group seems to be that we want to ease reserve pressures If tomorrow the Board approves a cut in the discount rate, then we do it one way; if the Board doesn't, then we do it with a lower borrowed reserve target The Committee doesn't have to address that at this point As Manley said, I think all we need to put in there is ""decrease"" Since we never specify our borrowed reserve target in any of these--  That we are moving closer toward a federal funds target  That's the main significance "
3166,1986-08-19,BLACK," I think that's a more important point, Mr Chairman You touched on it a while ago about the collateral cover for Federal Reserve notes It'd be sort of ironic if the collateral cover, which was designed to make them safer and presume there's a limit to the issuance of money, led to an overabundance of demand deposit money because we didn't have the free securities to sell to sop up the reserves injected by borrowing So, if there's an opportune time, I think we might well want to consider lowering the gold certificate requirements and then eventually eliminate them because that's getting pretty close now  They never really had any any effect on limiting any of those things But to me the argument that Peter makes is most persuasive And also, it gives him a chance to keep up with what's going on in the market That's the most persuasive argument So, I'd opt for staying where we are, but I don't think it's any big deal one  -18-    8/19/86  way or another We're increasing liquidity all the time because he's not buying enough [bonds] to lower our liquidity So if liquidity is getting better it's not really a big issue  Yes It's interesting to have someone who has been at the Board and also at the New York Bank with the other view-- someone who has been both places looking at this ""bills only"" issue  You occupy a unique position having been in the two prime places when these different arguments have been made in the past  Jim, do you have private domestic final purchases in percentage terms?  What would that be?  Are these American cars?  Well, phasing out the deduction of consumer loans over time should speed up some consumer expenditures now  I would think  Right Yes, that's another good point  Mr Chairman, we come out about where I think Gary Stern came out in saying that the staff's forecast is probably pretty reasonable Like most people around the table, we think that this J-curve is going to be a little lazier J-curve, to use a metaphor, than the staff has assumed in its projection By the same token, we believe consumption expenditures probably are going to be a little greater because of the low interest rates and the low inflation and the high increases that are occurring in personal disposable income And I think this tax bill probably will have a positive effect upon consumer expenditures I end up by saying that if we do achieve the results the staff is projecting I think that's a darn good set of results for this stage of a business cycle, given all these structural problems that we have in the economy now I don't think we can hope for much better than that  I would like to latch on to that because I agree with Tom on that We have a lot of problems in this country, no question--in agriculture, manufacturing, energy, and so forth The near-term outlook for investment certainly doesn't appear to be very good But most of these problems are due to such things as structural changes in the international market, the federal budget deficit, and uncertainty over the impact of the tax bill And there is not a lot we can do about that with monetary policy We could undo a lot of the progress on inflation if we overlooked those concerns  You have a chicken and egg question here, too, as to whether they buy these investments and then we supply the reserves to support the deposits created or whether we're putting the reserves out first  But with the fed funds rate down to 5-3/4 percent wouldn't you think that was easier?  I am very closely in agreement with Gary Stern and Tom Melzer on that I consider this scenario that the staff has traced out in its projections to be a very fine outcome for this [stage of the] cycle--in the fourth year and into the fifth year I can see the arguments on the international side, but trying to nudge these other countries into action-- I just can't see how any further easing will do anything to our domestic problems, most of which can't be addressed by monetary policy The aggregates are running through the ceiling and I can see and understand very well why we've downgraded Ml I even agree with that, which may surprise some of you But somewhere along the way the aggregate numbers are going to mean something And at some point we are going to have to get back to    8/19/86  some kind of procedure in which targeting aggregates and trying to hit the targets is part of [our policy approach] Or else we are going to be back in an inflationary environment somewhere along the way; I don't know how soon, but it is coming So, I just can't see the case on the domestic side at this point  You meant to exclude the special borrowing in Oklahoma from the $200 million, Mr Chairman?  You're giving up the $400 million possibility if you vote for that  Well, you changed ""somewhat"" to ""slightly"" "
3192,1986-09-23,BLACK," But it has to be in the non M1-type deposits because you already know those required reserves    9/23/86  But aren't they based on deposits earlier in the period?  Yes, I said it backwards, I'm sorry  It does suggest, though, that if we get a chance we ought to get rid of that collateral requirement on notes just in case  Jim, do you have a CPI figure for all items other than food and energy?  3/10ths Thanks  Mr Chairman, our view of the near-term outlook is still pretty close to that of the staff This upward revision in growth of GNP in the second half makes sense to us in view of the domestic automobile sales incentives and what appears to be some improvement in the manufacturing sector in general I think the longer-term prospects are a little harder to call We're still generally optimistic and we think the staff is perhaps about right in projecting a moderate 3 percent rate of growth for next year In fact, we tend to think that consumer spending and probably business fixed investment might be a tad stronger One reason is that we don't think there will be quite as much of an increase in the cost of capital and, therefore, that the new tax law will be less damaging to capital spending than some economists believe--if you take into consideration that the top corporate tax rate has come down and also consider what has happened to individual income tax rates of dividend recipients  But all of this depends, I think, on interest rates and inflation remaining relatively stable And I think the risks have increased that such might not be the case on both fronts In particular, the prospect for progress in reducing the federal deficit looks a lot less favorable now I think the financial markets sense this and that's one of the reasons we had the recent backup in interest rates, which probably affected the decline in the stock prices The markets also are clearly more concerned now about the possibility of a revival of inflation and neither of these kinds of [developments] is good for the markets and neither is good for the  -17-    9/23/86  economy I hope we'll do everything we can to keep these things from gaining momentum  Mr Chairman, I would first like to endorse your statement that this would be a pretty darn favorable outlook In particular, considering that this is the fifth year of an economic upswing I don't think we would have expected to have done any better than that As I indicated earlier, I think the biggest risk is the possibility that this present pessimism that we have in the bond markets will gain momentum, with long-term interest rates backing up further Obviously, that would not be a very healthy development from the standpoint of the domestic outlook I think a lot of the concern in the market is stemming from some reduced hope that the Gramm-Rudman procedures and the reduction in the deficit will be possible There is certainly nothing we can do about that from the standpoint of monetary policy, but I think some of these developments clearly stem from a change in attitudes and a feeling that there has been an increase in the possibility of inflation I think that stems, in turn, from at least two factors One is the recent action of OPEC; but I think it is also probably nourished by some growing uneasiness about the substantial growth in money and liquidity that we have provided recently from the highly publicized moves of the System toward greater accommodation So, I think this is a time when we really ought to pause and take stock and convey a posture of caution to both financial markets and to the public in general, and I would favor alternative B  It probably means more emphasis on ""woulds"" than ""mights""  On ""woulds"" than ""mights""  What kind of increments are we going to use to measure ooze, Mr Chairman--$50 million, $25 million?  But you wouldn't go as far as ""C"" because that would be a trickle instead of an ooze "
3218,1986-11-05,BLACK," Almost by definition  If we have a flu epidemic [unintelligible], Mr Chairman, that would decrease GNP too  As I see it, I don't think there has been a lot of change in the business outlook since our last meeting I think those, led off by Bob Parry, who had the perception that people in the market and other observers think the statistics look a little better are correct But if you look at them on a moving average basis they're not quite as much better as you might think on the surface The anecdotal information we pick up from around our District, which had been pretty good, I would say was a tad worse than it was maybe a month ago When I try to figure that out, I think one of the factors is probably the paucity of any information that suggests that we're getting any acceleration of the upturn The other thing that seems to me to be more important now is the doubt that business people seem to  -17-    11/5/86  have about the effects of the tax law on businesses For example, one of our directors said at our last meeting that he estimated the tax changes would cost his business $3 million more in 1986 and $5 million more in 1987 And I think most of them are viewing it that way But I think the financial underpinnings are certainly there to accommodate any kind of reasonable upturn that we might have in the economy  I believe the staff is right in what it has done in the Greenbook projection As several people alluded to, if you break that projection down between gross domestic purchases and net exports of goods and services, you see that the projection shows gross domestic purchases for next year running well below what they're doing this year By dividing it that way it focuses pretty crucially on the importance of the net exports side So, if we are to get an increase in GNP that means that the net exports side of it has to come through I think that's a reasonable thing to expect; as several people have noted, we are seeing a lot of anecdotal information that this kind of thing is happening There are all sorts of measures of how much the dollar has depreciated, but when you get through all of those I think you have to conclude that in real terms there has been a pretty significant depreciation in the dollar So I think it would be rather surprising if we didn't get some kind of a turnaround in our real balance of payments with this kind of improvement in the terms of trade We think we'll see that more, of course, in the real figures in the GNP than in these monthly census figures on merchandise trade They may not show up But after the deflation, I think it's going to show up in net exports of goods and services I don't know whether it's of any value or not, but one of our economists ran a VAR model and he usually gets results almost diametrically opposed to what the Board staff has; but that [model] suggested about the same kind of improvement that the Board staff has projected It might concern you more that two models suggest the same thing than if neither did!  Vector autoregression is what it stands for  It came along after we finished our graduate work, Mr Chairman, so we weren't really exposed to it in those days So, we would buy the staff's forecast and we would say the chances of error are about equal on each side of it  Mr Chairman, even though ""would/might"" sounds like some kind of obnoxious insect such as a tick, I would still like to keep our ""would/might""  Yes, I agree with that  This is going to be a long meeting  Don't you have to take out ""respectively,"" Mr Chairman? "
3242,1986-12-15,BLACK," I think Martha has a good point; you used to supply dollar figures [in the Greenbook] and then removed them awhile back Sometimes [unintelligible]  I would and I gather that Martha would I don't know--  Don, in expressing doubts about the new model, are you explicitly assuming that you will have more rapid adjustment on the offering rates?  You are seeing some movement--  Yes, I have some Mr Chairman, which I will talk about tomorrow  Did you ask if anybody wanted to comment, Mr Chairman? At the appropriate time, I would like to  I don't see much point in setting a range for Ml because it has been misbehaving so badly We could simply omit the range but I think it would be worthwhile if we substituted a range for M1A I know there are problems with trying to target M1A, just like there are problems with any of the other aggregates; but the long-run interest elasticity of M1A reported in the staff paper is low enough to make it, I think, technically feasible to set a range of 4 to 5 percentage points [in width], which is what we have done customarily It seems to me likely that the interest elasticity of M1A will remain relatively stable even if the depository institutions began to adjust their deposit rates more flexibly in response to changes in market rates And I just think that some sort of discipline like that could be very useful in reminding the public that we are serious about inflation Also, if we get to the point that we need to tighten up, we are going to need something to [unintelligible] Remembering back to October 6, 1979, I think a lot of people voted for targeting the aggregates because they thought it provided an excuse to raise interest rates more than they otherwise could get away with; and I think this kind of aggregate target could be extremely useful in that capacity when that time comes, if it ever comes I would do this along with--  The last paragraph on page 15 is a good one to read on that For me, it's easier to interpret that sort of thing than to look at the elasticity tables It says that a 50 basis point change in market interest rates would alter M1A growth and its velocity by less than 1/4 of a percentage point at an annual rate in the short run and about 1/2 of a percentage point over the year--not perfect, but not bad by the standards of the other possibilities, I think  I was going to ask Mr Kohn what he thinks it ought to be  Mr Chairman, I have a more radical idea  I didn't mean to overstate the case about M1A because I don't think it's going to be all that good; I don't think anything is going to be all that good What I would really like to see us consider is setting inflation targets for the next three years or so I don't have in mind that we would set up any kind of automatic operational procedure that would cause us to in any kind of predetermined way do something if we deviate from this target All I am recommending is that we set forth an explicit objective I think that would have more than a cosmetic effect because, first of all, it would help preserve our credibility in the sense that the public would know that we were going to have to take some kind of action to try to get inflation in line if we saw signs that we were deviating from the target The second reason I mentioned a while ago--that it is awfully nice when the time comes that we have to take the unpopular step of tightening to have something that we can point to other than interest rates If the aggregates are weak, we don't have a lot to point to and something of this sort could give us some political insulation at a time when we need it  Since we can't accept anything else, I would be afraid to throw those out  I think Jerry's concern is that if you bury it too deeply then you may not be able to exhume it if you need it    12/15-16/86  Well, that may change some over time I hope--  Don, how likely do you think it will be that eventually we will get to the point where these rates paid on other checkable deposits will vary pretty directly with market rates?  Particularly if we drop the M1 target, I think it has a message there  I think the staff's projection for real GNP is still reasonable both for the fourth quarter and for 1987 Like everybody else, we were impressed by the November report on employment; and I think the staff was right to revise their figures up on that basis But I really believe that the near-term outlook is more uncertain than it has been for some little time It seems that one month we get a series of good reports and the next month they are all bad; we keep flip-flopping back and forth as these reports come in But for three reasons, I am now concluding that the risk may be on the down side One reason is in the foreign trade sector I am particularly uneasy about the rapid improvement of the net exports of goods and services projected for the fourth quarter by the staff Even taking account of the likely slant in petroleum imports, I think there's certainly better than an even chance that we are eventually going to see some improvement on the trade side; at the same time, this strong and increasing competition from some of the smaller Asian countries and rather lackluster performance in the German economy in the third quarter lead us to think that the improvement might not be quite as great as most people are assuming I guess it was Bob Parry a while ago who suggested that it might be stronger now, and I certainly hope that he's right on that I am a little worried by it  We are disturbed for a second reason by this continued deceleration in residential [construction] and new home sales; and we got a new figure that sort of confirmed that this morning Finally, we are not as confident about the prospects for consumer expenditures as we were at the last meeting  the head of a large department store reported that sales had literally dried up right at Thanksgiving, after having been very good before then This was a nationwide phenomenon rather than something simply confined to the area; we get the same kind of reports from other retailers in our area And I can't help but think that some of this strength we are seeing--even in items other than automobiles--is an acceleration of purchases by those few people who itemize their sales tax deductions in order to take advantage of that this year on big-ticket items before next year when the tax is not deductible  I, too, would favor alternative B, Mr Chairman I prefer the proposed substitute language because I don't think we have any idea where Ml is going to be headed in the next two to three months and I don't think we'd react to it anyway, unless we were getting similar signals from the other aggregates I always tend to favor a symmetrical posture and I think I would this time, [although] what Manley said certainly makes sense I prefer ""somewhat"" over ""slightly"" because I think that indicates a little more willingness to react in case something unexpected occurs And for the same reason I prefer the ""woulds"" over the ""mights""  Well, you could say ""in view--""  What I heard was a feeling of uncertainty, Mr Chairman, tilted a little in the way you say But if uncertainty is the predominant feeling then the symmetrical language makes a little more sense to me because we could be wrong in either direction  Yes, I agree with that; and I was on that side But I don't say that with a great deal of confidence and I don't think any of us does  We can make a federal case out of it  That would be making it a federal case!  And we can play with the ""woulds"" and ""mights"" too  You've got three combinations  Oh, we could really have some fun indeed! "
3267,1987-02-10,BLACK," Peter, I guess that you would say the degree of pressure on reserve positions is essentially unchanged, despite the higher federal funds rate  He's not with that company any more  I didn't mean to imply otherwise by my question I felt that was the way you were going to answer, but I just wanted to make sure that you still view it the same way Because of the high spread between the discount rate and the federal funds rate, there    2/10-11/87  might be a little more demand for those borrowings, so there might be a little more pressure  A couple of our banks reported that they couldn't find the federal funds The market had dried up, as far as they were concerned  Jim, or Mike, I forget which one of you mentioned [in the presentation] that if you had had the employment report you probably would have upped your forecast a little If you add to that the National Association of Purchasing Manager's Report, would that cause you to change your figures?  I hope the converse of that doesn't necessarily apply!  Mr Chairman, we are more on the optimistic side, like some of our brethren are, I am comforted to see We may have been overly influenced by the signs of a turnaround in manufacturing in recent months than by the flurry of good statistics that has just hit in the face of a great deal of liquidity in the economy We put in 3-1/2 percent as the rate of growth in real GNP, and we have the unemployment rate coming down to 64 percent So far as our analysis is concerned, we are pretty much in agreement with the staff on the forces that are at work in that we think there is going to be a marked improvement in the net export picture and that it's going to be a  -20-    2/10-11/87  major contributor to growth We also agree with the conclusion that gross domestic purchases are going to grow more slowly, but we differ mainly in that we think that there are going to be more real personal consumption expenditures The staff has projected just 1-1/2 percent growth fourth quarter to fourth quarter It is certainly true that we have a lot of debt there, but we also have some factors that offset that negative in the growth of wealth So our guess is that PCE is going to be somewhat higher than their forecast Coincidentally, I suppose, we had about the same kind of growth in real disposable income last year as they are projecting for 1987 and we had a 4 percent rise in real consumer expenditures Against this more optimistic forecast, we have inflation near the high side, at 38 percent I am a little comforted to see that someone else is there and even more comforted by one of the Board member's forecast of real GNP of 4 percent For once I am not the high one on that We think that inflation is going to stem from this stronger projection of real growth; that ought to tend to reduce this remaining slack in labor and product markets, particularly in the second half of the year Insofar as the risks are concerned, I would say that the risks are that the numbers are going to come in somewhere between our forecast and the Board staff's  It's an averaging of two misses, probably  I sure hope you are right  Mr Chairman, I'd be reluctant to reduce the ranges a full percentage point as alternative III suggests, and I think we'd risk confusing the market if we went with alternative I Besides, I think the staff has made a good case for alternative II as  -30-    2/10-11/87  encompassing, probably, all the reasonably likely behaviors that we might see in velocity of M2 and M3 So I can go with ""II"" like everyone else  Well said  Up until April 15th  All guides are unreliable; some are just more unreliable than others  Mr Chairman, I think this variant I as you've suggested is really the one that we ought to use for the reasons that you indicated I was inclined to be sympathetic to Jerry Corrigan, but you made some pretty tough points on that At the same time, I think Tom Melzer has a point, too In a period when the risk of inflation seems to be increasing and the risks of [rising] inflationary expectations also are increasing, there could be concern about the dropping of M1 [as a target] That's the reason, really, that we put forth that idea of putting an inflation target in there to reassure the public that we had not lost our determination to deal with inflation  That has a lot of appeal  If we did it for the first half of the year would we use December to June?  I think it would be best to use January for the base because that's really the latest date  That's exactly the way I'd come out, I think  That's another factor  Well, we are not going to have much between now and next Thursday  That's what we are going to be listening for  I sure do like that idea of using the January base  That pretty well covers the intermeeting period, too  Aim at 6 to 7 percent for whatever month you pick  They can use this double asymmetry I can see the caption on that now That may be symmetric double negatives  Mr Chairman, many years ago--20 to 25 years ago --the market at one time had a sentence that said, ""The federal funds rate is hanging at this level apparently out of respect for what the market thinks the Open Market Committee has done""  You could say ""In the context of signs such as""  I think that ""such as--""  -60-    2/10-11/87  We're talking about slower M1 growth in the first line and the broader aggregates in the second line, aren't we? "
3292,1987-03-31,BLACK," Sam, to what extent have the market participants been able to figure out how much we have done in exchange market    3/31/87  intervention for our account and for the Treasury's account? Is there a pretty good idea?  It's the allowance you make for the errors in the accuracy of your rifle  SPEAKER(?) Did you learn that in Manhattan, Jerry?  The Bank has?  At the time of our February meeting we had slightly higher projections on real GNP and inflation than the Board  -25-    3/31/87  staff had The staff has not changed its overall projection, although it has changed the shape or the profile, and we left ours pretty much the same--partly out of conviction and also probably because we knew if we made another forecast that we would have two errors rather than one The main point of difference that we have with the staff is in the area of residential construction We think, given the sharp drop that we have had in mortgage rates, that it ought to be a little stronger than 13 percent Even more important than that, the staff's downward revision in construction and personal consumption expenditures, to which several people have alluded, is pretty significant It has come down from 4 percent in 1986 to 1 percent in 1987 and we have not had that low a rate of growth since 1981, which was a recession year In view of the proliferation of home equity mortgage loans--which I would think would make a difference--and also the wealth effect of the stock market, we think that that's apt to be a little stronger We come out about the same on the net exports of goods and services, although I think that is probably the most vulnerable part of all of our forecasts Things don't look all that good abroad now but we would stick with about what the Board's staff has said  As I mentioned, in the area of inflation we are a little higher than the Board staff Although we are still predicting a fairly moderate inflation in the implicit price deflator for next year, I think this price level bears some closer monitoring There is a lot of money and liquidity out there and that is going to be felt at some time We have had a substantial depreciation of the dollar and there has been an increase in capacity utilization, and all these things ought to work to put some upward pressure on the dollar at some point It may come a little sooner than most people seem to think Some of the pickup in industrial prices, as shown in the Greenbook and also reported in several of the District surveys contained in the Beige book, suggest that there may be a little more there than meets the eye I hope not, but it is something that I think bears some watching for the time being  Mr Chairman, this seems to me too like a good time to hold our policy steady I would opt for ""B"" and I would maintain that tilt toward restraint in the language of the directive There's a good case for making this language symmetrical, which is what I generally favor, particularly now with the aggregates slowing down That case can be made; but I think over the last couple of years we assumed that at some point the rapid growth in the aggregates was going to be followed by a slowing in those growth rates as they adjusted to the downward drift in interest rates That is what we may be seeing now And, like you, I would be very reluctant to do anything in the way of ease if the aggregates continue weak for a while because, if anything, the economy looks a little stronger to me now than it did So, that would not be any signal to me that we ought to act in that direction in the immediate future I would not favor putting a greater weight in the written directive on the foreign exchange side, although I think we would necessarily emphasize that We already have language in the directive now, and if we use the kind  -31-    3/31/87  of language suggested in the Bluebook I would have some concern as to how the markets might interpret that Although I certainly don't know, I fear that the markets might think that means more of a [unintelligible] than probably we have in mind I wouldn't want to give that kind of signal I would just ride with the reference that we already have in the directive about giving due attention to foreign exchange matters  Just delay the vote awhile  I think the only feasible alternative to what you suggested is 6 percent  That's the best one if we don't go with 4 to 7 percent  We used to do that  Somebody from west Texas; there's always been a [different] world down there  I think everybody would be "
3327,1987-05-19,BLACK," Peter, something you said earlier suggested to me that if you were to get that drifting back of the funds rate you would expect to see the dollar weaken right much Is that a fair reading of what you said?  They think we've got alternative C instead of alternative B  That's what Peter said, really, I think  It's still down; everything--  Mr Chairman, I come out pretty close to the Board staff's forecast We are a tad stronger than they are and had been even stronger; but we moved more closely to them because of the weakness in consumption in the first quarter, even abstracting from the automobile situation I agree with the point that Bob Parry just made that the balance of trade is going to be the strongest part of it I think Ed Boehne really put his finger on what is a more important issue there, and that is the extent to which the general outlook at the moment is correctly reflecting the amount of inflation that we're going to have There are a lot of inflationary expectations around the economy, as indicated by the bond markets And there's some question in my mind as to whether that's justified I think all of you know that I believe the primary objective of monetary policy is price stability; but based on what knowledge we now have about prices I think there's at least some chance that the markets have overstated the extent to which there's a risk of    5/19/87  acceleration in price pressures We're clearly experiencing a lot of increases in prices in the energy area and in food prices, both at the consumer and the producer price levels; and we've gotten scattered price increases because of depreciation of the dollar But these are all relative price increases; they don't necessarily mean that we're going to see that much increase in the overall price level Of course, we've had this strength to which many people have alluded in the commodity prices and in commodity futures But, again, there's a lot of noise in these data; there are a lot of special factors and there is some question as to how accurate these are going to be in predicting what the overall price level is really going to do I don't want you to misunderstand me; I'm not saying that I don't think there's any chance that we're going to have a pronounced rise in inflation I just simply am not quite convinced yet that those fears, as expressed in the changing nature of the yield curve, are really quite justified at this point The economy still looks sort of weak in spots, so we ought to think about it pretty cautiously But this is the point at which I think we usually have made our errors in policy in the past, so it's something to which we want to give a great deal of attention  Why don't you say we were sitting around the Open Market Committee table and didn't know what was happening and wanted to--  Do you think it is going to reverse itself without help from you, Peter? Or do you think you will have to unload some?  Mr Chairman, I apparently led some of our colleagues into thinking that I did not see any inflation pickup at all All I meant to convey was that I thought that markets may be anticipating more than, in fact, is likely to happen I do think that inflationary expectations and some indications of inflation have actually appeared But, in view of the weakness in the domestic economy and even greater weakness abroad, and now this Citibank situation, I think maybe we ought to proceed with some caution I was inclined to favor a position that was more a ""B-minus"", but after listening to comments around the table, I think what I really would like is a level of borrowed reserves that would produce a federal funds rate of around 6-3/4 percent, as it has been recently I'd put that in either the ""B-minus"" or the ""C"" category I would also favor going toward variant II [of the directive language], and moving that foreign exchange reference back to its usual position And I would like to use ""would"" and ""might"" Also, I think it might be worth considering moving up that point on the concerns about inflationary pressures before the reference to the strength in the business expansion as a way of showing that that is now a more important consideration This refers to what you'd find in the directive language with the brown cover on lines 110 and 111 or on page 15 of the Bluebook And, I would hold that discount rate move in abeyance for a while in case we get some real pressure on the dollar so that we could move very quickly on it at that time I don't feel terribly strongly about that  You've got that in Variant II, Manley I wonder if you would be amenable to putting that in front of the strength of the business expansion, which is the idea that I threw out  I think it gets to the same sort of thing  Yes, that's what I would do move it up to line 110 instead of 111 and put it right ahead of the ""strength in the business expansion""  Well, it is; I grant that  I think you can leave the second one out, but that may put more emphasis on the aggregates than you want to give them  That is what I would recommend to our Board on Thursday But in the interest of Gramm-Rudmann, if the Board acts to approve a move on the discount rate before Thursday, we have to spend another $300 to get our executive committee together to go along with you  There is going to be a bunch [of discount rate actions] coming in There are more [boards of directors] that meet on this Thursday than at any other time "
3350,1987-07-07,BLACK," What is your guess on what those numbers will look like?  The most important argument for using the borrowed reserve target is that it gives us a certain amount of political insulation so that we can let the federal funds rate move more than we otherwise would be able to do That to me is the important decision  Mr Chairman, in reading this discussion of the alternatives in the Bluebook, I was struck by the difference between the way some of us used to view these ranges several years ago and the way in which we are approaching them now, which seems to me to be very different In the past, some of us thought of these aggregates as intermediate targets and we selected ranges that we felt would be consistent with progress against inflation in the context of reasonable economic growth And, of course, one of the advantages of this fairly direct relationship was that we made an announcement on the ranges and it was reasonably clear as a signal to both the public and Congress of what our intentions were This present approach is, I think, very different from that What we are doing now, as I think the Bluebook makes very clear, is projecting a broad path of interest rates that we think will be consistent with a desirable economic  -31-    7/7/87  outcome and then we project the ranges for the aggregates that we think will be consistent with that interest rate path Now, I realize that the increased sensitivity of the aggregates to interest rates makes this a logical move but I worry that this approach, if we follow it too slavishly, is going to lead us to deemphasize the aggregates to such a point that these ranges will cease to be reasonable signals to the market as any kind of confirmation of our longer-term objectives Thus, I would have some reservations about reducing this 1987 range for M2 even though I recognize that a good case can be made for doing that on the basis of the prospective behavior of interest rates over the next 18 months or so I think some professionals in the market would clearly understand what we are trying to do; but I think there would be a lot of other people who would not understand it They would likely interpret it as a considerable move toward ease in the short run, which seems to me to be pretty unwise, given the uncertainties regarding the overall economy and inflation So I think a better approach would be to leave that range unchanged and state explicitly that there is a possibility that it may be appropriate to come in under the range if the recent trends in velocity continue  If you want me to go on to 1988 I would say that I would take alternative II, which would reduce all the ranges If we do that, though, I think we ought to have a sentence, which I would be glad to suggest if anybody has any sympathy with this, to explain the rationale behind why we are reducing these ranges--that the further reductions are going to be required over time if we are going to extend the recent progress we have made against inflation  Mr Chairman, I indicated earlier at the time I was talking about 1987 that I would be in favor of alternative II I still feel that way  If we don't go with alternative II, I think we need to go with alternative III for 1988  I am not sure that the best choice for 1987 isn't in part determined by what we do in the short run, because if we are not going to send a signal of any action there, then it makes it a little easier to explain no change for 1987 If we decide to take some action, I think it becomes a little more difficult to maintain the status quo for 1987  I am repeating myself, but I really do think this would come to a head if we would address the short-run target I think it makes the long-run a bit easier because we either send a signal or we don't and that strengthens or weakens the case for the most favored alternative  I think this is a dispute about how we explain something that we almost all agree on  They would eliminate the System!  Which ones?  With ""woulds"" or ""mights""?  That really [balances] off very nicely between 5 and 10  Trust him, Bob That's Boston--  We took a look at that Treasury study and concluded the same thing that the staff did that M2 is a little better  That's where we came out, quite independently of what they had done, much to my disappointment  I've been telling them they were playing with fire "
3376,1987-08-18,BLACK," Mr Chairman, I think the staff has done an unusually good job in describing the outlook, and I know Mike has done a very exceptional job in handling some very difficult questions I guess I come out pretty close to where Frank Morris is on this I think that the recent spate of statistics indicates that the economy is really beginning to strengthen quite a bit and a lot of that apparently is resulting from improved exports I would sort of discount the last figures we got from Census on the trade balance on the grounds that you have a lot of price increases of imported goods in there, and price increases on oil, and probably some anticipatory buying because of the oil problems and also because of protectionist legislation So, if this is true, then I think we could see some bigger figures than the staff is projecting We are approaching the end of the fifth year of economic expansion at a time when we would expect bottlenecks to begin to appear, and I think they are in some industries This is the kind of environment in which we could see wage and cost pressures begin to turn around from what we have been fortunate to have had in the immediate past, along with this further heightening of inflationary pressures and attendant upward pressure on long-term interest rates So, I think it's a situation where we have to increase the care with which we look at the situation; we're now in a different era from where we were a couple of months or so ago  As Bob Parry indicated, Mr Chairman, a number of us at the last meeting thought that we were probably going to have to let interest rates rise over the next 12 to 18 months if we were going to prevent this underlying rate of inflation from accelerating And it seems to me that this expectation is even more likely now, in view of the information that we have had since then At the same time, I am not exactly sure when it will be appropriate for us to take that action; but I believe that it will probably be sooner than I would  -28-    8/18/87 -29-  have thought at the time of the last meeting I am also well aware that the history of the System has been that, generally, we have not moved fast enough against inflation So, I tend to try to compensate for that Despite that, since there is a good deal of uncertainty out there, I believe the best case for now is to stick with alternative B I would make it asymmetrical with the ""would"" on the tightening side and the ""might"" on the other I think the Board staff's statement with regards to the ""as well as"" clause does suggest that it would be helpful to shift that around to deemphasize the borrowing side; as for the weakness of the dollar, that may deserve some further thought I think there is also another argument that we ought to put restraint of the business expansion high on that list if we are going to change the list around And I would not put in that sentence on the undershoot of the aggregates at all And I say this with the sneaking suspicion that later on down the road, I am going to look back and say, ""I wish I had been where Jerry Corrigan and those others were"" "
3402,1987-09-22,BLACK," Following up on Chairman Greenspan's comment, Peter, suppose that in the next maintenance period you do come in pretty close to $600 million and the market now expects $500 to $600 million Would you expect much rate movement if you got closer to that figure?  Mr Chairman, most of the comments have been directed at particular parts of the forecast My feeling the last time was that the economy would be somewhat stronger than the Greenbook was projecting, and the staff, indeed, have moved their forecast in that general direction So, we have very little quarrel with what they have done We think the main driving force is going to be an improvement in net exports of goods and services; and plant and equipment expenditures, particularly in the equipment area, also provide a pretty good push If we were to guess, we would say the risk might still be that the forecast is a little low But really what bothers us, I guess, is the feeling that they might be right on this forecast In saying that, I'm focusing on the inflation rate that they are projecting for next year--when it goes up to 4-1/2 percent I think we ought to be able to do better than that for next year, and we ought to target something less than that A 4-1/2 percent inflation rate could easily become 5 percent; and 5 percent is not really reasonable price stability So, rather than thinking they may have overestimated, we're afraid that they might be about right and have come up with some results that are a little too strong on the price side  Mr Chairman, I'm afraid I owe some apology for having discussed my thoughts on the state of the US economy at a time you wanted to consign to questions So let me just address that last question you posed as best I can, which is not very well I think you have to look at the negative correlation we have had between exchange rates and long-term interest rates since the fall of 1986 to get an answer to that There are three possible explanations one is that this has resulted from still a third factor, which is the rise in inflationary expectations A second--and maybe the most popular explanation of it--is that this decline in the dollar rate has been a decline in the real rate because of the persistently larger trade deficits that we have had, and fears that this will be reflected in higher import prices, which also will spill over into the prices of goods from those industries that compete with imports And the third explanation is that the rates may be high because the market is responding to what it thinks we are likely to do; but if that is the case, tightening would clearly be inappropriate because that would mean, I think, that a large part of that was real My impression has been that there really hasn't been that much response at the long end  -23-    9/22/87  to actions that we have taken For example, the response to what I thought was a very strong statement via the discount rate increase and also the raising of the borrowed reserve level was big at the short end; but we didn't really have all that much response at the long end So, that suggests to me that some part of this is probably real I guess I would end up with a view along the lines that Jerry first outlined, and some others have endorsed, that part of this is real and part of this is inflationary expectations I don't know what the mix is and I guess nobody else does But, I believe both factors are at work, I'm afraid  I do too  Mr Chairman, you might think in view of how I stressed the unacceptability of the forecast for next year that I would be advocating ""C"" as Bob Parry did, but I really think the steps we have taken already have been pretty strong In fact, we haven't even implemented all we agreed to do last time, so I would not favor anything beyond ""B"", particularly since I think that there has been a rise in real rates Also, we have had pretty subdued behavior on the part of the aggregates But I wouldn't want the symmetrical part of it because I just don't see the likelihood that we would want to ease during this period As a general rule, I'd rather it be symmetrical because I don't think we usually know; but I think something would be read into it if we eliminated the asymmetry this time  Could we rephrase that and say we did not change policy rather than we did nothing? "
3434,1987-11-03,BLACK," There's a constitutional basis for that position  Mike, with businesses having become so much leaner and meaner in recent years and increasingly willing to bring about permanent layoffs and temporary layoffs, some of our contacts have been telling us that if the downturn does intensify, they would expect the unemployment rate to jump pretty sharply because of this changing attitude on the part of businesses Does that seem reasonable to you? If so, have you factored it into these high unemployment rates that you are projecting here?  I agree pretty much with your forecast It just struck me as an interesting thought, since business people seem to feel that they will not hesitate this time like they sometimes have in the past  It is interesting that they got so much leaner with such a big rise too in the participation rate in the labor force It seems to have happened  He may see some jumps of other types too  This seems to be a day of confessions, Mr Chairman, and I will have to join those who confess that they don't have much confidence in their own projections I have less now than I typically do, of course, which is saying that I don't have a great deal We have these two elements of uncertainty to be sure first, we don't know what the impact of the decline that has occurred in the stock market thus far is going to be; second and more importantly, we don't know how much further domestic and foreign markets may decline And I don't think a further decline is a risk we can completely rule out So, the uncertainty level is extremely high But we don't know the answers to these questions Assuming that the market settles down somewhere in the 1900-2100 range, I think the staff's forecast is pretty reasonable; I don't think we could improve on that a great deal That seems to be what the business people in our District feel; at least that's what we have been able to uncover up until now But I do think there's a lot of risk in this, regardless of where you come out It is clear to me that there has been a big blow to inflation and to inflationary expectations in the short run from this But if the decline turns out to be as moderate as the staff has projected, and as we have endorsed, I don't think it's unreasonable to suppose that by the middle or last half of next year the same kind of worries that we had on the inflation front earlier might reemerge And I think that we ought to have that in mind as a definite possibility as we address what we do in the immediate future, because the effects of actions we take now are going to be felt down the road, and we ought to be well aware that that possibility is at least out there  I think the point at which you arrive has to be dependent in part on what you think really happened to the stock market whether it came from real shocks or liquidity shocks or some combination I lean to the view that it was more real, along the lines of what Frank Morris was describing earlier, in that the earnings-price ratios had gotten totally out of line with the bond yield And then there were a couple of sparks that set it off the problems in the Persian Gulf and the likelihood that we were going to enact some very severe protectionist legislation At the same time, I think there were liquidity shocks once this happened And I think we met those liquidity shocks, as we ought to in such a case, when we issued a statement that we would provide liquidity But as far as these real shocks are concerned, I don't think there's a lot that we can do about that through policy So, I would come out, I think, right where you did on this, Mr Chairman And like Ed Boehne, I would look through the borrowing to the federal funds rate and [seek a rate] of around 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent, which I had interpreted as being a little on the easy side of ""B"" as it was written in the Bluebook, but which you now have convinced me is really what you had in mind In view of the way in which this directive is going to be dissected, I think it would be good to go with Variant I But there are a couple of references in there that would bother me and might confuse the market If you look at the references to greater flexibility on lines 105 and 106 of the draft that was distributed with the brown cover, that need for greater flexibility, I think, could be a little confusing to the market It isn't clear to me what it means and I don't think it would be clear to the market I would hasten to add that this reference to our intention to ensure adequate liquidity is perfectly clear to me and I think it's obviously appropriate So, on the wording of this, I would tend to end up the same way Governor Angell did in saying somewhat lesser restraint ""would"" and slightly greater restraint ""might""  It is something we don't have a lot of control over  Mr Chairman, I don't think it's all that different from what we have, in fact, done We have had this wide range but it has been understood that we have had a borrowing number that was associated with a much narrower federal funds range And we didn't change that [sentence] then I think we probably would have met and changed that borrowing level or changed it without meeting  You can say way back when they-- "
3459,1987-12-15,BLACK," Mr Chairman, I think there are two key questions here that we need to consider One is whether or not the funds rate gives us the right signals if we target borrowed reserves, which has been addressed by the staff The other is whether or not it's really easier--from a political standpoint, or to follow up on Jerry Corrigan's point, because of inertia--to [make a policy] move under the borrowed reserve procedure Generally, the federal funds rate probably does move in the right direction to give the correct signal when we are using a borrowed reserve target But there are times when    12/15-16/87  it doesn't For example, in 1984, around the time of the Continental Illinois Bank crisis, Chuck Partee had to reassure the markets through an article in The New York Times that we were targeting borrowed reserves and that the rise in the federal funds rate did stem from banks' unwillingness to borrow--that it really didn't have anything to do with a tightening of policy at that particular time Also, right before the market crash on the 19th, I think there was a perception in the market that we probably would tighten at a time when we really didn't want that to happen In general, a borrowing target probably works [to give the right signal] but it doesn't always work that way  There's a lot to Jerry's argument that there is inertia when operating under a federal funds target; the Committee, just because it doesn't know where the funds rate ought to go, is less apt to move There is also some substance, I think, to the political argument that it gives us a certain degree of protection if we can say we really don't control the federal funds rate, we control borrowed reserves At least at one time I think that did alleviate some of the concerns of Congress and gave us some protection I'm not sure that's the case much anymore, except maybe in the case of some Congressmen The market seems to look through this and be reasonably certain that we have in mind a certain level or range for the federal funds rate Moreover, if the borrowing really doesn't change and the federal funds rate does change, they tend to think that's really what we want So, I would be inclined to do something like alternative (3), which is to go back to borrowed reserve targeting but pay a little more attention to the federal funds rate when it is not behaving in the way we think it ought to, and deal with it on an ad hoc basis But my real hope is that we can do what Bob Heller suggested--if we can ever get the aggregates behaving more normally--and that is, make some institutional changes and move toward a nonborrowed reserve target, which would have certain desirable automatic features that would enable us to ease or tighten without having to take discretionary actions I would hope that at some point we can move in that direction because now what the market gets is largely demand- determined and I think there ought to be a larger element of supply- determined in there than we have now because of the misbehavior of the aggregates  Unless the uncertainty is completely behind us, I think if we were to try to go in that direction, we'd have to make a public announcement that we thought enough of the uncertainty was behind us that we were going back to a borrowed reserve target We should do that so the swings in the federal funds rate that would probably result would not be misinterpreted  Yes, pretty quickly; but the first two or three days they would read all sorts of changes in policy into that, I would think  Mr Chairman, as Governor Angell was talking about the federal funds rate being what the market thought we wanted it to be, I remembered a day back in the early 1960s, which was before Peter Sternlight was Manager, when the open market wire said, in effect, that the federal funds rate was hanging at around 2-7/8 percent, or whatever it was at the time, out of respect for what the market thinks the Federal Reserve System's intentions are That has always stuck in my mind and I think there is some of that right now  And I'm not going to get more  Well, a New York press officer does announce that there is a special situation borrowing in there without giving an exact amount  It was in the days of trying to sell membership and this was one of the--  Don, I think you made an excellent case for not targeting M1A or Ml for the coming year Do you entertain any hope, as I do--although it's becoming a lingering hope, I guess--that at some point depository institutions are going to alter their pricing procedures on NOW accounts and OCDs so that they will reduce the interest elasticity of M1 and make it a better target? Or is there hope that the demand for M1 will become more stable as this adjustment process to deregulation goes further?  I will confess to this group that, with considerable pain, I share that feeling  Mr Chairman, I share Tom's longing for something like that that we can anchor our decisions to; otherwise we have nothing but a series of ad hoc decisions that are disconnected to a  -27-    12/15-16/87  certain degree I feel very uncomfortable with that because I don't think we're really smart enough to do it If there is something we can hang our hats on, I sure would feel a lot better That's why I'm so disappointed that M1 has lost some of that value that it once had I would encourage experimentation along these lines There has to be something out there that we can hang our hats on  But, if this is as unreliable as you say, suppose nominal GNP is not growing fast enough and you push interest rates down and the money supply slows down You really haven't necessarily moved in the right direction, even though--  Sometimes  Mr Chairman, I would just like to take issue with Jerry Corrigan a little about the reserve requirement system being irrational It is rational if you think M1 is the thing that you ought to control because all the requirements are lagged except those against M1 deposits So, if M1 were really what you wanted to control, you would figure out how much you needed in reserves for those other types of deposits, supply that, and anything else you put out would be used to support M1 and only M1 If M1 is your target, the only thing that would be more rational, I think, would be to have 0 percent requirements against everything that wasn't in M1; but, if M1 is of no value anymore--although I think it once was--then it is irrational The reserve requirement system was set up that way because at that time the prevailing feeling was that M1 was really the best of the targets And I think it was  No, I'm talking about the fact that we lag some reserve requirements and don't lag the others  Okay I thought I finally understood something and now I find out I haven't understood that either!  I agree with that on the monetary base And when I said I had sympathy with Tom, it wasn't that I was favoring a monetary base I meant that I had sympathy for some kind of an anchor to hang policy on, and if he could demonstrate [unintelligible]--  Well, I don't think the use of the base as a target will necessarily imply a steady rate of growth in that You would figure out what non-monetary liabilities were using up in the way of reserves, supply that and then supply the amount you thought was necessary to support whatever kinds of monetary aggregates you wanted That doesn't say to me that it has to be a steady rate  You might not want to ask him; he may have gone to sleep!  -36-    12/15-16/87  Has this switching to diversified portfolios had much downward effect on the dollar?  I would say switching had to have had some effect, even though I'm not much of an interventionist  Would you go so far as to say that recession is almost inevitable to get a desirable result?  Is business saving rising as well as personal saving?  You almost have to have a rise in business saving as well as personal, I would think, under that scenario  That's what I was implying that you would have rising capital consumption allowances and profits  That's what really bothers me more than anything else, I guess  I really don't have much to say I think the staff did an exceptionally good job on the Greenbook, and Mike really covered all the caveats that we now are throwing out I'm sympathetic with what Governor Kelley said about worrying about the aggregates To use your metaphor, Mr Chairman, we don't know if the plumbing has been reconnected or not; but I do strongly suspect that it will be reconnected before we know it has And I'm wondering if these could be flashing danger signals But, on the other side of that, the employment [outlook] from the National Association of Purchasing Managers report was extremely strong We went back and telephoned the contacts that we usually talk to when we produce the Beige Book to see if we could find any evidence that there were changes in expectations or sales We looked at 25 retailers, for example, and 18 said that recently their sales definitely had been running well above what they were last year; only three said they were down  Well, Martha, I was going to get to this in a minute, and say you were spending more than Si Keehn, because the  in Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia, said that sales were exceptionally strong In Washington, they were running 16 percent ahead; in Baltimore 13 percent ahead; and in Philadelphia 18 percent ahead  Dollars  There's a lot of discounting, so I don't know if it's more or less If there's more, then that means that you have  -57-    12/15-16/87  more volume, really, than these figures would imply We also looked at our industrial--  It's since Thanksgiving, which is really the beginning of the Christmas season She was very optimistic, much more so than  But it was really amazing to us that we couldn't find more evidence; nobody had scaled down estimates of what would happen next year In looking at the industrial contacts it's pretty much the same sort of thing So I guess you can just summarize their responses by saying that going into the details just didn't show any real signs of weakening at this point So, for what that's worth-  It makes me feel better than I thought I would feel at this time following the crash on October 19  It's the sort of scenario that would worry Jerry Corrigan  How about Peter in consultation with the Chairman?  Mr Chairman, I would maintain our basic policy stance that's indicated by a federal funds rate centered on 6-3/4 percent I think we ought to continue the present operating procedures for the period immediately ahead but I'd like to take advantage of some of these year-end pressures to allow the funds rate to begin to move around a bit more than it has Then as we move into the new year, I'd like to go to alternative (3) whether or not there's an announcement effect, as indicated in Don's and Peter's memo I guess that would call at that time for about $400 million in borrowing I would keep the asymmetrical language unless we remove the sentence that says, ""still sensitive conditions in the financial markets""  No, I'm saying I would keep it asymmetric, as it now is, unless we remove the reference to still sensitive conditions "
3496,1988-02-09,BLACK," Mr Chairman, I've been in Frank Morris' camp in thinking that expenditures on plant and equipment, along with net exports of goods and services, would be the real driving force in the economy You pointed out that he may have overlooked the foreign part of that But that would suggest that one of the two, anyway, increases a good deal I guess the thing that puzzled me so much in the fourth-quarter figures that were released was the sharp decline in producers' durable equipment One of our contacts who specializes in watching the computer industry attributed this to the  And he feels    2/9-10/88  that this is a much weaker pattern of expenditures than we really had Does that sound sensible?  I guess I still find that hard to believe in view of what I thought was happening I know you mentioned in the Greenbook that a good part of this was computer equipment And that's the reason I raise this question about  That is different from the way most of the other computer companies report the figures I don't know whether there is any truth in what this fellow said or not, but he seemed to know what he was talking about And it confirmed my suspicions, though I was hoping you could lend some support to that hypothesis  This fellow said he talked to That probably  was the exact reason; I hadn't thought about that, which is now [unintelligible]--  SPEAKER(?) Yes, but I thought the decline was 38 percent If I read this one [correctly,] it's 72 percent in the fourth quarter Where did I get that 38?  Mr Chairman, it doesn't look as if we have that many differences for the year as a whole with the Board staff's forecast We are sort of in the same camp--which probably makes you very nervous, Mike But I think what's coming out in this discussion is that the shape or the profile is probably more important for policy than taking the year as a whole Several people have indicated that they think the weakness in the first half, as a result of the inventory correction, may be greater than the staff is projecting Most of my colleagues at Richmond share that feeling My feeling is that the staff has it about right But I think that, in either case, there's a distinct risk that we can have more strength in the latter part of the year than people in general have been thinking--in view of the turnaround in the aggregates, the shape of the decline in interest rates, and also the obvious strength in the industrial sector So I think this is something we ought to bear very closely in mind as we address the policy issue because we may have a short-term problem, from the policy standpoint, that is quite different from what we may have later in the year And that will influence what I will say later on with regard to the various alternatives  [Unintelligible] now 75 percent of the developers are committed  Don, what did you say for M1 for '88?  Well, as I indicated yesterday, Mr Chairman, I was very close to Frank Morris and very close to Jerry I suppose at this point I'm a little closer to Frank in that I'm not as sure as my colleagues in Richmond are that we will have the weakness in the first part of the year But I think there is a distinct risk that by the end of the year the economy will really be rolling and there may be stronger upward pressure on prices and wages than most people are now expecting That would put us in a very difficult situation, and a dangerous one I think, given the advanced stage of the expansion So, my feeling is that reducing the risks of that kind of scenario playing  -35-    2/9-10/88  itself out ought to be one of the principal goals, if not the principal goal, of long-run policy So I would opt for alternative III Ordinarily, I think the Bluebook tends to favor the middle alternative, but I thought this time, Don, you did an excellent job in defending alternative III with your 6 percent midpoint If the economy should be a little weaker in the first part of the year, then the 7-1/2 percent limit ought to be enough to accommodate that and also some downdrift in interest rates But I think more importantly, dropping the range a full percentage point rather than just 1/2 of a percentage point, as we tentatively decided in July, would send a strong, and I think a very reassuring, signal to the markets and the public that the System is looking beyond the immediate softness in business activity towards the potentially more serious threat of excessive and rapid inflation later on And if we voted for that, I think you could make that point very strongly in your testimony I know you'd get some flack on that from some members of Congress, but I think that would be muted by the recent strength in the aggregates and the significant drop in interest rates I think, in the end, we'd be a whole lot better off from the standpoint of political pressure, if M2 growth didn't come out in the lower half of the range but somewhere near the midpoint And I think we have a better chance to do that with alternative III than with alternative II  What's wrong with a longer-than-usual coffee break?  Well, there are other things to do out there  The reason--  Don, I didn't see any mention of your borrowing targets under any of these alternatives [in the Bluebook]  I'm sorry, I remember having seen that I was just looking for it in a different place and couldn't find it  That threw me off  And I've even got it underlined so I have no excuse for not having remembered exactly what you had I thought that's probably what it was, but I just wanted to make sure  You want to identify it? It wasn't on the agenda  Mr Chairman, I would favor ""B"", but I'd like to see the average level of the federal funds rate near the lower end of this projected 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent range I think there's a good chance that the relationship between the level of borrowing and the federal funds rate is going to continue to surprise us from time-to- time in the weeks ahead So, I'd like to maintain this flexibility in the operating procedures that we have, and retain the sentence that's on lines 103 to 107 of the directive in this form  As far as the long run is concerned, I would stick with alternative III The statement that I'm really trying to make is that I think there is uncertainty in the economy now We have to be accommodative and make sure that that doesn't become serious But my suspicion is that it's not going to be all that bad So we want to be careful in the long run not to waken fears that we have thrown in the towel on the inflation issue, yet at the same time show sensitivity to the weakness that has been evident recently  Consistent  Yes, I had the same problem "
3521,1988-03-29,BLACK," Mr Chairman, I'm glad that you raised this issue because I share a lot of these frustrations that Manley has voiced I have thought for some time that we were having a problem with choosing a borrowed reserve level and getting what we wanted in the way of federal funds behavior A lot of unexpected behavior is short-lived and doesn't really have much impact But frequently, the deviations  -11-    3/29/88  are rather long and rather large; and in effect, I think they end up changing the stance of monetary policy that the Committee wants and misleading the market, too As Manley stated very well, I think the federal funds rate is the most important thing in determining the demand for money and the behavior of the aggregates over time And I think that the Committee has been confused by this, because at times we've gotten federal funds rates that were not what we'd expected at all and that has led to some misunderstanding For example, at the last meeting we had some discussion about what had transpired in the previous meeting  Now, there are a couple of arguments that have been advanced in favor of borrowed-reserve targeting The first of these is that you can get movements in anticipation of where we should go that are generated on the part of the market We've looked at that fairly closely and sometimes this happens; but it just doesn't look to us as if the empirical evidence is really overwhelming on that You certainly can find a number of instances--Manley cited some, and there are others--where the market has moved the federal funds rate in a way that we didn't want it to move The Continental situation and right before the October 19th crash, I think, are two notable examples So, I don't think that argument holds a lot of water But I think the important argument, and really the reason why we went to this procedure, was basically a political one We were afraid that we could not move the federal funds rate as much as we really felt we ought to, unless we obfuscated in some way We're not really moving the federal funds rate, we're targeting reserves and the markets have driven the funds rate up That may have had some validity at the time, and I had some sympathy for it But as time goes on, I've become more and more concerned about a procedure that really involves trying to fool the public and the Congress and the markets, and at times fooling ourselves in the process  What I'd like to suggest, if we have time for it, is an alternative procedure that might conceivably be satisfactory for both sides The procedure would be to establish a band for the federal funds rate, let's say a weekly average of 50 basis points, that would be understood to be the range in which we would operate during the intermeeting period The beginning point would be the midpoint of that, but the Desk, in consultation with you, Mr Chairman, would have the freedom to move anywhere within that 50-point range This would give us some leeway for market forces to work And it could be understood that if the federal funds rate moved out of this range, then there would be consultation with the Committee I think that this would be very clear to all of us and that it would work much better, because now we sometimes get federal funds rates that we didn't vote for and didn't want So, I think a move in that direction would be very helpful and clearly would be more honest I would hate to have to defend what we have been doing on the grounds that, in a sense, we really don't want people to know what we are up to I'd rather stand up, as Manley says, like a man, and do what we have to do But I do understand the other argument, because in '79, I'm sure we would not have gotten some people to vote for the new procedure if they had not thought that it provided a cover for doing something they didn't think that they could get away with I've heard members of the Committee state that So it's not something to disregard lightly; but I think that our long-term credibility can be damaged if we use that as a cover-up for what we're really doing  -12-    3/29/88  I think that it was the very hot political environment that made us reluctant to do that You know, interest rates were getting pretty high about that time There was a lot of pressure on us and we knew that we had to do something And we had to make it palatable so we didn't get shot out of the water as soon as we began to move I think--I don't know if others would agree--that's why we did it at that time I thought that we would end up targeting the money supply; but I think most of the people in the room really thought it was a way that they could get the federal funds rate up more than they otherwise could get away with, in that kind of highly charged political environment That's the way that I read it I don't know; Jerry or some of the others who were here might see it somewhat differently  I think you can argue that, for some people, it's a little easier to move the borrowing target I argued as you did I don't think we ought to do that But I do think that some people would be more likely to move at the point in the cycle in which we usually make our worst mistakes [unintelligible] cycle  I mentioned it  Mr Chairman, I think maybe I ought to clarify some of my statements I would like to say, first of all, that I'm very sympathetic to what Governor Angell had to say that what we really ought to do is control the supply of reserves in such a manner that we control whatever monetary aggregate is going to determine the level of prices over the long run I don't think we can really, in the long run, control real variables; all we can control are nominal ones I think the objective ought to be stable prices And that's the way I would want to do it If we ever get to that millennium, I think that required reserves are probably going to be the best target for us against whatever aggregate we settle on And I wouldn't want any bands on the federal funds range at all; I would want that to be free to move enough to allow us to hit that target What I was talking about earlier was this interim period where the demand for money has been unstable and our present procedures call for us to try to gauge the dimensions of the demand for money and set the operating variable that will best give us the kind of results we want And I think that's the federal funds rate  So far as this issue of discretion is concerned, I did not mean to take away your flexibility I was trying to suggest a band that was reasonable--that would be agreeable to the whole Committee as an operating range within which you could adjust the rate I'd like to use the whole band--that 50-basis-point-average range that I talked about--and just have some understanding that if we went beyond that, you would consult with the Committee There was some discussion, as you remember, at the last meeting that maybe we shouldn't have changed the borrowed reserve target without consultation I didn't hold that view, but some did And I thought it was important that we reach some agreement on when there would be a consultation and that's the reason I suggested it But, basically, I don't want to do this over the long run with the federal funds rate at all I want to do it with reserves, somehow measured, if we can get back to a more rational financial [unintelligible] So, that's where I come out My recommendation applies only to the interim period that we're in, and if I thought that this would prevent our going back to [reserve targeting]--Lee, as you said--let me change my position  Let me change my position because I want to get, I think, where you want to get And if this would jeopardize that, then I've made a bad mistake  I know; traditionally, it has been very long  Is that your entire statement, Roger?  Say that again  I think these upward revisions that the staff has made are perfectly appropriate, Mr Chairman, in light of the data we have gotten since the last meeting I keep thinking about a remark someone made then about how nice it would be if we could hold onto these things--the low unemployment and the rate of growth for the sixth and now the seventh year of expansion--still without much pickup in prices I'd buy that scenario any time and I guess a lot of other people would too I suppose some people might think that this is a rather rosy scenario, but I really think the danger lies on the other side that we may get too much strength in the economy, more than we now anticipate, and this might stimulate a sharp increase in inflationary expectations with the predictable fallouts on the dollar and US interest rates And I believe that that is a risk we can do something about with monetary policy I think we ought to be concerned about it, and in that connection, I would be getting a little concerned about the strength in the aggregates I would really be concerned if that continues for another month or so in the face of apparent strength in the economy I am not yet suggesting that the aggregates have gotten to the point where we ought to place as much emphasis on them as we did a few years ago, but I think they now may be giving us better information about the economy than they were a while back I think it would be wise to pay a little more attention to them than to try to appraise the strength of the business outlook as we have been doing the last several months "
3547,1988-05-17,BLACK," Mr Chairman, I think the staff has made an excellent case in its forecast for an early move It's true we have made a couple of moves recently, and I think they have been timely and very appropriate But I remember so many times sitting around this table when this was the apparent stage of a business cycle where traditionally we have made our largest mistakes So I think we ought to move now I think you've given us wise counsel in suggesting we hold that $100 million increase in the borrowed reserve figure; and I would buy that, with an asymmetric directive I'd like to get rid of that language about the unusual flexibility I think that's unduly fuzzy and just confuses people And I'd like to keep open that option that we would go the other $100 million if, after two or three weeks, it looks as if we need to In short, ""B""  Initially; maintain initially  Mr Chairman, could I ask for some estimate of the length of time before we move?  At the most?  That's right  -14-    5/17/88  You haven't ruled out the $200 million, have you?  No, but I mean over time, after you've moved the $100 million, if these contingencies--  That's the point I was making  Mr Chairman? I have one question Did we mean to have maintain initially? We talked about that and I thought we sort of--  -17-    5/17/88  It was; but it wasn't when Norm read it  He did?  Well, I missed that one, too I'm sorry, Norm  Oh! You had it in a different place; that's why I couldn't find it I'm sorry--I was looking for it down near the ""maintain""  Mr Chairman, I have a lot of sympathy with what Tom is trying to do because I think his ultimate objective is to achieve price stability I don't know how this Committee would vote on that, but I remember several years ago Chairman Volcker asked us what we thought the objective was and half of us voted for price stability alone; half voted the other way; and he didn't vote and didn't break the tie But I think that is the ultimate objective, and I hear more and more people around here saying that And I think Tom is trying to create a constraint that will make us really work toward that objective and not lose sight of it But my problem with it is that even though he thinks this is a constraint, I believe, in practice, that it really might end up being used like a target And our analysis, like Bob Parry's, suggests that M2 is really better for this in the sense of predicting the level of long-run inflation And that, I think, is the thing we really ought to look at, rather than how well it predicts nominal GNP, since I don't think we can peg real variables over the long run All we can do is affect the price level So, what I would like to do is to carry the thing a step further than Tom has, and suggest we think about using total reserves and nonborrowed reserves, or something of that sort, as an operating instrument What we have now is very akin to using free reserves, which has been fraught with problems the whole time I know that there are some institutional changes that will improve this--you could get rid of the reserve requirements against interbank deposits, [unintelligible] deposits, nonpersonal deposits, all those things You could have a penalty discount rate All those things could be done, assuming you can get the legislation for some of them In any event, if we could work in that direction, then I think we'd have something that would really be very useful to us Of course, one of the things we would want to analyze is what this might do to short- term market rates, and I don't think we have a good handle on that Most people think they would fluctuate a lot more; my instincts tell me that the private market would take care of that And, even if they fluctuated more, I don't believe that would be transmitted to long- term rates to the extent that most people seem to be assuming In any case, if we could use this as an operating variable instead of borrowed reserves, or the federal funds rate, or whatever people think it is we're using, I think it would be a very efficient way to try to achieve the very thing that Tom is advocating Now, if it came down to a vote as to whether to do what he suggested or not do it, I would say do what he has suggested I'd like to take it further than that, but I think it's better than what we now have, because it is a constraint And we really don't have many constraints now, given our willingness to violate our target ranges on an ad hoc, judgmental,  -24-    5/17/88  basis And I'd like a little more of a rule in there, a little more of a road map than we have, to the extent we can do it  Even if you could find a perfect rule, I doubt the Committee would vote for it, because it's so much more fun making ad hoc decisions every time  I mean I'm assuming away that problem; I still think we would vote for discretion  But, at a minimum, you have to tell the [Congressional] Committee next time in the Humphrey-Hawkins [testimony] that we have either rejected it, or we are looking at it and have not yet decided whether to accept it  I think you're right, Mr Chairman; that's the way I viewed it I tried to take it a little farther in the direction that I thought it ought to go, which nobody else will agree with except maybe Tom Melzer and Lee Hoskins I think that can be very productive  I would like to see us use multiple-year targets, if we can ever get to the point that we could agree on that I think it's an exciting step  I don't--not in the long run I think it's the best predictor of inflation of any of the aggregates we have now  It hasn't been too far from that  You want to implicate us!  If you can predict the prices, do you need to predict the interest rates?  I don't always understand these things, but weakly I'd suggest that it is a pretty darn good predictor of the price level "
3569,1988-06-29,BLACK," Your borrowed reserve figure is below target, too   So moved  Well, one thing to bear in mind is that he have been  taking a big share of the business down there Yesterday, I talked to him and he closed the conversation by saying ""I'm getting extremely worried about inflation""  He doesn't expect his own or his associates' [wages to go up], but he's worried about the inflationary pressures emanating elsewhere with no increases in salaries or wages for his own people That's one of the problems   Turning to the District, Mr Chairman, I think it's safe to say, in summary, that our grassroots contacts don't  -27-    6/29-30/88  really see any slowing in the expansion, in contrast to what the national figures seem to be showing There are widespread reports of extremely high levels of capacity operation in textiles, furniture, chemicals, paper--that sort of thing; difficulty in hiring workers; upward pressure on wages--and our most concrete example is in the case of the fast food industries where they have had to push their wages up well above the minimum in a number of places; and also reports of shortages of chemicals in certain areas For example,  and his suppliers of certain [raw materials] that he uses put him on quotas so he can't produce enough to satisfy his demand  In the case of housing, all of you in Washington are familiar with what has happened around here They can't keep up with demand And pretty much the same sort of thing has happened in the Richmond, Charlotte, Greensboro, Raleigh, Chapel Hill, and Durham areas, where the economy is really booming Home prices in Washington in the last couple of years have gone up about 1/3 and pretty much the same sort of thing is true in Richmond That's what they seem to feel, but I think Frank is right in saying the statistics do show some slowing there  Insofar as our particular projections are concerned, there's not a lot of difference in what we've projected and what the Board staff has done, except that we do expect more inflation next year than they have put in [their forecast] Interestingly enough, Tom Melzer and I ended up with exactly the same amount of additional inflation for next year The most important thing, I think, in the staff's analysis is their assumption that we need to have some tightening actions in order to bring about the results that they're projecting An analysis we have conducted at our own Bank reaches the same sort of conclusion My guess is that if there's going to be an error, I would come out about where Jerry Corrigan and some of the rest of you did that the Board staff's forecast--and ours as well--might be actually forecasting less inflation than we're apt really to have  At the rate we're going, the Greenbook shows a very smooth transition from this expansion driven by domestic demand toward one driven by foreign demand Except for a brief upswing in the third quarter, the rate of growth in gross private domestic purchases is expected to slow down significantly as the result of a weakening in consumer demand and business fixed investment And, of course, that's a perfectly plausible scenario, and it would be a very excellent one if it works out But, as I'm sure everyone would have to agree, it's far from a safe bet I guess we would conclude that business fixed investment in particular, given the high levels of capacity utilization, is apt to be somewhat stronger than we're thinking So, in short, while we think the Greenbook forecast is very reasonable and very defensible, that's probably the best that we could hope for; and our fears are that we're not going to do that well on the inflation side  Also a part of ours!  I think there's no explanation  That's where the challenge is  Don, you used an interesting term that I don't remember right now, but I think you really said you assumed expectations weren't rational in this low growth--  What was that term you used? I want to remember that  It was an interesting one; I should have jotted it down  I agree with your prescription, Mr Chairman, which is where most people have come out There's one observation I'd like to make, though I think there's one big weakness with this practice of setting one-year ranges for the aggregates, and that is that it doesn't really commit us to doing anything beyond that year in this Governor Angell suggested a while ago that it is important that we target some nominal variable He mentioned nominal GNP I think it's a point, although certainly one can't be sure that it's a better variable to target than would be M2 [I'd suggest that you] announce, when you give your testimony, that our intention is to move further in the years beyond If you look at the chart showing velocity of M2 in the Bluebook, that looks pretty darn constant over a period of 30 years It's true that it jumped around more in the '80s, but it looks remarkably stable for an economic variable And I would like to see you say that our intention is, given past evidence, and with a zero rate of change in velocity, to bring that down in the early '90s to about 3 percent--which I would interpret to be the long-run potential of the economy--or whatever you can get the Committee to agree to and feel comfortable about in saying something beyond '89 I think that would be very helpful to the markets And I would certainly favor something of that sort  Mr Chairman, I have two problems with that One is that you would be going into next year without having set any long- run targets  My other problem is more serious And that is, that I would like to see us state tentative targets over the long run that tell the market what we have often said in the past--that we want to get these aggregates down to the point that we've got noninflationary growth To me, [the approach recommended by Jerry Corrigan] would show less resolve than I think [is desirable]  Mr Chairman, I guess the real question is whether we've done enough up until now If you look at the real activity signs, I guess that would say probably we have; but if you look at the recent behavior of the aggregates--unless that's an aberration of some sort--that says we haven't My guess is that we  -50-    6/29-30/88  haven't done quite enough yet, so I was thinking in terms of that level of borrowed reserves that would be associated with an expected federal funds rate of 7-3/4 percent But I could live with what you're suggesting, with an asymmetric directive and the understanding that we get together in a couple of weeks and take a look at it  Mr Chairman, this gets us into an awkward position with regard to our boards of directors When we first sent in our recommended increase in the discount rate, we had in mind a half point increase in the federal funds rate, which we virtually have achieved That would suggest that we really ought to withdraw our recommendation, which is hard to explain to them because we can't really tell them what the System has done at the Open Market level  It gets into a ticklish position We did withdraw our first one for that very reason We had gotten up to where we wanted to go, so we withdrew it and then decided it needed to go more  Sure, that would be very helpful I've been debating what I would say to them because I can't really tell them what I know  As I say, the market assumes that the System has tightened  And therein lies another problem for the directors because, under our new procedures, if we haven't gotten a recommendation in, they are not going to be in that first wave And that's going to be very disappointing to them  I think it will be very helpful to give them a chance to join  Well, that's what we really told them  I don't think they are all unduly disappointed, but it's awfully hard to tell them the full rationale for your recommendation when you really can't tell them what the Open Market Committee has decided  That would solve that particular problem, Martha  If you abstract from this, special pressures are factors that would push the federal funds rate up We have, by going $50 million higher, done a slight tightening How's that? And I think it ought to reflect that  $520 million  Some of us have been suspected of slighter than-- "
3594,1988-07-19,BLACK," Mr Chairman, Bob Black I agree with Bob Parry and Ed Boehne on that "
3612,1988-08-16,BLACK," Very large  Was there any revision to the number for the previous month?  SPEAKER(?) Yes    8/16/88  Mr Chairman, I was just going to ask Ted Have you redone your projections of net exports since you got the Census merchandise trade figures?  This figure for net exports for, say, the fourth quarter of 1989 would not be very far off from $472 billion then?  Mr Chairman, I share Frank Morris's appreciation of the staff's efforts to give us some drought-adjusted figures for the GNP for the projection period Obviously, that drought has been a severe blow to a lot of parts of the country, but there's really nothing that monetary policy can do in the short run to deal with that So, I think we need to focus on these drought-adjusted figures in trying to plan the course of monetary policy These figures show GNP, after a bulge in this quarter, working down on a drought-adjusted basis to around 2 percent in the early part of next year That seems to me--in light of the tightness in labor markets and the higher levels of capacity in a lot of key industries--to be about as fast as we would want GNP to grow at this stage  I'm not quite as optimistic as Ed Boehne was--and I gather, probably Martha--that on the basis of these variable rates on consumer loans, consumption will slow down as much as the staff has guessed They've got 13 percent throughout each quarter of 1989 If I had to guess, I would think it's probably going to run higher than that-- although that would certainly be a desirable rate, in view of the necessity of getting that down to the point that we can accommodate an improvement in our balance of payments  What really bothers me most, I think, is what bothers most of the others; that despite all this tightening that we have done up until now, and the staff's projection of considerably more tightening beyond this, we've still got pretty big increases in inflation projected For example, the CPI less food and energy is rising at over a 5 percent rate at the end of next year, and much the same sort of thing is true for the fixed-weight GNP deflator, which is close to  -18-    8/16/88  4-1/2 percent These may be too high, I don't know, but they certainly seem reasonable to me, given the upward pressure on wages and employment costs that are now becoming increasingly apparent And what this means to me is that we still have a serious inflation threat facing us And if we have projected inflation at less than it actually turns out to be, then that's going to cross, I think, a pretty important threshhold in terms of what it would do to inflationary expectations And I think that could be very serious indeed So I hope we can hold it down some--at least as low as the staff is projecting And I would like to think we can do better than that  I can explain that, Martha  One of us is really--  Mr Chairman, I think I share Lee's objective of getting back to the point, if we ever can do this, where we can really control this supply of reserves--somehow measured--so as to control  -31-    8/16/88  the rate of growth of the money supply To put it I guess a bit unkindly, it seems to me that what we do now really is sort of a modern-day version of the real bills doctrine, in a sense The market gets all the money it wants at some price or some borrowed reserve level If it wants more, we pump out the reserves and we say the demand for money has increased If it wants less, we sop up reserves and say the demand for money has declined If we want to nudge it one way or another, through either the borrowed reserve target or through manipulating the federal funds rate, we change the price of money--in much the way the discount rate used to function under the old real bills doctrine So I really don't see that it's much different from that  But, given the uncertainties that people feel exist in the aggregates at the present time, I think I would come out a little different from where Lee does on which of the various alternatives we should use I would use the federal funds rate I think we are confusing the public, we are confusing ourselves, and we are confusing the boards of directors by going through the borrowed reserve target And in recent days, we've been resolving all doubts in favor of the federal funds rate, and I would prefer to just use that federal funds rate as long as we are on this kind of regime But I think at some point the aggregates are going to behave in a more normal, predictable, way and we can reduce this degree of fine tuning that we've been following And only then will I feel very comfortable with any policy decision Now we have to pick out a level of interest rates somehow defined, and predict what will happen The way I do that is to figure out what I think it is on an ad hoc basis and then I bear in mind that most of our mistakes I think have been on the side of being too easy, historically So I put in a fudge factor and vote for something a little tighter than I think it probably ought to be on the ground that that's the way we usually miss But I do hope our simulations suggest M2 is beginning to behave reasonably normally now; Don verified that to some degree And I hope somewhere along the way we can get to the point that we are really controlling the supply of money rather than letting it be purely demand determined  It has been very good really Wayne said a while ago he was taking considerable comfort in M2; and I was taking a lot of comfort in that, too, until Don pointed out that it was the RPs and the Eurodollars that were weak The consumer-type components of M2 were relatively strong, so that reduced my degree of comfort Still, that's something that makes me feel better than I otherwise would because they've been--  He can do that to people  That's basically a political argument  It's a political argument, though, and I think that's the strongest argument that Ed has made for the borrowing target And I think that's why we stuck with it  I think [unintelligible] moves it, so be it  This is not the only issue that has ever been discussed three times  Mr Chairman, a while ago I commended Mike Prell and his associates for producing drought-adjusted figures on GNP I would like, with equal vigor, to commend Don Kohn for producing an asymmetric Bluebook I agree completely with what you said on policy, and a willingness to act further if the need should arise I also agree with your statement that it might well happen that we will need ""C"" next month [If that's the case,] I would hope we would have an intermeeting telephone conference like we've had And finally, I would agree completely with Governor Angell's suggestion that we move the aggregates up to number one, which probably doesn't come as a great surprise to some in this room "
3636,1988-09-20,BLACK," Mike, could you give us some of the details of the revision in GNP, including the deflator and the fixed-weight deflator  Do you know which components of GNP were revised down?  What did you do to it? Did you take care of that place?  Another problem for him; he can [profit?] from that  Mr Chairman, I think every point I wanted to make has been made by someone--but some by one person and some by another Let me just summarize briefly We agree very closely with what the staff has suggested in the Greenbook We see the same signs of moderation, partly because of the employment figures and other national figures, and also because of the grass-roots reports that we've getting from our directors, particularly in textiles and furniture  But I'm glad to see this, because I thought the economy was growing way, way too fast and the risks were all on the upside This suggests that maybe they're less on the upside now than they were before But like most of those who have spoken, I still think that the risks definitely are skewed more towards the upside and that there's a danger that the economy might overheat These figures showing moderation have been around for only a month or two at most, and apart from housing, there are no real large parts of the GNP accounts or significant sectors that show any signs of a great or sustained weakness  And then, if you look at the figures in section II of the Greenbook, they show that there is some upward pressure on both wages and prices Mike has just reported that the figures on the implicit price deflator and the fixed-weight deflator for the second quarter were worse than we thought they were, based on the initial reports So in short, while I feel a little bit better than I did before, because there are some signs of slowing, I don't think we're out of the woods yet And I would think that the staff's prognostication that somewhere down the line we'll need to tighten further is probably still right, although now might not be the time to do that  Mr Chairman, I agree with your position too The only thing I would add to it is that these rates of inflation projected by the Board's staff, as indexed by the fixed-weight deflator, are way too high So, I wouldn't be completely satisfied with that outlook, although that may be the most it's reasonable to expect I would go right down the line with you on it  Except that the fixed-weight did hit 5 percent last quarter  We had doughnuts, I know that "
3661,1988-10-17,BLACK, This is Bob Black What is the timing on the release?  Could you send us a facsimile copy?  Thanks 
3678,1988-11-01,BLACK," I think you take it the wrong way It's the other three of us!  Well, Mr Chairman, I guess like you are not surprised by what Jerry Corrigan said, you probably won't be surprised by what I say either I like this paper very much because I think it    11/1/88  has very important implications about how we ought to conduct our long-run policy The main thing the evidence says to me is the same thing I think it said to all of you--namely, that we can control prices over the long run by controlling M2 It also suggests that there has not been in the last 30 years or so enough of a permanent shift in demand for money that that would have been troublesome Now, of course, it does point out that we might have shifts in money over time for which we'd have to allow, but I don't think that really negates the basic conclusion that we can control the price level over the long run while targeting the M2 The idea of controlling inflation in this manner obviously is not a new one, but the evidence given in this paper I think makes it pretty dramatic and gives it added support  I think all of this really raises some fundamental questions about our current long-run strategy Obtaining long-run price stability is clearly one of the preeminent goals of monetary policy; I would say it is the goal of monetary policy We frequently state this in our public statements, and yet there's nothing really in our current set of procedures that ensures that we are really going to target M2 or any other aggregate over the long run It's true that we announce that we have targets for these aggregates, but we don't hit those targets a lot of time And we allow base drift to come in, and so there's no assurance in our present procedures that M2 is going to grow at a rate that will be compatible over the long run with price stability--over 2, 3, 4, 5 years, or whatever you want to target on I've been dissatisfied with this procedure for a long time, and I think there are some other members who have been somewhat uncomfortable with it, too The staff paper provides impressive evidence that we really can control price stability in the long run by controlling M2, if we just change our procedures to ensure that we keep our long-run M2 [unintelligible] And I'd like to make one further observation about section 6 of the staff paper which explores the long-run dynamic characteristics of the price gap equation The analysis in this section suggests that if we fix the M2 growth at a constant rate, the price level [fluctuation] would remain pretty wide around the equilibrium level for many years before stabilizing the--  Yes, that's right! And this is very discouraging more so to me than to you, Manley, because I'm an old man I'm going to be on a fixed income in four years We have to wait until our grandchildren to see this price stability  Yes, our great grandchildren I haven't even gotten my first grandchild yet, but do have one coming in January in case any of you are interested! I think it needs to be emphasized that this particular analysis deals only with the special case where there is a stable rate of growth in the money supply I think it's reasonable to suppose that we could have some kind of reactive mechanism that would bring this under better control and damp these oscillations We had one of a sort when we were targeting nonborrowed reserves If there was an overshoot in the aggregates [under that sort of targeting] we made the banks borrow half of that overshoot And that was an automatic mechanism There are others that obviously    11/1/88  could be used I would also draw the opposite conclusion from the Lucas critique on this and say that intuitively I think if you had a stable rate of growth in money supply over this 30 years, that you would not have changed the structure of the models So, if you targeted a stable rate of growth after that you would have had less in the way of oscillations this produced because these are two very different regimes and that is the issue to which I think the Lucas critique was addressed I've said too much, Mr Chairman, but I surely like what the staff is doing I would not go quite so far as one of my colleagues and say the first eight pages represent the best work the staff has ever done because I think it has done a lot of other awfully good work, too  There's a problem with that!  But not necessarily  Mr Chairman, I have a lot of sympathy with the view that Lee Hoskins expressed I have had some reservations about  -17-    11/1/88  these swaps ever since we entered into them It's not that I'm all that opposed to smoothing operations but I felt that they might delay our dealing with some fundamental problems by covering them up for a while I think it is important to note that foreign affairs are basically an Administration function and the Treasury has primacy in this area And even if we philosophically don't agree with the kind of intervention we've done--and I think we pretty well [have expressed that] disagreement--we would have to yield to the Treasury on this, just as monetary policy is a function that Congress has delegated the Federal Reserve and the Treasury shouldn't be telling us what to do in those areas  The last two firms would meet all these tests?  There have been very few changes in the Greenbook projections this time from last time, and we agree pretty broadly with that and think they are pretty closely on target It seems clear that there has been a slowing in real activity--or there was in the third quarter--and I think it's reasonable to suppose that, on a drought- adjusted basis, the economy will grow more slowly next year than it has this year At the same time, I think the risks are on the upside but I think they've got a pretty good forecast I wouldn't be quite as sure about the risks on the upside as Frank Morris, but I'd be more or less about where Ed Boehne came out on both the level of output and prices  Well, it's been the day to do things  Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation, too I'm very sympathetic to what Tom Melzer has said, though We can probably explain the weakness in the aggregates, and the early increases in short-term rates up to this point, but next meeting I will be in favor of a symmetric directive if the weakness in money continues for another month For now, I would agree completely with what you recommended "
3715,1988-12-13,BLACK," Peter, is it fair to say that most differences have been resolved in favor of the federal funds rate?  Yes, I was on the [morning conference] call this time, and I think that's an excellent description of what you did I was really referring to the longer run It seems to me that in the past most of them have been resolved in favor of the federal funds rate Not all certainly, but I think that's what it has usually yielded  Mr Chairman, as I've indicated a lot of times, what I hope we are going to move to eventually is some kind of reserve targets and make the necessary institutional changes so they'll work I think it's important in the interim that we recognize that this borrowed reserve target is not a reserve target in the usual sense The real instrument under current procedures, as I perceive it, is the federal funds rate because this is what determines the demand for money and consequently the rate of growth in the aggregates And the borrowing is simply the device that we use to try to control the federal funds rate I think it has confused us, and it has confused the markets on occasion I remember that Manley and I were arguing this back at the March meeting I think it was I would favor adopting, if we could get a consensus, a wider range for the federal funds rate and dropping the borrowing target I would then give the Desk, in consultation with you [Chairman Greenspan], enough freedom to move anywhere within this half percentage point limit [for the federal funds rate] that seems consistent with the directive I still favor that I think this [recent intermeeting] period illustrated that I think Peter Sternlight handled it beautifully the way he jumped back    12/13-14/88  from one and then the other I do think most of the time we have resolved it in favor of the federal funds rate where there were differences And I think that's the more important of the two  Wayne, wouldn't a lot of that announcement effect be lost since this wouldn't be released until Friday following the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting?  I certainly wouldn't favor targeting a particular federal funds rate I might want a band for the reason that Wayne has indicated But I would just note that the band associated with the borrowing target did not necessitate a borrowing target as long as we had the band  You know, when we were under the borrowed-- nonborrowed reserve targeting procedure, we made banks borrow half of any shortfall There was an automatic corrective mechanism there, and we made ad hoc adjustments every now and then as needed, and I'd like to preserve that right That's the kind of direction I would like  I'm not sure  -10-    12/13-14/88  Yes, if the money supply spurted, we made banks in effect borrow half of the additional reserves that they needed And that was an automatic brake on that  Well, that would appeal to me a whole lot more than what we have now, but there's not going to be a consensus on that at this point I hope some day there will [unintelligible]  One thing we probably can agree on is that we've been doing a pretty darn good job with what we've had; it's just a question of whether we can continue to do it with this procedure  What I was advocating here is not what we had before but a much wider band I would be totally opposed to going back to what we had before That and the market--  Mr Chairman, I'm afraid I have misstated my position pretty badly I think the excellent memo we had last time demonstrates pretty clearly that there is a good relationship in the long run between M2 and the price level And I think the price level ought to be our ultimate target I think that's all we really ought to be targeting on If we do that, then I think these other things will fall into place about as well as they can That suggests to me that somehow or other we have to control the supply of money In the short run, which is what we are talking about here now, our procedures regardless of whether we use a borrowed reserve target or a federal funds rate [range that is] narrower or wider--and I had in mind a wider one--necessitate our being able to estimate the short-run demand for money I think that's very difficult to do All I was attempting to say is that I think if you leave out the borrowed reserves stuff and work with the federal funds rate, we'll probably do better in the short run in doing that But I will not be satisfied until we get to the point that we really pay a lot more attention over the long run to what's happening to M2, or if some other variable is a better predictor of the rate of inflation then that's the way I want to move I certainly don't have in mind any rigid pegging of the federal funds rate That to me would be nothing but a modern day version of the real bills doctrine where the market would get everything it wanted in the way of money at the particular rate we chose and all we could do to change that would be to raise the rate or lower it--which means we'll end up with a real bills doctrine, and I'm violently opposed to that I think that doctrine has long since been discredited And so the question really is what kind of mechanism in the short run can get us to what I think should be our long-run target or some control over prices over the long run through controlling the rate of growth in some aggregate or some reserve measure I don't know what the answer is in the short run We had a memo on that and it doesn't suggest the answer is very easy But there is the sense in which I offered this recommendation of mine And I'm afraid I didn't make that very clear  It's not quite complete yet  Ted, were the September figures on CIF basis revised?  What is it for September? I didn't get that somehow  $106 billion, is what it is now?  Thank you  That may not be shared in other states  We noticed  Mr Chairman I've been following these Greenbooks for a long time, and I think really in the last year or so they have been considerably better than they were before then although they have always been good And I found this one particularly helpful although it does make me darn nervous on the inflation side because it suggests that there's very little room for error It projects a further tightening of policy over this period and an appreciable rise in interest rates, and this doesn't cause the underlying rate of inflation to diminish very much, and then only well into 1990 when the decline is modest at best So, it seems to me that the risk of error really is that we are probably going to have more inflation than the staff has in the Greenbook if in fact there is any risk of error in this Wage pressures, as several people have indicated, are increasing--not rapidly in some cases--but certainly unmistakably; and if consumer prices increase at the rate of 4-1/2 to 5 percent that they are projecting for next year, it seems to me it's almost inevitable that we will begin to see some wage pressures then So, I would not be surprised, in the absence of some action on our part, to see, rather than declining inflation in 1990, some wage-price spiral feeding on each other  and he expected wage pressures there and elsewhere to be considerably stronger than most people seem to anticipate  Now, on the real side of the economy, my guess is that in the first part of next year anyway despite signs that the rapid upward pace of some of the foreign economies may be slowing to some extent, we are still going to have perhaps a little more restraint in our export demand than the staff has suggested And with the growth in employment and income that we are having in the domestic economy this suggests to me that probably domestic spending is also going to be stronger than the staff is projecting So, I think we've got an incipient boom on our hands, but basically I'm in pretty close agreement with the staff in what needs to be done to control that  He has succeeded where many of us who have tried before have failed!  I think they have  He just retracted his comment!  Mr Chairman, I would favor ""C"" I have never differed with you since you've been here, and I do so with great trepidation today because I have such respect for your judgment But I think the market has expected a discount rate increase, and I think if we don't get one it might be interpreted as some lessening of our resolve to deal with this problem we see developing And I think there's also a lot of substance to the point that Governor Angell made that if we are concerned about the lack of a firm relationship between the level of borrowed reserves and the federal funds rate, I think that would be exacerbated by letting that [rate spread widen] still further But at the same time I want to be reasonable on this, and I can see the merits to what you've said I can certainly see the merits to what Tom Melzer has said because the aggregates do concern me a great deal I would not be willing to go this far if I didn't see a sign that they were beginning to move I would like to bargain with you a little bit on that $100 million and make it a little higher than that But I don't think it's an important enough difference that I'd want to go to the mat on it or anything of that sort I'd really like the discount rate to be a part of it  Mr Chairman, could I ask for some clarification? The $100 million, would you anticipate this would move the federal funds rate to 8-7/8 initially from 8-5/8 percent?  Yes  6 to 10? I thought it would be 7 to 11  SPEAKER(?) Well, it should be 7 to 11  If we leave it at 6 to 10, we've got the midpoint below where we are now I'm not sure where we are Are we at 8-1/2 or 8-5/8? I think we are at 8-5/8  It shows the gamble we are taking! "
3742,1989-02-07,BLACK," You know, it certainly would help to have this [analysis] sent out a little ahead of time so that we could reflect on it a bit That's a lot to digest in that short a period of time  Mr Chairman, our projections for 1990 pretty closely parallel those of the Greenbook We do expect slightly more growth, but not quite enough to put us in the outlier column as has sometimes happened in the past And we expect a tad more in the way of an increase in the consumer price index As Mike Prell suggested very well a while ago, more important than the specifics of the forecast are some of the things that underlie it And as we read the economy the pressure on US productive resources looks very, very strong to us This is evident, I think, in most recent statistical data real personal consumption expenditures ex-automobiles, for example, were very strong; the nonagricultural employment figures for January were very strong; and the theme report that we got on business capital expenditures, which I found extremely helpful this time, seemed to indicate strength We're getting the same sort of  -10-    2/7-8/89  grassroots information from our contacts around the District To us, one particularly interesting thing this time was a comment of  who has been in the department store business  says that business is really booming so it came as  something of a surprise to us Now, if we have this strong demand, as is apparent to us, that naturally is going to put some upward pressure on real interest rates And any attempt on our part to resist that pressure through monetary policy is going to risk getting inflationary pressures So we've assumed, like the staff, that our monetary policy will not resist these things; rather we predicated our forecast on the assumption that there will be a significant further increase in short- term interest rates, and specifically some increase in the relatively near future Now, if we do allow that increase to occur then we think the risks are about equal on both sides If we don't let that increase occur then we think the risks are on the up side of more inflation than the staff has projected  Mr Chairman, Don did such an excellent job of outlining various alternatives and he answered most any question I might have But I do have one little simple question that I'd like to ask Do you personally, Don, have more respect for the price projections made by your big model or by your single-equation model that stems from that very excellent memo we got back in November of  -26-    2/7-8/89  last year? I guess that tells you which one I have the most respect for  When you're winning something--  I wouldn't want to--  Yes, I realize that I didn't mean to oversimplify I would have equal confidence for 1989 since they project the same inflation figures that I did; there was very little difference  They are pretty close  -27-    2/7-8/89  I was just going to indicate my support for what Governor Angell was saying But I'm wondering if the Humphrey-Hawkins wording precludes our focusing on one aggregate since it says ""provide  -30-    2/7-8/89  for the rate of increase or diminution in aggregates"" or something like that  Aggregates  I guess, then, that you wouldn't have to have M3 I thought maybe you would since it says money and credit If you had one of each I think you could meet the definition as such I support it even--  Yes, I know But I was just thinking about the correct thing to do [according to the Act], not what Congress wanted [in July]  Yes, well--  SPEAKER(?) It could be M2 [unintelligible] and credit  I would favor that  Right You should have said the public and financial markets  You learned your lesson  Mr Chairman, I think you put your finger on it when you said the question was really whether we would have to raise the range the next time we look at it So, I don't feel very strongly about either one of these alternatives But I do have some preference  -35-    2/7-8/89  for alternative ""II"" because I see the basic function of setting these targets as being that of reassuring the public about our anti- inflationary resolve If we assume we have to have a 4 percentage point spread or something like that in the ranges because of the sensitivity of M2 to declining interest rates or rising interest rates, that suggests to me that what we're really after eventually is a range of about 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent or something like that And I think we're in a position now that we could take that additional step The upper part of the alternative ""II"" range would be 6-1/2 percent; and if we could take these figures at face value on M2 that should give us sufficient flexibility, even with a declining rate of growth and a drop in short-term rates in 1990, to still hit this 5 percent rate with some room to spare--and to hit the 6 percent in 1991 with some room to spare Like Gary Stern, I don't think we would really have to end up raising that but it's not a do or die issue with me I could go with either one, but I do have that preference because I think we can take a good step now without much risk  Right  Well, I think it's amply true what Jerry was saying about those [depositors] who initially come out But they spend that money buying something else; it moves into the hands of some other people So you've got to go beyond that and ask What are they going to do with that? And it might well come back into deposits in some form  [If it is] first in the operational paragraph, Bob, that may be sufficient I agree with your sentiments, but in the operational paragraph--  He's just saying in the case of inconsistencies between the borrowing level and the funds rate resolve doubts on the side of borrowing  Our special theme reports suggested that would be pretty strong, really, if I read that [right] Is that the way you read it? I was very much encouraged by what that seemed to say  And that's good GNP  Mr Chairman, I'm very close to Jerry Corrigan and very close to Lee Hoskins A while ago I appeared to be complimenting Don Kohn unduly at the expense of Mike Prell But I'd like to say that I think that Mike's forecast for the economy--the need for increasing short-term rates--is probably absolutely accurate And I favor sooner rather than later But there's always this risk that we could do too much now As far as this yield curve is concerned, one reason it's the way it is [relates to] an expectation on the part of knowledgeable observers that we probably will do some further tightening fairly soon So, I clearly come out in favor of ""C"" But there is this matter of institutional harmony that Jerry mentioned a while ago And given your commitment, Mr Chairman, to move to this in a couple of weeks or so I can go along with that I'd rather do it now but I can vote for that  Well, I meant to consider a move depending on what the data say And if they point in the other direction I wouldn't want to move; I think it is very ""iffy"" right now I'm less convinced than most of my colleagues in Richmond that this has gotten quite as far away from us as some people think  If we say ""maintain"" would that preclude our letting the federal funds rate move up?  And ""maintain"" would permit us to raise the borrowing target $100 million?  I wanted to make sure that we didn't preclude a decision to raise the borrowed reserve target if the data indicated, simply because we said ""maintain"" in here And the answer is no  I just wanted to be sure on that one "
3769,1989-03-28,BLACK," Mr Chairman, the Greenbook projections look quite reasonable to us Until very recently we had thought that they were underestimating the amount of economic growth we would have in the economy But at this point I guess we think the risk of error is about equal on both sides of that This change in our view is not the result of what we see in the Greenbook or the Beigebook or what we pick up in the way of anecdotal information To us those sources suggest--if you allow for some downtick in some of the monthly statistics in February because of that temporary weather-induced burst in January and also allow for the sluggishness recently in automobile sales, which may prove to be temporary--that the economy looks pretty strong What makes us think that the risks really have shifted is that we have taken, we think, some pretty significant policy moves in recent weeks and months The federal funds rate is up about 3-1/2 percentage points over a pretty short period of time, and we think these policy actions--particularly the most recent ones--have increased the odds that economic activity will moderate later this year just as the Greenbook projects And these actions significantly reduce the risk that the economy is going to overheat further  Now, the recent sharp increases in prices at the wholesale level and certainly at the consumer level worry us a great deal as do the indications of upward pressures on wages And we're deeply concerned about broad increases in prices outside the food and energy area That suggests that the underlying rate of inflation has risen at least a notch or two in the last several months On the other hand, the trend rate of growth in M2 has dropped pretty markedly over the last two years and I think that provides us with at least some insurance against a really sharp further acceleration in the underlying rate of inflation for the remainder of 1989 But I would add, perhaps gratuitously, that if we're really going to get inflation down to a zero level I think somewhere down the road we've certainly got to get the aggregates growing at a slower rate than they have grown over most of this two-year period--maybe no slower in 1989, but certainly in a trend sense they have to come down still further if we're going to get to our ultimate goal  Mr Chairman, I favor holding policy steady over the period ahead, for a period of the next few weeks anyway My hunch is the same as the one that's there [in the forecast] and also the one you made in assuming that some further increase in the funds rate is probably going to be needed later on to keep inflationary pressures and expectations from building up over the months ahead So, I would want the directive to be asymmetrical But I think it's also possible that we've done enough, particularly in looking at the behavior of M2 and how that has decelerated I realize a lot of that stems from how opportunity costs of holding M2 [have changed] just recently; but if  -35-    3/28/89  you look at the last two years M2 growth is still down to 47 percent from many years at a trend rate of about 89 percent That is one whale of a lot of deceleration over that period That leads me to be more sanguine about what might happen to inflation than I would be in the absence of that decided deceleration in M2 So, I would go with ""B,"" at least until we have more information on the March figures; I'd watch those closely because I may well be wrong on that Certainly, the current statistics do not reflect anything that would suggest that we ought not tighten more You've got to look way back at what has been put in train, guess about those lagged effects, and reach the conclusion that now is the time to pause And that's really where I think the focus ought to be right now  Both?  You would have said yes if he hadn't helped you, "
3794,1989-05-16,BLACK," Sam, you mentioned a while ago that the Germans had some differences over the type of intervention What is their preference on that?  I can't now, Bob, but I'd give you--  At our last meeting, Mr Chairman, I think Governor LaWare said he thought the economy was probably a little mushier--if I remember his words right--than most people were thinking  I understand words like that  Well, I think the national data that have been released subsequently support that, and we see confirmation of that in our District The Beigebook report showed that consumer spending and manufacturing activity were moderating a good deal in March and April and the comments of our directors at the last couple of meetings have been noticeably less bullish than before At our meeting last Thursday several of the directors who live in what they like to call the golden crescent, which reaches from Baltimore through Washington and Richmond down to the Tidewater area around Norfolk, said activity actually has slowed up somewhat And this has been a boom area for some time  So far as the outlook is concerned, I think the Board's staff has made a solid case in the forecast that they have in the Greenbook And I think Mike made a further solid case by modifying that in the direction that he suggested when he drew on the later numbers This means essentially a soft landing Of course, everybody hopes that's what we will have It has been so long since we've had one that I don't think I would even remember Like Ed Boehne, up until recently I've been thinking that the risk of error was on the up side and now I think it has become more balanced between the up side and the down side I do think, however, that it would be premature to conclude that the risk is definitely on the down side at this point It's still possible that the sluggishness we have seen in the economy could turn out to be temporary A lot of it comes from the weakness in automobile sales and the incentives there are pretty sizable; so it's quite possible that that will turn around I remember so many times in the past when we thought we saw signs of weakening and they turned out not to have materialized For example, in the face of the weak employment reports that we had back in July and August we were really  -19-    5/16/89  worried about the economy for a while; and then they shot back up in the fall Don't misunderstand me I'm not suggesting that there is going to be a reacceleration As a matter of fact, I think that's unlikely The only point I mean to make is that I think it's a little premature to conclude that the economy really has turned downward at this point I would hold off a little on that judgment, although we certainly can make a better case for that now than we could have at the last meeting  Martha, you've raised an interesting question about whether the borrowed reserve target or the federal funds rate is the better indicator of policy Earlier Governor Angell raised the question as to whether the behavior of the aggregates or the federal funds rate was the better target And I think we all--  I'm saying there are three ways we can measure it that have been discussed here today, and I like Governor Angell's way best I like the federal funds rate second best and the borrowed reserves third best And they are all incompatible with one another We had a pretty interesting discussion earlier  Yes, I know what you were doing  But what the Bluebook did assume was that the best measure of the degree of reserve pressure was the federal funds rate, because you've adjusted your borrowing target to influence that rate  All the worrying about viewing the borrowed reserve target flexibly was designed to give preference to the federal funds rate which [unintelligible] was probably given--  Mr Chairman, I would favor ""B;"" $600 million; symmetrical language with ""slightly"" and ""might"" I'm not really worried about abandoning that asymmetrical directive because by the  -43-    5/16/89  time it comes out it will be after our July meeting and you will have testified before the two Congressional Committees The market, I hope, has the wisdom to look back and [recognize that] when we removed the tilt [the outlook] was very uncertain and that tilt was justifiably removed at that time It may subsequently have been reversed by whatever actions we take, but I think that a rational market observer--and there are a number of them--would think that was the logical thing for us to have done  I was suggesting ""slightly/might"" on both of them  Yes That predisposes us not to move unless we have some evidence that we don't now have It's a stronger vote to remain where we are than ""somewhat"" and ""would,"" I think We may be getting into minutia here but--  If I were voting I would [accept] ""somewhat"" and ""would;"" I even toyed with the idea of ""somewhat"" and ""might"" and other permutations and combinations of that  That's possible, too, but I thought that would drive Don and his associates crazy "
3828,1989-06-05,BLACK," Mr Chairman, this is Bob Black Has anybody been able to figure out whether this is a supply phenomenon or a demand phenomenon? It occurs to me, with this high level of employment, that that weakness might stem from a lack of people to employ  Well, [I question whether] to interpret this as a sign of weak demand when employment rose so slowly I'm wondering if it wasn't a matter of difficulty in finding people, given such a high level of employment, high participation rates, and a relatively low level of unemployment  I didn't understand all of what Joyce was saying, but I thought it had accelerated a little "
3840,1989-07-05,BLACK," Are they attributing that to what they think we're about to do? What is the explanation?  Any guess on the unemployment rate and the figures this Friday?  Mr Chairman, our projections are very close to those in the Greenbook We have slightly higher growth in real GNP and a slightly higher inflation rate but the differences here are really minor and not worth mentioning The overall profile of the forecast is just about the same More interesting than the projections themselves is the question as to where the risk of error probably lies If one looks at domestic final demand only, one might conclude that the risk in the case of GNP is definitely on the down side But, as we all know, the behavior of net exports of goods and services has had a very large impact on our total GNP over the last six years And the prospects for net exports are something of a wild card in the outlook currently I think the staff's projected sharp drop in the growth of exports is certainly reasonable, given the strength of the dollar But the underlying demand abroad is pretty strong in a number of countries and this could buttress our exports for a while, I think, even if the dollar remains relatively strong On balance, I would say that the risk of error in our forecast and that of the staff's is probably on the down side; but I wouldn't rule out the possibility that the economy could be a little stronger, given this wild card on the export side  When we get to the price issue, I think the risk is about evenly distributed The staff is expecting that the underlying rate of inflation as measured by the CPI less energy and food will be about 5 percent over the next several quarters I think a lot of that is going to depend on how strongly these aggregates come back and whether the projection of growth in the aggregates is really going to materialize On an anecdotal level, at a recent meeting of our board  -17-    7/5-6/89  of directors to which we invited our alumni there were more mentions on the part of both groups about how tight labor really is and the virtual impossibility of attracting labor Now, we have a pretty prosperous District by and large with the exception of a few parts of West Virginia But still, it was striking that so many were reporting such difficulty in attracting labor This leads me to think that we may have more wage/price pressures than some people assume or that these pressures may be around a little longer than some are assuming  Mr Chairman, I think you have taken away the easy part of the problem The 1990 ranges are really where I suspect we will have most of our differences here And I think that's the more important part of [our decision] A lot of this depends on how one views the ranges; there are different ways that one can look at this To me, the most important thing is that the ranges are our signal to the public, and I hope a reasonable signal, of what we plan  -34-    7/5-6/89  to do over the next four to six quarters to achieve the long-run objectives of monetary policy Accordingly, I think it's very important that the ranges we select for 1990 make it crystal clear to the public that this current apparent softening in final demand is not going to divert us from our objective of trying to restore price stability over the long run We have made a lot of progress on this and I think we've had excellent monetary policy for a long time now But we still have the underlying inflation rate at around 5 percent, so we still have some distance to go on that All of us, obviously, would like to achieve price stability with a minimum of disruption in the economy But I think price stability really has to be our primary--and I would say our single overriding--long-term goal I think the greater the public's confidence in our commitment to that end, the less the short-term disruptions are going to be  So, in my mind, it's highly desirable that we reduce the range for M2 further in 1990 to maintain the credibility that we've won over such a long period of time So, I strongly prefer alternative III What that means to me, really, is that we want the underlying rate of growth of M2 to come in somewhere around the 4-1/2 percent midpoint of the 2-1/2 percent to 6-1/2 percent range, which would be consistent with what I think we've been trying to do for a long time Now, I recognize that the staff's baseline forecast for M2 for 1990 is 6-1/2 percent That means, of course, that a 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent range doesn't give us a lot of leeway for error on the up side But frankly, I wouldn't be unduly concerned if interest rate movements or some other temporary factor did cause us to come in above that, as long as we were reasonably confident that that was temporary and it was something that we could explain to the public  If you'd permit me to add one final point, Mr Chairman Every time we go through this exercise, I become more and more convinced that we really need to change our targeting procedures to look at this on a multi-year basis Several of us have made this point in the past; and I'd like to suggest again that we take a look at that because, given base drift, this seems to me a pretty inefficient way to target on the long-run objectives on which I think we all agree I would like to see us, if we can agree on that, make some kind of move in that general direction  I can't really quarrel with that I was just hoping, as I was telling Don before the meeting, that he could come up with as good reasons why we ran over the target as he did in his recent memorandum--which I thought was excellent work--explaining why we ran so low If he could, then I could be pretty well satisfied with that He certainly eliminated some of my worries about this unduly slow rate of growth we've had in M2 recently It has been about 3 percent adjusted  He did it and he did it very well!  You'll have to speak more quietly next time, Jerry, if you want a longer reign!  It is a modern-day version of the real bills doctrine  Don, in your chart 9 where you have P above P*, is that a significant difference that would [lead] you to think that that's some indication for us that it might not [unintelligible]?  I like that adverb  Mr Chairman, you made my talk for me except that you made it much better than I would have But, I would like to suggest one thing It probably won't meet with a lot of acceptance but I'd like to see the monetary aggregates moved up in that list of things that might temper what we're doing in the intermeeting period Rather than the unemployment and employment figures [to be released] this Friday or inflation figures coming later on, I think this is  -54-    7/5-6/89  really the crucial thing And I think it's important that we do keep [money growth] moving up; it has been very weak for a long time and unless we get to change that, frankly, I think we're going to run into trouble before very long So I'd like to see that moved up to the first place But otherwise, I'm right with you on this  When the federal funds rate comes down a little and the aggregates continue at the rate they have been going, I think the market will be scared very much by those developments So, the reason I suggested moving that up a little is that they ought to know that we are concerned that the aggregates not stay that low forever, but rather that they should move up a bit from where they are The work that Don and his associates did alleviates a lot of my worries about it because that work pretty well suggests to me around 3 percent, which might not be too bad I don't think that [low growth] ought to go on any longer now; and I'd like the markets to know that if it doesn't begin to move a little we'll have to do something  I always suggest that  [Unintelligible] "
3892,1989-10-03,BLACK," That probably means he doesn't want any questions!  Mr Chairman, most of what I wanted to cover has been covered by various people I wanted to start off by saying that I think this issue is more important than any of the ones we have on the agenda Despite the Japanese belief that sterilized intervention can have some permanent lasting effect, I don't really buy that And I think this does put us into a dangerous position As Sam indicated a while ago, we can drive the dollar down and the Treasury has a vested interest in that so as not to show a loss on its operations You could say that we do, too, although I'm sure that that's not anything that would motivate us  Oh, I know that  Well, the next point I was going to make was that I was sure you were making just that sort of argument and I wanted to commend you for having done that I do think one issue remains and that is one that Governor Angell and Governor Johnson raised last time whether this really can fall in our existing directive to counter disorderly conditions To my mind, it might go a little beyond that And I realize the [unintelligible] of the constitution is the Treasury [unintelligible] and I think you had to cooperate; I would support that But I think it does behoove us to continue, as you are doing, to try to educate them that this path is fraught with a lot of dangers At some point if we continue to get pressure from the Treasury to do this kind of thing I think we ought to at least take a look at the directive and maybe expand it--if we think that's appropriate--beyond disorderly conditions I wouldn't want to go beyond that myself but maybe the Committee could I realize you've been on the side of the angels in this and--  Well, I was going to commend you but at the same time criticize the fact that we unavoidably and inextricably got drawn into it because of the Treasury's primary status in this thing I would express the hope that this study we have undertaken could convince some of those who really don't know that much about it  As I said, I knew you were on the side of the angels! Others may argue, but Wayne has had very close contact with angels and he says that that is exactly right! If there's anyone here who's equipped to speak for the angels I think he really is  Mr Chairman, I just have one comment I was comforted by your statement that central bankers were lined up almost uniformly against the ministers of finance on that Do you know how strongly they are arguing their position with their minister of finance counterparts as you are clearly doing in this country?  May we all take off that day, Mr Chairman? I'd really like to take off Well, Monday is a holiday  It'll be in the paper Tuesday, then  What you are saying, then, is that it was the wrong job in your view?  But it is the wrong job  Mr Chairman, I find myself in a little different position from the first three speakers We really haven't changed our view of the economic outlook very much from what we had last time The Greenbook projections seem reasonable to us; the staff always does a good job I don't think I will ever understand how Mike Prell is able to answer so many questions so well! But since there is some onus on us to say how we differ, I would say that our best guess is that the downside risk is a little greater at this point than the upside risk, for a couple of reasons First of all, I don't think we have yet seen the full effects of all the tightening that we have undertaken over the last year and a half Secondly, a lot of the improvement that the Greenbook projects is based on the external sector and that, in turn, has an underlying assumption that the dollar is going to continue to depreciate at a rather steady rate That's certainly a plausible position, but I think one can make some case that there is certainly more than a small possibility that the dollar just may not decline for reasons that we don't well understand I don't think we fully understand why it was strong before we started intervening; it may well be that that strength is going to resume, particularly after we are out of the market If that were to be the case, then real net exports and real GNP might come in a bit weaker than what the staff is projecting On the inflation side, I found the staff's efforts to estimate the magnitude of the effects of the projected depreciation of the dollar extremely helpful but rather  -26-    10/3/89  disturbing, because even with these alternative projections we didn't show much progress on inflation through 1991 But again, we find ourselves in a rather unique position in that we think inflation may do better than the staff thinks I feel rather uncomfortable with that because I remember--  We think we will have less inflation than they projected The reason I feel uncomfortable with that is that over time I think most of our System policy errors have been made by having been too easy rather than by having been too tight And the outlook is dependent to a large extent on what I think is an unusually high degree of credibility that policy now enjoys My feeling is that we probably have a higher degree of credibility now than we have ever had And I think your statement in response to the Neal resolution did a lot to strengthen that So, I'm a bit more optimistic on this than I have been But I hope that doesn't translate into the wrong kind of policy for the Committee because I'm not ready at this point to relinquish the reins and say that we have this battle won, by any means   -29-    10/3/89  Well, I'm talking about  How big is the gap is what he's asking  Mr Chairman, I'm very sympathetic to the point that Lee Hoskins made because I tend to focus on the longer run, as I think he does And I think our long-run problem is inflation rather than recession I'm also sympathetic to the points made by those who favor symmetry just because I'd like to send a signal to the market that we don't really approve of the G-7 action But I also share Wayne's feeling that monetary policy has been a little tighter than most people assume and that it may be [sufficient to] hold down the inflation risk So, I think your original formulation is probably the best one for now; I would go with ""B"" asymmetrical on the easing side  That's exactly the problem  We can use a long-run perfectly vertical Phillips curve and I wouldn't have any objection to that  -48-    10/3/89 "
3942,1989-11-14,BLACK," Ted, I was a little surprised by the severity of the decline in net exports in the third quarter I just didn't sense the things that you [noted] Does that seem to be a reasonable figure to you or is that one that we might--  Self-glorified numbers  Mr Chairman, the Greenbook projections haven't changed very much since last time and neither have ours We continue to believe that if there is risk, the risk is probably that the economy will be a little weaker than the staff have been projecting That feeling has been heightened by recent anecdotal information that we've been picking up I got a particularly interesting piece this morning A president of one of the small investment firms in Richmond sent me a collection of articles published by a guru he's been following for some 30 years and he said that the problem with the economy was that the Reserve Bank Presidents had recently started attending the Open Market Committee meetings and they were bullying you into accepting tighter monetary policy, which he thought was correct! But more important than that, our directors at their last meeting were decidedly less optimistic about the economy than they had been They reported weakness in commercial construction and automobile sales a good deal weaker, with several dealerships in trouble They said manufacturing activity appeared to be softening and loan demand was flat at some of the large commercial banks But they went ahead to stress that despite all this, they didn't think [the economy] was really falling out of bed And labor was still very tight But in view of this indication that we've gotten from various sources, the Fifth District is probably slowing to some extent Since this area has been one of the stronger parts of the national economy, we think that the national economy, if it isn't right on target with the Greenbook's projection, will perhaps be somewhat weaker than that At the same time, we're a bit more optimistic--the Richmond Fed staff  -18-    11/14/89  has been assuming no change in monetary policy--on the inflation side Given the amount of tightening that we had in '88 and in '89, we think we're going to begin to see some dividends from that I think there is some evidence of that in the squeeze in profit margins now; despite rising labor costs, firms are not able to pass that on to prices because there's more resistance to those prices So, we are hoping that we'll do a little better on the inflation front than the staff is projecting  Mr Chairman, I would go along with ""B"" with asymmetric language I recognize that we've done quite a bit of easing in recent weeks and that M2 is growing pretty strongly Clearly, at some point, as Tom expressed it so well on the ""Call"" the other day--and Governor Angell has made the same point--we're going to have to start paying more attention to the aggregates and less to these short-term indicators of real economic activity or else we're going to be headed for a lot of trouble I don't think we've reached that point just yet, but that's clearly a judgment call Having said that, I think it is very essential that we keep our eyes firmly on our longer-term goal of bringing down inflation Accordingly, I think any further easing, even that little amount permitted by the proviso, should be approached very, very cautiously  -29-    11/14/89 "
3967,1989-12-18,BLACK," I think one could also argue that our credibility wasn't as high during that period as it might be in the future  Which would have made it even less  Like so many others, Mr Chairman, I would compliment the staff; in fact, I did compliment Mike Prell before the meeting And I'd like to compliment you in allowing us to talk about these things I've been attending these meetings off and on for 30 years now and almost all the time for 16 years and in that period of time I don't think we've addressed a topic quite as important as what we're doing now I know no one would have a lot of confidence in the econometric measures that one would use to determine what the costs of eliminating inflation are, but what to me comes out as most important is the qualitative differences between these various approaches The backward-looking model, which is the traditional way we've looked at it here, makes the cost very, very high But if we can assume that we have something like rational expectations and forward-looking  -21-    12/18-19/89  expectations and if we can assume that we have some kind of credibility and strength in that credibility, then the cost becomes considerably less I think Manley made a good point a while ago, which Lee picked up on, when he said maybe the worst case is the one we had in the early '80s when we really hit the economy with a big shock without announcing exactly what we were going to do I don't think we really anticipated ourselves that rates were going to go anything like that high; and yet from this vantage point, it seems to me the costs have been relatively low There were certainly costs, but they were relatively low And if something like the Neal resolution passed, and if we could state our targets--I would like to say over multiple years rather than just one year--in advance and come close to these and eliminate this base drift, then I think the costs are not nearly so scary as we seem to be concluding here Finally, I'd like to pick up on Governor Angell's point about the cost of not aiming at zero inflation, which is the alternative I think we have had a lot of experience of that in the postwar period I think those costs are very great; and there are substantial risks that evolve from that sort of a program So to me the case is to try to [unintelligible] rational expectations to the extent that you can and back those up with as high credibility as you can and then the costs of doing what we'd all like to do are going to be lower than they would be under any of the other possible alternatives  That's where a lot of them are  Mr Chairman, I'm sort of on the side of the Angells in this!  Well, I shouldn't have said it, I guess It looks to me like the first question breaks down into two points one is whether we ought to seek a zero rate of inflation or a steady low rate; the second is whether the Fed should target a zero rate of inflation or a stable price level And there are a lot of costs Don mentioned a while ago shoe leather costs in trying to minimize one's balances because of a rise in nominal rates and interactions with the tax code When you have inflation of any kind, even a low level, you have all these nonsocial institutions that rise up and use resources to help you beat inflation So, clearly, I think what we ought to do is to aim for a zero rate Governor LaWare raised some interesting questions about this because he was saying, I think, that the existing indexes don't capture all the improvements in quality That is certainly true And, therefore, I was glad to see that you got the Neal Subcommittee to adopt your definition of inflation, which is much less specific in that we don't have inflation when it no longer affects the decisions of the decisionmakers  Now, with regard to the second part of the question--the price level at which we ought to aim, or the zero inflation rate--I think we ought to aim at a particular price index, as I think Governor Angell was saying Otherwise, I think we're apt to get shocks of all sorts [that induce] deviations from that zero rate In effect, that's where the political pressures are going to arise So, unless we undo that if it's an upward pressure or undo it if it's a downward pressure and go back to our original target, then I think we're going to have price level drift that is not unlike the base drift that we had when we targeted the monetary aggregates  Well, I just think that our whole economic system has a bias in favor of inflation I even think that the Federal Reserve has some bias in favor of inflation  In that kind of world I think that's what you would expect; but in a political world I don't think they would [be random] The answer really, Manley, is that they would be purely random, but it's the political issue that enters in  That expresses it; I wish I'd thought of that  Well, my mother-in-law is an exception to a lot of other--  Well, let me answer the second question I got us off track I can see As to the timetable, I would come out right where Governor Angell did on that; and that's where you came out, Mr Chairman, in your testimony before the Neal Subcommittee I think in the interest of credibility we need to pin ourselves down to get there If all these simulations we did are in any sense right, you have less painful results when expectations are forward-looking rather than based entirely on past experience So I would like to see that tied down to a 5-year period, realizing that if we don't hit it that  -36-    12/18-19/89  we would have a few problems on that But I think if we had the target we'd be more likely to hit it than if we didn't  I remember, too  Mr Chairman, I think Governor Angell was right in going back to the Constitution where it says Congress should have the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof And that has been delegated to us through various forms of legislation Don Kohn mentioned a while ago that among the objectives that have specifically been spelled out in the existing Acts is to control inflation I think the best way to make that point is to do precisely what you did before the Neal Subcommittee by saying that this is the best way to get all these other things, which I sincerely believe  I do too, absolutely And that would be the brunt of my argument  If we didn't approve it, Sam would end up having to buy some dollars with some of his earnings on foreign currencies to stay below the limit So we pretty well have to do it for that reason Maybe--  Well, let's see  Yes  Yes  -58-    12/18-19/89  The limit has to be enough to keep it from--  I'm not disagreeing with that  Peter, off and on for several years Roger Guffey has been raising questions about whether the seasonal borrowing levels mean the same thing as the adjustment borrowing levels Intuitively, I can't see how they really could because I don't think of banks as feeling the same degree of pressure when they have a [seasonal] loan that doesn't have to be paid off until a specific maturity date But the studies that the staff has done always have suggested that, so far as we can tell over the banking system, the reaction to either type of borrowing has been pretty much identical and we have treated them as identical This time we made two technical adjustments because of misjudgments about the level of seasonal borrowing Does this indicate any change in the attitude of the staff toward seasonal borrowing?  It makes sense to me that you're doing it But that's what I would have concluded without a study One of my predecessors used to say that research consists of proving with uncertainty that which was known for certain beforehand I'm glad to see this now and I imagine Roger is glad to see it too  That's the problem!  Could I ask, Ted What would be your figure for net exports of goods and services for the third quarter?  You mean it's a $6 billion improvement?  But if you take those two factors off, Martha, they total 9/10ths of a percent--if I'm not wrong--so this comes down to 12 percent So, really, your first quarter is as weak as any quarter in 1990 after you take account of the earthquake and the Boeing strike  Mr Chairman, we came here with the idea of saying that we thought the general outline of the Board's forecast was pretty accurate But we intended to express the feeling that if we  -77-    12/18-19/89  had any doubts, the doubts were whether the economy would be quite as strong as the projection And I think Mike essentially has done that in his revised statement We've been influenced not only by the incoming statistics but by the anecdotal information that we picked up, particularly at our last Board meeting It's always hard to interpret what business people are saying about things because they don't seem to have any concept of seasonally adjusted rates or anything of that sort; they are always looking at the previous year They can say it's the worst ever and it really might be a seasonally adjusted improvement Anyway, they said the things one would have expected them to say They were universally pessimistic; and there hasn't been a meeting since the last recession when our directors have been as uniformly pessimistic as they were at this one Other anecdotal information has been pretty much along those same lines We're a bit more optimistic than the staff is, though, toward the end of 1990 and the first part of 1991; [we're expecting] GNP to pick up primarily because of export improvement And I think it's quite possible, and probably likely, that domestic demand will be stronger than the staff is suggesting in its forecast I think too that lower interest rates may well be compatible with our efforts to control inflation, and the staff is projecting essentially flat interest rates Finally, I'm a bit more optimistic on prices than they are It's a great comfort to me that the P* model, which I think is a very great piece of work, is projecting [unintelligible] for next year But just looking at the way I see the market working, profits are being squeezed and they're being squeezed because businessmen can't pass on price increases There's a lot more resistance to price increases now than at any time in my lifetime that I can remember And I think that's why they can't pass these things on I [refuse] to pay list on anything Somebody accused me the other day of shopping three places before I'd buy an ice cream cone I haven't gotten quite that bad! But I do think the American consumer is in that kind of--  In essence what we do is buy in quantity and put it in the freezer and make our own ice cream cones at home! Anyway, I do think that is a bigger factor now than it has been And I think some of these price indexes recently have been reflecting more inflation than perhaps we have had; for example, the last one shows automobile prices and apparel prices as being the two main offenders The indexes are supposed to measure the price at which the items are generally available and I don't think they pick up the extent to which discounts occur Automobiles, for example, you can buy at below dealer cost; there's no question about that in many cases I think the System's practice of bidding for automobiles when we buy, which I think we have to do, really results in our paying higher prices than if we could go around and dicker with the dealers I believe I can buy an automobile more cheaply than the Reserve Bank bank can buy one I think the surveys are not picking up a lot of that discounting because the discounted prices don't appear to be generally available So, I feel a little better about the price situation I think [the outlook] looks very much like a soft landing with a slow pickup after that That's probably too good to be true but that's my best guess  You don't think you're sending a false impression for later years do you?  Mr Chairman, I think it's a close call today I have a marginal preference for staying right where we are because of very strong growth in M2 I have enough faith in the past to believe that the secular velocity of M2 is likely to remain pretty stable, and along the lines that Lee and Don were discussing awhile ago, that means somewhere along the way that growth is going to have to be slowed down At the same time, I see less inflation out there than most people do right now And I think interest rates are likely to be lower as we go along than most people seem to feel So, I could live with your recommendation If I were voting I would go with you on that, although I have a slight marginal preference for not making a change  And deeply felt  I agree with that, Mr Chairman  -99-    12/18-19/89  The last time you suggested that we submit ideas on rewording the directive that was the one we submitted and it was rejected  I strongly support Governor Angell on that point  At least!  We have not followed Robert's Rules in the past  There are some other things we would like to resurvey too that we didn't vote--  SPEAKER(?) We'll have different voting members next year "
3996,1990-02-06,BLACK," Mr Chairman, Governor Johnson's questioning about these real long-term interest rates prompted me to look at the footnotes on Chart 15 down in the lower left-hand corner where there are three asterisks That says inflation is estimated by a 36-month centered moving average of actual inflation, forecast by staff [where needed] Does that mean that the last figure has 18 months of forecasting in it?  I think they all want to go home!  Mr Chairman, our projections for the Humphrey- Hawkins report are very similar to those of the Greenbook on both GNP and unemployment We basically agree with what I think the Greenbook is saying that the economy seems to be passing through an inventory correction that's largely centered in manufacturing and that the correction ought to be pretty well completed during the first quarter of this year At the last meeting we felt that the risk of error was on the down side and this time we've shifted to the point that we now have a sense that the risks are about evenly divided on each side We've been impressed by how quickly the domestic automobile industry has adjusted or moved to adjust its inventories downward, and we are  -11-    2/6-7/90  encouraged by the strength of orders for durables goods and also for nondefense capital goods So this suggests to us that manufacturing may be stronger than we thought and also that business outlays for new equipment may be somewhat better than we thought earlier  At the same time, I have to say that I'm really concerned about these projections for inflation that the staff has for 1991 as well as 1990 They show, in essence, no further progress in bringing inflation down from the present rate and, in fact, the CPI less food and energy is shown as actually increasing a notch in 1990 and again in 1991 The same is true of the fixed-weight GNP index I think, like all of us of course, that that would be a very undesirable outcome--to put it gently--in view of our stated goal of getting prices down I think it's essential that somehow or other we improve on this inflation performance shown in the Greenbook, and I'd like to suggest that we keep this in mind when we work on our long-term targets later on in this meeting We're more optimistic on inflation, I should add, than the staff is  We put in 4 percent  Mr Chairman, Governor Seger raised an interesting question about base drift I've been very much concerned about that problem over time I had felt that the best way was some kind of point target, and I even thought of going with some range for missing above or below But the way we do it, if we end up expecting a rate of growth for the next year from some point other than the one where we are at year-end, it's very difficult to explain to the public I don't know exactly the way around that unless we move to some kind of point target But it's very confusing If we're way over, even those of us who are the most hawkish are reluctant to vote for something like a 2 percent rate of growth to counterbalance some of the overshoot, because that would seem rather extreme to the public who would just pick up the 2 percent and not realize that it came from a different base I think it's a problem we ought to try to deal with somewhat differently from the way we're doing But I don't really have the best answer as to how to do that I do have a lot of sympathy for some kind of point target way out there, a multiyear target  It would certainly be good if we could do that since our [Congressional] testimony--that of the four Reserve Bank Presidents and yours--of course suggested it If we thought this were a real possibility within a 5-year period, the only scenario here that even comes somewhat close to that is strategy II  Probably not I hope we have something better than anything that appears in any of them actually; but I think it would be rather optimistic to expect that  Mr Chairman, I share your enthusiasm for the material contained on page 8 because I think strategy II clearly is the sort of thing that we really want to get, at a minimum And even that strategy has inflation coming down only 2 percentage points over a 5-year period In contrast to that, which seems to me to be the minimum progress that we ought to aim for, the baseline would have us coming down to an inflation rate that is still more than 3 percent in 1994 I part company a little with you by thinking that alternative III is probably a better way to go But I realize that there are political problems We did go with 3 to 7 percent tentatively as the range for M2 last time--although I argued forcibly, and I thought extremely persuasively, that it ought to be 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent but lost that battle--and it is very difficult to bring it down But we also have to think about the risk of not doing something to lower the inflation over time And that risk bothers me when I look at strategy II because it has the unemployment rate going up to 6 percent; I'm  -31-    2/6-7/90  sure that bothers everybody else in the room too But, as Governor Angell said, this is a Phillips curve type model and the Bluebook points out, I think wisely, that a more restrictive policy might well change expectations and increase the credibility of our efforts and reduce the cost of getting there So, the tradeoffs might not be as unfavorable Finally, beyond that, I would say that we need to give some consideration to the risk associated with an outcome like the one in the baseline simulation The inflation rate is still above 3 percent in 1994 and we've all said, as embodied in the Neal Resolution, that 5 years seems to be a reasonable length of time to work the inflation rate down gradually If we had 3 percent that late, I think observers would pretty well conclude that we had thrown in the towel We can certainly do what is compatible with strategy II with alternative II instead of III, and I certainly wouldn't dissent on it if I were voting But I do have some preference for alternative III because I would like to send that little signal to the market that we still have the long-run objective of reducing inflation  Mr Chairman, excuse me I was just going to say that I'm very sympathetic to what Governor Angell has said, but I think the Humphrey-Hawkins Act says we have to report the rate of increase or diminution of the monetary and credit aggregates And usually, I believe--  It was just the plural on ""aggregates"" that made me hesitate, because I really support what he says if we could get away with it  Second  That wouldn't be good  I hope so  What lines are you on, Bob?  No growth  Some of you are still there!  Mr Chairman, I share fully Lee Hoskins' assessment of how we ought to measure the impact of monetary policy And that puts someone who believes that in a very difficult position because what we have to do is to pick out of the air, as it were, some borrowed reserve target that will create some federal funds rate that will enable us to predict the demand for money I'm very skeptical of our ability to do that in the short run, and I always have trouble with this particular part of the meetings for that reason My guess is that the caveat Don Kohn threw out is probably right and that we're probably going to get a slower rate of monetary growth with existing money market conditions than shown in ""B"" That's a pure guess But for that reason I would stick with ""B"" because I think the rate of growth we may get on M2 may be closer to that shown for ""C"" "
4022,1990-03-27,BLACK," You got reckless there for a minute!  Well, it's in the wrong direction  What does that say about your thoughts on the evaluation of the Committee?  Mr Chairman, I think the changes in the staff projections are clearly in the right direction As a lot of people have indicated, there is a great deal of uncertainty, but I do think we have enough hard information now to know that the inventory swing  -25-    3/27/90  from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year was [more] than we thought Consequently, it looks as if the rate of growth in real GNP in the first quarter is going to be correspondingly higher One of the key points looking ahead, of course, is that the staff has projected that there will be some rise in interest rates over this period of time in order to get roughly the same rate of growth in GNP and more or less the same sort of inflation figures I think that change in policy assumptions is quite correct We've had a sustained growth in M2 for about 9 months now and this may well strengthen aggregate demand considerably In addition, events in Eastern Europe have moved much more rapidly than anybody felt they probably would So it seems to me that the transformation of these economies is necessarily going to lead to higher real interest rates throughout the industrial world Given this assumed upward adjustment in rates that the staff has incorporated in its forecast, I think the risk is about evenly split between up and down If they had not raised these rates, I would have placed the risk on the up side in their forecast I don't think it will surprise anybody to know that my chief concern is that which was voiced first by Governor Angell that there's no improvement in inflation over this projection period Someone mentioned an absence of trend, but actually if you look at the fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter figures on the fixed-weight deflator and the CPI, they both are higher for '90 and '91 than they were in the last Greenbook The CPI ends up in the fourth quarter of '91 at about 4-1/2 percent, and I think we have to do a good deal better than that Someone--I guess that was Governor Angell too--used the term ""unacceptable"" If we want to maintain our credibility, I think we have to do better than that I sense that despite our best efforts we have lost some of that credibility recently; we ought to think about that very carefully as we formulate our policy later on in this meeting  Anybody you want to suggest to do it?  Mr Chairman, when we've been faced with this degree of uncertainty about the business outlook I don't think we've ever tightened before And yet when I look back through the history of the System, I think this is where we've made most of our mistakes If we could take the Bluebook at face value and assume that we would get a growth of M2 of 6 percent for April through June, I think that would be an adequate slowing, given the rate at which the aggregates have been growing But I'm a little suspicious that it might be a little stronger than that So, I favor a bit of a preemptive strike-- somewhere between ""B"" and ""C,"" a ""B-"" or ""C+"" But that clearly isn't going to happen So, I would be prepared, if I were voting, to vote for a directive with asymmetry to the [tighter] side I think we ought to do at least that much If subsequent economic information suggested that that was the wrong way to have leaned, I don't see that we really would lose anything since that would not be released until after the next meeting  Well, losses on our books could go directly in there too  There are at least two dangers One is that we can lose our credibility and the market will assume we're going to ease policy in order not to take the losses The other is that members of Congress become concerned about the losses and try to exert political pressure on us so that we don't have to take those losses, which would mean pressure to ease policy  We didn't do that "
4058,1990-05-15,BLACK," Mr Chairman, we think that the more restrictive monetary policy that the staff is projecting is going to be needed if we're going to generate greater projected disinflation as appropriate What's striking and disappointing to us is that this assumed tighter    5/15/90  policy is expected to produce only a small improvement in the inflation outlook, at least through 1991, but a fairly substantial reduction in GNP next year I think most of us would agree, and indeed this was an import of the excellent memorandum distributed to us sometime back, that there are different kinds of models on this those that are forward-looking and those that are backward-looking I assume that most of this is based on the MPS model If you used one that is more forward-looking, I think that would suggest a better tradeoff, with more disinflation at a smaller cost Of course, the staff readily acknowledges this in saying that the assumed tighter monetary policy could yield a much bigger payoff if it increased our credibility And that, of course, is a very important issue from the standpoint of our policy decision later on I don't think most of us would be willing to argue in favor of a tighter policy if we thought the payoff on inflation was going to be quite as small as what has been projected in the Greenbook  My own feeling is that the payoff would be larger because I think people are becoming more and more forward looking If we can demonstrate to the public that we really have a strong commitment to [reducing] inflation, then I think perhaps we could have much better results than the staff is projecting on the inflation side Now, we wouldn't quarrel much with the staff's near-term projections for the second and third quarters I would guess that the near-term risks might be skewed a little toward the down side because I think there really is something to this real estate credit crunch We hear this from too many places We had an interesting statement by a major regional developer who is a very astute man, I think He said that funding has virtually dried up; he cited one large city in the country where only one out of eleven major real estate developers can get any credit at all And if that is true, of course, then it could have some early impacts and would bias the next couple of quarters to the down side  Mr Chairman, I'd like to reiterate my view that the progress we make toward achieving our long-run objective and the transition cost of moving to that are going to be affected a great deal by the credibility of our policy --the large regional real estate developer who told me that only one out of eleven developers in a given city could get credit--said that he thought our credibility as an inflation fighter had all but disappeared He could find nobody who thought inflation was going to come down, and he was obviously disappointed that we didn't  And that made me think about it somewhat differently than I otherwise would have because I think this fellow is unusually perceptive  No he isn't; he's even younger than I am, Martha, if you can conceive of such a thing! So, I think we ought to pay a little more attention to the long-run issues in the position we take today than we typically do, instead of our perceptions of what is going on in the short-run part of the economy And we [ought] to focus on what this is going to do to our credibility So, I would favor ""B"" for now, but I would go asymmetrical You've taken care of a good part of my concerns by suggesting that you really favor asymmetry but that you're not quite ready to put that language in the directive I think we need a signal out there that we really haven't abandoned our quest for price stability I'd like to see us put that asymmetry in the directive But the behavior of the aggregates is a concern to me to some extent I would be alarmed if they don't pick up before long, especially M2 and not so much M3, because I think we might have squeezed too much But overall some kind of signal--not a discount rate increase but something from this Committee--really would be very helpful right now, because I agree with you that our next move will be to tighten Of course, like everybody else, I'm guessing on that    5/15/90 "
4081,1990-07-02,BLACK," Mr Chairman, our projections for GNP are pretty close to the staff's; they are almost right on the button for this year, but they are a little lower next year than the staff is projecting As we see it, this seems to be pretty compatible with the kind of growth we've had in the aggregates recently and the Greenbook's assumption that we'll have the same degree of restraint over the forecast period We would guess that the risk of error would be on the down side and perhaps very much on the down side for the next six months or so I say that partly because there doesn't seem to be a real thrust in the economy anywhere right now, with the exception perhaps of exports, and also because of the sharp deceleration in the aggregates The staff memo did a good job of eliminating a lot of the worries I had about the slowing in the aggregates, but as the staff admits--and, of course, we all know--this could be reflecting to some degree a slower growth in the economy than would be healthy And we, like Bob Forrestal, Si Keehn, Tom Melzer, Gary Stern, and maybe some others, are more optimistic than the staff about the degree of inflation that we will have, and we have felt that way for some time We think the staff is about right for this year because of what is already in place for the first quarter, and that puts us at 4-3/4 percent on the CPI for the year But we're expecting a deceleration in 1991, down to the neighborhood of 3-3/4 percent maybe, because of the drop in M2 growth in the second quarter and also the projection on the part of the staff that we will have a constant federal funds rate over the forecast period And, finally, we think the credibility we will get on our anti-inflation policy, if in fact we do hold the federal funds rate steady over the next 18 months in the face of rather sluggish real growth, really ought to have at least a moderate [salutary] effect on the rate of inflation that we actually achieve I was intrigued by Si Keehn's comments about ""ponding"" in his District; we've had a little dry spell, Si, and I think we would be happy with a little ""puddling""  I concur, Mr Chairman, with Bob Forrestal's statement about how useful these longer-run [Bluebook] simulations are because I like to look at monetary policy from a particularly long-run viewpoint As I studied these, I found myself thinking about the Neal Resolution If we can assume hypothetically--I'm sure it's purely hypothetical--that the Neal Resolution would pass Congress this year, we would be mandated to bring inflation down to zero by the year 1995, the last year shown in the simulations Since we supported this resolution publicly in part of the testimony [presented by] many of us, the deceleration shown in the simulations in strategy II would seem to be the very least that we ought to be aiming for over the long run Two percent is certainly not zero, but it's considerably closer than the 3-1/4 percent that we would have in the baseline simulation And the simulations for strategy II do suggest that GNP growth would be very modest over this extended period of time in order to get inflation down to the 2 percent level over the five-year period But as we are well aware, there are various kinds of models and the Board's model is not a particularly forward-looking model I think one that took more consideration of the rational expectations [theory] might show that there would be a [higher] rate of real growth consistent with the progress against inflation that is shown in strategy II In any case, the inflation rate in strategy II seems to me to be the minimum progress that would be consistent with our stated objectives To help achieve this minimum progress--and I would hope we could do even better although I'm doubtful about that--I think we ought to reduce the ranges for M2 steadily over this entire period of time, with the goal of eventually bringing them down to 2-1/2 or 3 percent no later than 1995 I had this sort of thinking in mind when I argued--I felt very persuasively but later found out very unconvincingly--in February that we ought to go to 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent for 1990 So, I would like to see us do that, and we can explain it on the basis of its behavior There is some risk, I suppose, that some might think that was a tightening move, which I would not consider it to be In any event, I do feel very strongly, whatever we do with the 1990 ranges, that we ought to cut them for 1991--in the case of M2, to 2 to 6 percent I think the adoption of such a range would send the public a pretty clear signal that we have    7/2-3/90  a continued firm commitment to our anti-inflationary strategy And it may be especially helpful to send this signal right now because of the recent fiscal developments and the likelihood that we're going to get added political pressure to ease policy aggressively if anything significant comes out of this Now, if we did reduce the M2 ranges, it obviously makes sense to lower the M3 ranges too, although I really don't think that does a lot for us operationally I'm pretty sympathetic to Governor Angell's suggestion that we eliminate M3 But I do think the staff produced a good memo that suggests that there is some marginal value in maintaining it  Which were easy to explain to Congress at the time--  Mr Chairman, I think the last several years of monetary policy have been some of our very finest; I wouldn't go back and change any vote that I've cast during that time It has been many years since I went through an entire session without dissenting in favor of tighter money I started off thinking about the short-run objectives with exactly what you had in mind an asymmetrical directive because of this apparent softness in the economy and the slow growth in the aggregates Then I started looking at the economy a little more closely and I read Don's and his associates' memo And when I looked at the economy, I couldn't see what it was that was going to make us turn down; and his memo on the behavior of the aggregates gave me a good deal of comfort So, I became somewhat uncomfortable with the asymmetrical part of it, since I think our objective is price stability and we're going to have to take some responsible risks on the side of restraint if we're going to get there I came out with alternative B, but I favor symmetry I certainly wouldn't dissent on this, but I do think that in general it's better to have a symmetrical directive because that suggests we are able to go either way I think that would give sufficient leeway  -51-    7/2-3/90  to do exactly what you have in mind I don't have any great problem with asymmetry, but I have a slight preference, as I think Governor Angell has also, for symmetrical language But I think you're very close to where we ought to be on this You made a good statement; I found particularly helpful your analysis of the current conditions, and I take some comfort in your view of inventories I share that feeling I don't know what's going to make us turn down So, if I voted, I would go with symmetrical but not dissent on asymmetrical "
4148,1990-09-17,BLACK," Mr Chairman, Bob Black To get the other side on the floor, let me just say that in looking at the national figures the sense of our directors is that the economy is going to continue at a pretty slow pace but we don't really [expect it to] turn down now [unintelligible] And I think this may be a very crucial point in policy where we have to take a little less in the short run in the    9/17/90  interest of our long-run objective of bringing inflation down So, I would urge that we not move just yet It may be that we'll need to move soon, but I don't seen the evidence quite yet that suggests we ought to move My answer to the question you asked Ed a while ago is that an easing move would raise long-term interest rates And I think that could be very counterproductive for the economy "
4172,1990-10-02,BLACK," We need some kind of reserve measure tied to M2, but there's no way--  Our present structure was set up to target Ml, which then ceased to be a good indicator We have all this institutional set-up in effect and it's not useful  Very cleverly done, too  I thought it was great at the time, but I didn't know what was going to happen to Ml  Peter, does anybody think we've tightened any because we went above our expected--?  I haven't seen any indication of it; I just wondered if you had  You are in the [minority] Of all the observers you're one of the few who really think that Don't virtually all observers think of it as a target?  You have to be able to predict--  This is obviously a very volatile and highly uncertain period and any economic forecast is going to be subject to an unusual degree of uncertainty At the same time, I think we have to avoid overemphasizing these uncertainties To me the main thing that has changed is that we have this oil problem in the Middle East and we don't know how that is going to affect the price of oil Given the kind of assumptions that the staff has made about what will happen to the price of oil, I believe their forecast is a very plausible one and I think the economic projections make sense I would guess that the odds of error are about equal in both directions The key feature of the forecast to me is not so much that a recession is predicted, but that the recession the staff is projecting is relatively shallow and brief And when you think about recessions that we've had in the past, they have almost always been preceded by some kind of overheating of the economy inventories have been bloated to some extent, usually inflation has accelerated rapidly, and interest rates generally have risen rapidly But those conditions really don't exist for the most part today So again, I think the staff's projection is pretty well on target I make this point because I think it implies that the policy approach that we take ought to be cautious and measured, like the one that we have been taking in recent years I don't think there's any cause for panic now even though we obviously need to be alert to what is going to happen in the Middle East  So far as our District economy is concerned, usually I don't see anything that's all that different, but I come out with a little different view than Bob Forrestal did I don't think the Beigebook  -20-    10/2/90  report reflects conditions as well as what we've heard since then because our most recent anecdotal information suggests that economic activity is still growing for the most part, but at very slow rates The sharp slowing that we had been reporting early in the year seems to have subsided The main weak point in our area, as is true I guess in most other places, is certainly commercial building We have some major problems in the Baltimore-Washington-Norfolk corridor It looks as if we increasingly will have to deal with the kind of real estate problems that some other parts of the country have been through Apart from that particular situation, however, I would describe the activity in our area as still growing, but at a very, very modest pace  You took time to add an ""A+"" though  It's not a holiday for financial markets, though it is a bank holiday  But the securities market will be open  Mr Chairman, if you would favor this move without the budget agreement because of economic considerations, wouldn't it be wiser to link it more to those economic considerations so we don't have this precedent of having acted because fiscal policy has acted? I think that could set a precedent for us in the future that--  You have a point there You still stressed it in the context of a longer-term objective of trying to control inflation, given that the aggregates have picked up some, but a lot of that pickup may be fictitious It seems to me that under those circumstances maybe a little lower interest rate is compatible with keeping the money supply running at the rate we had in mind all along, and couching it in those terms--  Yes, that's essentially what I'm saying  But I would still express that in terms of reiterating our long-term objectives  This is perfectly compatible with that and it's not throwing in the towel [on inflation]; that's what we're concerned about  All I'm saying is let's make that a part of the statement I think most of us would agree that that is the way we want to do it  It's hard to know, really, what funds rate level to pick out of thin air that will give us the rate of growth we want in the aggregates I was cheered by the pickup in M2, but when you examine it you wonder if that isn't part fictitious  To me, if in fact M2 is really still relatively weak, then this easing is perfectly compatible with the policy that aims toward price stability But if M2 for some reason or other strengthened a great deal beyond what we think, then--  I'd feel a little better if I knew how that reserve requirement matter worked out  Is this change in the reserve requirements going to have any real impact?  -50-    10/2/90  Mr Chairman, this is a time when we have to be extremely cautious, as everybody has suggested here We have had recent increases in the core rate of inflation; we have weakness in the dollar and complete uncertainty as to how this budget package is going to play The more I look at it the more it bothers me For example, I don't know whether the public is going to [react] the same way And there is this nervousness in the bond market, which made me lean initially toward doing nothing on the federal funds rate But to me changing the federal funds rate is not really a change in policy; it's a change in policy if we really are trying to do something with a rate of growth in the aggregates And you have satisfied me that your intention is to try to keep to what I think is an appropriate target So, I don't think that's a change in policy The market, however, is going to look at it as a change in policy, and that's why I suggested earlier that we couch it in terms of not having abandoned our long-run target, but just as a way of implementing what we want to do  So, I would go along with it It wouldn't have been my first choice, but you're probably more right than I was when I got here As to this second step, I sure would agree with Jerry Corrigan--as you did and I think everybody has--that we want to look at that one very closely But to the extent that we can disabuse the market of the notion that we really have changed the thrust of our policy every time the federal funds rate jumps a little--  As I've said before, it's a modern day version of the real bills doctrine We set a particular rate and the market gets all the money it wants at that rate The only way we have to encourage it to take more is to lower that rate, or the only way to discourage it is to raise the rate, which is what we had under the real bills doctrine And I don't like the initiative for the    10/2/90  generation of the money supply to come from the market It ought to be supply determined rather than demand determined since the long-term velocity of M2 looks like a pretty stable function to me now So, I've always endorsed that I don't have the answer, as I indicated earlier We just don't have any reserve measure that can be expected to control M2, so I don't know what the alternative is And I am very frustrated over that  One thing to bear in mind is that the employment report comes out on Friday and that's significant "
4197,1990-11-13,BLACK," Well, at some point that law has to be changed, it seems to me This is probably not the time to do it  We really ought to get rid of that; it's a fiction [unintelligible] reserve requirement rather than some notes and deposits  Mr Chairman, I think that Don gave us a good solution to the problem, and I certainly agree with Bob Parry that the    11/13/90  final option is the best one We certainly don't want to lock ourselves into the pre-1979 procedures where we have a very narrow range and have all the problems attendant to that When you look at the third and fourth options, we have all these difficulties writing what we want in the directive now, and I can't imagine this group being able to sit around the table and come up with an alternative that we would agree on for the language there So, this kicks me back toward the final option If we're not willing to do anything in the way of adopting a new one, then I think what we have now is better than any of the alternatives other than dropping it  Yes, go back to option one if we don't go to five, but I much prefer five I've always been opposed to any limits of any sort because my predilections are to try to control things with some kind of a reserve measure That necessitates a wider range over which the federal funds rate can move than we've been willing to tolerate in the past  Well, when Roger used to say we were targeting the federal funds rate, Chairman Volcker used to say ""That's what you always say, Roger"" He always used those exact words  Mike, the absence of objections might be because some of us have been objecting for so many years with so little success that we just finally quit out of a sense of futility But I see renewed hope, based on what the Chairman said about that And I think it is tied into Governor Angell's point that it's really closely related to what our new procedures turn out to be, if indeed we adopt new procedures  That was enthusiastic! It suggests, Mr Chairman, that if we want enthusiasm on the part of the Committee that we should discuss insignificant items  Mr Chairman, I think the Greenbook's forecast is certainly plausible and internally consistent, given the kinds of assumptions the staff is making about policy and the price of oil over the forecast horizon But it seems to me that the risk is clearly on the down side even if one assumes that oil prices will behave as the staff has concluded by declining significantly What impresses me about all the recent data we have received, both statistical and anecdotal, is that it is just universally bad As Mike Prell indicated a while ago, the worst is the employment figures But the National Association of Purchasing Managers' figures don't look good We got the figures on industrial production and capacity utilization this morning and they certainly didn't look good The Beigebook suggested that virtually all parts of the economy--in most sectors and in most regions--are experiencing slower growth or even some decline  -23-    11/13/90  in business activity From our directors and other grassroots contacts, except for those in the agricultural area, we're just not getting any good comments at all At last Thursday's meeting of our board, for example, they were more pessimistic than I remember for years and years; even at the meeting before there were a few bright spots that were mentioned, but absolutely none at this one We even had one letter from an unusually affable former director who is a strong supporter of this System saying that the System really didn't understand how bad it was out there He was irked by all the statements that we don't know whether we are in a recession or not and he proceeded to give me a set of figures that demonstrated to his satisfaction that we are, though they were hardly conclusive  Obviously, none of this suggests that we're about to fall over the edge of the cliff But given the state of business and consumer confidence, which as I assess it is lower than I can remember for many a day, it seems to me that there's a better than even chance that we're going to have a greater drop in GNP than the staff is projecting It may well mean also that the recovery is not going to come as early as the second quarter Now, I think the downside risks would increase pretty significantly if the growth in the aggregates comes in below what is projected, and I'm very much concerned by this further evidence of weak growth in the aggregates I hope the Committee is going to take some steps later on to try to get the aggregates more nearly on what seems to me to be an appropriate path Finally, I would like to say that I sure was happy to see the projections on inflation that the staff has made for down the road a way It's certainly true that we're going to have some turbulent times, but I think we have made some progress toward our long-run objective of achieving price stability I'm delighted to see this reflected in the forecast, and I believe the staff is going to be right on that  Is that your unbiased report?  That's a subdivision of the Fifth District, Mr Chairman "
4219,1990-12-07,BLACK," How's that going Dick?  Mr Chairman, Bob Black I do think we have to address this discount rate issue I really [unintelligible] favor the penalty [rate] that Governor Angell has stated recently But I do think this differential is now down so low that it is something that we need to look at and make a conscious decision about Some of my colleagues may be surprised [unintelligible] because I've been very hawkish throughout my entire career, but it is out of line with past practices It's very difficult to explain [to the directors] why this is so and we don't want to tell them it really doesn't play much of a role anymore unless we're going to give the changed expectation So, we sent in a recommendation suggesting that the discount rate be lowered by 1/2 point, with an announcement that this was to bring it into alignment I think a decision is needed on what sort of role we want the discount rate to play in the days ahead I think we have the right amount of [ease] now and I wouldn't favor any further moves now, but I do think we need to look at that issue "
4235,1990-12-18,BLACK," It would be easier in that you would not have to worry about what the level of borrowed reserves was as much as you did  Mr Chairman, these are obviously uncertain and difficult times not only for consumers and producers but also for forecasters This looks a little different from anything we've ever had before I think the staff's forecast is highly plausible, given    12/18/90  the assumptions on which it rests But our hunch is that the projection for real GNP for the current quarter and the first half of 1991 will turn out to be on the high side even if the oil prices do come down from the relatively optimistic path that the staff has assumed I have several reasons for saying this One is the big revision the staff has made in net exports of goods and services by showing a pretty steep, near-term drop in imports which, of course, has the effect of raising both real GNP and net imports of goods and services compared to the November Greenbook forecast We think the direction of this revision was clearly appropriate, given the weakness in domestic demand that's been evident in the recent data and also the census data mentioned in the Greenbook and again the figures that we've gotten on the merchandise trade balance for October--though a lot of that may wash out as Ted suggested Despite all those things, the magnitude of the revision looks a little big to us And the second reason is this persistent weakness in M2, which I don't think anybody really can explain satisfactorily That continues to worry us a great deal And finally, we've been impressed by the continued strong negative tone of most of the anecdotal information that we've been getting from all sorts of sources One piece of information that struck me as particularly impressive came from the  who is in the plastics business and makes parts for manufacturers all over the country and sells them on a nationwide business He called up specifically to tell us that the bottom had fallen completely out of his order book, which is something that he had not seen before  This had happened last month Now, we feel somewhat more comfortable with the staff's inflation forecast than with the projections on output and employment The staff has revised downward a little its projections for inflation for 1991 and 1992 from the last Greenbook, and that strikes us as appropriate But as I said earlier, I really think the monetary restraint that we have put in place over the last several years as a whole may well produce greater long-term benefits on the inflation side than the staff has been projecting even if this recession turns out--as I hope it will--to be as mild as they are projecting  Mr Chairman, I was just looking at the P* model shown in Chart 9 and, as I read that, it provides me with a pretty good comfort level Don, do you take much comfort in that?  Well, in the long run it has been pretty darn stable  That's right  If we did this, you don't think it would provide an undue degree of surprise, do you?  That's the way I read it  Mr Chairman, you formulated exactly what I would have done I just want to express the hope that the Board of Governors in its wisdom does what you suggested it might do tomorrow so that the net effect would be a 1/4 point change in the federal funds rate If the Board does not act, then 1/4 point is all I would want to do at this point I think a 1/2-point move would do things to the bond market and the foreign exchange market that we wouldn't like very  -35-    12/18/90  much That would be seen as throwing in the towel [on inflation] at this point So, I'm with you 100 percent on that  Which might or might not be used  I think we could put out a news release if we decided this sort of thing  Bob Parry and I are going to be on next year too [as voting members]!  And it's on the other side where we've made our mistakes every time throughout our history practically "
4258,1991-01-09,BLACK," Mr Chairman, this is Bob Black I was on the call yesterday and I did not know at the time of the call that Peter had had conversations with you and that Don had talked with you But when they told me they were not going to drain reserves, I told them I thought that was an appropriate policy in view of the extreme shortfalls in the money supply Peter subsequently phoned me following the call and told me about the conversations, indicating that he did not have time to tell me ahead of time I think you did exactly the right thing and I applaud your gracious act in moving when you did  Mr Chairman, Bob Black again Just briefly, I think this does raise the question of whether the discount rate ought to be one of the things [the Board] may have to address just as a matter of alignment [with] the federal funds target I guess the discount rate really doesn't have much role, but it's still something I think we have to look at even if we don't allow any of that change to show through in the federal funds rate I feel it's the proper course right now "
4278,1991-02-05,BLACK," You haven't used the BIS on this have you, Sam? We have done this ourselves?  Mr Chairman, I have been on the [morning] call thus far this year and I think Peter handled this exceptionally well under very difficult conditions But it necessitated his resolving these frequent doubts between the borrowed reserve target and the expected federal funds rate always, it seemed to me, on the side of the expected federal funds rate And that's how he kept the market apprised of what we really were aiming at Peter, I just wanted to ask you if you could remember a period when the relationship between the borrowed reserve level and the federal funds rate was quite as tenuous as it seems to have been [recently]  I hope there wasn't another because I know how you struggled with that  Si, one time during the week I was joking with members of the Board's staff [on the call], and Peter asked if we would mind stopping so he'd have time to get into the market It looked like we were going to delay him unduly--which was unintentional by the way!  It wouldn't appear to be as much of a giveaway program now with the banks so troubled  If you could ever sell it, this is the time you could sell it  They already have been seen coming out  -14-    2/5-6/91  I have a question to which probably everybody except me knows the answer on Chart 3  This is shown as a percent of real federal purchases What is the fiscal impetus there?  Yes, I would be interested in seeing your memo I'm sorry I was the only one who didn't understand  I was just curious I was trying to figure out what it could be and I couldn't come up with anything  They're not Persian carpets, are they?  Mr Chairman, I think the staff has done a very thorough job in putting together their economic forecast but, like so many of the other speakers, I believe that it may be a bit on the optimistic side and that the risk of error with respect to real GNP is at least moderately tilted toward the down side I think the staff is probably about right on its guess that the war may end in the spring but my fear is that it will be the late spring rather than the early spring In any event, while the war is going on there are going to be a lot of continuing uncertainties and periodic setbacks and it's going to damp both business and consumer confidence as well as sentiment in  -28-    2/5-6/91  the financial markets Now, these negative impacts are going to be amplified, I think, by three big problems the situation in the Northeast; the perceived fragility in the banking system; and the extreme weakness in commercial real estate in substantial parts of the country So, we think there's a significant chance that the economy will recover later and probably less strongly than the staff is projecting Our guess would be that the recovery might begin in the third quarter rather than in the second And we expect only about 1 percent growth in real GNP on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis, which does not put us comfortably within the central tendency, as Si was, but labels us as an outlier in that the staff is predicting about 2 percent growth over this period We also are an outlier on the inflation side because we're more optimistic about inflation under the assumption that we can avoid a long and destructive war in the Gulf In addition to the effects of the declining oil prices on the CPI, we think that the underlying trend rate of inflation is going to begin to respond in '91 to the considerable deceleration that we've had in the growth of the aggregates over the last several years I think it's quite possible that our core inflation rate for the CPI may be down to around 3-1/2 percent or lower by the end of the year  Mr Chairman, I would agree that alternative B is the best We have just taken a fairly significant, strong, and dramatic policy action and any further move now would appear to me to be sending the signal that we had pushed the panic button The staff may be right in saying that we won't have to ease further in this cycle I certainly hope that that's true because it's in that area and the failure to tighten up promptly that we've usually made our mistakes But in my own forecast I see it somewhat weaker than the staff does So, I think it's possible that we may have to do a bit more [easing] before we start upward, though I hope not But because of that possibility, I would go with your asymmetric directive tilted toward ease Lest anyone think that a hawk has become a dove, I think I will be among those who will argue the strongest quite early for an increase in the federal funds rate, if the economy does turn around  Yes I was just going to say that I have a lot of sympathy for what Tom said I think that reserve measures can be refined, though There are several things that are reservable that are not part of M2 The whole [reserve structure] is set up with the idea of controlling M1 but we know ahead of time, because requirements against interbank deposits and government deposits are lagged, what volume of reserves we need for that And we could put those in at the beginning of the period Those against the M2 portion are not lagged quite as much So anything we put out over and above that, which would be something of a refined measure of total reserves, would be available for supporting M2 and nothing else I think we could get to something like that Another thing I'd like to see us do is to try to make some estimates of the amount of currency that is going abroad because that [outflow means the] currency component is badly distorted and if we think that's part of our domestic money supply, we're being badly mislead But I really think the rate of growth in the aggregates is demand-determined now, and I think as Tom does that it ought to be supply-determined to some degree and that's not easy because of the reserve structure we have Also, I think financial innovation would create a number of instruments that would not be reservable; indeed, a lot of them in M2 are not reservable now But I think we can get something better by moving in general in that direction And I would support--  I agree with what Governor Angell suggested I'd also like to move monetary aggregates up [in the list] I'd rather have them before trends in economic activity, but that's raising an issue I don't think you want to get into "
4306,1991-03-26,BLACK," Mr Chairman, I agree completely with your point about federal funds targeting I've felt for a long time that we needed to find something else, preferably some kind of reserve measure, but that's not all that easy with a lot of the parts of M2  -2-    3/26/91  not reserveable and with the proclivity of the financial markets for innovating if we did slap reserve requirements on those But I think we need to move in that direction, and we probably need a little more consultation than we've had The problem I had with the memo was that I didn't think the authors necessarily were suggesting more consultation I think you've been unusually good in calling us together, but there have been one or two instances when I wished we had gotten together and we didn't--the change in the discount rate right before the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting, for example One of my colleagues called and said ""You know, you've just been disenfranchised on your vote"" Well, I happened to agree with that move; we were one of the Reserve Banks that had sent in [a request to lower the discount rate], and I didn't really feel disenfranchised But he felt very strongly that that [action] had precluded the FOMC from determining the federal funds rate, which he thought was the province of the FOMC And I can understand that argument So, I would opt for slightly more consultation, but I think you've been better than anyone else has ever been in providing that  I think there probably would be a preference for unwinding the warehousing first, too, Mr Chairman  We might be able to couple that with opposition to letting the FDIC borrow $25 million from us and get a credit--  That wasn't really what I had in mind, but that's an interesting fallout  I bet it would too I was just thinking about the monetary policy accord in the early '50s We need a credit accord too, where they don't try to dictate the composition of our assets, which is what the FDIC maneuver does and what this warehousing does  Yes, I didn't mean to get ahead of you  Mr Chairman, we've moved in a slightly different direction from Bob Forrestal in that we think the near-term outlook has improved significantly since the February meeting Back then we were expecting the recession to last through most, if not all, of the second quarter, and we felt that the risk of error in the Board staff's projection was clearly on the down side We now agree with the staff that the economy is likely to turn back up in the second  -25-    3/26/91  quarter and we think the bulk of the risk has now shifted to the up side, particularly in the second and third quarters, although obviously there is still some risk that we could have more down side weakness than we see For example, exports might not do as well as we are thinking  The main reasons why we feel a little more bullish are what you might expect One has been this decidedly improved level of confidence on the part of businesses and consumers that followed the ending of the war The second is that we've had this flurry of scattered statistics that suggest some little intensification of activity And the third is that the grass roots information that we're picking up around our District is decidedly better than what we saw at the time of our last meeting And the improvement appears to be more than what could be accounted for by the normal seasonal things, which is something that businessmen have difficulty distinguishing when they're reporting on whether business conditions have improved For example, at our last board meeting I saw what was the most abrupt change in the attitude of our directors between two meetings that I've seen at any time since I've been with the System They were practically all on the positive side The one exception was our director who had been on the positive side before and he has moved to the negative side now But seems to move in a different direction from everybody else on a lot of issues And then the last but by no means the least reason we're more optimistic is the pickup in growth of M2 It seems to be responding to our earlier easing actions and, as Mike Prell indicated, that doesn't guarantee a strong recovery but it certainly does enhance the possibility that that is what we'll get  On the price side, we were particularly glad to see that the staff has lowered its forecast of inflation somewhat over the period ahead We're still generally optimistic that long-term inflationary pressures are going to move in the right direction as a result of what I think has been a very wise monetary policy over a period of several years now I think we're going to hit pay dirt on that one But I am disturbed, of course, by the rapid run-up in both the consumer price index and the producer price index even after allowing for the known special factors I'd be even more concerned about that if the recent growth in the aggregates doesn't slow somewhat in the near future from its pace in the last couple of months  Mr Chairman, several months ago we sat around this table as we eased policy and reminded ourselves--and several people participated in this--that we had better be ready when the time came to avoid the mistake that we usually have made in the past in not tightening soon enough I was prepared to deliver that same talk again and also to throw in a caveat that we ought not pay much attention to our favorite economic indicator, the level of employment You made essentially the same talk and made all the points I thought were pertinent So, I very much agree with you that we ought to stay with ""B"" with a symmetrical directive I also agree that if we move in either direction, it would be desirable to meet and talk about it  -43-    3/26/91  Si is the first fellow who has ever had a hired gun to speak for him at a meeting!  It would be ""somewhat"" still? "
4330,1991-04-12,BLACK," Mr Chairman, this is Bob Black What did M2 do earlier this month? Do we have an estimate for April?  This is Bob Black again I think Ed Boehne has made an excellent speech and I would join him on the discount rate "
4347,1991-04-30,BLACK," Mr Chairman, our Bank has not moved yet on the discount rate I suppose we can do it all from here through one of our colleagues who is back at home But is there any urgency to get it done today?    4/30/91 "
4362,1991-05-14,BLACK," Mr Chairman, I think the staff's downward revision in their projection of real GNP for the second quarter makes sense in light of the incoming information More generally, the overall profile that they've predicted for the next three or four quarters strikes us as eminently reasonable given the staff's policy assumptions, the behavior of most of the leading indicators, and the pattern of recent anecdotal information It's interesting to me how close the projections of the staff are to those of the private economy Mike suggested theirs were a bit stronger, but it seems to me they are remarkably close, which is something that many people might view with alarm given the record of forecasters in the past I might be one of those except that I believe they're about right on this And I believe that the risk of error is about equal on the up side and on the down side I guess the most important question we ought to ask ourselves is How great is the risk that we will have a big error on the down side? In other words, how likely is it that we will get a significantly greater decline in the current quarter than the staff expects and that this will be followed perhaps by a greater decline in the third quarter? Obviously, we can't rule that out entirely; but in the absence of some totally unlikely, unexpected negative supply shocks such as we had last August, the probability of that kind of decline seems to me to be pretty low We've already taken out a lot of insurance to prevent such a thing happening, with the cumulative policy actions over the last six months or so And beyond that, we're now seeing new signs of life in residential construction, strength in the stock market and some of the other leading indicators, and a recent upturn in the National Association of Purchasing Managers' index, which was higher in April than it was in the lowest quarter trough of any previous full economic upturn  So, those all suggest to me that we are probably now very near the bottom of a recession Whether it's going to be longer or whether it's a near trough, I don't know But it seems to me that a significant further weakening is decidedly unlikely I was particularly glad to see that the staff has reduced its inflation forecast because I have felt for some time that we had followed a very wise policy [course of] action and that it would pay off in terms of inflation numbers The staff has cut a couple of notches off the inflation projections for both this year and next year and they're now predicting a core rate of inflation of about 3 percent at the end of 1992 And I think we ought to have at least that degree of progress against inflation But it is important that we keep in mind what the staff has assumed when it made these projections, and that is that we'll come very close to achieving the midpoint of our target range for M2 I think it's critically important that we take whatever steps are required to keep M2 somewhat in that range in case the recovery and consequently the money demand turns out to be somewhat stronger than it now appears to us that it might be  This is in the Bluebook, Norm? "
4401,1991-07-02,BLACK," Except they had it a point too high!  My term will be up; I sure would like to know now  -11-    7/2-3/91  SPEAKER(?) We'll send you a postcard!  Mr Chairman, I hate to say this because it may be a source of worry and concern for the staff, but our projection for '91 is almost exactly what you all have So, you may want to go back and check yours! As I read the Greenbook, adjusting for the swings in the overseas earnings of oil companies, it's pretty clear that the [recession] must have hit bottom in the second quarter That's a reasonable conclusion based on what we know about the April and May  -12-    7/2-3/91  figures and the little we know about the June figures Whatever the final record does show, I don't think the bottom will come any later than July in view of this evidence we have of increased consumer spending and strength in residential construction In any case, I think that the staff's 1991 projections are very plausible and that the risks of error are about equal on both sides for both real GNP and inflation  When we get to '92, however, we differ right much We are much more optimistic on both the growth side and on the inflation side We're projecting about 1/2 percentage point more growth in real GNP and we're forecasting only a 3 percent rise in the CPI, which is about 3/4 of a point lower than the Greenbook and well below most other forecasts that we've seen Now, I need to emphasize something that we have already alluded to earlier, and that is that our staff's 1992 projections are based, in accordance with our instructions, on what we would regard as an appropriate monetary policy in the next six quarters So, what we've done is to assume that M2 will come in slightly above the midpoint of its current range this year and that the FOMC will lower the range for 1992 to 2 to 6 percent and will hold the actual growth of money within that range This assumption of a lower target range for 1992 has a direct bearing on our projection since we believe, given the background of very favorable behavior in the money supply over the last few years, that reducing the range further would increase significantly the credibility of our anti- inflationary strategy and, consequently, would result in a more favorable division of nominal GNP between real growth and inflation-- because of [how we factor in] forward-looking expectations, Lee And without that strategy [unintelligible] If we achieve what we think are these highly plausible results, then we think the prospects of the subsequent years after 1992 will be very bright indeed I think we have a real opportunity here to make significant progress--the best we've had since I've been around  You left too soon!  Mr Chairman, I've never disagreed with you before, much to my pleasure, and I certainly agree with your comments that the baseline growth rate for M2 is much too high and that strategy II is near what we ought to be aiming for I even went so  -35-    7/2-3/91  far as to say one time to a reporter, facetiously, that much to my dismay I was tempted to just give you my proxy and go play golf And you, on another occasion, said you were going to hold me to that! I will try to cover my tracks by saying that I suppose at some point inevitably we're all going to differ  So, I'm with you on the first two-thirds but [not] when we get down to the discussion of the ranges I recognize that long-run alternative II, which means extending the '91 ranges to '92, could encompass strategy II--an idea that we both endorse But as the Bluebook points out on the bottom of page 19, long-run alternative III, which lowers all the ranges 1/2 percentage point is ""more consistent with the spirit and intent"" of our anti-inflationary strategy And that would provide fresh evidence of our commitment to the very things that Governor Angell has just described very well I think that is a very important point, as he emphasized As I said yesterday and as he said much better today, we are at a very crucial point; we've had remarkable success up to this point and many forecasters are now beginning to lower their projections of inflation in part because they think the economy is not really going to spurt as much as it has in past recoveries But I think a large part of that is due to the growing credibility that we have gained because we have had this remarkable record over the last several years I think leaving these ranges unchanged in '92 would raise some doubts and possibly slow, if not break, the momentum that we've gained thus far But lowering them would reinforce our credibility and I think would reduce the transitional costs of achieving price stability Consequently, I very strongly favor alternative III I recognize that M2 growth may well be in the upper part of that range next year if we adopt that alternative, but that strikes me as a pretty manageable problem that we could afford to take on in view of the benefits that I think we would get from the credibility standpoint by lowering our ranges And if, as Governor Angell postulated, we had to raise them, I share his confidence that you could explain that very well We really have a golden opportunity here that we haven't had until now, and I think we have to seize it Although there are many reasons why I could argue that we ought to temporize, I'm afraid that I just have to come out for alternative III  Show the kind of restraint that Governor Angell and I showed!  I'll second that, Mr Chairman  I would strongly support that suggestion I've been urging my colleagues in Richmond to do just that, but they have  -45-    7/2-3/91  been resisting because they don't really think it can be done And it is difficult, unless we're saying that the reserveable part of M2 is going to grow at the same rate as the nonreserveable part If we paid interest on reserve balances, it would make that more likely But having to reach up in the air and pick some federal funds rate that's going to give some predictable rate of growth in the money supply is just a crap shoot at best I'd really like to move toward some kind of reserve targeting if it can be done But it might necessitate a complete change in the reserve requirement regime to do it successfully  Don, is there anything that suggests--other than what your material contains--that the small time and savings deposits might be moving into bond and stock funds?  Would I be justified in being less concerned about the weakness in June because of where this money has gone?  I come out, I think, about where you do It gives me some comfort knowing where they've gone; otherwise I'd be concerned that M2 has been too weak  I agree with ""B"" symmetric, Mr Chairman I would like to suggest that we consider moving the ""monetary aggregates"" phrase up to either first or second place, though I'm a little concerned by the weakness we've had, but I think there's a good explanation for it So, I think Governor Angell is right; we have not been too tight But at some point the aggregates may give us a little more accurate information and I'd like to pay more attention to them  That's fine "
4423,1991-08-05,BLACK," Mr Chairman, Bob Black I would be very near where Lee is if it were not that I think Don's explanation of these portfolio shifts has a lot to do with the kind of behavior we've had in M2 For example, over the last six months, if you exclude small time deposits, M2 has grown at a rate of 98 percent; in the last three months it has grown at a rate of 72 percent Now, if it continues as weak as it looks for July and August, then I think we're going to have to do something to try to get it moving again I do think one could raise a legitimate question as to whether lowering the federal funds rate really would do that, because of the tendency to force more funds from small time deposits into the mutual bond funds But, anyway, I will be very concerned if [the weakness] continues much longer I'm almost concerned at this point that it has gone too far  As far as the real economy is concerned, I agree with the others that [the recovery] is sort of lagging, although it never looks very good near the bottom of a recession But this one, it seems to me, is showing a little more weakness than I can remember having seen in similar upturns in the past "
4443,1991-08-20,BLACK," So move  Mr Chairman, I'm glad you gave us a chance to take a look at this I don't think it would surprise anyone who has listened to what I've said that I would favor such a study And now, like Governor Angell, I don't know where the answer would lead; and Al Broaddus certainly doesn't know exactly where it would lead But I've never really been comfortable trying to control the aggregates by manipulating the federal funds rate because I think the demand for money for any given level of income in the short run fluctuates too much to do that I have some sympathy for those alternatives that have a degree of automatism But I remember that when we had the procedures in 1979-82 and we were supposed to adjust the level of borrowed reserves by half the amount of any miss in the aggregates, about two-thirds of the moves we made were also discretionary So, I'm not under any illusions that we're really about to put [policy] on automatic pilot But a lot of things have come along in the way of studies on this since we last looked at it All I would advocate is that we use the System's considerable research resources to examine this question because I think all of us feel some dissatisfaction with the way we do it But I don't believe there's anybody here who really feels that he knows the answers as to exactly how it ought to be done    8/20/91  It was simple in my mind when we wanted to control Ml; but it's not simple when we're trying to control M2 and only a small fraction of M2 is reservable And we're not paying interest on required reserves, and that encourages further innovations So, where this will lead, I don't know I suspect we probably won't get far from where we are, but we ought to take a good hard look at it And I think Don and Dave have done us a good service in providing us these various alternatives  One of the big reasons reserve targeting has been opposed in the past has been the feeling that it would cause more fluctuations in short-term interest rates And as Al indicates in his letter, there is some evidence now that that might not be the case for long-term rates That could be an important factor, I think    8/20/91  It's awfully hard, even if you know what you want to accomplish, to pick the [appropriate] fed funds rate  You'd be surprised as to what the aggregates are doing with that particular fed funds rate, which we thought would be something very different  And therein lies our frustration, I think  Well, I think Governor Kelley has done us a real service in pointing these things out I've been uncomfortable for a long time with the way we've handled this thing And even though we ourselves don't pay much attention to this, the Fed watchers do pay a lot of attention to it and they think it's an indication of our practice More importantly, if we do change them, they think that means we've changed our emphasis So, if we continue doing that, there's a strong argument for doing what is almost the unthinkable, as you and Jerry have pointed out, of debating this and maybe reaching an impasse at every meeting So, I've concluded that what I think you are all moving toward is that we should eliminate this language and take another route Changing this list, even infrequently, tends to promote the perception already held by many that we are constantly changing our objectives and we're trading off one objective against the other And I don't think considering the list at each meeting would add anything to our policy deliberations; that could hamper us,  -13-    8/20/91  as Don pointed out, and you and Jerry also have mentioned So, my preference would be to adopt what is Governor Kelley's point 3 and Don's example under 4 Don gives three examples and I like the one labeled 4b, which is at the bottom of page 3 in his memo, because it puts long-run price stability at the head of the list And needless to say, I'd want to retain the reference to the aggregates because right now I think that is the best route to get to long-term price stability, although our views may change as a result of this study we talked about earlier But adherence to that approach doesn't necessarily bind us to that every time If we have a particular situation like we have now, with extreme weakness in the aggregates for some unexplainable reason, or like the stock market crash in October of 1987, then we could certainly change it But I would like to start off with saying something about price stability As Don pointed out, there is such a reference in the previous paragraph, but I don't think it would hurt to put it at the beginning of the operational paragraph too and make it a generic reference I would very much favor doing that  I think this point bears on the one that you raised earlier about our not thinking of a change in the federal funds rate as a change in policy and yet the market, or most of the market, does If we had this overall summary statement as in Don's example 4b on page 3 ""In the context of the Committee's long-run  -15-    8/20/91  objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, somewhat greater reserve restraint"" then we can go into these things But we have said that that is in our judgment compatible with our long-run objective and I think it would reduce the tendency of the public to think of that as a change in policy when it really isn't That's one of the main reasons I lean toward a reserve base measure because if we had that, we could have interest rates go this way or that way and we wouldn't have any better idea as to which way they would go than anybody else I don't know if they would tend to be interpreted that way, but it is just the natural fallout of trying to seek a long-run objective; it may involve lower rates or it may involve higher rates, and that can change all over the place from time to time  Mr Chairman, we're very, very close to the staff, as we usually are, and maybe even closer this time than ordinarily We'd be very happy if we got the outcome that they think is most likely, but from the standpoint of policy the relevant question is where the risks lie I think the staff concludes as we do that the risks probably are on the down side, when you think about the insurance problems--and now we have the casualty insurance companies hit by hurricane Bob--the so-called credit crunch, and the weakness in the aggregates We ought to keep in mind some other things, too There's always doubt when you're in a recession as to what it is that's going to take you out of it I remember that in every single one we've had Mike just enumerated three major factors that had caused the staff to think that maybe this forecast ought to be revised slightly upward the behavior of consumer expenditures, residential construction, and net exports The thing that worries us most of all, I think, is the behavior of payroll unemployment and employment We went back and looked at the behavior of this for all the postwar upturns in the first three months following a trough If you look at that and compare the first estimate that we have now for the last month, it really doesn't look very different from what we've had in the other postwar upturns except in one case So, this may not be quite as alarming as it looks on the surface With these things in mind, I don't think it's time yet to push the panic button But I think we have to be very, very alert to the risk to the near-term outlook that is being posed by the behavior of the aggregates since we simply can't explain by econometric models or otherwise all of this weakness that we've seen in them And that makes me worry somewhat that monetary policy could have been tighter than we really meant it to be  I want to be a spectator, not a participant  Mr Chairman, in most cases I would agree with Lee, but I think there are some special factors at work here So, I would buy all three of your recommendations--""B,"" asymmetry toward ease, and version II  Celebration?  END OF MEETING  -42-     "
4479,1991-10-01,BLACK," Well, I think getting a hand on the true state of the economy and its near-term prospects is about as difficult this time as it has been at any time I've ever been involved in it, and I've been doing this longer than I would like to remember Much of the anecdotal information that we've been getting lately has been negative and discouraging Of course, there is some positive news-- especially in the manufacturing area--and similarly the statistics are pretty mixed But despite all that conflicting information, I think the staff has made a particularly strong case for the kind of moderate growth that they're projecting here And I think it's important to bear in mind that this is just a moderate [recovery] and not in any sense a strong one Real GNP, for example, is expected to grow at only slightly above what most people assume to be the long-run economic potential So, if this is all that happens, this recovery is definitely going to be on the slow end of those that we've had in the postwar period Our guess is that the downside risk on the forecast, while somewhat greater than the upside risk, is not as much greater as most people appear to think today We're all aware of the downside risk presented by such things as the weakness in M2, apparently continuing restraint on credit supplies to some industries and in some geographical areas, the fiscal restraint in the federal and the state and local government [sectors], and the heavy overhang of commercial real estate throughout the country But balancing all these negatives, at least to some extent, are strong increases in the leading indicators of manufacturing activity, an apparent reduction in the underlying inflationary pressures--although Mike did explain very clearly that that's not an unambiguous signal--and the substantial reductions that we in the Federal Reserve have effected on short-term and long-term rates  -10-    10/1/91  The one aspect of this recovery that does appear to be clear to me, really, is that we have made substantial progress toward reducing inflation or the underlying trend rate of inflation The staff's projection of about a 3-1/2 percent rate by late next year in the context of continued moderate real growth seems pretty reasonable to us And if we can get 3-1/2 percent next year and then maybe 2-1/2 percent in 1993, then I think we will be closing in on what is effectively price stability Now, I'm certainly aware of the risk that excessive monetary restraint could damage the economy and its apparently precarious position and that we could make it more difficult, if not impossible, to achieve sustained price stability So, we definitely want to exercise a degree of caution But at the same time I think it's important that we not be too cautious We clearly have some momentum in reducing the inflation rate now; our credibility is growing and that will not only increase our chances of attaining our goal but will also reduce the cost of attaining it  It's ""B""  -29-    10/1/91  Mr Chairman, I come out right where you do but I really do feel a great loss in seeing M2 lose its meaning I feel almost like a baby who has lost his pacifier! [Laughter]  It took a while! "
4501,1991-10-30,BLACK," Bob Black, Mr Chairman I don't remember a time in the postwar period when I felt that the confidence of our business people was as sour or as bad as it is right now We hear it from our directors; they are quite unhappy If you look at the report on the Conference Board's confidence survey on the second page of The Wall Street Journal this morning, several [unintelligible] coincident indicators rather than leading indicators It's also helpful to bear in mind that we are just at the beginning of a recovery and people are always rather pessimistic about it I do think the recovery is still continuing I'm impressed by the strength in Ml If you take small time deposits out of M2, M2 less time deposits has grown at a rate of 73 percent from the fourth quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year; and in October that measure was up at a rate of 79 percent If we were to cut the federal funds rate, I don't know what it would do to M2; probably very little But at the same time we can ill afford to ignore this deterioration in confidence and I think we ought to make a move just to try to turn that around even if we see an adverse effect on M2 over the long term So, I would favor 25 basis points [on the funds rate] today, and then I'd take a look at the figures we are going to get on Friday--the employment report and the report of the National Association of Purchasing Managers And then Tuesday we might, as you said, consider doing more But I would limit it right now to only 25 basis points We ought to do that just to try to stop this erosion of confidence that seems so [evident] to me "
4520,1991-11-05,BLACK," It seems obvious to us that in our District people now think everything is pessimistic; whether they're consumers or business people, [they have] very low expectations A particularly striking [example] came at our last meeting, which was a joint meeting of our Baltimore/Richmond boards, when I heard the most pessimistic statements of the economic conditions I think I've heard in the 36 years or so that I've been attending these meetings And virtually all the reports we've gotten since then have been along that line  From what I read and what I've heard around the table, it's pretty clear that for the most part that pessimism is equally widespread in the rest of the country and may be even more widespread in certain places And then we got--to use Mike's term from a while ago--""a stunning confirmation"" of this when we received this downward revision in the Conference Board consumer confidence series But having said all this, I think the question we have to answer this morning is Exactly what does this mean in terms of the near-term prospects for the economy? I certainly think it tells us something namely, that the recovery has been weaker up until now and probably will be weaker in the immediate future than any of us thought it was going to be The current quarter and probably the first quarter are certainly going to reflect this So, the downward revisions in the Board staff's figures are clearly indicated But I think it would be premature at this point to conclude that this apparently declining  -16-    11/5/91  confidence means that the economy is necessarily going to go into a double-dip recession as some people have been assuming Sentiment frequently remains bearish in the early stages of an economic upturn, and it's clearly even gloomier than usual this time if I remember correctly I think the media has added a lot to this because there has been so much more hype on this than in the past  Now, I know there are differences of opinion about what these consumer surveys show, but three studies done by different Federal Reserve Banks have suggested that they are not really very good predictors I would say they probably are a coincident indicator at best So, while we have this October drop in the survey of the Conference Board and this obvious pessimism in the form of anecdotal information, I'm not ready to push the panic button at this point Some of the recent data are a bit on the favorable side at least We had some upward revision in the payroll employment figures for August and September and the M2 numbers have turned around--not as much as I would like, but they've certainly turned around recently And the orders and production components of the National Association of Purchasing Managers [survey] in October were generally favorable So, I think the staff's revised forecast is reasonable And the risks on their projection are probably equally divided, although like Gary Stern--who I believe is the only other one who said this--I think they might even be tilted a little toward the up side So, we ought to approach this policy issue today very cautiously before we make any kind of major move toward ease  Would that be on Friday?  On the federal funds rate?  Mr Chairman, I'd like to suggest a compromise, which I guess would be controversial, though  Mr Chairman, there's another complication A number of us have meetings of our executive committees or full boards on Thursday and we'll be addressing the question of the discount rate And if we know that we're going to cut the federal funds rate 1/4 point on Friday, we can't tell the directors yet They don't have the  -37-    11/5/91  information they need to make a rational decision So, there's another reason for doing it now rather than then, although I have a lot of sympathy for what Peter and his associates have been saying  Sure, I can; but I have knowledge that they don't have that I can't share with them  And I wouldn't--  Well, it is [a concern] to me not to share information and give them my best judgment, which would have to be affected by the knowledge that we were going to cut [the funds rate] 1/4 point the next day We're pretty free with our directors but we never tell them anything about what we're going to do or anything about what we just did that isn't released, and we never will So we couldn't possibly tell them that this 1/4 point [reduction] was pending And yet I think their attitude would be affected to some significant extent by that if they knew  If you hadn't talked so long, maybe we could have! [Laughter]  I know I'm being facetious  Could I ask Peter one question, Mr Chairman? Peter, if we went in before the normal time, which you could and sometimes do, would that alleviate to any extent the problem that you alluded to originally?  I'd favor doing it in the morning, first thing  No, I was thinking about going ahead and doing it through the market tomorrow as soon as the market opens  That's what I think I'd do  No, nor 1130 am "
4542,1991-12-02,BLACK," Mr Chairman, Bob Black As you will see when you get our section of the Beigebook, things here in the Fifth    12/2/91  District look about like everybody else has described But there is a thread of optimism about what lies ahead six months or so down the road, and this is something we have not seen until recently We were extremely pessimistic--the most pessimistic I can remember in the postwar period But there does seem to be a bit of a change that was a surprise It was a welcome change "
4562,1991-12-17,BLACK," Mr Chairman, there may be some people who still entertain doubts that Governor Lindsey is actually from the Fifth District, but he is wearing the Thomas Jefferson tie If you can arrange it, I think it would be good if you would call Terry Sandford and tell him you'd like him to come over and meet him; he would recognize the tie!  Mr Chairman, I think Governor Kelley has done us a real service in bringing this question up, and I would strongly support his recommendation seconded by you I'm particularly pleased that he listed price stability and then sustainable economic growth, since I feel so strongly that that is the route by which we reach sustainable economic growth So, I really like the order of those  Well, there were some others too--you included, I think  It will shorten the meetings; that's another advantage of it I wish I had thought to mention that!  What kind of insect is that white fly?  Mr Chairman, I think it's a very difficult time to forecast Of course, it's always hard but it is particularly difficult now Looking back, the vast majority of forecasts--and that certainly includes our forecast--underestimated the strength of the negative forces that are apparently working in the economy But I guess by now we really should realize that some of this restructuring and downsizing that we've seen in a lot of different industries will not only eliminate existing jobs--forever probably--but will also raise a lot of doubts in the minds of others about their job security, with predictable effects on consumer and business confidence I think we've all been aware that there are some important structural changes taking place in the economy, but we underestimated the extent to which they were restraining consumer income and spending And, of course, in this highly uncertain environment, the disinflation process is making it increasingly difficult for businesses to pass on any increase in prices The firms are naturally very reluctant to hire and are cautious about inventory management, not to mention capital expenditures This caution really augurs well for the long run because I think we're going to emerge with a much more competitive society than we had before But certainly in the short run it has some implications for the level of business activity and I think it's going to retard the recovery beyond what we had thought earlier  When you think about the structural changes and couple those with some cyclical changes occurring on top of them, it makes it very difficult to predict how strong and how persistent these restraining forces are going to be and to what extent they're going to be offset by the lagged effects of the considerable easing in monetary policy  -12-    12/17/91  we've done over a period of a number of months The Greenbook projections of the real economy strike us as reasonable and quite plausible, given what we now know We do think the staff might be a little high in their projections of inflation, although those are certainly reasonable But I believe the inflation outcome in [1992] is going to be a tad better than projected in the Greenbook if we can maintain the System's credibility about our long-term objectives That last point is a very crucial one as we move into this policy- setting process today Another measured step toward ease of the sort we've been taking for some time is probably appropriate now, but I think any more aggressive move would be quite counterproductive at this point  Don, I have been one of those who thought that M2 was flashing wrong signals I even went so far as to say in one of my more frivolous moments that it was as if I were experiencing colic like a baby who has lost his pacifier But looking at it now, as Governor Mullins indicated earlier, it might not have been flashing all the wrong signals What has happened has been along the lines of what you would have expected, taking it at face value  I think that's a much better answer than the one I suggested earlier You had warned us that there might not be [unintelligible]  Mr Chairman, I always feel very uncomfortable when I disagree with Tom Melzer, and I'm partly with him because I think we've done almost enough But if we adopt your proposal of moving [the funds rate] 1/4 point--and I would add a gratuitous bit of advice to the Board of Governors that they couple that with a 1/2 point cut in the discount rate--I think, and hope, that the market probably would conclude on its own that we've gone as far as we are going to go And some people will come out of the woodwork when they think rates have gone as low as they're going to go  I would be a little more leery of taking that second step because I think a 1/2 point move on the funds rate, even if it's done later on, might look surprisingly close to these ridiculous suggestions we've been getting with regard to fiscal policy I basically buy what you have suggested, but I share some of Tom's nervousness that we're almost there  I didn't hear it that way I'm sorry  When you invoke the proviso, if you have to, you would go 1/4 point and that's all?  I guess I'm the only one who is confused!  No, it's my fault "
4598,1992-02-04,BLACK," Mr Chairman, I don't have much to add to this very excellent presentation the staff gave us and the fine coverage in the Greenbook Our projections really are not significantly different We do expect a little more real growth and a little greater slowing in the rate of inflation But the broad profile is pretty much the same, with some pickup in the rate of increase of the recovery in the second quarter--but only to a very moderate rate in comparison with what has happened in past recoveries--and continued deceleration in core inflation, even though we are projecting that the overall CPI will come in a tad higher this year than it did last year Insofar as the risks of error are concerned, I guess a carefully reasoned analysis would say that they are about equal on both sides Certainly, there are some downside risks the heavy overhang of commercial real estate; the corporate restructuring; the balance sheet adjustments that are taking place; the restraint on credit Also, all these temporary dislocations that have taken place as a result of declining rates of inflation could produce another year of lower-than- expected growth  But on the other side of that, I think the substantial further easing in monetary policy we engineered in November-December could easily produce a more rapid recovery than we are expecting here, particularly if a fiscal package is enacted early in the year or relatively early in the year For what it's worth, my instinct is that the upside risk is probably a little greater than the downside risk mainly because of the actions that we took in the fourth quarter We engineered a very significant easing in policy; it has not at this point had a very positive effect upon the economy; the stock market really seems to think [it will] over the next several quarters Moreover, we're seeing a decided change in the comments that we hear from our contacts around the District There is not much hard evidence yet that things really have improved, but the outlook for the next six months or so is decidedly better than it has been over the several times we've made contacts; it's quite a shift away from what we heard [unintelligible] It always seems to me that the pessimism is the greatest right at the bottom of a recession So, since it  -14-    2/4-5/92  looks a little better now than it did a while back, I hope that means that we're beginning to come out of this a little faster than most people seem to think  I hope it doesn't get any worse than it is now It would really be bad It's the worst I've ever seen since the '30s and I don't know very much about that  You can imagine how the rest of us felt!  He may have thought you weren't up-to-date on the issues  -29-    2/4-5/92  Shall I go ahead, Mr Chairman?  I can't do what he said I would do, but actually he's given me a lot more credit for this than he should have I had put this on the back burner; I had thought about it many times earlier He surfaced the plan and sent it to me and asked for my suggestions and I made one or two suggestions, which he very graciously adopted Then he sent me another version and I made one minor suggestion on that So, the thought of giving me the credit for it is really misplaced Since he has entitled it ""The Virginia Plan,"" I wish very much that I could have Patrick Henry do the defense! There's little doubt that he and Thomas Jefferson and George Washington and George Mason would certainly have a favorite rate of growth of the money supply with the use of ""tunnels,"" if anybody had ever brought that up I do know that they would be a bit worried if they knew the ""Virginia Plan"" was being defended by somebody who was born in Kentucky My only defense there would be that Kentucky was once a part of Virginia  Yes, it was then, that's right I wish we could go back in time and I could speak at that time; but while I'm a Kentuckian by birth I'm a Virginian by choice--maybe that will give me a certain amount of credibility--and I also have two children who are native Virginians and I married a native Virginian You kind of absorb some of this as you go along  I think Governor Lindsey has already stated quite well the reasons for adopting the multi-year tunnel approach instead of the annual cones and basing this on the level of M2 at the end of 1990 originally Now, we set the data on 1991, but it comes out to the same thing Let me make three additional comments on this, mostly by way of elaboration First, the upside insurance this would give us at this particular moment is really a compelling reason The [beauty] of this tunnel is that it pretty much guarantees that we would get price stability over the long run--which I think should be the objective of monetary policy to the exclusion of all others--as long as we were willing to reduce the rate of growth in the money supply until we got it down to the rate at which the potential output of the economy could increase [over time] Now, everything we know about monetary history tells us that we can stabilize price levels if we get [money supply growth] down over time to somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 percent or so People differ on what the potential growth of the economy is, but I don't think there's any doubt that it would be greater if we had price stability than if we didn't And this is essentially the message of the P* model, which is one of the finest pieces of work I think we've done in the System I wish I'd had a hand in that, but I certainly applaud the others of you who did  -30-    2/4-5/92  I think a continuous unbroken tunnel would be a much more appropriate and powerful device for controlling the long-run rate of growth in M2 than the current cones because it would eliminate base drift And base drift has really been the bane of our existence Whatever base drift has brought us in the way of short-term flexibility in some years, in practice I think it has made it virtually impossible for us to control the long-run rate of trend growth of M2, with the result that we have [not] known and nobody else has known what the price level would be several years down the road Consequently, I've concluded that no matter how strong our intentions are to reduce inflation--and for the last several years this group has had a stronger inclination in that direction than virtually at any time in the history of the System and I don't think that intention has ever been stronger than it is right now--I don't think we will achieve that goal Despite our feelings on that and our best efforts, I don't think we will ever achieve that goal unless we do something about moving away from our present targeting procedures And I think the tunnel would address this Moreover, and I can't emphasize this point too much I think this move to a tunnel would greatly increase the credibility of the System We have said repeatedly that our intention over time is to bring down the rate of growth in the money supply to noninflationary levels This would spell that out in a great deal more detail and yet it would be clear that we would have the necessary leeway in the short run to do what needs to be done And if this did increase our credibility, it would greatly reduce the transitional cost of moving to price stability  Second--and all of this is relevant to the comments that Don put in the Bluebook under the ""tunnel option""--it's certainly true as the Bluebook suggests that we wouldn't want to adopt the tunnel option when the relationships between M2 and income and prices are going to fluctuate in the future All we really have to guide us is past experience and, historically, we know that there have been variations in the short run extending sometimes more than a year but that in the long run there has been stability in that relationship V2, by the best statistical measures that we have, has been constant and predictable over the long run Consequently, this tunnel approach makes a great deal of sense to me But the tunnel needs to be wide enough to accommodate a fair amount of these variations in V2 that we normally have over periods as long as one to several years Maybe a 4-point spread, as Governor Lindsey suggested, would be the proper amount, but it's possible that the width should be greater than that It's important to note in this regard that even a very wide tunnel would still constrain the trend growth of M2 over a long period of time sufficiently to ensure price stability  And finally, the Bluebook may be right in suggesting that a substantial further easing of policy might be needed to get M2 up to the midpoint of Governor Lindsey's tunnel But if we had a tunnel that extended our long-run trend objectives to 1993, I wouldn't feel compelled to move M2 up too rapidly from its present position near the bottom of the tunnel to the midpoint by the end of this year if it were clear that the recovery had resumed In other words, this is not a ploy for ease What I'm trying to do here is to suggest a long-run strategy that would give us the necessary flexibility in the short run So, with regard to the width of the tunnel, it might be that it would be better for us to have a 5-percentage point tunnel if we wanted to make sure right now that we accommodate what is probably a  -31-    2/4-5/92  good projection on the part of the staff, which is that 3-1/2 percent M2 growth in 1992 would be consistent with a resumption of the recovery But, again, even a fairly wide tunnel like that would be concerned with the course and control of M2 over a long period of time And that to me is the beauty of the tunnel approach  So, Mr Chairman, like Governor Lindsey, I hope the Committee will give the ""Virginia Plan"" favorable consideration I did not admit this to you, Larry, but as you were labeling this ""The Virginia Plan"" I thought to myself it really sounds more Hamiltonian than Jeffersonian And then I thought with your background from New York you could send a ""New York Plan"" But in my case, although I spent right much time in New York, the first time I went to New York I crossed on the Staten Island Ferry prior to shipping overseas at the end of World War II and I didn't even see the Statue of Liberty I was the only one who went out without seeing it and that was the main thing I was interested in seeing So, I didn't think I could defend a New York Plan, but I do think this may be a little more Hamiltonian than Jeffersonian And I hope the Committee will honor these distinguished forebears of ours who, other than an occasional glass of whiskey, probably would have liked nothing better than a slow, steady rate of growth in the money supply!  Mr Chairman, could I say something in response to that?  I don't hear anything you say that makes anything but sense, but my policy position now and I guess for the short run is that I'm going to argue that we not change the federal funds rate I don't see any reason for doing that at this point If we're concerned that [adopting the tunnel approach] would look like a tightening, then I think we could widen this tunnel, make it 5 percentage points, which would ensure that we would come within our targets And on your last point, in a sense I think you're saying that it wouldn't be so bad to disregard the cone if the money supply were to go over it; and I certainly would want to do that myself if [that began to happen] But I think that would be a bit more damaging to our credibility than if we had a tunnel [because with a tunnel] we would not be seen as disregarding our targets People think that we don't pay a lot of attention to the targets That's the only reason, really, why I want [a procedure] that we could live with and have the flexibility we need and not [unintelligible] And I think with those two changes we could do it okay  Mr Chairman, could I just say one thing in response to that, because I think Governor Angell has hit upon a very important point? When this was first done, Larry had it at 4-1/2 percent and I suggested that we cut it to 4 percent That was done and he carried the 4 percent rate on out into 1993 I would not want 4 percent in 1993; I would want to bend it down to 3-1/2 percent or something of that sort There's a sentence in the letter that he sent me in which it appeared, if someone read it carelessly, that he might be committing himself to 4 percent forever; I don't think that was his intention So, I suggested that we make it appear that we want to bend it down What surprised you is not the way I had suggested So, I'm really where you thought I would be; it's just that we didn't end up changing that particular thing  I would say if [the reason for such growth] is purely technical, it would be permissible to go outside I have not been as disturbed about the low rate of growth in money we've had recently as I would have been had I not felt that there were explanations for it If we have good reasons for why it's growing unusually fast, I think we should state those to the public and use them as justification for staying outside [the tunnel] but say, that if we get into a more normal pattern of money growth, we will definitely get [money growth] back into the [tunnel]  But no matter what form we select, we're always going to have serious doubts about how much we need to move the federal funds rate  We're never going to know the answer to that!  Well, that's the really difficult issue and the reason I wish we could develop some other control mechanism, but I'll be darned if I know what else we can do Most of M2 is not reservable and, given the market's proclivity for designing new instruments that would avoid any reserve requirements we put on existing instruments-- if indeed we did--unless we paid interest rates on the reserves, which is a political problem That would certainly make it legally controllable  Mr Chairman, the one time I dissented on anything since you've been here was when we established the tentative ranges in July of last year But we missed so badly because of base drift, by virtue of this faulty procedure we use, that I think it would be a mistake to do anything other than alternative I So, to show my graciousness, I would argue that we ought to stick with alternative I  I guess it's a Boston thing!  I agree with you, Mr Chairman I might point out that Friday we will get the unemployment report and if we get a surprise on that on the down side you could, of course, schedule a conference call to decide what to do and where to go from there "
4623,1992-03-11,BLACK," Mr Chairman, this is Bob Black I would also [be cautious about] overpredicting either the timing or the strength of the recovery very accurately, to a large extent because of all the structural changes superimposed upon cyclical factors On the side of conventional wisdom, this quarter [unintelligible] and we ought to do better next quarter  As far as the District is concerned, we have not gotten anything that statistically supports that rebound [unintelligible] [There seems to be an] improved outlook on the part of the retailers, manufacturers, and most every other respondent in our survey So, I think the expectations are better One main fear that seems to be cropping up in a lot of people's minds is what is happening to the long end of the yield curve I'm not sure I understand [why it is happening]; I don't know if anybody does But the [long end of the yield curve] does bother me and I think, along with a lot of other people in this part of the country, it has made clear that the markets feel that [the progress on] the price level may weaken somewhat or that at least for the time being we're not paying as much attention to it as we were earlier So, we are rather cautious about the outlook for the economy "
4648,1992-03-31,BLACK," Mr Chairman, I think Peter has done an excellent job of outlining the history of this for us and he has made an excellent case for a high degree of liquidity That has been needed in part because we have had to offset reserves supplied through the discount window and also through foreign exchange operations The only point I would make is that a lot of us have reservations about how much we ought to deal in the foreign exchange market The changes in the discount mechanism and the law that was passed last year suggested that we lessen our emergency lending through the discount    3/31/92  window So, I think this gives us a little more opportunity after we've sopped up the reserves released by the reduction in reserve requirements and through the ""encouragement at the margin""--I believe that's the term you used, Peter--toward getting longer-term securities If there is some premium on those rates, this could help to reduce that premium to some extent, although I don't really buy that argument to any great degree I think we have a little better case now for intervening than we did before but it's only a marginal case, and I don't feel very strongly about it We also would earn a little more from the Treasury if we did more, but who can tell? Maybe, we'd need more liquidity and a further reduction in the reserve requirements It was a good paper; I thought it was very, very good  Mr Chairman, there has been a marked change in the degree of optimism in our area, which seems to be very similar to what is happening in the rest of the country For example, in our recent regular survey of retailers and manufacturers for the Beigebook, we found more signs of optimism, both nationally and locally, than we had at any time since 1989 Contacts with our directors and others since then have pretty well verified that sort of sentiment And we are seeing in the actual figures some pickup in physical activity For example, new home sales and residential construction are rising pretty much across the District; and sales and production in industries related to housing--like furniture, textiles, and homebuilding products--are also picking up in strength At our last meeting, one of our most astute directors said he sees absolutely nobody who thinks the recession is not over The way he put it, the only question in people's minds is what the strength of the recovery will be  So, against that kind of regional background, and taking account of the latest information that we have gotten on a national basis, I think the staff was justified in making the upward revision in the forecast that it did The overall profile of the Greenbook is quite close to what we would expect The key question is where the risk of error lies And on this we come out a little differently from some of the others who have spoken in that we think the risk of error is on the high side even after these upward revisions in the forecast are taken into account That is because we continue to believe that the easing we put into effect in November and December was pretty strong medicine and that its full potential impacts have not yet shown up and probably are not captured fully in the Greenbook and other forecasts But we have less confidence in that now than we did because of the weakening in the behavior of M2 in March One of our economists did a simulation that suggested the widespread uncertainty about jobs probably was reducing consumption by maybe 2-1/2 percent from what it otherwise would be It's really an interesting study; it's econometric but nevertheless pretty revealing, and it sort of verifies what everybody assumed was happening  I'm happy to see that the staff still expects that the disinflation trend will continue and that inflation can be brought down somewhere below 3 percent by the second half of this year As the Greenbook notes, this projection is pretty much at odds with most of the current market expectations It's also at odds with most of the forecasts that we've seen, which call for an early increase in inflationary pressures as the economy improves But the difference between the staff forecast and these other forecasts now is that we can make ours happen if we play our cards right! And I'm increasingly confident that we will  Mr Chairman, I came prepared to argue for ""B"" symmetric I wanted to point out that we could move in either direction but that if the economy did strengthen, as I thought it most likely would, then we would look very omniscient to have moved at this particular time when this [directive] is released in late May But after absorbing the new numbers on M2 and listening to your other comments, I come closer to where you are The only difference I have  -34-    3/31/92  is that your disinheriting the P* model bothers me a little because I still have a lot of faith in that  That part I agree with; you made that very clear But there was a statement you made in the beginning against giving too much credit to the P* model  LAWARE He was being modest  I have a lot of faith in it because I don't think we have any evidence yet that there's not a shift in the secular trend of V2 But I would comfortably--  Well, I think it is, too As a matter of fact, if you take M2 at face value and say that we thought we had a reason to explain its weakness, it has pretty darn well predicted what happened even without any adjustments So, maybe it didn't lose some of its meaning I did think that we would be [tightening policy] and it would be nice to show that we anticipated this a little But I have some more doubts as a result of the behavior of the money numbers than I had That being true, I can put that off for another meeting At the next meeting I hope we will be able to move to symmetric language if events go our way between now and then "
4674,1992-05-19,BLACK," Mr Chairman, I agree fully I've never had very much sympathy for intervention, but I do remember the days that Jerry has alluded to when we had to draw on the swaps to get money to support the dollar And if we are going to continue [to intervene], which I hope we won't, our holdings could come in useful, as he says But I have never been sympathetic toward intervention and I'm glad we're going in the direction we're going  Mike, in reading the Greenbook, I concluded that you thought the first-quarter GNP, or rather GDP--I haven't made that transition completely--increased at a 3 percent rate Then in reading the briefing papers last night, I thought at first you were going to say 33 percent but then I looked at the chart and it appeared that it might go as high as 4 percent What is your best guess as to what that figure really might be?  That really would be something of a surprise to the private economy if it were that much, wouldn't it?  Mr Chairman, the staff forecast has changed really just a little since the last time We thought it was a good forecast then, and it still seems to be a reasonable forecast to us Certainly, most of the anecdotal and other information that we are getting in the Fifth District and also in the country as a whole is consistent with this relatively moderate rate of recovery that the staff is projecting  On the point regarding commercial real estate transactions, our Vice Chairman is a big real estate operator He does a large volume of business and also is a solvent real estate developer, which makes him an unusual breed He has been reporting for about two months now that commercial real estate is beginning to move Nothing new is being built, but it is beginning to move; the prices had  -12-    5/19/92  dropped to the point that they looked attractive He also always adds ""and there's plenty of financing out there for it"" This was not true a while back, but that's the way he has seen it for some two months And I think that's a pretty [reliable] reading because his firm operates in a lot of cities throughout the country  It's certainly true that both manufacturing activity and retail sales did appear to have decelerated a bit since we had the gains earlier in the year Nevertheless, most of our contacts believe that the recovery is here to stay this time That view was universal at our last board meeting, for example And for the most part they expect their own businesses and industries to grow at a solid, if something less than spectacular, rate over the months ahead These contacts cite a wide variety of leading indicators; they all seem to have their favorites, and those range from increasing trucking activity to reduced loan delinquencies to rising telephone hookups, and on and on  Even though I think the staff forecast is reasonable, it's certainly true that reasonable forecasts don't always come true So we have to ask, as we always should, where the risk lies And I think the risk of errors may be on the down side I'm bothered by this sharp deceleration in the rate of growth in M2, although I think your explanation comes very close to explaining why it has misbehaved, and I'm very sympathetic to that The apparent continued sluggishness in May is obviously a further risk on the down side, and it's a risk I worry about a great deal Still, I believe we can be fairly certain that the weakness that we had results from these special factors such as the lower non-withheld personal income tax payments and the movement into other kinds of assets, this substitution for M2-type balances My 85 year old mother-in-law, for example, is now out in the longer end of the market and that is something I never thought would take place! And I think we'll be better able to gauge--  Well, if we get the lower interest rates that the staff has projected she might take capital gains on that! Anyway, I think to be better able to read the significance of M2 we have to get a little further past April and the tax date  Now, on the other side, I think it's worth noting that the main differences between the staff forecast and most other forecasts is that the staff expects inflation to decline further this year and then hold steady next year Many of the other forecasters think inflation is going to bottom out this year and is going to be higher in the next few years The staff is also projecting, as I just mentioned, lower long-term interest rates over the period ahead and it seems as if most other forecasters expect interest rates to continue on an uptrend I see the Greenbook projection as more desirable, and it is certainly plausible But I believe the chances of achieving this are going to depend pretty highly on whether or not we make the right policy calls in the critical months ahead In particular, I think we have to convince the markets and the public that we are still determined to reduce inflation further even as we try to foster this budding recovery we apparently have under way The credibility of our long-term strategy is at a very crucial point right now and it's really on the line So, I think we need to do all we can to reinforce  -13-    5/19/92  this commitment that I think all of us in this room share to working inflation down over the longer run  Tell them to go long!  ""B"" symmetric, Mr Chairman, with your clarification about your reluctance to move in either direction unless we had some confirmation in the real economy as well as the aggregates I think you're dead right on that and I was going to throw that [comment] out had you not done it ahead of me Another thing we need to address is this alternative sentence proposed for the directive That sentence indicates we are expecting at least a moderate resumption of expansion in the aggregates, and I'd like to see that in there rather than the old sentence that we had "
4700,1992-06-30,BLACK," The big economic news in the Fifth District, as I suspect many of you know, is that it may soon be possible to buy a BMW that has a honk with a southern accent! BMW people have just announced that they are going to build a huge new factory in northwest South Carolina that will create jobs for about 4,000 people I wish that had been announced before our last directors' meeting when you had an exchange with our protectionist-minded Mr Chairman, who has been mourning the loss of those high paying jobs and their replacement by this sort of thing But there is an unfortunate side of this in that South Carolina paid about $150 million in subsidies in order to get that factory So, this is not a purely economic decision but it does augur well for that particular part of the country at the expense of some other part Now, beyond that, not much really has changed in the region Gradual recovery seems to be continuing and business people are generally optimistic about the near-term outlook pretty much across the spectrum of sectors and industries The tone of the anecdotal information, though, at our last joint meeting of our three boards was a little less positive than it had been at the meetings immediately before that Against this background, we think the optimism about the future could fade pretty fast unless actual business activity does accelerate at least a little in the fairly near-term future  At the national level, our projections are very close to those of the staff We expect slightly more real growth and slightly less inflation, but the differences are not really significant The question of where the risk lies seems to me to depend largely on how much weight one wants to give to the persistent weakness in M2 as an indicator of what lies ahead We're still inclined to discount most of the recent weakness that we've seen because we feel most of it comes from the portfolio adjustments that are reflecting the structural changes in banking and financial markets with which all of us are very familiar But the longer this weakness persists, the more uneasy it makes us Our uneasiness was heightened by the excellent analysis in the second part of the Feinman/Porter memorandum which suggested that M2 is by no means dead So, on balance, we think the risk of error is now moderately on the down side rather than the other way around, given this renewed contraction in M2 that apparently has been taking place in June  Despite whatever questions there may be regarding the real side of the projections, we are very comfortable with the staff's projection that inflation will come down This is also our projection and in fact we expect somewhat more decline than the staff does both this year and next And we think there's a good possibility that a  -15-    6/30-7/1/92  growing acceptance of this belief on the part of the public would work to bolster real economic activity  Tom, when you said you were an outlier on inflation did you mean on the low side?  You have an awfully big sample in relation to your universe! Let's look at it that way  Bob Parry's question raised something that has been on my mind for some time I think there are two ways to look at these intermediate targets, or the long-term targets as we call them now One is that they are in fact medium-term targets The other extreme is to set these where we think the aggregates are going to be and not really think of them as targets I think what Don has said is that the reason he has suggested lower [growth rates] is that he thinks they are reasonable targets because of the downward shift in the demand for money that we've seen, which makes [lower growth] perfectly justifiable But I think it's a trap we can easily get  -35-    6/30-7/1/92  into setting these where we think they're going to be rather than where we think they ought to be I'm very much in favor of choosing targets and making the aggregates behave the way we think they ought to rather than just putting these out I think the staff has done a very fine job in a very difficult environment in setting forth the numbers that we have here And I think Don would agree with what I'm saying  Mr Chairman, I'm with you about 95 percent of the way, which is a lower percentage than it usually is  But in the absence of some multi-year policy strategy such as the ""tunnel"" strategy that Governor Lindsey and I so bravely proposed back in December, which we all did not have the wisdom to accept, I think we have to look upon these one-year targets that we set now as sort of a mid-term benchmark We don't know what  -39-    6/30-7/1/92  the heck is going to happen, as you correctly said, so I think it's very wise to stick to the 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent [M2 target] for this year The main reason I would suggest that is not that I think we're likely to be anywhere near the 6 percent, but that there is a possibility we might be there And to have to change [the target] later on by raising it because we chose a range that was too low would reverse what we've been doing over a long period of time There's a beautiful story in Appendix A of the Bluebook showing how, since about 1980, we've been lowering these targets steadily over time, and I think that conveys an important message But if we were to choose the lower range and then for some reason or other M2 or the other aggregates were to strengthen and we had to raise the range, I think that would muddle the thinking of the whole financial market and it would be very bad But by the same token, as we choose our target this time I think we ought to send an unambiguous message to the markets that we have not lost sight of our long-term objective of good economic growth with stable prices And I would favor very strongly adopting for 1993 a range of, say, 2 to 6 percent [or] one of the recommended ranges--say, 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent Governor Angell and I discussed that last night A 2 to 6 percent range would be my preference because of the uncertainty, but 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent wouldn't bother me either unless we got to the point that it really wasn't enough and we had to raise that So, I would really prefer the 2 to 6 percent because I think that gives us enough room on the downside to convince the market of what we really want to do and at the same time enough to provide adequate financing for whatever economic growth we can get  It was higher than that!  Just to reinforce that I was about 95 percent with you, I think your suggestion that you explain this in your Humphrey-Hawkins testimonies is absolutely vital  -40-    6/30-7/1/92  I strongly endorse that; I just forgot [to mention] it But I'm 60/40 if--  Well, like Governor Lindsey, I think there's a limit to how far these things can go, but I don't know what it is I think a lot of [the adjustment] probably is behind us because I don't know anybody who has thought about it at all who has not shifted money out of M2 I cited my mother-in-law who is 85 and has gone long-term And the Chairman asked me if she was holding these for income I said probably but she wasn't averse to taking a few capital gains if they came There has to be an end to this, but I don't know when it will be I think Don's group has done a very, very good job in addressing all the issues; it's one of the finest things they've done, yet I'm sure they feel somewhat dissatisfied with it because it's so complex If this target-setting gets any more complicated than it is today, it is going to mitigate to some extent the disappointment I have in not being able to participate in the next target-setting session I don't think I could find one any more challenging than what we have today  Mr Chairman, I don't see a lot of difference in the approaches the two of you are suggesting except that I think Jerry would favor reducing the range next year because of the signal effect Otherwise it seems to me you have said essentially the same things, as I've understood you That's the point I was trying to make  I would much prefer that if we had the option But if we should take a step toward [ease] either through adoption of a directive that is asymmetrical toward ease or through dropping the federal funds rate, I think we badly need something out there for the future that says we have not abandoned our long-term quest for price stability And that's why I--  I was sure you would feel that way I just feel that some tangible movement in cutting the aggregate ranges would be necessary and make that as believable as I would like it to be  That's my problem  You said you didn't want to put your foot down firmly, Mr Chairman; I think 2 to 6 percent would not be putting your foot down firmly like 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent would be  I understand You're in a very defensible position; you're a very persuasive person; you have higher credibility than anybody in the country But if we don't lower that range, I think people are not going to believe everything you say That is what I'm afraid of  Uneducated?  Was the private nonresidential unchanged?  Mr Chairman having been in the uncomfortable position of supporting you [earlier] only 95 percent in my estimation,  -67-    6/30-7/1/92  I would like to express 100 percent agreement with this approach I would add only thing I think we ought to include the bracketed sentence on page 23 of the Bluebook which stresses the uncertainty  So, it's 100 percent agreement, not 98!  I'm not sure I'd say the same thing if I were speaking again I supported the Chairman but then on further reflection I thought that if we had lowered the targets for next year I would support him more enthusiastically, if I may put it that way  We can say ""slightly"" or ""somewhat""  I think we could take that last sentence and attach it to the one before and say ""in light of the recent unusual behavior of these aggregates"" "
4725,1992-07-02,BLACK," It seems appropriate to me, Mr Chairman; this is Bob Black  Mr Chairman, did I understand you to say 915 or 930 am? "
4735,1992-08-18,BLACK," Mr Chairman, a while ago you said that statutorily the Treasury has the primary responsibility [for foreign exchange policy] I believe it would be safe to say, wouldn't it, that it also has that primary responsibility under the Constitution, just as Congress has the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof, which gives us primacy in the monetary policy area  That's what I was speaking of  Including the 5 percent interest on them, I suppose?    8/18/92  Well, they ought to have some value on accrued interest I would assume  That would seem a right unwelcomed message to send out  Mr Chairman, a while ago Si Keehn's analogy of an airplane reminded me of another mechanical analogy that I think is very pertinent here In the days when we first began to install antipollution equipment on automobiles I used to get terribly frustrated trying to get the car started and running very smoothly I've been experiencing the same sort of feeling about the economy with its fits and starts and near stalls But eventually we usually did get the car to run pretty smoothly, and I'm satisfied that sooner or later we're going to have the economy moving up at a smoother pace But I do think the downward revision that the staff has made in the forecast over the remainder of 1992 is clearly appropriate in view of the lackluster growth we've had in the economy since the end of the first quarter My guess is that the risks of errors are about evenly divided between the up side and the down side On the down side, for example, many of the factors that have been plaguing us in the recovery in recent months--such as the negative impact of this corporate restructuring, which I think augurs well for the long run but is terribly painful in the short run--are still around But it does mean increasing efficiency in the long run And I think the rise in productivity probably means a higher long-term growth potential than the 2 percent the staff is estimating We also have the slowing in defense expenditures; we have situations abroad where the economies are not really growing very fast; we have the oversupply of office space and other commercial real estate And maybe even more important in the minds of the consumer, there are a lot of non-economic worries such as crime and drugs and the breakdown of family values that I think have been making people less inclined to part with their dollars than they otherwise would be I believe this sort of thing is going to be with us for quite a while and is going to exert a drag on economic activity in the period ahead, and the weight of the drag  -22-    8/18/92  could even increase Of course, in addition to that we have the weakness in M2 We've explained a lot of that, I think, but I still have a nagging worry that there's some weakness there that we're really not explaining away by these special factors  But then one can look at the up side of this and say that there are at least some signs now that this might turn into a typical recovery--albeit a much less rapid recovery than we've usually had-- because of the decline in interest rates, which eventually I think is going to stimulate housing My expectations got a little setback with the data released this morning Certainly, sales of durable goods at the consumer level and also of producers durable equipment are going to be one of the stronger parts in the recovery when it comes And that, of course, will stimulate jobs and economic growth But having said that, I think it is important for us to recognize that there's a big downside risk and it's very serious I'm getting at the same sort of thing that Dick Syron was talking about a while ago  If these reduced Greenbook expectations turn out to be true, this could be pretty serious in terms of jeopardizing our strategy for getting to our long-term objectives We need to give that some consideration in our setting of short-term policy goals today Now, in the case of the long-term objective, I think the staff's estimate of the inflationary outlook is [about right]; we will certainly be moving closer to our goal by the end of 1994 That's obviously very encouraging to someone who thinks that the prime goal of monetary policy ought to be price stability But in the context of the staff's outlook, it seems to me that this further progress is dependent upon continued sluggishness of any projected recovery even as far out as the second half of 1994 Maybe this continued softness is necessary in order to get inflation down further But my own guess is that we can get the same kind of inflation results with stronger real growth in late 1993 and in 1994 if we maintain a visible commitment to our long-term objective of price stability, despite the current weakness in the economy And I think we ought not miss any chances to say that that is our ultimate long-term goal even though we recognize that we have some short-term problems on the side of weakness in the economy right now  Mr Chairman, ordinarily I'm biased very much in favor of symmetric language but I think your reasoning on why we shouldn't switch from one to the other and then back again is compelling So, I would say ""B"" asymmetric "
4764,1992-10-06,BLACK," I just want to commend those of you who had a part in the decision for having tried to urge the Treasury not to do this intervention I think you proved your point very well  The latest national reports--especially that of the National Association of Purchasing Managers, the employment figures, and the downturn in consumer expectations--have been very disheartening to say the least In light of those reports, I think the staff was correct in lowering its projection; what they've done seems pretty reasonable to me But I don't think anybody really understands why we are getting this persistent weakness in the economy In such a case it looks to me as if the risks of error on any kind of forecast are very high indeed I would be more hesitant to guess which way the risks of error might lie in this particular period of time  I do take a small measure of comfort in the most recent information we have gotten from around our District The economic picture may not be as bleak as suggested by the national data; some of the District information is [more current] For example, reports of our directors at the September meeting certainly did nothing to suggest that there would be any further decline in business activity in their view in our District The same is true of the reports that we got in our regular survey of manufacturers and retailers In fact, that survey actually suggested a slight improvement in a number of areas such as retail sales, manufacturing, business sentiment, and residential real estate And I think the recent growth in bank credit and money also presents at least a ray of hope about the future Indications that loans are now more available, as reported in the Greenbook, are pretty well consistent with what we are hearing in our District through anecdotal information While the 3 percent rate of growth in M2 in August and September is lower than I would like to see at this point, it's a big improvement over the negative rates of growth that we had for the previous five months I hope this could be the beginning of some sustained period of higher growth  Insofar as the inflation forecast is concerned, as you know, the Greenbook is showing a decline in the CPI down to a rate of about 2 percent by the end of 1994 That seems reasonable to me, given the sharp deceleration in money growth that we've had over the last several years If we were to achieve this low inflation rate, however, then I think we have to be prepared if necessary to let the federal funds rate rise rather quickly when economic activity and the rate of growth of money do speed up, although I hope what Governor Angell described is really what will happen in that case I'll return to this point later when we get to the policy discussion  Mr Chairman, I think the policy decision that we face this morning is, as Don said, essentially a matter of weighing the risk of a renewed deterioration in the economy against the risk that a further easing at this juncture will damage our credibility and might not do any good in any event My real preference, reading the tea leaves the way I do, is to do something now--move a quarter point --but I can accept your formulation of ""B"" with an asymmetric directive But I want to underscore what Jerry Jordan said This decision would be a lot easier if we had cut those targets back in July Governor Angell and I felt strongly enough about advocating a cut in the [1992] targets [in July 1991] that we actually dissented on [the vote to retain them] But if we do cut them regularly, I think we establish the credibility whereby we can make these short-term lowering [moves] without scaring the market half to death because we would reassure them that we have not lost sight of our long-term targets  But not on the merits of the case! "
4789,1992-11-17,BLACK," Thank you very much, Mr Chairman I'll be perfectly willing to send you a letter if I think you're going astray, and I hope you will heed that letter!  I don't have a fax machine but I'm thinking about getting one  Mr Chairman, we come out very close to the staff projections on the real side of the economy, and they in turn are generally in line with what most private forecasters are saying in that they call for a gradual recovery Our guess is that the risk has now shifted to the [up side] For the first time I think we see some signs that the economy may really be beginning to move a bit For example, a substantial portion of the latest data, both nonfinancial as well as financial, has been at least somewhat stronger than expected Prospects for consumer spending in particular look much better than I thought they would look; they strike us as really rather bright when coupled with the apparent upswing in consumer confidence    11/17/92  as reported in the Michigan Survey for early November And the apparent acceleration in commercial lending at banks is another favorable financial sign Also, the anecdotal information that we've been picking up around our District has been considerably more upbeat lately than it had been for a couple of months Our directors' comments in particular have been better for two successive months than they were before that And their comments for the last couple of years have been pretty darn good leading indicators Somehow or other this group we have now has been better able to call the movements in the economy than almost any group of directors we've had in the past And this is what they're telling us Now, we're all aware, of course, that these developments can prove to be pretty transitory We have had a lot of fits and starts in this frustrating recovery period that we've been through Nevertheless, I believe [the improvement] may be real this time  Let me make just one final comment about the inflation projections that the staff has made Over the last several years, I've often been accused of being much too optimistic about inflation A lot of that stems from my deep faith in the wisdom of this Committee to do what needs to be done I think our policy has been excellent for many years now Now I think we're seeing some evidence that my optimism about inflation is beginning to be realized We've made tremendous progress If you look at the staff projection of 2 percent inflation in the CPI for '94, for example, I think we've gotten very close to what really amounts to zero inflation, taking into account the errors of measurement in that measure And I express one parting hope That the Committee will continue to behave as it has in the past If you do, my fellow pensioners and I will forever be grateful to you for your fine work!  Mr Chairman, I have a strong preference for lowering the ranges by a full percentage point, although I don't think your suggestion of 2 to 6 percent would be all that bad I don't think this is a purely technical issue, though I think this [affects] our credibility Governor Angell and I argued unsuccessfully for such a move back in 1991 In 1992 I did not argue for it because I thought we were clearly in a recession and it would look bad at that point But I do think we would have done better if we had moved it back at that time Now, the technical case is very strong Don and his colleagues, Messrs Feinman and Porter, have done a great job in showing that 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent is technically a very good place for the range to be But that gives us just a little bit of margin We would be just above the 1-1/2 percent lower limit if they're right in their assumption that 2 percent growth in M2 is what we would get and that velocity would behave as they suspect But the 5-1/2 percent on the up side gives us a lot of room for movement in case the economy turns out to be stronger than they have assumed, and I believe that is one of the more likely outcomes As far as the timing is concerned, it would look unnecessarily provocative if we did this now unless we were also to ease our short-term [policy] just a little and couple the two actions I would prefer to wait until February to do it I think we would experience less political flak if we did that  So, I feel pretty strongly that we ought to go with ""B,"" and I would like to see the directive made symmetric If we do decide, though, to change the federal funds rate today and lower it a little, then I think we ought to go ahead and couple that with a lowered long- term range I'm not as skeptical as Bill McDonough is about how the markets would accept this I think there are a lot of people out there who would find that somewhat acceptable But if we lower the federal funds rate, I think we definitely should lower that longer-run range or else we'll be perceived as having thrown in the towel on inflation I guess I end up about where Governor LaWare and Governor Angell did on that  Mr Chairman, I know you prefer to explain it as a technical move, but do you think it's purely technical?  I don't  Well, the technical argument is very strong, but I think there are some people who still entertain doubts about how serious we are about achieving price stability, and I think they will  -45-    11/17/92  take this as a concrete sign that we may be more serious than they thought before  More than we've ever had; I wouldn't argue that  I agree that that's exactly the position of everybody in this room, but I'm not sure that the public is completely convinced at this point But I don't want to let this--  That's right And since that yield sits up there where it does, I think that is some evidence  That's right  I don't think it reflects entirely, but some part of it--  You think you have an ally and so does Governor Angell!  What you really want to ask is how we were able to exclude this before we found out it was a sin!  Mr Chairman, I agree with Bob Forrestal I think that Mr Gonzalez's purpose really is to politicize the Federal Reserve, and he hopes to do that by exposing our deliberations So, I think he's not really asking for [earlier release of] our actions He knows those fairly soon, although one could argue that we could make them available a little sooner What he wants to know is the deliberations I was around here when we gave up the memoranda of  -62-    11/17/92  discussion; I hated to see it [discontinued], although I understood the reason why the Committee did it I chatted with Chairman Burns about it at the time and he said he too hated to see them go because they do have valuable information for scholars--admittedly only a few [of them are interested]--but the memoranda do have some valid information for those inside and outside the System I think we would be wise to resume preparing them I doubt that would inhibit our discussions and deliberations at all if they were released, say, three years or even two years later And we would be responding to a point you made which I think is very real That maybe we do have a responsibility for making available to the public something more than we are now doing And I don't think that would inhibit our discussions For example, would you mind tomorrow if someone told people what you had said two years ago at an FOMC meeting? My view is ""no""  Well, you mean they would get out sooner than the lag we would set?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  Well, it takes a while to write them! It's one heck of a job Norm will tell you that And I may have lost a friend! "
