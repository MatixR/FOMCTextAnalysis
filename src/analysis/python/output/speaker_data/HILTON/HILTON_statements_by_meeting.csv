6904,2001-10-02," The other issue we were facing early in the week after the 17th   was that, as a symptom that the financing markets were operating much more efficiently,   the liquidity we had provided previously was beginning to have a very telling effect on   financing rates and the funds rate So when we were coming into the market in the   morning, on some of those operations we were receiving propositions of below 1 percent    We continued to accept them for a while, but there was no sense of balance in the   financing markets by the 18th or 19th--no sense that there was any upside risk to rates   And given the liquidity we had put in previously, market participants were really testing   how low rates could go There is no natural floor above zero  We did consciously reduce   the amount we were supplying at the margin so that at least at the end of the day market   participants would see that there was some risk of rates going up  We saw a little     10/2/01 12   evidence of that risk later in the week when in late trading rates reached as high as 6 or 7   percent Since we restored that balance to market expectations, though, we have been   supplying somewhat higher levels of central bank balances  "
7918,2006-05-10,"  No, I think that adapting to that environment would not be a problem for us  It   would probably be very easy to do    We have thought of different ways that the ability to pay interest on reserves   could be used, and you’re making a distinction between a rate that might be paid on excess and a rate   that might be paid on required  Maybe they’d be the same; maybe they would be different  Depending   on which you chose, you could have a very different framework for implementing policy on a day-to-  day basis  Operationally, from the Desk’s perspective, they could both be executed in a fairly   straightforward fashion  "
8265,2007-12-06,"  As Sandy described, one way to structure a temporary term   auction facility would be to hold regular auctions of twenty-eight-day term loans, for  a period of approximately six months  If one auction were held every two weeks,  then there would be two overlapping sets of loans outstanding at any one time   Auctions sizes would be shaped by demand and market conditions and by experience  gained from preceding auctions  For the initial auctions, it’s difficult to gauge what   December 6, 2007 9 of 51    the appetite might be, as the whole program and the auction process itself would be  somewhat novel  But initial auction sizes of up to $20 billion seem both realistic and  large enough for one to expect them to have some real and immediate effect on  markets     Being able to hold the first two auctions before the year-end would have an added   benefit of relieving some of the pressure that has been building ahead of the year turn   The upcoming holiday calendar would definitely pose a challenge for scheduling, but  it is doable  We propose that a first auction settle on December 20—a Thursday— with the auction itself held earlier that week, on Monday, December 17  The formal  announcement of the auction would take place sometime before then  These would  be twenty-eight-day term loans that would mature on January 17  A second auction  would settle just one week later—on Thursday, December 27  Because of the  Christmas holiday, which falls earlier that week, the auction itself would be held on  December 20, the Thursday of the previous week  These would be thirty-five-day  term loans that would mature on January 31  When the term loans arranged through  these first two auctions matured, they could be replaced with new auctions of twenty- eight-day term loans  This would then put the auctions on a biweekly schedule,  which could then hold going forward     We are in a favorable position to accommodate even a very large buildup in   outstanding term loans over the next month or so  To offset these loans on our  balance sheet, we would run off some of the currently rather high level of RPs  outstanding, and we would redeem a portion of our maturing bill holdings each week  for a number of weeks  These activities could be supplemented with outright sales of  bills and reverse RPs if needed     Reserve management through the transition period, including the upcoming year-  end, is not without its potential challenges  Demand for TAF loans could prove to be  unexpectedly light, in which case we would be left having to build up further our  already high level of RPs outstanding through the year-end  By the same token,  demand could be stronger than expected, while at the same time reserve supply from  other sources might jump—say, from heavy use of the primary credit facility  If so,  the advance notice we would have about TAF auction sizes due to the gap between  the auction date and when they settle would buy us some time with which to organize  a response  Brian will now conclude our presentation    "
8425,2008-04-29,"  Thank you, Jim  We have identified four critical objectives for a   new operating framework, which are listed on page 34 of your handout  These are  (1) to reduce burdens and deadweight loss associated with the current regime, (2) to  enhance monetary policy implementation, (3) to promote efficient and resilient  money markets, and (4) to promote an efficient payment system  For each of the five  options that Jim has just presented, I am going to describe what we see as the major  advantages and disadvantages of each vis à vis these objectives  I will also highlight  some important sources of uncertainty that we have about how some of these options  might function in practice  Then I will close with a broad assessment of how the five  options measure up against each of these four objectives       The key advantages and disadvantages of option 1—remunerate required and   excess reserve balances—are listed on page 35  This option would have the  advantage of being relatively easy to implement given that it would build largely on  elements of the current operating framework and would simply pay interest on  reserve requirements and, at a lower rate, on excess reserves  The basic framework,  which consists of an interest rate corridor with reserve requirements and maintenance  periods, is widely used by other central banks, and we’re pretty certain how it would  function in practice  For central banks that have adopted this basic framework, it has  proven to be reasonably effective for controlling short-term interbank rates under a  variety of circumstances  However, this option would do little to reduce the  administrative burdens associated with our current regime  This framework is also  somewhat rigid, particularly in the flexibility it would provide to us and to banks  themselves to adjust the level of requirements in ways that would facilitate monetary  policy implementation  A particular shortcoming is that many depositories active in  the interbank market have a very small base of deposits against which requirements  of any level could be assessed  An important source of uncertainty with this option is  whether it would lead to a significant increase in total required operating balances,  which would be helpful for damping interest rate fluctuations that can arise when  requirements are very low  However, the Fed would have some power to influence  the aggregate level of requirements by raising requirement ratios     Option 2—voluntary balance targets—(shown on page 36) would lead to some   reduction of administrative costs and burdens compared with the current framework  (option 1), as relative simplicity would be one of the principal design objectives for a  new system of voluntary reserve targets  The basic framework is similar to that of  option 1  It consists of an interest rate corridor with maintenance periods but  substitutes voluntary targets for reserve requirements  As already noted, this basic  framework has proven to be reasonably effective for controlling overnight interbank  rates where it has been adopted  Furthermore, a new system of voluntary targets  could provide all DIs with considerable flexibility for setting their own level of   April 29–30, 2008 152 of 266    targets and for adjusting the size of these targets, a feature that banks might find  useful during periods of heightened uncertainty or stress  With this option, there  would also be the opportunity to review and totally revamp the length and mechanics  of the maintenance period to make them more supportive of monetary policy  implementation  However, almost any system of voluntary targets for reserves is  bound to impose some administrative costs on both depositories and the Fed, and  there may be some tradeoff between administrative simplicity and design flexibility   An important source of uncertainty with this option is that we have yet to identify  with precision a system of voluntary reserve targets that would be workable, in the  sense of being easy to administer across a large number of DIs with disparate  structures, and that would be effective in yielding a total level and distribution of  voluntary targets across DIs that would enhance our ability to achieve our operating  objectives  Unfortunately, experiences of other central banks offer little guidance in  how to design voluntary targets  A particular risk that concerned the Bank of  England when it designed its voluntary target scheme was the potential for market  manipulation that a new system might offer individual banks if they were entirely free  to choose their level       Option 3—simple corridor—(on page 37) would go about as far as possible   toward eliminating administrative burdens by doing away with all requirements and  maintenance period accounting rules  This option should also keep the overnight  interbank rate within a narrower range than the other options, assuming that we adopt  a narrower spread between the discount rate and the interest rate paid on excess  reserves  Experiences of other central banks that have adopted this kind of operating  system support that belief  However, there is also reason to believe that, with  removal of the ability of banks to average reserve holdings over a maintenance  period, interest rate volatility within the interest rate corridor could be high  We  could respond to high volatility within a corridor by further narrowing that corridor   But there is the risk that, at some point as you go in that direction, market participants  could use our discount window or interest on excess reserves as a first recourse rather  than as a last resort and thus affect the Fed’s role as intermediary and impair normal  market functioning  There are some important questions about how effectively a  simple corridor system would function in our particular environment  All the options  we are considering propose to use the primary credit facility to limit upward  movements in market rates  To the extent that this facility might not serve as an  effective brake on upward rate movements, the consequences would be greatest for  this option because there are no other mechanisms for smoothing interest rates  Some  central banks that have a simple corridor framework have also developed  arrangements to adjust reserve levels late in the day to prevent exogenous reserve  shocks from pushing market rates to either the upper or the lower end of the corridor       Option 4—floor with high balances—is shown on page 38  It would also do away   with all requirements and maintenance period accounting rules and, like option 3,  would go a long way toward eliminating administrative burdens  Moreover, because  the rate effects of even a large aggregate reserve shock or a payment shock at an  individual DI are likely to be relatively small, the need for depositories or for the   April 29–30, 2008 153 of 266    Desk to manage daily reserve positions intensively is likely to be reduced, which  should translate to further resource savings  Better insulation of market rates from  exogeneous reserve shocks is a design objective, and it is a particularly distinctive  feature of this framework  However, completely severing the link between daily  reserve levels and interest rate movements can be a double-edged sword  While we  may wish to better insulate market rates from reserve shocks, we may also wish to  preserve some ability to influence market rates by manipulating reserve supply when  other factors are distorting rates  One risk associated with this option is that it would  represent a radical departure from the basic elements of our own current framework  and from those of almost every other central bank, preventing us from learning from  the experiences of other central banks  A particular unknown with this option is the  possible implication for the functioning of the interbank market  Offering to  compensate DIs for all the reserves they might choose to hold at a rate that is in line  with market rates could have profound effects on their willingness to lend in the  market, under both normal circumstances and during periods of market stress  The  Reserve Bank of New Zealand, one central bank that has experimented with a system  similar to option 4, did run into some difficulties with the hoarding of reserves by  individual banks to the detriment of the interbank market  As a result, they adjusted  their framework to cap holdings of excess reserves by individual banks      Option 5—voluntary daily target with clearing band—is on page 39  It has many   of the same advantages and disadvantages as option 2, stemming from the fact that  both feature voluntary reserve targets  Because simplicity would be one of the design  principles, it should reduce current administrative burdens  It would also provide DIs  with the same kind of flexibility that option 2 does for setting and adjusting their own  reserve targets  On the other hand, a system of voluntary targets for reserves would  still leave some administrative costs, and we have yet to specify a system of voluntary  reserve targets that would be workable and effective  An additional advantage of this  option is that it could allow the Fed to adjust the width of the daily clearing band  around the reserve target  The final choice of clearing band width could be made  after some experimentation based on what works best  Moreover, being able to make  temporary adjustments to the width of this daily clearing band could be a powerful  tool for dealing with exigent circumstances  Experiences of other central banks  provide little guidance about how this flexibility might be best employed  But the  Bank of England did widen its maintenance period clearing band during the recent  financial market turmoil, and they have been happy with the results  Interestingly, the  ECB, quite independently, has been examining the possibility of a new system  centered on a one-day clearing band rather than a multi-day maintenance period       Let me sum up by outlining how these five options stack up against the four   objectives that we have established for a new operating framework, which are  summarized on pages 40 and 41  First, all the options would eliminate most of the  current “reserve tax” associated with the nonpayment of interest on reserves, and  perhaps with the exception of option 1, they would reduce the administrative burdens  associated with our current framework  Option 3 (simple corridor) and option 4  (floor with high balances) would do the most to eliminate these administrative costs     April 29–30, 2008 154 of 266      Second, all the options would improve monetary policy implementation by   helping set a floor on the fed funds rate  Most have additional features that could  help control rate volatility, although these differ from one another in terms of their  mechanics  But some of the options offer greater potential to adjust parameters in  ways that could be helpful amid changing circumstances—say, during periods of  market stress or heightened uncertainty about developments that could affect our  balance sheet  An adjustable clearing band in option 5 could offer considerable  flexibility  Adjustable reserve targets, a feature of both options 2 and 5, are another  possibility     Third, all the options would rely on efficient money markets for distributing   reserves between DIs  There is more uncertainty, however, about how some of the  options might influence the incentive structure for trading and the allocation of  liquidity in short-term financing markets and the role of the central bank in that  process  This is the case with option 3 (simple corridor), should that corridor be too  narrow, and with option 4 (floor with high balances), where the choices of lending  excess liquidity in the market versus holding excess reserves would be nearly  equivalent       Fourth, all the options are compatible with the proposed changes in payment   system policies  However, there are differences among the options in the levels of  reserves that would likely be in place and that could serve as a substitute for the  provision of central bank daylight credit  Option 4 (floor with high balances) would  provide the most reserves in the system, and option 3 (simple corridor) would provide  the fewest, perhaps even lower than current levels  A system of voluntary reserve  targets, a feature of both options 2 and 5, could be deliberately designed to encourage  a relatively high level of reserves      Well, for the Bank of England, the way the voluntary target rules are set is   really very simple  The bank chooses its own voluntary target  It can’t be below zero, of course,   but they have a cap  It can’t be any higher than a certain amount, and I think it’s 2 percent of some   measure of their liabilities on their balance sheet  They were extremely worried  They had no idea   what they were going to get  Their experience was encouraging in that they got an aggregate level   and a distribution that have brilliantly facilitated their control over their interbank market  But it is   sort of taking a leap to go into that system, although we have some experience with our clearing   balance program  We do see how banks adjust their participation with reserve-management   objectives in mind  In our case, because there are practical limits—ceilings on the size of a clearing   balance that makes sense for any bank to have—we don’t really have a direct observation of what   we would get if it were entirely voluntary  The evidence that I see from our experience of clearing   balances and from the Bank of England is encouraging that we would get, even with a very simply   designed set of voluntary targets, a good aggregate level and distribution of voluntary targets  But   right now, based on what we know, it is an uncertainty    That’s our impression, that it doesn’t have macro consequences  Maybe it’s   a tempest in a teapot, but for the participants in that market, the uncertainty and the costs that are   borne by borrowers and lenders are an important issue  But the macro fallout, the effect on longer-  term rates, doesn’t seem to be significant    Well, for a lot of what we seem to get—like the Eurodollar rates and   LIBOR and foreign exchange swaps and the way they relate to what goes on in our overnight funds   market—the typical intraday pattern is firm in the morning and coming off late in the day  Those   April 29–30, 2008 170 of 266    higher morning rates are the ones that are linked to the other rates—Eurodollars, swaps—and so it’s   not the average rate over time that seems to get priced into these other vehicles    We are finding a great reluctance to do intraday arbitrage  We’re hearing   this from the banks that in the past would do that from time to time  Coming back to one of the   other questions that Don had about what we are hearing about stigma from some of the banks, one   of our better contacts, Citibank, as Jim mentioned, used to do a lot of arbitraging and using the   discount window, the primary credit facility  On occasion, after they borrowed to re-lend in the   market at a higher rate last year or so ago, they would call us in the morning to let us know how it   was that they were helping us out with the funds rate  That has pretty much stopped cold, and they   have decided on sort of classic stigma  They routinely point to the publication of borrowing data in   the H41 release, and they are just not interested in the small gain from that kind of activity while   taking the risk in the market of being seen as in dire need of liquidity    I would say, as a general characterization, that the common practice is to   intervene only once a day, in the morning—not unlike what we do  Where there’s an exception, it’s   like with the Bank of Canada  They have access to information that would allow them to know with   precision late in the day what the supply of reserves is in the absence of any further open market   operations, and then they make an adjustment accordingly   The fact is that, even if we were to operate late in the day but still before the close—let’s   say, 530 or 600—we really have no more information than we had at 930 in the morning upon   which to make an estimate of that day’s reserve supply  We can observe rates, but we don’t know   what amount of a reserve adjustment would be needed to bring supply in line with demand  The   risk of just opening up and offering to be one side or the other of the market in that situation late in   the day is that we could get the entirety of one side of the market and actually create a reserve   imbalance in the other direction between that time and the close of the day  So simply being willing   to operate late in the day isn’t really enough  You do need reserve information as well upon which   to size those operations    No, it is that they know the balance sheet  They know it by late in the day   with certainty  They have few sources of uncertainty to begin with, and their major source of   uncertainty, government balances, is something that perhaps the small number of banks they’re   dealing with facilitates  But it is that they know by late in the day what the supply of reserves will   be with real precision   April 29–30, 2008 174 of 266   "
8653,2009-01-27," Thank you, Trish Assets on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet,  as of last Friday, totaled $204 trillion, as shown in exhibit 24  The total has declined  about $250 billion from its recent peak on December 17, with most of that decline                              January 27–28, 2009 18 of 267  coming since the year-end  I should note that most of the data in these charts are as  of last Friday, and just within the last day there have been some fairly significant  developments at some of the facilities  For example, at the CPFF, borrowing came  down as much as $50 billion yesterday and another $21 billion just today, and we’re  learning today about large declines in swap facilities that will take effect on this  Thursday But before I get into some discussion of the individual facilities, let me  give the general picture of what we’ve been seeing   In general, demand at several of the special liquidity facilities has fallen to one  degree or another in recent weeks, reflecting a relaxation of stressful conditions in  some of the money markets, as suggested by the downward movement in money  market yields, which is shown in exhibit 25  Some of the key term funding rates that  are linked to several of our liquidity facilities are shown here  The direct support  offered by various Federal Reserve programs, which since October have provided a  large amount of term funding to banks, dealers, and other financial institutions—as  well as the support offered by various government initiatives—has been behind much  of the easing of conditions in these funding markets and also helps explain why the  year-end passed fairly uneventfully Lower rates in these financing markets in turn  affect the economic incentives to use some of the facilities, and that is being reflected  in the more recent experience  But other factors, such as an ongoing deleveraging of  positions, have also contributed to falling usage in some cases     Looking ahead, we anticipate that the net size of the balance sheet is likely to  continue to fall for a time, but by how much is difficult to say  Even if reported  market rates remain at levels that suggest cheaper funding could now be secured in  the market, the liquidity behind those quotes is not always deep  Any net decline that  we see in coming weeks will also likely prove to be temporary  The agency  mortgage-backed security and agency debt purchase programs are really just getting  under way, and the TALF program starts only later this winter  Moreover, as we have  already experienced, the usage of many of these facilities could change quickly and  substantially should conditions in financial markets again deteriorate     Now I’ll tell about some of the recent experiences at individual facilities in more  detail The term securities lending facility (TSLF), which is illustrated in exhibits 26  and 27, does not affect the size of our balance sheet but does alter the composition of  assets that must be financed in the marketplace  TSLF loans outstanding are just  around $125 billion, and that’s off a level of about $200 billion in post-September   The auctions continue to be undersubscribed, and stop-out rates have regularly been  at the minimum bid rates  Even over the year-end, only a small quantity of the  options on loans sold under the TSLF options program were exercised  The  downward trend in participation here is consistent with the narrowing in spreads  between the term repo rates on the collateral that we accept and those on the Treasury  securities that we lend In rough order of magnitude, these spreads are now in line  with the minimum bid rates at both the schedule 1 and the schedule 2 TSLF auctions   Dealers have also indicated that their holdings of some private securities that are  eligible under schedule 2 continue to shrink and that money market funds and other                         January 27–28, 2009 19 of 267  investors are now more willing to finance the agency debt and agency MBS that we  accept on schedule 1 On that last observation, I’ll note that today we let our last  outstanding 28-day single-tranche repo mature, bringing to closure the initiative  begun last March under which we arranged term repos against agency mortgage- backed securities as collateral  As recently as one month ago, the outstanding value  of these operations was still at its peak of $80 billion   Net draws by foreign central banks under our swap agreements have come off a  peak of $586 billion in early December, and as of last Friday, they stand $120 billion  below that, as shown in exhibit 28 Declines in LIBOR and foreign exchange swap  funding costs seem to be having a direct effect on participation levels  Most of the  dollars made available by the participating foreign central banks are allocated at a rate  of OIS plus 100 basis points, across one-week, one-month, and three-month tenors   Recently, OIS rates out to three months have been standing at about 20 basis points   There have been considerable reductions in draws at the shorter maturities, where  LIBOR rates are now well below these allocation rates  Some of the decline in the  shorter maturities has been offset by increases in draws at the three-month maturity,  where three-month LIBOR rates are now very close to the OIS plus 100 basis point  threshold But just this morning we learned of an $80 billion decline in net draws on  some of the 84-day allotments, about $50 billion at the ECB   Term auction facility loans outstanding have come off their peak level of  $450 billion reached over the year-end and now total $416 billion (exhibit 29)  Most  of this decline reflects the run-off of some of the special forward-settling operations  arranged last November that spanned the year-end  Although propositions have been  below the offered amounts since last October, when the auction sizes were raised to  $150 billion, the quantities borrowed remain large, as seen at the last several auctions,  including yesterday’s 84-day operation (exhibit 30)  Improvement in the term  interbank market has not so far translated into a significant decrease in participation  at our TAF auctions That may reflect the fact that the minimum bid rate is set equal  to the interest rate paid on excess reserves, which is just 25 basis points, and that most  banks have ample collateral available to secure such loans   In line with the more general trends, borrowing at the PCF and the PDCF has  been falling as well, as indicated in exhibit 31  PCF borrowing has been running  around $60 billion, and PDCF borrowing has been about $30 billion   The commercial paper funding facility passed a major milestone yesterday—its  three-month anniversary  As shown in exhibit 32, much of the $350 billion of  commercial paper purchased through last Friday under the program was acquired in  the first days of operations, beginning on October 27  Since then, increases have  continued at a steady but much slower pace  The CPFF purchases only 90-day paper,  and reflecting the heavy concentration of purchases at the outset exactly three months  ago, $88 billion matured yesterday  Of yesterday’s maturing paper, only $33 billion  was replaced with new issuance at the CPFF; the remaining $55 billion of the  maturing total was not  Today another $57 billion was maturing, of which about                         January 27–28, 2009 20 of 267  $20 billion to $25 billion rolled off This is pretty much what we would expect and  what several of the participants in the program had indicated that they would likely  do, given that CP rates in the market are now well below the CPFF loan rates  These  rates are set at OIS plus 200 basis points for unsecured paper (100 basis points less  for paper with a guarantee) and OIS plus 300 basis points for asset-backed CP   Issuers that did not roll over their maturing CP at the CPFF covered themselves in  one of several ways Some had pre-funded themselves in the CP market, were  funding themselves elsewhere, or had reduced their overall funding need  Short-term  funding markets were able to absorb the increased issuance with no apparent problem  yesterday, although some backup in CP rates has been seen in recent days and a large  amount of CP issued to the CPFF, about another $130 billion, matures over the  coming week or so   The use of two facilities targeted at money market funds reflects the continuing  improvement in the position of these funds  AMLF (ABCP money market mutual  fund liquidity facility) loans continue to run off and are now just about $15 billion  (exhibit 33) Still there has been no borrowing at the MMIFF (money market investor  funding facility)  Inflows into prime money market funds and funds that invest in  agency paper remain on a steady uptrend (exhibit 34)   There have been, however, some areas of growth in the assets on the balance  sheet Purchases of agency MBS, being made through our four investment managers,  have continued at a fairly steady daily pace since these operations commenced on  January 5 (exhibit 35) Cumulative commitments total $58 billion (through January  23) This puts us on a pace to accumulate as much as $500 billion by the end of the  second quarter Few of the purchases arranged so far have actually settled—so far  about $7 billion This reflects the considerable delays between purchase and  settlement that characterize this market  Of the contracted purchases so far, the vast  majority have been for MBS for 30-year maturities, most with coupons ranging from  45 percent to 55 percent The option-adjusted spread to Treasury rates narrowed  almost 50 basis points after the announcement of the program in November  On  balance, spreads have tightened somewhat further since purchases began in early  January, but there have also been periods of modest backup amid strong selling  pressure Some of the selling pressure reportedly reflects a lack of clarity among  market participants about the Fed’s commitment to this market after the second  quarter and the $500 billion purchase objective has been met  Investors are worried  that there may be a “cliff,” with purchases ending abruptly at the end of the second  quarter This uncertainty could be lessened if, for example, the Committee stated that  the program will continue beyond midyear as market conditions warrant   Conforming mortgage rates had been about 6 percent just before the program  announcement  Shortly after we began our purchases, they were being posted by the  same banks at rates as low as just under 5 percent, but they have more recently moved  back up closer to 55 percent as originators struggle to process the wave of  refinancings that has ensued                       January 27–28, 2009 21 of 267  Working with the investment managers, we have been confronting the challenges  of both building up a large portfolio of agency MBS and trying to be supportive of  smooth market function  This has provided some perspective about the potential  value of our being sellers at times or of participating in the dollar-roll market, even as  part of a strategy oriented toward building and maintaining a large portfolio   Likewise, the rise in mortgage applications, shown in exhibit 36, indicates that the  supply of new agency MBS may increase sharply in coming months, which may be a  factor that we need to consider in determining the appropriate pace for MBS  purchases going forward   Meanwhile, we have continued to purchase agency coupon securities, arranging  about one operation per week Since purchases began in early December, we have  bought a total of $23 billion (exhibit 37) So far at least, most of the narrowing in  spreads of agency debt to Treasury securities realized since this initiative was  announced in late November has been maintained  The purchases reportedly have  contributed to the market’s receptive response to the renewal of debt issuance by the  agencies this month     Trish noted the relative lack of improvement in those markets not directly targeted  by any of the Federal Reserve’s newer liquidity facilities  With that as background,  let me provide a brief update on the term asset-backed securities loan facility (TALF)   Just as a quick reminder, through the TALF, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  will lend as much as $200 billion on a nonrecourse basis for up to three years against  certain AAA-rated consumer ABS as collateral  The US Treasury Department will  provide $20 billion of credit protection to the New York Fed in connection with the  TALF, and further protection will be provided by haircuts on the loans  In recent  weeks, staff members at the New York Fed, the Board, and the Treasury have made  significant progress in finalizing several aspects of the program that are critical to its  success These include working out a host of operational details  The aim is to post  the terms and conditions for the facility and to provide frequently asked questions by  the end of this week, with the goal of being operational maybe even as soon as late  February or early March   I’ll conclude my review of the financial assets on the balance sheet by noting that  we last ran off a small portion of our remaining bill holdings last September and have  arranged no outright operations in Treasury securities since then  We now hold  around $475 billion We have no conventional repo agreements outstanding and have  not arranged any such operations in the market since October  On the liability side of  the balance sheet, the offset to net swings in total assets has mostly been in excess  reserves, which are now in the neighborhood of $800 billion—maybe now closer to  $700 billion The Treasury had built up its balances held at the Fed under its  supplementary financing program to a level of $560 billion in November  Since then,  it has been running down these balances because of debt ceiling considerations, and  they now total $175 billion Brian will now continue our presentation                    January 27–28, 2009 22 of 267 "
8698,2009-03-17,"3  Thank you I’m going to review major changes on the Federal  Reserve balance sheet since the last FOMC meeting and then summarize some  long-run balance sheet analysis that was in the memo distributed last week  Last  week, the Markets Group distributed its first comprehensive report on developments  at the various lending facilities and purchase programs over the past intermeeting  period, with a discussion of related financial market developments  That report offers  much more detail than I will provide in my remarks   Just ahead of the last FOMC meeting in late January, the total size of the balance  sheet was $204 trillion, a bit off levels reached just ahead of the year-end  As shown  in exhibit 2, over the course of that last week in January, which included the FOMC  meeting dates, assets fell almost $200 billion  Declines were widespread among the  various short-term lending facilities, with the steepest drop-offs in total draws on the  swap lines used to fund dollar lending by foreign central banks, and in the  commercial paper funding facility As shown in exhibit 3, for the past several months  now, interest rates on alternative market sources of financing available to many  borrowers have been below the rates on the facilities themselves  Ongoing  deleveraging of balance sheets has been cited as a factor contributing to reduced  borrowing   3 Materials used by Mr Hilton are appended to this document (appendix 3)                                       March 17–18, 2009 18 of 266  As shown in exhibits 4 through 9 on the following two pages, since early  February, lending through many of the short-term liquidity facilities has declined  further to one degree or another Still, these facilities remain a crucial source of  funding for some borrowers, despite rate quotes that suggest cheaper market sources  of funding A notable exception to the general trend is the term auction facility,  shown in exhibit 7 The volume of propositions at the TAF auctions at the minimum  bid rate of 25 basis points has increased some in recent weeks, although total  propositions have remained below the total offering amounts   As Trish noted, purchases of agency MBS and agency debt have been steadily  rising Purchases of agency MBS show up in a very lumpy way on the balance sheet,  because of market practice to concentrate settlements on select dates, often with a  considerable lag Last Thursday alone, the size of the balance sheet jumped, as about  $160 billion of purchase commitments settled, which now leaves the total balance  sheet about unchanged from its level just ahead of the last FOMC meeting   In coming weeks, we anticipate that recent patterns in different components of the  balance sheet will continue  There is potential for increased lending through some of  the short-term liquidity facilities ahead of the March quarter-end date as a possible  stress point  But apart from the aforementioned increase in TAF auctions, we have  not seen this so far  Meanwhile, our outright purchase programs are set to proceed on  a steady upward path   Turning to longer-term prospects for the balance sheet, the memo distributed last  week presents illustrative forecasts of the balance sheet out to 2016  Projections were  constructed based on certain economic assumptions, varying degrees of financial  stress assumed over the next couple of years, and on policy assumptions motivated by  the economic and financial conditions   For simplicity in estimation, the various liquidity facilities, purchase programs,  and other balance sheet initiatives are grouped into just a handful of broad asset  categories A baseline scenario was developed using economic conditions similar to  those of the March Greenbook, and an optimistic scenario and a stress scenario were  built around this case   The methodology was kept very simple given the obvious uncertainties  But the  broad contours of the asset projections are thought to be illustrative of different orders  of magnitude for the size of the balance sheet that could be realized under several  plausible sets of assumptions   Projections for the balance sheet and the asset components for each of the three  scenarios are shown in exhibits 10-12  In the stress case shown in the bottom panel,  solid growth only takes hold in 2011, another financial market stress period is  assumed to occur later this year, and there is a significant total expansion in outright                                      March 17–18, 2009 19 of 266  purchase programs  In this case, the balance sheet peaks at $46 trillion in 2010,  although most of the growth occurs this year   In the outyears—2011 and beyond—in all scenarios we assume a natural runoff of  assets Short-term lending at liquidity facilities dissipates relatively quickly  TALF  loans mature on schedule  And the gradual declines in outright holdings reflect either  maturities or prepayments of agency mortgage-backed securities   On the liability side of the balance sheet, apart from some assumed nominal  growth in Federal Reserve note liabilities, the offset to asset movements is the level  of reserve balances held by depository institutions  The reserve estimates can provide  a sense of the possible size of any need either to drain reserves or to increase reserve  demand should the Federal Reserve wish to target short-term interest rates—the  federal funds rate—using conventional operating procedures that are typically  associated with keeping excess reserve levels near zero   Exhibit 13 shows reserve levels for all three scenarios  Peak reserve levels reach  $37 trillion in 2010 in the stress scenario While it is unlikely that a return to a  positive interest rate target would coincide with when reserve levels were at their  maximum, that occasion could come unexpectedly quickly nonetheless  The memo  concludes by presenting the various options available to the Federal Reserve for  accomplishing this   From October to December 2008, excess reserves were left high, and market rates  were considerably below the interest rate paid on excess reserves  There are good  reasons to believe that experience may not represent the normal relation between  market rates and the rate of interest paid on excess reserves  Nonetheless,  policymakers might be uncomfortable at this point adopting a framework to control  market rates by setting the interest rate paid on excess reserves alone while leaving  excess reserves at high levels   The Treasury’s supplementary financing program or authority for the Federal  Reserve to issue its own debt would provide considerable capacity to drain reserves,  and little additional operational infrastructure would be needed  Traditional monetary  policy tools, sales of assets and reverse RPs, could be developed to support reserve  draining operations on a much larger scale than ever used in the past  These could  take some time to develop to their full potential, and there is some question about the  scale on which these tools could be deployed   Finally, the broad authority to pay interest on reserves that the Federal Reserve  now has could be utilized in other ways to shape demand for reserves so as to  effectively reduce excess reserves to levels that would allow the Fed to target positive  short-term interest rates within a more conventional operating framework  Here, too,  some period of time would be needed to develop an effective operating framework  using interest-on-reserves authority  Now I’ll turn it over to Brian to conclude                                             March 17–18, 2009 20 of 266  Yes   Not really systematically in the way this is put together  Our sense,   though, between now and the next meeting, is that what we’re going to be buying is fairly   predictable I’m not sure what the settlement dates are, but if the settlement dates were smooth,   we would be expanding pretty much at the same pace  I’d expect the liquidity facilities, though,   to hang out where they are and maybe, on balance, come off a little bit further, barring some sort   of a stress period So I would anticipate that we’re predominantly in an expansion phase right   now           March 17–18, 2009 28 of 266  Yeah—with a nice confidence interval   Well, it’s a good observation  The assumptions we took for the baseline   were just purely the economic ones  We did have an extension built into the outright purchase   program in the baseline of $500 billion, as you’ve noted, but we did not try to calibrate a   feedback effect, as you suggest, which would be a reasonable thing to do That could move up a   bit the period in which you might want to be otherwise raising the target rate   You really have to look at what the settlement date is almost   It’s not a long intermeeting period, so a couple hundred billion might be   a little bit larger than is realistic  It is hard to anticipate where the liquidity facilities are going,   but the fact that they have been relatively stable on balance for a couple of months—since late   January—makes me think that, without some fundamental change in liquidity conditions, they’re   probably not going to break in a substantial way one direction or another   We can do repos  The other element is our involvement in the dollar roll   market as well, which we probably could scale up at a relatively fast pace, if we wanted to    Again, though, we would have to look at the calendar, because those also settle on a discrete   date   Balance sheet or base?  "
8764,2009-06-23," Thank you Jim  If excess reserve levels were still high when the  Committee again wishes to target short-term interest rates at levels above their  effective minimum, then the starting point for raising market rates would likely be a                                          June 23–24, 2009 21 of 261  corresponding increase in the interest rate paid on excess reserves  This is certain to  put upward pressure on bank borrowing rates, including the overnight federal funds  rate Under improved conditions in financial markets, this by itself might well  provide sufficient control over short-term rates, regardless of the levels of excess  reserves   But if the Committee were dissatisfied with its control over market rates—that is,  should something like the experience of last fall recur—then the Committee would  want to be in a position to respond quickly to exert tighter control  For this reason,  development of some of the tools that have been described is proceeding, even in the  absence of any certainty that they would be employed when the time comes to tighten  policy   Among the various measures described above for reducing excess reserves, some  appear to offer greater potential in terms of their scale or in terms of their availability  in the near term than others  Several options introduce other issues apart from  narrowly operational ones that would need to be addressed before they might be  employed on a large scale, and we are beginning to look at some of these  And for all  the tools aimed at reducing reserve supply, we are not certain about the level of  excess reserves that would be consistent with tight control over the federal funds rate;  however, we can be confident that large reductions in excess reserves would  eventually increase their scarcity value and, with it, short-term market rates   I will now quickly review the feasibility of some of the options that Jim presented  with these additional issues and challenges in mind   Issuing Fed bills or a revised Supplementary Financing Program exempt from  debt ceiling limits are attractive options partly because, unlike reverse RPs, they  avoid any need for collateral and its administration, which should also make it more  appealing to a broader investor base  But either approach would require legislative  action that appears to be problematic at this point   Selling SOMA assets on a large scale is operationally feasible even today  But  use of SOMA asset sales as a key tool to drain reserves could be limited by the  possible effects on longer-term interest rates that would be hard to predict and on  trading conditions that such sales would likely have in those markets  In addition,  asset sales could have significant effects on Federal Reserve capital, as described by  Seth   Arranging reverse RPs against SOMA assets, including agency MBS, on a large  scale likely would require developing counterparty relationships beyond the  traditional primary dealer ones  The dealers themselves are not natural lenders  They  could act as conduit between the Fed and lenders, but their willingness to play this  role could be limited because of the effect it would have on the dealers’ own balance  sheets Ideally, we would want to reach lenders to banks, especially those currently  receiving less than the interest rate on excess reserves on their lending  This includes                                                             5 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 5)                         June 23–24, 2009 22 of 261  the GSEs as possible counterparties, either as part of a broader reverse RP program or   via separate operations arranged with these institutions    Arranging reverse dollar rolls with the agency MBS we accumulate is something   we could do now We are uncertain about how large a presence we could have in this   market—this is something we are exploring—and the accounting treatment could   require us to realize any capital losses on the agency MBS we delivered even if just   on a temporary basis    The counterparties for term deposit arrangements that Jim described are, of   course, the banks and other depository institutions directly  At issue is what interest   rate incentive would be needed to induce depository institutions in the aggregate to   shift excess reserve balances into these term deposits, and specifically, how far above   the interest rate on excess reserves this rate must be  It’s hard to calibrate depository   institutions’ demand  But experience with interest rate corridor systems suggests that   maybe even spreads in the neighborhood of 50 basis points could incent banks to   place most of their excess reserves deposits into term deposits  This same   observation also holds for the two options Jim mentioned for increasing banks’   demand for reserves  the system of voluntary reserve targets or raising reserve   requirements  In either case, the question to be solved is the rate of remuneration on   reserves held for these purposes relative to the interest rate on excess reserves    To sum up, in the future under more normal financial market conditions, the   IOER framework could be a more viable tool for controlling the overnight federal   funds rate or other short-term interest rates than it appeared to be last autumn    Moreover, some potential exists for improving arbitrage in funding markets to tighten   the relation between the IOER rate and overnight bank borrowing rates  But the   System could bring additional tools to bear that collectively could be used to reduce   excess reserves on a large scale  But apart from the remaining operational issues to   be addressed, developing some of these tools to their full potential could involve   additional issues, such as moving beyond traditional open market counterparties    I would also point out the inflexibility to change the level and the   inflexibility in terms of the scope that it provides the reserve requirement structure in banks in   managing their reserve accounts  I would agree that, yes, it would work in the technical sense of   giving us some leverage over short-term interest rates, but I would say that, with the authority   that we have to pay interest on reserves, we could do a lot better and come up with something   that’s more flexible   I think it’s a good question What does the rate represent?  What does   the gap represent?  Does it represent a rent that banks are extracting, or does it represent their           June 23–24, 2009 45 of 261  own spread aligned with their borrowing rates and their lending rates?  I think that’s a legitimate   question, and in my mind it’s an open one   If we are seeing a gap between the rate that banks are earning on excess   reserves and what they are paying, I think that I would approach that situation as really an   arbitrage opportunity for us If we’re talking about reverse repos as the tool, as long as we have   the collateral and we can basically get to those depositors directly or even indirectly, then that           June 23–24, 2009 59 of 261  would be the mechanism that we would use to grow the reverse repo market  But in   contemplating the potential scale for the operations, I don’t think we should believe that we are   necessarily limited by measures we currently have of the size of that market  Rather, it’s a   matter of how many reserves we want to drain and who it is that is earning a rate from the banks   that’s well below the interest on excess reserves and therefore would be interested in lending to   us at a slightly higher rate So that’s how we would simultaneously lift rates and manage down   the size of the banks’ balance sheets, that is, bring down excess reserves and some of their   liabilities   We have thought of them  We haven’t approached them about it  But in   terms of thinking of a pool of liquidity, that might fit the kind of description I provided, yes   I don’t believe so  "
8901,2010-01-26,"  Thank you, Jim  The current accommodative stance of monetary   policy has been marked by the purchase of nearly $1¾ trillion of mostly longer-term   securities under the purchase programs and the maintenance of near-zero levels of   short-term interest rates since December 2008  In devising the exit strategy from this   policy stance, two key decisions that will have to be made over the near term are,   first, the approach to be taken with regard to sales and redemptions of domestic   January 26–27, 2010 33 of 260    SOMA assets and, perhaps most crucially, whether sales might be used as a   discretionary policy tool and, second, the appropriate sequence to be used in draining   reserves around the time of a first increase in short-term policy rates—the target   federal funds rate and the interest rate paid on excess reserves               These two issues are interrelated as, for instance, decisions about asset sales   would affect reserve levels, which could be relevant for any draining of reserves   associated with a hike in policy rates  However, these issues will be addressed   separately  This treatment is consistent with a view that the temporary reserve-  draining tools being developed, and not sales and redemptions of SOMA assets,   would likely be the principal tools used to achieve any large-scale reserve reductions   in the near term  For reference, pre-crisis levels and expected peak levels of SOMA   assets and reserves are shown in the top panel in exhibit 7  And to provide a sense of   maturity liquidity in the portfolio, also shown (in red) are potential cumulative   redemption amounts for the different asset types looking ahead several years   Turning first to possible strategies for reducing SOMA assets, sales and   redemptions could be motivated by three main considerations, which are listed in the   middle panel in exhibit 7  First, they reduce excess reserves, which could improve   the ability to control short-term policy rates, although as just noted, they might not be   the principal tool employed for this purpose  Second, sales and redemptions would   reverse the effects of the purchase programs, putting upward pressure on longer-term   interest rates and tightening financial market conditions independent of any changes   in the outlook for short-term interest rates  We should also note that shrinking the   balance sheet and reducing excess reserves could conceivably operate on the   economy through other channels, such as by their impact on inflation expectations   more directly  And third, these could be used to return the composition of the SOMA   to include Treasury securities only, which policymakers may view as desirable for   restoring credit neutrality in the SOMA   In principle, the use of sales and redemptions to operate directly on longer-term   interest rates provides the FOMC with an additional discretionary tool for influencing   economic conditions, beyond its traditional approach of controlling short-term   interest rates  A substantial reduction in our holdings of longer-term assets would   likely push up long-term interest rates beyond any movement associated with the   expected path of short-term rates, operating through a portfolio balance channel    Staff work using alternative methodologies suggests that the purchase programs have   held down a range of longer-term interest rates by anywhere from 50 to 80 basis   points through portfolio balance channels and that flow effects may account for an   additional 25 basis points on mortgage-backed security rates  SOMA portfolio   reductions might be expected to be able at least to reverse these movements  Under   this framework, shrinking the balance sheet through asset sales and redemptions   becomes a substitute to some degree for raising short-term interest rates, and   reductions in the SOMA portfolio could influence the timing or sizes of adjustments   to be made to short-term interest rates   January 26–27, 2010 34 of 260    However, several considerations warrant some concern about using asset sales   aggressively, whether to achieve financial tightening or for any other purpose, and   these are also listed in the middle panel of exhibit 7  First, there is a considerable   degree of uncertainty surrounding the effects of asset sales on financial conditions   and the economy  Given our lack of experience with this tool, our estimates of the   macroeconomic effects of changing our holdings of longer-term assets are   considerably more uncertain than those associated with changes in the federal funds   rate  Second, an announcement to sell SOMA assets would run the risk of prompting   a sudden sharp rise in longer-term interest rates, a pattern observed in reverse with the   announcements of the purchase programs  Policymakers could be particularly   concerned about the potential for a quick backup in longer-term rates to derail an   incipient recovery  A third concern is that policymakers may worry about the effects   that large-scale asset sales could have on market functioning by negatively affecting   liquidity conditions for a time  A final consideration regarding asset sales is the   potential for sizable capital losses               There are many alternative approaches to reducing the SOMA apart from ones   involving the aggressive use of sales  In the bottom panel of exhibit 7 we list several   possibilities and their respective implications for the total size of the balance sheet   looking ahead several years  Each example is intended to illustrate a different   underlying approach to the use of sales and redemptions   A strategy involving redemptions only might provide the starkest contrast to one   involving aggressive sales  The second example in the exhibit shows possible   outcomes with redeeming all agency debt and MBS holdings but reinvesting all   maturing Treasury securities  This approach would largely avoid the risks associated   with rapid sales  But possible shortcomings are that the pace of the reduction of the   portfolio would be somewhat arbitrary, uncertain (given the difficulty of predicting   MBS prepayments), and sensitive to market interest rates (given their impact on   prepayments)  One might argue that the Federal Reserve should take greater control   over the pace at which it shrinks its balance sheet to align it better with policy   objectives   Under a steady and gradual reduction approach, as illustrated by the third   example, the portfolio could be placed on a specified path involving a gradual   reduction over a number of years—somewhat faster and more certain or steady than a   redemptions-only approach—but one that still avoids the risks of rapid sales  As with   a redemptions-only approach, the portfolio adjustments would be operating in the   background, with adjustments to short-term rates used as the active tool to adjust   financial conditions  One implication of adhering to a predetermined path of decline   is that the selling of assets would have to be accelerated as interest rates rose and   slowed as rates fell, given the interest rate sensitivities of mortgage-backed   prepayments, and that could be countercyclical   Finally, policymakers could instead use adjustments to the size and composition   of the SOMA, through sales or purchases as needed, as a discretionary tool to respond   January 26–27, 2010 35 of 260    to the evolution of economic and financial conditions  There are, however,   challenges with a state-dependent approach  Policymakers may have difficulty   calibrating the appropriate response for a balance sheet rule and its coordination with   adjustments to short-term interest rates because of the uncertainty of its effects and   our inexperience with these policies  The use of this new instrument could also create   more uncertainty in the markets, at least for a time, because markets do not have any   history by which to judge the balance sheet adjustment reaction function               Given the above, the staff is inclined to recommend a strategy of slowly shrinking   the balance sheet in a passive manner, at least for a time  The reduction could be   achieved through redemptions only or through a strategy that commits to a gradual   reduction in portfolio size in which redemptions are supplemented with modest asset   sales  Policymakers could switch from this passive approach to a more active one if   economic conditions shifted in a manner that necessitated a more rapid response   using all tools at their disposal  But for any chosen balance sheet strategy, given its   novelty, effective communication will be crucial to its success   The second broad policy issue for policymakers to consider is the strategy for   sequencing draining reserves around the first hike in short-term policy rates  The   temporary draining tools being developed—reverse RPs and term deposits—could be   used to achieve a much more rapid decline in excess reserves than could be obtained   via sales and redemptions  That introduces several options for the timing and size of   reserve-draining operations with these tools around the time that the Committee first   raises the interest rate on excess reserves and sets a higher target level for the federal   funds rate  These alternative strategies are listed in the left panel of exhibit 8, with   potential benefits and risks associated with each    One approach is to drain nothing through reverse RPs and term deposits before   raising the IOER rate, and even then doing so only after some period if dissatisfied   with the observed behavior of market rates  This approach has advantages if one is   confident that the IOER rate will provide sufficient pull on short-term market rates,   including the federal funds rate, even at the high levels of reserves that may still exist   when the FOMC wants to tighten  This approach avoids the possibility that markets   would misinterpret the initiation of reserve draining ahead of a rise in policy rates as a   signal that policy tightening was necessarily imminent  In addition, it could avoid the   operational complexity and expense of conducting reverse RP and term deposit   operations at all, if it turned out that raising the IOER rate was sufficient to   satisfactorily control short-term market rates   An alternative approach would be to remove a large portion of the reserves before   raising policy rates, getting down to a lower base of excess reserves  The principal   motivation for this approach is that it avoids the possible outcome in which an   increase in the IOER rate has much less effect on short-term market rates than desired   and we face impediments to quickly ramping up various draining tools on a   potentially large scale without disrupting funding markets  A scenario in which the   Federal Reserve faces an extended period during which credibility about its ability to   January 26–27, 2010 36 of 260    control short-term rates is in doubt is perhaps the most worrisome of outcomes    Draining a substantial amount of reserves in advance might mitigate that risk, either   by strengthening the link between the IOER rate and short-term market rates or by   leaving less ground to cover if it turns out that most of the reserves will need to be   drained eventually anyway  Additional possible benefits to this strategy include the   impact it could have in convincing market participants ahead of time that the Federal   Reserve has the necessary tools to ensure a timely exit from the current   accommodative stance of policy                  Beginning to drain reserves ahead of a tightening in rates could introduce a   communications challenge to avoid any impression that draining reserves signals that   a hike in policy rates is at hand  On that score, it is perhaps encouraging that many   market participants expect reserve-draining tools to be used ahead of a tightening in   rates  An important element of this strategy would be the choice of operating   objective for draining operations in the period before a tightening in rates    Policymakers could take the amount of excess reserves down to a specified level, say   $500 billon, and then keep it there until the time when the rate paid on excess   reserves is raised  Because we are at a point where reserve demand appears to be   very elastic, even a large reduction in reserves from current levels might not be   expected to have much effect on market rates  But the use of a quantitative operating   objective for reserves during this period might need to be made conditional on the   observed reaction of the fed funds rate or other short-term market rates   Under a third approach, the first use of reverse RPs and term deposits might   coincide with an initial tightening of policy rates  Communications issues under this   option would be straightforward, but beginning to drain reserves only when policy   rates are first raised would not seem to shorten by much the interval over which there   would be any risk of the funds rate trading well below its target   Shown in the right panel of exhibit 8 are the various criteria that policymakers   might use to decide which sequencing strategy to adopt  These include the degree of   confidence about the IOER rate as a tool by itself for controlling short-term interest   rates, the communication challenges with beginning to drain reserves ahead of a   tightening, and other considerations  At this point, the staff does not have a definitive   recommendation regarding the sequencing of reserve draining  However, the   potential consequences of the worst-case outcome associated with each strategy might   point toward the second option   That concludes my presentation on this topic  In the exhibit on the final page of   the handout is a set of questions for removing policy accommodation that the   Committee may wish to consider in its discussion     I interpret the first option that is given as a strategy for the sequencing of   draining to include that, if I understand you correctly, in that it would use those temporary   reserve-draining tools only if it is observed that control over the market rates by adjusting the   rate paid on excess reserves is not sufficient  So it doesn’t presume in that case that we would   necessarily consider it a contingent use  They are there  We have them, but that strategy says,   Don’t use them until it is proven that you need them    One of the points in the asset sales memo was that there may be risks or   issues associated with an aggressive sales strategy that might preclude you from using that on the   scale that you would need in order to achieve an objective for short-term interest rates    I think that there are externalities potentially with using asset sales on a   large scale in a short period of time that set it apart from possibly using the temporary reserve-  January 26–27, 2010 39 of 260    draining tools  So it’s an option, but it’s one that would, I think, be used only recognizing that   we could be limited in terms of the scale in which we could use it in a short period of time    In terms of potential market disruption of trying to sell a large amount of   assets    A paper by Morten Bech, and I think he presented it as a bargaining   model between bank borrowers and those they are borrowing from, who do not have an option to   just sit on excess reserves, and the outcome of that bargaining could depend on what the level of   the interest rate was  I think that was probably what you were referring to    I would be inclined to say that, as far as sequencing of strategies for   using draining tools, it would largely depend on conditions in the short-term funding markets,   and as long as those were reasonably stable, even if there is uncertainty about some of the   broader macro issues, I don’t think that those would have much bearing on, say, the relationship   between where short-term rates are and the rate paid on excess reserves  Obviously, if   conditions are disruptive in funding markets as they were in late 2008, the story would be   different    Exactly    I would say that, in voting for the strategy and thinking about how to   operationalize it, what impact that beginning to drain and draining successively larger amounts   would have on short-term rates should have some bearing on how we should operationalize it    That is, we may want, to present an example, to employ the tools of temporary draining on a   larger scale until we observe it beginning to have some noticeable effect on short-term rates    The chart that Jim presented on page 3 suggests that, from current levels of reserves, we could   actually drain several hundred billions of dollars and perhaps not have any observed effect on   short-term rates of the kind that you’re describing    Well, one possibility with the use of term deposit rates, the question   would be, What would be the incremental increase in rates before you paid on excess reserves   that would be needed to induce banks to transfer a lot of the reserves from excess reserves into   these term deposits?
