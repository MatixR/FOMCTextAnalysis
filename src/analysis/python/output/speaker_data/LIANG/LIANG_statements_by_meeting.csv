7908,2007-06-27,"  The next four exhibits focus on financial conditions in the   corporate and household sectors  As shown by the black line in the top left  panel of exhibit 6, operating earnings per share for S&P 500 firms for the  second quarter are currently forecasted by analysts to be up about 5 percent  from a year ago, a deceleration from the 9 percent pace in the first quarter   However, in view of the sparseness of earnings warnings thus far, we expect  second-quarter earnings to top analysts’ forecasts by a few percentage points   As noted to the right, for the year as a whole, analysts are forecasting  8 percent growth in earnings per share (EPS), not very different from the Blue  Chip Consensus and the staff’s forecast  For 2008, however, analysts appear  to anticipate that EPS growth will pick up to 11 percent, whereas we project  that profits will flatten as margins get squeezed by rising unit labor costs   Even adjusting for a typical bias in analysts’ views, our outlook is a little more  guarded         The middle panels use analysts’ forecasts to assess equity valuations  As   shown by the blue line in the left panel, the trend-forward earnings-to-price  ratio for S&P 500 firms has stayed near its level of the past several years, and  the gap between it and the real Treasury perpetuity yield—the equity premium  shown by the shaded area—narrowed a touch in the past few months as yields  rose  But the premium remains close to its average of the past twenty years,   June 27-28, 2007 17 of 261    suggesting perhaps that investors still are mindful of the risks of investing in  equities  However, this caution seems to be less the case for smaller stocks   As shown to the right, a simple metric of valuation—the forward price- earnings ratio—shows that valuations of smaller companies, the red line, are  on the high side of their range of the past two decades  Relative to valuations  of larger firms, shown by the blue line, small-cap valuations also appear on  the high side  As shown by the red line in the bottom left panel, risk spreads  for high-yield bonds have fallen on net in recent quarters and currently stand  near record lows  To assess the risk premium on high-yield bonds, we  subtract from this spread the compensation for expected losses from defaults  that would be required by risk-neutral investors  As shown by the black line,  expected losses have been low for the past few years, and the risk premium,  the gray shaded area, is narrow at about 120 basis points  Low risk spreads  and risk premiums may be supported by the exceptional quality of corporate  balance sheets  As shown to the right, the ratio of debt to assets for publicly  traded speculative-grade firms, the red line, is just off its twenty-year low   The ratio for investment-grade firms, the black line, continues to edge down       Exhibit 7 examines corporate leverage  Some analysts have expressed   concern that low risk spreads are encouraging firms to ramp up debt, which  will lead to a sharp deterioration in corporate credit quality in the future  As  shown by the green bars in the top left panel, share repurchases have risen  sharply since 2003, far outpacing the rise in dividend payments, the blue bars   Cash-financed acquisitions, including leveraged buyouts (LBOs), the yellow  bars, have also risen  The table to the right characterizes the effects of large  repurchases on leverage in 2005 and 2006  Firms with large repurchases,  defined as more than 5 percent of assets, had earnings that equaled 9 percent  of assets, row 1, higher than earnings of 6 percent at firms with limited or no  repurchases  Row 2 shows that high-repurchase firms boosted their debt  ratios 2 percentage points, in contrast to the decrease of 1 percentage point at  other firms  Even so, the increase raised the debt ratio to only 22 percent at  large-repurchase firms, below the average for other firms  Thus, repurchases  to date do not suggest material damage to credit quality and would seem likely  to do so going forward only if firms were pressured to continue to pay out  cash despite weaker profits         LBOs tend to involve much more debt than share repurchases, as firms   typically have debt-to-asset ratios of more than 65 percent right after an LBO   As shown in the middle left panel, the issuance of speculative-grade bonds for  mergers and acquisitions, including LBOs, the dark portion of the bars, has  risen notably, and originations of speculative-grade loans for M&A, shown to  the right, have shot up  The sharp rise in loans reflects in part greater demand,  particularly for collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), by institutional  investors, who are estimated to have purchased more than half of these loans  last year  One reason for the greater demand could be the relatively attractive  risk-return tradeoff of loans relative to bonds, illustrated in the bottom left   June 27-28, 2007 18 of 261    panel  Returns on leveraged loans in recent years, the black line, are only  modestly lower than returns on high-yield bonds, the red line, but are  significantly less volatile  Thus, as noted in the inset box, Sharpe ratios— defined as mean excess returns to standard deviation—are higher for loans  than for bonds  We expect that institutional investors will continue to pursue  loans until expected returns decline, perhaps through tighter spreads or lower  recovery rates on loans  Financial data generally are not available for firms  taken private; views of examiners and rating agencies can be used to gauge  the effect of LBOs on credit quality  As shown by the black line in the right  panel, the most current, and still preliminary, reading on the share of  syndicated loans outstanding that were adversely rated shows almost no  change from the previous year and remains low  For corporate bonds, the  share rated B minus and below, the red line, stayed in its recent range at the  end of the first quarter  Although these measures provide a bit of comfort, it  may take some years to fully assess whether the operating efficiencies attained  through LBOs will be sufficient to cover the higher debt obligations        Exhibit 8 focuses on household financial conditions  As shown in the top   left panel, the ratio of net worth to income is estimated to be up on net through  the current quarter, largely on stock market gains  While we expect this ratio  to decline in coming quarters as house prices flatten and stock prices advance  more slowly, it remains high by historical standards  Moving to the right  panel, delinquency rates on consumer loans at banks, auto loans at finance  companies, and most mortgages have edged up in recent months but do not  suggest signs of stress  Overall, most households appear to be in good  financial shape  However, there are strains among some subprime mortgage  borrowers  As can be seen in the middle left panel, delinquency rates on  subprime adjustable-rate mortgages, the solid red line, have climbed sharply  and in April moved up again, while those on other mortgages have remained  low  As shown to the right, early-payment delinquency rates—at least three  missed payments within six months of origination—on adjustable-rate loans  rose further in April, though they remain modest for prime and near-prime  types, the blue line  As shown in the bottom left panel, we estimate that new  foreclosures were started at an annual rate of 13 million in the first quarter   Subprime mortgages, the red bars, accounted for more than half of the starts   As noted to the right, foreclosure starts in states with high unemployment, like  Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana, continued at a high rate but were little changed  from the fourth quarter  The sharpest increases were in four states— California, Florida, Nevada, and Arizona—accounting for more than the  nationwide increase, as house prices in those states decelerated  To predict  foreclosure starts, we have developed a model of national rates that regresses  state-level rates on house price growth, unemployment, the share of loans that  are subprime, interest rates, and other variables  This model predicts that  foreclosures will continue to rise and reach a bit more than 14 million for  2007 as a whole and 15 million in 2008, under the Greenbook assumption  that national house prices will be roughly flat this year and next     June 27-28, 2007 19 of 261      There is unusual uncertainty right now about a forecast given the   unprecedented reach of the subprime market in recent years  Some sources of  that uncertainty are discussed in exhibit 9  The top four panels present  information on interest rate resets on subprime adjustable-rate mortgages,  based on a very recently acquired dataset of more than 2 million 2/28 and 3/27  loans that were outstanding as of March of this year  As shown in the top left  panel, we estimate that as of the end of the first half of this year, 36 percent of  the loans have already had their first interest rate reset  Another 25 percent  will face their first reset in the second half of this year, and 21 percent will do  so in the first half of 2008  Characteristics of interest rate resets for this  snapshot of mortgages are noted in the right panel  The data indicate that, for  mortgages close to their first reset date, the initial rate averages about  735 percent  Most contracts specified the “fully indexed” rate as the six- month LIBOR plus a margin, which averages 6 percent, and most had caps on  the size of each adjustment        The diagram at the middle left presents a progression of interest rates that   borrowers about to reset likely will face, based on mortgages that were reset in  the past year  As shown by the red line (a slightly stylized version of the  actual data, the gray line), the jump in the rate at the first reset date is sizable,  almost 2½ percentage points, resulting in a new rate of 9¾ percent  The first  reset rate almost never jumps to the fully indexed rate, the blue horizontal  line, because of the various caps on increases  But rates are subsequently  reset every six months, and as shown on the second reset date, the rate rises  another 1 percentage point  Our data suggest that a borrower would not reach  the fully indexed rate in the original mortgage until twenty-four months after  the first reset (not shown)  As noted to the right, however, many borrowers  historically have refinanced their mortgages before the first reset date or  shortly thereafter  In our sample, 25 percent of mortgages had one reset, and  only 12 percent had a second reset       The expected resets in coming months highlight a risk to the outlook for   subprime credit quality  Fewer borrowers currently have the ability to  refinance because of less home equity accumulation, higher interest rates, and  tighter credit conditions  However, many lenders are working with borrowers  to modify their loans  In addition, our most recent data indicate that, while  credit conditions have tightened, financing remains available  As shown in  the bottom left panel, spreads on new subprime MBS issues have eased from  their peaks in April, although they have moved up in recent weeks, triggered  by concerns related to losses at Bear Stearns’s hedge funds  Subprime  mortgage originations, the full height of the bars in the right panel, while  down substantially from record highs in late 2005, are not inconsiderable   Moreover, funds appear to have been available both for refinancings, the blue  bars, and for home purchases, the green bars  My colleague Mike Leahy will  continue     June 27-28, 2007 20 of 261       The serious delinquency rate is for the pool of adjustable-rate   subprime loans, and they represent about 9 percent of the outstanding mortgages     There is $10 trillion in mortgages outstanding    The red lines are subprime    Subprime adjustable-rate loans are about 9 percent of outstandings,   and subprime fixed loans are another 5 percent of outstandings  That would be 9 percent   of the $10 trillion in total mortgages    June 27-28, 2007 29 of 261     By dollar it is very similar    If we had started this series in the early ’90s, this would be the   high  We have the stock market bubble of 2000 in here, and it has come off, but it is 5½    Even at the end of the projection period, it is 5½ times disposable income  That is   historically high  Before ’96, it would have been about 3½ or 4    We think there is probably $900 billion to $1 trillion in adjustable-  rate subprime mortgages outstanding    It is around 9 percent  If you get on the Internet and try to find a   subprime fixed-rate loan, it would be about that  We can’t find an official series, but   roughly 9    That’s right, right now   June 27-28, 2007 32 of 261   "
8122,2008-01-29,"  As discussed earlier, Treasury yields and stock prices are down   sharply since the December FOMC meeting on news that indicated greater odds of a  recession and large writedowns at financial institutions  As shown by the blue line in  the top left panel of exhibit 6, the fall in stock prices pushed up the ratio of trend  forward earnings to price  The difference between this ratio and the real Treasury  perpetuity yield, shown by the shaded area and plotted to the right, is a rough measure  of the equity premium  As you can see, this measure jumped in the past few months  and is now at the high end of its range of the past twenty years  In the corporate bond  market, the spread on high-yield corporates, the black line in the middle panel,  widened sharply, and investment-grade spreads, the red and blue lines, also rose   Forward spreads (not shown) rose especially in the near-term, suggesting particular  concern about credit risk in the next few years  In the forecast, we assume that the  equity premium and bond spreads will recede some from their recent peaks as the risk  of recession recedes and activity picks up, but they will remain on the wide side of  their historical averages  As shown in the bottom left panel, our most recent  indicators suggest that the OFHEO national purchase-only house-price index, the  black line, fell 2¾ percent in the fourth quarter; we project further declines of about  3¼ percent in both 2008 and 2009  In some states with many subprime mortgages— such as California, Arizona, Nevada, and Florida—house prices, the red line, began to  fall earlier and have declined by more  Reports of spectacular writedowns from some  financial firms may also have caused investors to assign greater odds of tighter  financial conditions  As noted in the bottom right panel, financial firms took  writedowns and loan-loss provisions of more than $80 billion in the fourth quarter   Most of the reported losses were from subprime mortgages and related CDO  exposures, but many banks also increased loss provisions for other types of loans  In  response, financial firms raised substantial outside capital and cut dividends and share  repurchases  Still, the risk remains that writedowns and provisioning will grow larger  if house prices or economic activity will slow more than currently anticipated or if  financial guarantors are downgraded further  Moreover, many of the largest firms are  still at risk of further unplanned asset expansion from previous commitments for  leveraged loans and their continued inability to securitize non-agency mortgages   Consequently, these firms are likely to be cautious in managing asset growth      Your next exhibit focuses on business financial conditions  As shown by the   black line in the top left panel, top-line operating earnings per share for S&P 500  firms for the fourth quarter are now estimated to be about 23 percent below their  year-ago level, dragged down by losses at financial firms  For nonfinancial firms, the  green line, earnings per share are estimated to be up 10 percent from a year ago   Analysts’ estimates of Q1 earnings for nonfinancial firms were trimmed a bit last  week but suggest continued growth  Robust profits since 2002 have put most   January 29–30, 2008 24 of 249    businesses in strong financial shape  As shown in the right panel, loss rates on high- yield corporate bonds, the black line, have been near zero for more than a year as very  few bonds defaulted and recovery rates were high  However, we project that bond  losses will rise gradually in the next two years as the nonfinancial profit share slips  from its currently high level  In commercial real estate, the middle left panel, the net  charge-off rate at banks, the black line, was low in the third quarter of last year  despite a slight tilt up mostly from troubled loans related to residential land  acquisition and construction  We project that this rate will rise fairly steeply,  reflecting weakness in housing and expected softening in rents for commercial  properties       A similar outlook may lie behind the tighter standards for business loans reported   in the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey  As shown by the orange line in  the middle right panel, the net percentage of domestic banks reporting having  tightened standards on commercial real estate loans in the past three months reached  80 percent, a notable increase from the October survey  In addition, one-third of  domestic banks tightened lending standards on C&I loans in the past three months   Large majorities of the respondents that tightened standards pointed to a less  favorable or more uncertain outlook or a reduced tolerance for risk  Despite wider  spreads, borrowing rates for investment-grade firms are lower than before the  December FOMC meeting  As shown by the red line in the lower left panel, yields  on ten-year BBB-rated bonds, the red line, fell about 25 basis points, and rates on  thirty-day A2/P2 nonfinancial commercial paper, the blue line, have plummeted about  200 basis points since just before year-end  In contrast, yields on ten-year high-yield  bonds, the black line, are up and now are close to 10 percent  Net borrowing by  nonfinancial businesses, shown in the right panel, is on track in January to stay near  the pace of recent months  Net bond issuance, the green bars, has been sizable in  recent weeks with most of that issuance by investment-grade firms  Unsecured  commercial paper, the yellow bars, rebounded after substantial paydowns ahead of  year-end         Your next exhibit focuses on the household sector  As shown in the top left   panel, delinquency rates at commercial banks for credit cards, the blue line, and  nonrevolving consumer loans, the black line, edged up in the third quarter, as did  rates for auto loans at finance companies through November  Some of the recent rise  in delinquency rates for credit cards is in states with the largest house-price declines,  and could represent spillovers from weak housing markets  As shown to the right,  delinquency rates on subprime adjustable-rate mortgages, the solid red line, continued  to climb and topped 20 percent in November, and delinquency rates on fixed-rate  subprime and on prime and near-prime mortgages also rose  Looking ahead, we  expect delinquency rates on consumer loans to rise a bit from below-average levels as  household resources are strained by higher unemployment and lower house prices   These developments have spurred lenders to tighten standards on consumer loans  As  noted in the middle left panel, responses to the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion  Survey indicate a further increase in the net percentage of banks tightening standards  on credit cards and other consumer loans in the past three months  Banks also   January 29–30, 2008 25 of 249    reported substantial net tightening of standards for subprime and prime mortgages,  with the latter up considerably from the October survey  In addition, spreads on  lower-rated tranches of consumer auto and credit card ABS jumped in January amid  news that lenders were increasing loan-loss provisions  That said, interest rates on  auto loans and credit cards, not shown, are not up, and most households still appear to  have access to these forms of credit  As shown to the right, issuance of securities  backed by these loans was robust through January  Securitization of nonconforming  mortgages, the grey bars in the lower left panel, was weak in the fourth quarter of last  year, and there has been little, if any, this month  But agency-backed securitization,  the red bars, was quite strong in the fourth quarter and appears to be again in January   Moreover, as shown to the right, interest rates have fallen appreciably  Rates on  conforming thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages, the blue line, and one-year ARMs, the  red line, fell, and offer rates on prime fixed-rate jumbo mortgages, the black line, are  also down  The six-month LIBOR, the rate to which most subprime ARMs reset,  plunged in January, although, even at this level, the first payment reset will still be  substantial for many households       The next exhibit presents our outlook for mortgage defaults  The top left panel   shows cumulative default rates for subprime 2/28 ARMs by year of origination  A  default here is defined as a loan termination that is not from a refinancing or sale   The default rates for mortgages originated in 2006 and 2007, the red and orange lines,  respectively, have shot up, and for mortgages originated in 2006, about 18 percent  will have defaulted by the loan age of eighteen months  This rate is higher at every  comparable age than for mortgages made in 2005, the blue line, and the average rate  for loans made in 2001 to 2004, shown by the black line, with the shaded area  denoting the range across years  Softer house prices likely played an important role  in defaults on 2006 and 2007 loans because borrowers had little home equity to tap  when they lost their jobs or became ill, or they walked away when their mortgages  turned upside-down  These mortgages have not yet faced their first interest rate reset   As shown to the right, we expect a sizable number of borrowers to reset to higher  payments, about 375,000 each quarter this year, if these mortgages are not prepaid or  rates are not reduced  While many borrowers still have time to refinance or sell  before the first rate reset, lower house prices and tighter credit conditions are likely to  damp this activity  As noted in the middle left panel, to project defaults on subprime  ARMs, we use a loan-level model that jointly estimates prepayments and defaults   The model considers loan and borrower characteristics at origination, subsequent  MSA- or state-level house prices and employment fluctuations, interest rates, and  “vintage” effects  As shown to the right, with data for the first three quarters in hand,  we estimate that defaults in 2007 about doubled from 2006 and predict that they will  climb further in 2008 and stay elevated in 2009  These estimates imply that  40 percent of the current stock of subprime ARMs will default over the next two  years       An important source of uncertainty around our projections is how borrowers will   behave if falling house prices push their loan-to-value ratios above 100 percent  As  shown in the first line of the bottom left panel, we estimate that 20 percent of   January 29–30, 2008 26 of 249    subprime borrowers had a combined loan-to-value ratio of more than 100 percent in  the third quarter of last year  If we assume that national house prices fall about  7 percent over the forecast period, as in the Greenbook, an estimated 44 percent of  subprime mortgages would have combined LTVs above 100 percent  A similar  calculation for prime and near-prime mortgages, shown in the second line, indicates  that a not-inconsequential share, 15 percent, of these would also be upside-down by  the end of 2009  While prime borrowers likely have other financial assets upon  which to draw in the case of job loss or sickness, such high LTVs pose an upside risk  to our baseline projection of defaults  Another source of uncertainty—this one on the  positive side of the ledger—is how loan modifications can reduce defaults or loss of a  home  We have limited information, but recent surveys indicate that loan workouts  and modifications were modest through the third quarter of last year but likely  accelerated in the fourth quarter  Servicers are strained working on the large number  of loans that are delinquent before the first reset  One survey indicated that servicers  assisted about 150,000 subprime borrowers in the third quarter, which would  represent about 15 percent of those with past-due accounts, but were not addressing  current accounts with an imminent reset       As highlighted in the top panel of your next exhibit, we summarize our   projections for credit losses in the next two years for major categories of business and  household debt  These projections rely on the paths for house prices, unemployment,  interest rates, and other factors from the Greenbook baseline  We also present  projections based on the Greenbook recession alternative with the additional  assumption that national house prices fall 20 percent  In this alternative scenario, real  GDP growth turns negative in 2008, and the unemployment rate rises above 6 percent  in 2009  As shown in the first column of the bottom panel, if we use the loss rates  over the past decade or two as a guide to approximate losses under average economic  conditions, total losses, line 6, would be projected to be $440 billion over the next  two years  Such losses could be considered what might be expected by lenders of  risky debt in the normal conduct of business  But conditions over the next two years  are not expected to be normal, even under the baseline scenario  As shown in the  second column, losses under the Greenbook baseline are expected to be considerably  higher than average and total $727 billion, given our outlook for only modest growth   These losses might not greatly exceed the amounts that investors already have come  to expect given signs of slowing activity  The above-average losses are especially  large for residential mortgages, line 1, including those for nonprime mortgages, line  2  In contrast, losses for consumer credit, line 3, and business debt, line 4, are only a  touch higher than normal  In the alternative scenario, in which business and  household conditions worsen further, losses are projected to rise even more, not only  for mortgages but also for other debt  Losses of this dimension would place  considerable strains on both households and financial institutions, creating the  potential for more-serious negative feedback on aggregate demand and activity than  is captured by our standard macroeconomic models  Nathan will continue our  presentation        January 29–30, 2008 27 of 249      We have revised this forecast up quite a bit since the first time we looked   at this maybe in June or August, in part because of lower house prices and tighter credit   conditions  The model requires as inputs defaults and prepayments, and the prepayment rates   have been fairly slow but not zero  The 2006 vintage, as it approaches its first reset, has been   that 20 to 25 percent are able to prepay  They are able to find something  So we don’t want to   assume that none of them will be able to  The model would approach both of those, so that is the   positive side  The downside is that our forecast, with the national house-price assumption of   roughly minus 7 over the forecast period, does imply house-price declines on the order of minus   20 percent a year or more in California, Florida, and some other places  That does leave the   loan-to-value ratio, as I mentioned, pretty high for many borrowers  We have never had this   kind of episode, so we have to make a judgment about the point at which subprime borrowers   walk away from their houses  The current assumption is that at about 140 percent we just say   you are out; but it has to be almost an assumption that, if by then you hadn’t defaulted, we would   push you out  So there is an upside  On the other hand, saying 40 percent of the outstanding   stock will default over two years sounds like a big projection as well  So we tried to balance    There are risks on both sides, for sure    Yes  We have not distinguished between who is holding the securities—  banks or investors—so mortgages would include the 20 percent or so that are commercial banks,   and it would also include those held by investors in the primary form    In mortgages, 20 percent is actually probably a pretty good estimate    They have that much of the business sector and that much of the   mortgages, so that pretty much covers it    One issue here is whether you want to do it relative to current capital   cushions  Banks can raise capital  If they anticipate that they will need to raise capital, they can   cut dividends further  I haven’t done that sort of exercise  One way to think about this is that the   average long-run rate is about 60 basis points on debt; in the Greenbook baseline it runs to about   1 percent, and in the alternative, it gets close to about 1½ percent of debt  So, it is not outside the   realm of history  It is on the high side    No, I understand  I think the third alternative gets beyond what most are   expecting at this point    In that sense, it does represent a risk that you are going to get dynamic   feedback between losses and household spending and lending—it is a high risk  So I wouldn’t   say “comforted”  I think we were saying that this is beyond probably what our models could   respond to in our typical way or it would be another dynamic feedback loop of some sort that we   don’t typically adjust for    The loans could be packaged in securities  This is debt  It includes all   debt  Now, whether it is repackaged into an MBS, it would be there  It wouldn’t be if it got in a   CDO or something    Yes  It includes corporate bonds  "
8768,2010-06-22,"  Domestic financial conditions have tightened on net since the April   FOMC meeting largely on concerns about the implications of the European debt crisis   for the US economy  As shown in the top left panel of exhibit 12, although Treasury   yields and mortgage rates have fallen substantially, broad stock prices, shown to the   right, fell notably as well, and those for banking firms (the purple line) dropped a bit   more, perhaps also reflecting uncertainties about regulatory reform  As shown in the   middle left, the implied volatility of equities (VIX) shot up  While it has receded in   the weeks following the announcement of the EU and IMF actions and other policy   measures, it remains somewhat elevated   Financial market participants and economic forecasters appear to view recent   developments in Europe as increasing the downside risks for the US economy  As   noted in the panel to the right, respondents to the Blue Chip survey in early June saw   spillover effects from Europe’s debt crisis as the largest risk to the US economy in   the next 12 months, and most believed that the primary channel would be tighter   financial conditions rather than weaker exports  In addition, responses to the primary   dealer survey conducted last week point to significantly greater downside risks to   GDP than in the April survey   The bottom two panels present measures of financial market participants’ views   about risks to stock returns—both inferred from options on the S&P 500 index  The   June 22–23, 2010 64 of 213             black line in the lower left panel plots the distribution of stock returns over the next   30 days as implied by options from yesterday, and the green line plots the distribution   for the day before the April FOMC meeting  The distribution of returns from   yesterday’s option prices is a bit wider than the distribution from the April FOMC   meeting, after having been substantially wider in May, the gold line, when the VIX   was higher                     The panel to the right shows a measure of the downside skewness of the return   distribution over time, defined by the distance between the 5th and 50th percentiles as   a share of the distance from the 5th and 95th percentiles  The downside skewness   moved up early in the intermeeting period, suggesting a higher perceived probability   of a significant decline in the stock market and increased risk aversion for a given   level of volatility  As the most recent flare-up in the VIX has subsided, this measure   has declined somewhat, but it remains relatively elevated   The next exhibit focuses on real estate and banking, two sectors that appear   particularly vulnerable to weaker economic growth    As shown in the top left panel, the number of distressed mortgages has climbed   sharply in the past few years  Mortgages in foreclosure, the red shaded region,   reached 24 million in the first quarter of this year, and, as shown by the gold region,   another 26 million are 90 days or more delinquent but not yet in foreclosure; all told,   almost one in ten mortgages are seriously distressed  Our forecast assumes that, as   the economy continues to recover, new delinquencies will continue to decline and   successful mortgage modifications will help work off the overhang of distressed   properties  The sales associated with this process are expected to keep exerting   downward pressure on house prices     As shown to the right, after their sharp drop since 2006, prices of single-family   homes seem to have decreased enough relative to rents to erase the apparent   overvaluation in 2006  We project that house prices will fall a few percentage points   more this year and then remain about flat in 2011; combined with a small increase in   rents, valuations in 2011 will be about 10 percent undervalued  However, were   employment gains to stall, new delinquencies might not decline and modified loans   could re-default at an even higher rate than we have assumed  The resulting lower   house prices and valuations would further erode household wealth and the   profitability of the banking sector   The next panels focus on the financial condition of the banking sector  As shown   in the middle left, the liquidity positions of banks have been improving  The ratio of   short-term noncore-deposit liabilities to assets (the green line) has come down in part   as banks have reduced foreign and large time deposits, and the liquid assets ratio, the   black line, has risen as cash, mostly reserve balances, has increased   The return on assets for the sector, shown to the right by the gold line, eked out   another gain in the first quarter  The increase came as loan loss provisions (the   June 22–23, 2010 65 of 213             shaded blue area) edged down, though they remained quite sizable  A measure of   gross returns, the sum of the return on assets and loan loss provisions, shown by the   dashed black line, has been relatively robust, suggesting that gains going forward will   depend importantly on further improvements in asset quality                     However, as shown in the bottom left panel, in our baseline forecast, we project   that loss rates on major types of bank loans, the first column, will ease only a bit from   current levels through next year  Losses on commercial real estate loans (column 2)   are expected to increase as property values continue to fall through this year, but the   performance of other loan categories (column 3) is expected to improve as the   economy strengthens   The expected continued weak performance is reflected in supervisors’ ratings of   commercial banks  As shown to the right, assets held by banks with ratings of 3, 4,   and 5 have soared since 2007; the $45 trillion in assets held by these banks represents   about 40 percent of the industry   The next exhibit focuses on how further adverse events from Europe could affect   US financial institutions and markets   The top left panel presents estimates from regulatory reports of banking system   credit exposures to the peripheral European countries  US banks are estimated to   have had $24 billion in exposures to Greece and Portugal at the end of 2009, but   another $208 billion to Spain, Ireland, and Italy  Combined, these claims represent   29 percent of industry tier 1 capital  Banks in France and in Germany have   substantially greater exposures, which has raised concerns among investors about the   risks of some of the large banks in these countries   As noted to the right, bank supervisors began collecting information in February   from the largest US banks about their most significant credit exposures to peripheral   Europe and about how the banks were managing their risks  Data reported by the   firms show smaller exposures than the regulatory data, largely, we believe, because of   differences in scope and reporting conventions  Based on these data, supervisors   have roughly estimated the losses that would be generated if the riskiest sovereigns   were to default, and the trading losses if asset prices were to deteriorate a bit more  A   preliminary assessment is that direct losses to US banks from defaults in Greece and   Portugal, assuming minimal financial spillovers, would not be substantial  But   supervisors have a number of concerns, including discrepancies in the data, the   potential for further spillovers from defaults to financial asset prices, and indirect   exposures of US firms, such as to large European banks or to prime money market   funds  The latter concern is heightened by the magnitude of the potential   commitments, since the largest US banks sponsor more than $500 billion of prime   money funds   The middle panel elaborates on the exposure of prime money funds to Europe    Confidential data from a biweekly survey by ICI of the largest fund families show   June 22–23, 2010 66 of 213             that the exposure of prime money funds to peripheral Europe (Ireland, Italy, and   Spain), column 1, is only 4½ percent of assets  But exposures to France and   Germany total 20 percent of assets, and to other Europe, another 26 percent  The   large exposure at prime money funds raises the potential for sufficiently adverse news   from Europe to spark a run, which could disrupt short-term funding and damage   market sentiment                  To date, money fund managers appear to be winding down positions and   shortening tenors in an orderly fashion  As shown in the second column, the share of   assets accounted for by entities of the peripheral European countries and in France   and Germany fell a total of 2 percentage points over the two weeks ending June 2    Moreover, as shown in the right-hand column, the share of outstanding paper issued   by such entities maturing in more than seven days fell, consistent with managers   being less willing to provide funds at longer tenors   In the US commercial paper market, the outstanding amount of CP issued by   financial institutions with parents in the peripheral European countries (the gold line   in the lower left panel) and in France and Germany (the green line) has been falling   steadily, while the amount of CP of firms of other Europe or the US has held steady   or risen  As shown to the right, spreads for all issuers of unsecured CP have risen   since early May, with conditions especially volatile for some peripheral European   countries   Your next exhibit reviews the effects on the US economy of the European debt   crisis scenario that was just presented by Chris Erceg, in which increased concerns   about the solvency of some European governments push Europe back into a   recession  As noted in the top left panel, the reemergence of recession and the   associated appreciation of the dollar would, through traditional trade linkages, be   enough to slow the pace of recovery in the US  But we also assume financial market   spillovers that would likely accompany such a “tail risk” event   As shown by the red line in the right panel, US stock prices are assumed to start   about 20 percent lower relative to the baseline forecast, the black line, and the BBB-  rated corporate bond rate, shown in the middle left, is 1 percentage point higher than   the baseline  In addition, banks are assumed to tighten lending terms and standards in   response to higher loan losses and the deterioration in the balance sheets of   households and businesses  These shocks are calibrated to the fallout that Europe   experienced during the US-centered crisis in late 2008   With financial conditions significantly more restrictive, the US economy falls   back into recession, and, as shown in the middle right panel, the unemployment rate   rises substantially through 2011 rather than moderating  Moreover, the persistent   level of slack leads to a temporary period of deflation, shown in the bottom left    Beyond 2011, the economy recovers gradually as the crisis abates, and the federal   funds rate (bottom right), following a standard policy rule, remains at extremely low   levels relative to the baseline for at least another year   June 22–23, 2010 67 of 213                            Your final exhibit focuses on valuations and leverage  By some measures,   corporate bond valuations are somewhat rich  Far-term risk spreads, shown in the top   left panel, which reflect investors’ appetite for risk, have risen somewhat in response   to the European debt problems, but they remain relatively low  As shown to the right,   repo haircuts on corporate securities have come down this year and are just above   levels prior to the financial crisis   However, other valuations appear less rich  A measure of the equity premium,   shown by the shaded area in the middle left panel as the gap between the expected   return on equity and the real Treasury yield, widened in May from an already   elevated level  In addition, overall leverage in financial markets from funding   markets does not appear to have increased appreciably  For example, as shown in the   middle right, triparty repo market activity has risen some since late last year but   remains well below levels before the crisis  Reduced leverage suggests that declines   in asset prices are less likely to be reinforced by asset sales of investors who might   have to unwind their positions    Finally, as shown in the bottom panel, debt growth of households (the black line)   and nonfinancial businesses (the green line) remained negative in the first quarter    Business debt is on track to decline again this quarter, as robust profits and large cash   positions limit demand for external funds and lending standards remain tight for some   firms  In addition, we estimate that households have continued to delever this quarter   as sluggish demand, tight lending standards, and substantial charge-offs limit growth   in mortgage debt and consumer credit  Bill English will continue with our   presentation    Supervisors have information they collected from the largest firms on the   largest significant exposures, which include sovereigns, corporates, financial institutions; and,   for a set of the largest firms, they have been collecting counterparty exposures on similar types   of things for quite a while  Again, these are the most significant exposures  If you’re worried   about the entire Greek economy and the whole retail exposure, they don’t have that totally  I’m   going to wrap that up into spillover effects  It’s not financial spillover, but it’s spillover to the   economy   There’s a little comfort, but we tried to emphasize how much concern there is about the   quality of the data they have  For example, there’s quite a bit of netting of things that goes on—  there are certain conventions you follow to net for the regulatory reforms, and then there are   different netting conventions firms might use for their own risk-management systems, which   supervisors need to get into to see if they’re comfortable with them  These don’t include   contingent exposures, such as undrawn commitment lines or CDS written, those kinds of things    I think there’s definitely a “next step” concerning what else they’re going to go in and get a little   more information on, and conversations with the chief risk officers are ongoing right now  "
8914,2011-01-25,"  Your next four exhibits discuss the financial conditions underlying  the staff’s forecast and highlight some key financial risks in domestic markets   As shown in the top left panel of exhibit 9, yields on 10-year Treasury notes are  about flat since the last FOMC meeting, but are up nearly a full percentage point  since the Chairman’s Jackson Hole speech in late August  Yields on BBB-rated  corporate bonds, the green line, have risen by less since August, leaving the spread to  Treasuries about 30 basis points lower  One measure of bond valuations is shown to  the right  Near-term forward spreads on these corporate bonds, the black line in the  right panel, suggest that investors are still pricing in somewhat elevated losses in the  next few years, but far-forward spreads, the orange line, are lower, suggesting an  almost complete retracing of risk appetite for corporate bonds to pre-crisis levels   As shown in the middle left, stock prices have rallied sharply since late August,  posting gains of more than 20 percent  As a result, the expected real return on equity,  the black line in the right panel, has fallen, though it remains elevated relative to  historical standards  Its gap to the real Treasury yield, a measure of the equity  premium, shown by the blue shaded region, also remains quite wide, suggesting a still  relatively cautious attitude towards US stocks  Broadly consistent with this attitude,  as shown in the lower left panel, money has been flowing out of domestic equity  mutual funds in the past eight months  In contrast, as Steve Kamin showed, flows to  emerging market equity funds have been strong  In our baseline forecast, we assume  that the equity premium will decline toward a more typical level as investors become  more confident of a sustained expansion   Despite the gains in the value of some risky assets, use of dealer-intermediated  leverage does not appear to have risen significantly  For example, in the triparty repo  market, the rise in the average daily volume (not shown) has been moderate in the  past two quarters, and as can be seen in the bottom right panel, haircuts for corporate  bonds have drifted down only slightly, although they are nearly back to mid-2008  levels  In addition, market participants have noted only selective increased use of  leverage for funding equities  Instead they have expressed greater concerns that  traditionally unleveraged investors are feeling significant pressure to boost returns  and are driving demand for some fixed-income products   As shown in the top left panel of your next exhibit, corporate bond risk spreads  for A-rated financial firms have declined since late spring but remain above those for  similarly rated nonfinancial firms, reflecting some lingering concerns about the credit  quality of the financial sector   Meanwhile, the availability of credit for households and businesses continues to  improve, albeit from depressed levels for some forms of credit  As shown to the  right, results from the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey show that a small  net fraction of banks again eased lending standards for a composite of all loan   January 25–26, 2011 75 of 282              categories over the past three months  Moreover, as shown in the middle left, a large  net fraction of banks reduced terms on C&I loans to both large and small firms  The  net easing of standards and terms on C&I loans may reflect competitive pressures  from capital markets that have been increasingly accommodative  As shown in the  middle right, debt issuance by lower-rated corporations rose sharply in 2010   Issuance of high-yield corporate bonds, the yellow bars, was very strong, as firms  took advantage of low long-term interest rates  Issuance of leveraged loans to  institutional investors, the blue bars, also increased, and market participants point to  some loosening of covenants in leveraged loans, though from still fairly tight levels   As shown in the lower left, for households, growth in consumer credit recently  turned positive, and we project a modest increase in the fourth quarter of 2010, the  first quarterly rise since 2008  Installment loans have risen with demand and an  easing of credit conditions, but credit card balances continued to contract   Despite the pockets of improvement in recent months, total debt of nonfinancial  businesses, plotted as the red line to the right, expanded only modestly in the fourth  quarter, and we expect only a moderate pickup this year and next, as firms draw on  their substantial cash holdings  Debt growth for households appears to have stayed  negative last quarter, and is expected to remain so this year, held down by a further  contraction in mortgage debt   Turning to your next exhibit, conditions in the real estate sector remain quite  weak  As shown in the top left panel, residential house prices in recent months have  been coming in lower than we had expected in the November and December  Tealbooks, and recent readings indicate that prices now are modestly below their  levels in early 2009  Going forward, we now have prices declining a bit further  before flattening out next year  For commercial real estate, shown to the right, prices  for non-investment-grade properties, the orange line, peaked about a year after  residential house prices  These property values have continued to decline, and we  expect them to remain sluggish  The prices of these properties likely reflect the value  of collateral backing many CRE loans on banks’ books   There are some notable bright spots  Prices on investment-grade commercial  properties, the black line, appear to have found a bottom in 2010, consistent with the  rise in CMBS prices in recent months  In addition, in the residential mortgage  market, fewer homeowners are moving into delinquency  As shown by the red line in  the middle left panel, for prime mortgages, the transition rate from current status to  past-due status slowed notably in 2010, while, for nonprime mortgages, the transition  rate, the black line, continued its two-year decline   Consistent with these trends, the middle right panel shows that the amount of  residential and commercial mortgages that are delinquent or not accruing interest at  commercial banks edged down slightly through the third quarter of 2010, although  the percent in distress is very elevated, at more than 11 percent of real estate loans  outstanding  Thus, despite some signs of improvements in fundamentals, real estate  losses at banks likely will remain elevated for a while   January 25–26, 2011 76 of 282              Expected credit losses estimated from aggregate models are shown in the bottom  left table  These models do not capture the heterogeneity of loans across banks, as  could be done with supervisory data that currently is being collected for some of the  largest firms  As shown in the first column, aggregate CRE loss rates in the baseline  forecast are estimated to increase in the next two years to an annual average rate of  30 percent, as distressed properties hold down some property prices  In contrast, loss  rates for residential mortgages are expected to average about the same level as last  year, and loss rates for other categories, notably consumer, are forecast to decline as  unemployment falls  Total loss rates, the fourth column, are on average about  unchanged  In the aggregate, current reserve levels, combined with projected  revenues, would appear sufficient to absorb continued losses of this size   However, as noted in the box to the right, the real estate situation could play out  worse than we expect  For example, as illustrated by two alternative scenarios in the  Tealbook, a greater-than-expected 10 percent decline in house prices would raise  bank losses modestly, although it would not be sufficient to derail the improvement in  economic activity unless other asset prices also dropped sharply and credit conditions  tightened  Another risk to banks is related to mortgage documentation practices  The  ongoing examinations by the federal banking agencies of mortgage servicers have  revealed serious deficiencies, and the agencies have commenced enforcement  proceedings and expect to take public enforcement actions against a number of the  largest mortgage originators and servicers  Other federal and state legal authorities  also are exploring enforcement actions  In addition, banks face risks related to the  alleged violation of reps and warranties provided on loans in securitization trusts sold  to the GSEs and other investors  Supervisory estimates of losses from potential  mortgage put-backs based on data for 12 institutions range from $25 billion to  $75 billion  While these estimates have been revised down sharply in light of recent  GSE settlements with Bank of America and Ally, they could still be material for a  few firms   Your next exhibit turns to problems in the euro area and the consequent risk to  domestic money market funds  As shown in the top left panel of your next exhibit,  financial institutions based in peripheral European countries have had to pay a  premium to issue dollar-denominated commercial paper  Spreads on short-dated  commercial paper issued by Irish financial institutions were very high in recent  months, and spreads for Spanish and Italian firms also were elevated  Firms have  also had to shorten maturities, and some firms have lost access to the market  altogether   Reflecting pullback by investors, outstanding CP and negotiable CDs issued in the  United States by peripheral Europe financial firms, shown as the purple line in the top  right, have dropped sharply in recent months  As can be seen by the black line,  holdings by money market funds indicate that they are the primary investors in the  paper issued by these peripheral European firms in the US  As shown in the middle  left, while major money market funds have shrunk this paper to a very small share of  their assets, paper from other European countries has remained quite substantial   These holdings of paper from non-periphery countries are a concern, because the   January 25–26, 2011 77 of 282              banking systems of those countries have substantial exposures to peripheral European  debt   As noted in the table to the right, our most recent data (now six months old) show  that banks in France and Germany have extended large amounts of credit to Greece,  Portugal, and Ireland, the first column, as well as to Spain, the second column  While  banks in France and Germany have reduced their exposures since year-end 2009,  credit extended to these four countries still represents more than 100 percent of their  tier 1 capital  The credit from US banks, the third line, is more modest   Nonetheless, US banks could feel the effects of peripheral European problems  because of their substantial ties to the large core European countries  Another  channel for risk to US banks is that they sponsor roughly $650 billion of prime  money funds and may feel pressured to support these funds if runs were to occur    In terms of domestic fiscal pressures, investors have recently become more  concerned about the implications of budgetary pressures on US state and local  governments, as reflected in rising CDS spreads for general obligation bonds of some  states  Notably CDS spreads for Illinois bonds, the red line in the bottom left panel,  rose sharply in recent months, and to levels above those for California, which have  been elevated for some time  After the recent passage of a budget with higher taxes  in Illinois, CDS spreads for a number of states eased a bit, reflecting perhaps some  relief by investors that state governments appear willing to step in to avoid defaulting  on their bonds   While recent market jitters may have been overdone, the elevated spreads suggest  investors are concerned about risks in this sector  As noted to the right, some state  and local governments now will have to pay higher rates to issue new debt, which  could increase stresses further  In addition, some could lose access to variable rate  demand obligations (VRDOs), which effectively allow municipalities that issue long- term bonds to borrow at short-term rates that reset frequently  Nearly all VRDOs  have explicit liquidity support from a bank  Borrowing costs would increase for state  and local governments if banks choose not to renew liquidity facilities or raise their  fees because of higher risks   Banks also are vulnerable to heightened concerns about this sector  Preliminary  data for the largest banks suggest that credit losses from loans and securities would be  modest  However, banks have contingent liabilities from the liquidity support they  provide to VRDOs  Six major domestic banks and a large Belgian bank (one with  high and rising risk spreads) provide liquidity support for about one-half of VRDOs  outstanding; that market currently totals about $400 billion  Thus, banks’ balance  sheets could be pressured if investors, such as tax-exempt money funds, become  concerned about the credit risk of the issuer or the liquidity provider and choose to  put back the VRDO  To date, such pressures are not evident  While tax-exempt  mutual funds have had unexpectedly large outflows in recent months, tax-exempt  money market funds have not  Joyce will continue with our presentation   January 25–26, 2011 78 of 282               In the table in exhibit 12, the middle right, the data are from the BIS   consolidated banking statistics, and they are an approximation of the US banking system’s   exposures to debt in these countries  As the table indicates, it’s estimated to be $67 billion to   Greece, Portugal, Ireland, and another $52 billion to Spain  Those are small amounts, but the   exposures to France and Germany can be large—some of their large banks are big counterparties   in transactions that we have  I don’t know if we have strong supervisory data, but we have these   data, which are not exactly the same  If you give me a minute, I can get that    Please go ahead    President Lockhart, I don’t have the BIS data on the US exposures to the   core Europeans through the banking systems  These data are going to be updated, and we’re   expecting to have a new set next week  We can pass that along, and, as you might guess, there   are significant exposures to, say, Germany and France, because they’re big countries    I’ll start this one  Just to corroborate Steve’s remarks, in April, May, and   June, when the European CDS did start rising, the correlation with US asset prices was   enormous  The second time around, it just wasn’t visible at all  In large part, it has to do with   some of the facilities that were set up in Europe    The estimate I cited comes from work by Mike Alix and staff at the New   York Fed, so it was done in a pretty comprehensive way  They literally looked at the private-  label securities that these firms had  They had the loan portfolio of mortgages originated  They   had the firm-specific default rate for each bank  They estimated how much of that might be   attributed to deficiencies in the process, and then the strength of the securities  On the basis of   that, they then took estimates of the GSE put-backs—the recent claims give you some idea  And   then they had to assess how much the private-label investors would be able to claim  So that’s   why there’s a range, because they had to make some assumptions about how high those claims   could be  These current assumptions are that the private-label investors would not be more   successful in putting back than the GSEs, which have a pretty sophisticated system  To sum up,   the estimate is based on the full portfolio of originations, firm-specific default rates, and firm-  specific put-back assumptions  So I think it does incorporate the full view  The $25 to   January 25–26, 2011 88 of 282              $75 billion is a pretty broad range, though, because it’s hard to know how successful they’ll be in   court, which is really the probability you have to write down    Yes, I think we have the estimates of the outstanding GSE put-back claims,   plus an estimate of claims to come  I think that’s all in there  "
8993,2011-06-21,"  This issue has come up  The FSOC and the Board have had that   discussion  The FDIC is also concerned  You’re right, the Farm Credit System does have about   one-third of the outstanding farm credit debt  On your point about its failure, it has a huge   surplus so that seems not to be an issue  But we have heard complaints about them causing   community banks to loosen their standards  We have been watching it  Whether it’s a systemic   issue or if it’s just something to point out and have examiners be aware of this issue is still in   discussion, but it’s good to hear it being raised again    Yes  There are about five or six committees that have been set up  One is   the Systemic Risk Committee, and that one is very busy trying to write an annual report, which   will be released, we expect, near the end of July  That’s a key committee that I think is going to   form the core of what FSOC will do going forward  It wasn’t as active over the past year  Going   forward, it’s designed to get staff together to discuss emerging risks they’re seeing  So you   would have the SEC and the CFTC and all of the banking regulators, et cetera, get together and   have discussions that will allow issues about risks to bubble  Then that committee would make   decisions about what to bring to the principals for discussion  In the past year there hasn’t been a   lot of discussion because there has been so much work under Dodd–Frank to finish  There has   been a whole slew of studies and proposed rules to write  As a result, when the principals get   together, it’s just all about approving a study or rules, without much opportunity for discussion    But I think that will change  One of the two big issues on the table right now that the principals   have started to engage in, and the staff has worked quite a bit on, is the designation of the   nonbank systemically important institutions  The FSOC was heavily criticized for not being very   transparent about how they were going about this process  They were going to put out a   proposed rule in May and pulled that back, but we’ll put out another document for comment   fairly soon  We are trying put something out to the public that reduces some of the uncertainty   about what institutions might be evaluated further for designation  There is a view out there that   June 21–22, 2011 109 of 282              the designation could encompass hundreds of firms; because there is just so much uncertainty,   there’s an effort to try to reduce some of it   The second piece right now is the annual report  There will be a couple of sections on   topics like  What does the system look like?  How it has evolved since the financial crisis?    There will be a big section on emerging threats  It won’t sound too different from what some of   you have been hearing lately in terms of what the key threats or the vulnerabilities in the system   are, including bank capital, liquidity, money markets, and infrastructure  And then there are   some recommendations that we’re now crafting  The principals will have to make decisions   about which recommendations they would want to include in the annual report and to sign the   reports  That’s what will be going on over the next four to six weeks    The goal is to release something in late July  Dodd–Frank’s anniversary is   July 21, and something around that time is the goal    For example, if we were to highlight vulnerabilities—the banking system,   capital cushions, short-term funding instability, for example—the recommendations could be to   continue to pursue money market reforms, which probably is something that the FSOC has come   to view as important because they have made a lot of progress on money markets  On the bank   capital, it could be to implement the Dodd–Frank enhanced prudential standards, plus to have the   supervisors continue with their CCAR exercises, the internal capital planning processes,   something along those lines  These will all get negotiated over the next few months, but it would   June 21–22, 2011 110 of 282              tend to be structural, regulatory reform at this point, trying to stay away from fiscal policy and   monetary policy  "
9095,2011-11-01,"  I don’t think I’m going to add too much to that  That is an issue that was   raised very quickly, and so that is something we’re reviewing to see if there’s any measurable   effect on the cash spreads and the CDS  But as Steve pointed out, in July and last year, when   they talked about extending maturities, it appeared to get shrugged off, though the effects on   November 1–2, 2011 132 of 282              CDS values were a big concern at the time  This time we’re starting to see a little bit of an   effect, but it’s a hard question to answer  We’ll try to come back with something  "
