12,1976-03-29,  Will there be any more information about the status of the Government in  the Sunshine [bill] by that time?  
38,1976-04-20,"  To come back to the point, if we made these projections today rather than  yesterday we would have a little different picture  I somehow got the impression, with the quick  review of the first-quarter report, that so much of this is inventory--in which figures I have very  little confidence anyway--that I am not sure that, in, perhaps, a conservative mood I wouldn’t  stick with what we have  I’m not sure that my opinion of the staff forecast has changed much as  a result of the publication of the first quarter  Would the staff care to comment on that?    I had interpreted it, perhaps superficially, Lyle, at least in part, as a moving  up of inventory accumulation earlier than we had expected  But that, you would say, is not the  major lesson to be learned    You do?    We understand that the majors have a significant stockpile inventory, too,  quite apart from the independents, but in truck tires it’s a more serious--    60-90 [for automobiles] and maybe as much as 30 [for trucks]    Mr Chairman, I find your reasoning very persuasive  It’s completely in line  with my own position  I would add one other dimension here that we might want to consider,  and that is that some of the confusion with regard to our targets relates to the fact that the base is  continually changing and being revised and so forth  We did a few things with the numbers last  night in working over the idea that maybe we would be on sound ground if we went to the  fourth-quarter base rather than the first-quarter base and in effect did that on a 15-month period     I would give you the way we look at it as a 4 to 7 percent range for M1  That would be  really quite consistent with the way alternative B of 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 is stated in the Bluebook  because of the difference in the base  And we would [deflect the criticisms] that I consider  somewhat petty [of those] critics who say,  “It’s too confusing the way you do these changes in  goals”  Maybe we are on firmer ground if we use a fourth-quarter base, which is indeed a bit  firmer than our first- quarter base     But regardless of that particular point, I would associate myself with Governor Coldwell in  a desire to keep the 3-point spread  I think it gives us, again, the flexibility that we need in the  pursuance of these goals  And I think the figures that you mentioned, Mr Chairman, as the  results of our first full year of experience, give some weight to the idea of continuing a 3 percent  spread, so I would go for 4 to 7, 7 to 10, and 9 to 12    I thought that was one of the reasons that we didn’t vote in the first place, to  give you the announcement effect with the committee and such interpretation as you wish to  make between the time of our advising you and the time you appear  Some of these things may  be better stated in a little different light when you go up      No, but I’m thinking again of the point of the possible immediate release     4/20/76 - 35 -            No  But, Chuck, all I’m trying to say is that we felt that that the Chairman  should have maximum flexibility in the preparation of his own statement and discussion with the  committee  There may be some of the elements in our discussion he would want to emphasize a  little differently two weeks from now than he does today    I would like to associate myself with the 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 range, Mr  Chairman  I think, again, that it’s the top figure that’s the critical one  I don’t think the lower  figure has too much practical significance at this point except as a psychological lower end of  our range     To the extent that the midpoint has significance--although maybe it has more significance  than some of us would like--I think it is better to have that up just a shade to give sort of  substance to the idea of permitting--and I like the phrase “permitting”--the market to adjust  maybe 1/8 or so higher in terms of our resistance points rather than doing any outright  encouragement in a more direct manner     I would keep M1 at 5 to 8 even though that seems to be below alternative B  Again, I  think the upper end of the range here is the critical figure  I really don’t care much whether the  lower is 4 or 5, but I think the 8 percent is quite appropriate here  And I’m really not too worried  about Chuck’s point on what may happen in May in an 8 percent [specification] where April is at  8  I think we can still qualify under that to the extent that we need to  So I would vote for 4-1/2  to 5-1/4 to show some direction, very faint it is true, and I think that’s the way it should be, and  an M1 that would have an 8 percent rather than a 9 percent top    Mr Chairman, may I humbly suggest that if 4 equals 8, then 8 equals 4, and  the sum of them is 12 equals 12, so we still have to pay some attention    Now what this adds up to, Tom, is that if we get the Government in the  Sunshine [Act], we have an even more elaborate procedure, because of the tape requirement,  than the Memorandum of Discussion [imposes] now  Is that a fair statement?     4/20/76 - 55 -            Mr Chairman, question really to Tom  Where do we stand on the  Memorandum of Discussion over the past five years?  Is there--if the suit, say, is sustained, does  that open the door to either another suit or a feeling that we should release all of the Memoranda  of Discussion in the last five years?    So this would consume all of the staff time for a long period--     4/20/76 - 58 -            --from a practical standpoint, to prepare them for documentation    Mr Chairman, I’d like to support two of your recommendations despite the  fact that I was a member of the subcommittee that came up with the other recommendation  earlier that we--    SPEAKER(?)  We were divided equally on that, Bob    Well, no, I don’t think we were, really, not on the 30 days  I’m talking  about the Coldwell subcommittee more recently  I have no question at all about the 30-day  thing  I think that should be done in any event  My only question on the other is the acute  question of psychology of the timing, whether we appear to be destroying records rather than  enhancing public records  And I think this is a real source of criticism, but despite that, my only  question in my own mind is whether I would approve this time or wait one more month and then  approve it  I think it narrows itself pretty much to that sort of position    Mr Chairman, I have one problem, though, of interpreting, even as we  know it now, approximately 30 days as being 31 to 38 days, which is really what we’re talking  about    Well, it’s quibbling, I will admit  "
64,1976-05-18,"  Mr Chairman, I might say, too, that, to elaborate on your point, even the  more sophisticated readers of our document, three or four weeks later, may be hard put to  remember whether our directive came out the day before or the day after the appearance of new  GNP figures, and this sort of thing  The timing can be sensitive, and I think it does make for   more complete background information, quite apart from the formal requirement here to have the  facts as we knew them on that day and not have people wondering, ”Sure, but did this new figure  come out before or after that date?”      Yes    Be glad to, certainly    Well, we’ll see what we can do, Mr Chairman  I would like to work with  Lyle and his people     Came from what?    On a perhaps minor point, Steve, we have noted the experience in our  District, at least, of the $2 bill that we have put into circulation  [The bills] are going into  bedroom bureau drawers, etc  The few merchants that have accepted $2 [bills] from their banks  have done so under pressure, and they come right [back] to those banks  That’s been a typical  experience, although we haven’t taken a full survey on it  Currency has been expanding rapidly   I haven’t any numbers in mind, though, as to whether the sort of thing I am describing has any  monetary policy significance or whether it’s minimal    I find myself subscribing completely to your reasoning and your figures on  the federal funds constraint  I think the 5 to 5-3/4 would be quite appropriate here, a central  point of 5-3/8 which gives us another 1/8 nudge if it should be deemed necessary    I am less sure however of your recommendation, Mr Chairman, on M1 and M2, feeling  somehow [that] it wouldn’t be quite as consistent if we were to lower the ranges as much as you  suggest and that it might hasten the arrival at the 5-3/4 percent [upper bound of the federal funds  rate] range earlier than we otherwise would anticipate  I would favor, therefore, maybe  something like 5 to 9 and 6 to 10 on M1 and M2  Of course, if we were to adopt your  prescription we could still have an intermeeting telephone or wire session to perhaps change the  5-3/4  But I feel the same way that you have indicated, that you don’t really see the need right in  the month ahead to go above 5-3/4  And I merely have that one reservation as to whether  adopting too low a range on M1 and M2 might make the increase faster than we really want     My reasoning is exactly like yours on the federal funds rate, but I think that  if we lower the top of the M1 and the M2 range, we are putting the Manager, Mr Chairman, in a  position of getting to 5-3/4 too soon, and then what do you do next  I don’t want to go above it  either    But again, my point is, Mr Chairman, are we being unduly constraining?  The Manager can [encounter] this by having M1 and M2 ranges that have too low an upper limit  "
91,1976-06-22,"  Question for counsel  Tom, is there any legal risk that the decisions made  by this Committee today will be overturned in the process of this suit?    Thank you    This may not be too relevant, Tom, but it raises a question in my mind that,  if this is unconstitutional, wouldn’t the fixing of the discount rate by our boards of directors be  unconstitutional since that’s one of our major tools of monetary policy?    Mr Chairman, I subscribe to your comments  I think I do prefer the full 5  to 6 range for fed funds with our usual tendency, which would be the same, I suppose, under  both of our prescriptions of leaving it pretty much where it is  But it gives a little more leeway to  the Desk       6/22/76 - 29 -           I think I’d like the idea of maybe 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 for M1 as against 4 to 8  I find it a little  more in tune with our longer-term objectives, keeping those in a general subtle tendency perhaps  of a bit lower  I’m thinking also that the results of this meeting will be published very close to  the time you go up to testify before the Banking Committee at the end of July  And not  prejudging where we are going to come out a month from now, I would make a guess that we  probably would not be raising those ranges  Indeed this might be in the right general area, and  although it doesn’t make much substantive difference, it probably would look a little better than  the 4 to 8  M2, I would take 6 to 10      And I would use 6 to 10 for M2, not that that is critical, but I would still pay  a little more attention to M2, as we have the last couple of times  I would lean toward a money  market directive this time, since that is perhaps a better expression of the way [alternative] B is  set up, but I don’t feel strongly about it  "
119,1976-07-19,"  I’d like to follow up on the point that Bruce made, which is really my only  question  I favor continuing our present position  I don’t think we should be frogs and jump  around just because two people who happen to be in a particular position like to see us jump   But I would like to have Mr O’Connell’s counsel on this, as to whether he sees any prejudice to  our position on the openness of our records in the instant case that Bruce referred to, by a  decision one way or another in this particular instance  Is there any relevance at all?    Well, Governor Partee has finally made my speech for me all the way down  the line  I’m not troubled by the overshoot  I think that [unintelligible] should be more broadly     7/19-20/76 - 55 -   measured  I have the same uncomfortable feeling that Chuck mentioned with regard to the  housing thing, but I see no great difficulty in explaining that to the general public     I have a slight qualm as to the tactics  We did explain to the general public that one of the  reasons for moving the M1 range down last time was that there were new factors coming into  parts of M2 that were really M1 in a way, and that [there were] movements out of demand  deposits--corporate sweeps and so forth  We are now silent on that subject, and it might look  inconsistent to people who view our reduction of the targets on M2 and M3 and keeping the  target on M1 as a reversal of the previous explanation  But I don’t think that that should cause us  any trouble     I must say I find empty the suggestion that we make a change now because it would be  hard to do a change three months from now  I don’t consider that any of us around this table is  capable of judging the precise environment in which this discussion will take place three months  from now, regardless of when you may be asked to testify  I am quite willing to be a  procrastinator on that particular phase of decisionmaking today, so I would support the  recommendation you have made Mr Chairman    I have the same feeling you do, Mr Chairman, on the ranges for the  aggregates  I think 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 in B is too high  The 4 to 8 under alternative C is all right, but  I wouldn’t even mind shading that a little bit  I don’t see any necessity of placing our upper limit  any higher, really, than 7-1/2 as a practical matter  However, I would keep the federal funds rate  range of 4-3/4 to 5-3/4, but I would adopt the money market directive wording, which I think  would work in the direction of keeping the rate closer to the 5-1/4 percent, where it is now  "
145,1976-08-17,"  You mean the tool purchases?    Well, Mr Chairman, you have articulated a couple of my points better than I  could have, but I was about to say something along the same line  I put a little different  interpretation on Mr Winn’s list, which is impressive, than I think either Mr Partee or you do  I  think that it contains some of the elements, actually, of strength rather than weakness in terms of  perpetuating the recovery  I acknowledge here your point of the midrecovery pause, or whatever  we call it  But it seems to me that many of these factors are “normal” factors--that analysis  would bring forward if we were to do it in depth--that characterized almost all of our recovery  periods over the last generation  It seems to me, therefore, that, while I recognize the somber  nature of President Winn’s list, I find in that list a number of factors that, instead of giving me  increased concern, give me a little more confidence in the lasting nature of the recovery and  expansion that we are in     Having said that, I again will revert to the type that seems to characterize all of us  I find  the staff projections already encompass what I have just said  It is a recognition of factors that  keep this from being a worrisome, if you please, type of expansion that would lead to ultra-high  interest rates, super inflation again, and a bust that would follow  So I would like to put a  positive tone on Willis’ list     I would also remind the Committee that this happens to be an odd coincidence of the  August doldrums--not always statistically measurable--with perhaps a mid-expansion phase in  our economy  And I think that, psychologically, this has considerable importance  My friends in  New York as well as in Chicago find that there is less activity going on in August than is usual   And again, this is a year divisible by four, which has something to do with it, too  People are  sitting on their hands a little more  I think the confluence of all three of those factors makes me  feel even more that I’m not ready to make a judgment yet as to whether the economy is  sputtering     One other facet of this  No one has mentioned the interpretation of some of our leading  indicators as optimistic  I noted with some interest the article in, I think, the Wall Street Journal  the other day--and I’d like to have Lyle comment on it, if he cares to--that [characterized] the  ratio of the coincident to the lagging indicators as being a very bullish factor  Again, I don’t  want to get into gimmicks, and [in this case] maybe the ratio of one gimmick to another    The ratio of one gimmick to another may be double gimmicking, but in a  political year I think we can engage in some discussion of gimmicks that’s not on the record,  especially when it becomes newsworthy enough for the Wall Street Journal to run a front page  article on it  Do you have any confidence in this particular ratio, Lyle?  Have you studied it all?    Well, one of the troubles with it, as we all know, is that it equates one stock  market [index] with one labor index with one of all sorts of things, and--granted they’re trying to  equate the trends in each one--the weighting is an impossibility  I think that the only support I  would give to such an indicator is as Lyle suggests  If that indicator upon analysis--not just  arithmetic but upon analysis--seems to give a little more cohesive support to conclusions already  formed on the basis of substantive analysis, maybe this gives me a little more comfort  We have  a discomfiture index in the weather, and we can have one in economic projections as well  And  maybe that is false analysis    We just hope it isn’t false comfort    One other observation, Mr Chairman  You, with all of your background,  found it somewhat discomforting that 4 equals 8 when we were working with the seasonal  adjustment problem on money supply  Knowing how sensitive those seasonals are, some of us  may tend to forget that they are equally poor, if I may use the term, on unemployment and more  particularly on some of the price indexes    It was called to my attention yesterday morning that some of our people have a real  suspicion, for example, of the agricultural price decline in the wholesale price index  In July the  change in the unadjusted figures was zero; this was publicized, though, as a decline of  17 percent, or something like that, in food prices  Some of my people who are very cognizant of  the construction of these seasonals say, in effect, let’s not play games  That’s the reason the  wholesale index looks so good in this last month  But ’taint really so; the seasonal isn’t that  good  So I think, again, we can draw from our own experience with our seasonal problems on  money supply and recognize that [the data on] much of our economic world is suspect in one  degree or another    I have no problem with your recommendation or your points, Mr Chairman  and Vice Chairman  I would buy alternative B  I don’t want to suggest a change in the range for  M1  But I think it might be appropriate to raise a caution that if M1, in the preliminary judgment  of the Desk and the people here, seems to be expanding because of the decline in the Treasury  balance, I wouldn’t panic and go to the top of the federal funds range just because of that factor,  because it itself is something of an aberration  It’s not something to be ignored, but it’s  something to be given a little lesser weight than other short-term movements in M1  "
166,1976-09-21,"  Alan, is this schedule that we are talking about visualized as having some  flexibility, or is it a fairly rigid schedule?    I guess this is my question  The Swiss franc continues to be very strong,  and this is a big chunk  I just feel a little uneasy, myself, [about] our ability to do it at, quote,  “current market rates”    I fully subscribe to this  I just have the uneasiness going along with the  subscription    I agree, too, Mr Chairman, on the wider federal funds range--4-3/4 to 5-3/4  I think is quite appropriate and it doesn’t box us in quite as much as the 5 to 5-1/2 would seem  to, at least in the public gaze  I don’t see any real difference in the effect of one versus the other  on the way the Manager would operate, but he may wish to comment on that       9/21/76 - 26 -     As far as M1 is concerned, 4 to 8 is fine  I had initially written down on my note sheet,  Mr Chairman, 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 on M2, which was the figure that you started with and then  changed to 8 to 12  I certainly have no reason to differ from the 8 to 12  I share the point,  though, that Governor Wallich made on our M2 range  I do feel fairly strongly that it shouldn’t  be as high as 9 to 13     On the reserve requirement point, in case all the members of the [Federal Reserve] Board  aren’t familiar with it, the Conference of Presidents meeting in Chicago last week adopted a  recommendation to the Board with regard to reserve requirements  It went along the lines that  we could see merit in some announced plan late this year, perhaps the last six or seven weeks of  the year, as to our intention to reduce reserve requirements, perhaps over some sort of a  scheduled plan starting with some reduction before the end of calendar 1976  Seasonally, even  though the seasonal may not be very great this year, there still would be some reason to provide  reserves in this way  And, indeed, we feel further steps could be taken, even when the seasonal  is more neutral, because of our ability to offset the effects in open market transactions    Mr Chairman, I intended to pursue with Alan on the question, would he  operate any differently [unintelligible] 5 to 5-1/2 versus 4-3/4 to 5-3/4?    I would agree with that     9/21/76 - 29 -      Mr Chairman, I’m not sure I understand the reason for moving back to the  aggregates directive as against money market  "
189,1976-10-19,"  Mr Chairman, first of all, an observation  As an ex budget director, I think  Lyle is on the right track in his feeling that the most logical explanation of the underspending at  the federal level is, if I may use the term, budget padding by the agencies in terms of their  inflation assumptions that are never stated, probably, even by the OMB  And again I have no  knowledge of this, it is just surmised, but it seems to me a very logical chain of events that would  lead to an explanation of the present underspending level     I find that I share substantially Lyle’s comparing the Greenbook forecast of just several  months ago with the very little changed Greenbook forecast today in terms of risks that are  involved--he felt we were likely to exceed our estimates of two or three months ago, with the risk  much greater on the downside now  I like this formulation in my own mind because it gives me  a separation of a--granted--judgmental forecast, but with an added fillip of judgment that can’t  really be quantified at all     On the other hand, while defending this approach, I must say, well, that’s an economist for  you  Why doesn’t he change his figures instead of just reappraising the risk as being greater on  the one side in one case and greater on the other side in the other case?  He is telling us, in effect,  that the outlook is not so good as it was two or three months ago, and it’s not nearly as good as  the comparison of the figures would indicate  I was wondering if Lyle had any comment on that      That’s my question    Is it operationally possible?    I also had written down, before you spoke, the same federal funds  range--4-1/2 to 5-1/4  I share Paul Volcker’s comments on how this worked out last time, and I  think it worked out very well  I would be willing to try it again on much the same sort of  approach that was taken by the Desk during the last month     Maybe it’s just a quibble, but I share some of the same problems that Paul has with the 5 to  9 [for M1]  I would prefer 4-1/2 to 8-1/2  I think I would rather see Ml go a little bit lower than  the 5 percent--although this is terribly minor--before, in effect, we worry about our limits on  federal funds  I feel less strongly on the 9 to 13 [for M2]--8-1/2 to 12-1/2 is fine with me      Well, I personally prefer, Mr Chairman, sticking where we are, 4-1/2 to 7  [for M1] with a rise in M2 to either 8 to 10 or 8-1/2 to 10-1/2, which is the prescription in  alternative B  I didn’t consult with the doctor who prescribed alternative B, but it seems to me  that this does have some announcement effect that is very slightly toward easing, and the only     10/19/76 - 49 -   rationale, or the major rationale, for taking your prescription in preference to this--for Ml at 4-1/2  to 7--would be if you indeed did combine it with a rise of 8-1/2 to 10-1/2, and I think you could  cover the possible, indeed, perhaps likely, misinterpretation that we were squeezing too early  here on the long-term ranges by doing that  But I still have a preference for the way alternative  B is stated by the staff    "
228,1976-11-16,"  Mr Chairman    Where does this, what is our position in relationship to the supervision of  our domestic commercial banks if we have a feeling such as you just expressed?  Do we,     11/16/76 - 8 -           policywise--is this related in any way to our member banks in order to avoid a possible problem  that they might have if there were a debt moratorium on the credit extended?      To what extent do you visualize coordination to be sure that we all read the  agreement in the same way?  I can see a possibility of one Bank including something, then Reuss  coming back and saying, “Well, where’s this from the other 11?”  And this sort of thing  Should  the Conference of Presidents [of the Reserve Banks] be involved directly in terms of, shall we  say, monitoring this, or should O’Connell--     We think it is very important that it be done    If he were to have any of his staff people contact any of us directly to get  further information, what would our posture be, Tom?    In other words, you would eliminate all executive committee meetings that  act on the discount rate?    [Unintelligible] is an even bigger question mark  They have no familiarity  with, nor have they paid as much attention, as usual, to the statements that have been made in the  campaign or to the extent that they have, they write some of it off as campaign rhetoric  They’re  waiting for a philosophy to be expressed  It doesn’t mean that they expect that to be against their  interest, it’s just another element of uncertainty, and I think that’s [unintelligible] the stock  market which again [unintelligible] has heightened the uncertainties    Mr Chairman, I’m prepared to accept a repetition of our range at this time  on federal funds for a 4-1/2 to 5-1/4  I feel strongly about the 5-1/4  I do not want to see a 5-1/2;  I think it gives the wrong impression all the way along  I could be talked into a 4-1/4 on the low  range as against a 4-1/2, but I think my preference is the 4-1/2  It gives a feeling of stability, and  yet, the midpoint being 4-7/8, I think this is something that we can gradually work toward  It  would give a little feeling of ease to go along with what I agree, too, should be perhaps a 1/4  point change in the discount rate  I wouldn’t go as far as Frank  I, too, have resisted movement  within my board to lower the discount rate  It’s been quite a vocal and articulate response,  interestingly enough, by the bank members [of my board], not by the nonbank members  I don’t  know how you would explain that to the chairman of the House Banking Committee  But I find  that this is the way the sentiment runs    I have already indicated to our board of directors that my recommendation is  still firmly in favor of keeping the discount rate where it is, but I’m not guaranteeing that there  would be no change in that recommendation as we look to the next full board meeting, which  would be a week from tomorrow     On the M1 and M2, however, I guess I split a little here  I think I prefer the 3 to 7 [for M1]  and the 10 to 14 [for M2] as the points to watch on our ranges for November-December  I share  some of Frank’s problem with the 2-1/2 [lower bound for M1growth] looking awful [skimpy],  and I haven’t that much confidence in the figures  I’d rather just round them, and I’d round up  rather than down in both cases  "
255,1976-12-20,"  Point of information--is the word “collaboration” in the present directive    I wanted to raise this at some point, Mr Chairman  [My point] doesn’t deal  with the specifics here, but I think it should be raised, and that is the absence of a preamble of  some sort as to what the philosophy of the swap line is  The absence of such a preamble kind of  bothers me  I have no solution to this  I throw it on the table only as a problem  We used to talk  about creating liquidity with the fixed exchange rate; those references have appropriately  disappeared  But I’m just wondering if we are at some point along here in need of some  defenses as to why we are in the swap business  I don’t see it  I miss it    Yes, I see this, Henry, and I think it is appropriate, and I can’t define too  well what’s bothering me, but I’m looking for something more philosophical    That’s right    That’s why I brought it up at the tail end of my discussion, Mr Chairman  I  don’t think it has direct relevance to the specific documents we are looking at today, but I think  it does have direct relevance to our policy as a System    Well, John, my only problem with that is, again, a question of tactic,  strategy, and timing, as to whether it would be unfair to ask Henry and his associates to open     12/20-21/76 - 22 -         up--first of all, we would have to develop a statement here ourselves that we would agree to, it  seems to me, and second, Henry would then have to enter into a further discussion with Treasury  on it  And I’m wondering if it would be inappropriate, timewise and strategically, to introduce it  right now  But I think it should be there somewhere along the line    An observation and then a question  We have found in our probing among  our directors and other business contacts that the time has come to again say that the subjective  feelings of the executives and economists that we’ve been talking too are a little ahead of the  statistics  In other words, the statistics are still weakening in some areas, stabilizing in others,  but are really not optimistic yet  And yet we detect a little more cautious optimism than a month  or certainly two months ago with regard to what you might call the flavor of the business  outlook     The question, I guess, has been largely answered already, but I’ll ask Lyle anyway for a  little elaboration  My question was how much of your improvement from last time is due to  fiscal stimulus, and how much is the economy coming up on its own  If I read you correctly, the  improvement, say, by the fourth quarter, from 49 percent real GNP growth to 64--you attribute  two-thirds of that to fiscal stimulus and one-third to the economy without the fiscal stimulus   Am I jumping to a conclusion, or is that about right?    Oh, you would have    Well, now, I am puzzled, because I thought you agreed with me when I said  about two-thirds was fiscal stimulus  Now aren’t you saying that all of it is really fiscal  stimulus?  From 49 to 64?    Well, what I was looking at is your page I-7 on the staff projections, and the  fourth quarter of ’77, 49 for a month ago and 64 for the current projections  And I gather from  what you’re saying, that since we did have an improvement built in a month ago, that really the  additional improvement here is fiscal stimulus    Thank you    Also, the ground is frozen now, and the subsoil problem isn’t going to get  corrected until we have thaws, and the moisture now that is there in the form of snow helps the  soil from blowing away to the extent that it isn’t frozen  But there is still a serious problem  around our area; the subsoil moisture has basically been used up     12/20-21/76 - 54 -          Well, again, it depends how the snowcover corresponds with the ability--if  the ground’s frozen, that snow isn’t going to do much good--it will just gradually evaporate  The  snow has to be there later on in the season  You’re right, it is too early to make firm judgments  on the crop fate, but it has got a lot of people worried    These are exceedingly small differences, and I think most of us emphasize  this  I find myself, too, Mr Chairman, in the group favoring the 4 to 5 percent range  I favor a  bigger range than 3/4 of a percentage point, somehow--constitutionally--and have for many  years  I think we have tended to narrow the range too much  I feel that the difference between  4-1/2 and 4-5/8 is again very minor, but I like the psychology of at least seeming to tip our hat in  the direction--internally, at least, to let the new cut in the reserve requirement work its way  through market psychology without feeling that we have some sort of a duty to offset it     I also feel that the monetary aggregates are sufficiently difficult to predict here, and I  would widen the range just a little bit on the M1 and M2  I would go from 2 to 7 on M1, and I  would go from 9 to 14 on M2, because I don’t think we really want to make any significant  moves within those ranges  I don’t feel that they are too broad if we were to do that  I still have  a bottoming out philosophy that doesn’t say go down straight but, really, make a saucer  And  “make a saucer” to me includes a recommendation again on 1/4 percentage point on the discount  rate to make it clear to the market [unintelligible], in effect keeping our credibility as a System in  the recognition of the market here and our flexibilities     These are all very minor adjustments  I could live with the prescription just as you gave it,  Mr Chairman, but I prefer just a little bit here  I don’t want to call it fine tuning, but I must  apologetically say, I suppose, that is what it is  "
283,1977-01-17,"  But there will be a uniform rate from the BIS to the British    I was thinking about the countries    I see    Mr Chairman    If the Congress were to support the position that you’ve just outlined, isn’t it  still possible that suit can be filed by some people who aren’t happy with that and take it to the  courts?  Or is that not a--    Yes, I can find that  Well, “this firm” refers to one of the economists for  one of the retail firms--“this firm” is in an excellent position to know  “This firms believes that  the Department of Commerce sales data that show a flat trend in summer and early fall reflect an  erratic seasonal adjustment and that sales did not really level off  Also, it is believed that  government data understates sales of specialty stores, in apparel, appliance, furniture fields”   Lyle, do you have any view on that?    Just a question to Lyle  Several months ago we heard quite a bit of  discussion on the corporate side that tax liabilities were being piled up in ’76, payments were  low in ’76 based on ’75 profits, and the place where this would begin to pinch was in the spring  of 1977  I haven’t heard a word about that for a month or so now, and I noted nothing in the  discussion today, either written or oral, on the subject  Does that mean, Lyle, that this was  blown out of all proportion and really isn’t significant?    Thank you, Steve, I heard a figure in excess of $10 billion, which seemed  awful high at the time  This reassures me    Just one other observation on the employment side, Mr Chairman  I don’t  want this to be interpreted as expressing any lack of concern for the point that Steve mentioned,  which I share, but I made the point before that I wondered what would happen if we just took  civilian employment and related it to population in the United States--preferring on some  occasions to take a gross measure because of all the difficulty we have in fine tuning all of these  adjusted measures  I found it rather significant     We didn’t do [the exercise for] every year, but we took years that we thought would be  significant back to 1929, and I am glad to report that civilian employment in this country as a  percentage of population is at its highest point in history  Now that means conversely that that  proportion of the population that is not employed is at its lowest point  Don’t pursue this too far,  but I think it is a rather interesting observation  We measure all sorts of things in international  statistics on a per capita basis  This is a per capita basis in terms of civilian employment  Not a  new record by a large [amount], but it’s 407 percent as against 39 percent in ’29--slightly over  40 percent but not as high as ’74  Civilian employment divided by total population--it’s a very  simple statistic on an annual basis    This is just civilian, but it includes government civilians    Yes, it’s less gross    Of course, there are differences again, over time, as to what proportion of  those slightly under 16 or slightly over 16 are working or aren’t  This is merely a terribly  simple-minded approach that anybody can look at  And, by the way, the Wall Street Journal  yesterday had a column that approached this same point  It’s not something to use in devastating  the worriers about unemployment, but in terms of mouths to feed, in terms of standard of living,  total population I think is quite--after all, we are all supposed to be equal in this regard, one way  or another  It has some merit    We have had natural gas shut off to a number of large users, but they have  been able to convert to other fuels, and there has been no big unemployment as a result of this, or  plant closings    I am quite willing to accept your prescription, Mr Chairman  I started out  going Frank Morris’s way--no change  Then I began to worry that, just about the time that we  come up for this three months from now--and I feel much surer [now] in my own mind--I  wouldn’t want to see us make a change [then]  And if we’re going to pursue our longer  objectives, I would rather see us do it now  Congress is either going to be in the process of  passing a tax cut or will have just passed one when you go up three months from now  And I  think the eagle eye will be placed on us 10 times--well, it will be 10 times as difficult to explain  a change in our targets at that point than now, everything else being equal, which of course it  never is     But on the basis of what limited foresight we have at the moment, I would prefer to see us  make some recognition of our desire to reduce the ranges over a period of time  I subscribe to  cutting the lower [end of the] range on M2 and M3 because I think that, if you look at the  maximums and minimums of all three of these ranges, these are the least sensitive ones in terms  of what you might call our justification for going above or below, in a minor way, from the  minimum of the M2 and M3 ranges  M2 and M3 ranges are in part a product of Regulation Q  and the disintermediation process, and, unlike Phil Coldwell, I see no objection to eventually  widening the spread a little bit on both M2 and M3 rather than narrowing [it]    Well, Mr Chairman, I [do not have] a very decided preference, but I do  have a preference for Chuck’s prescription on a 4-1/4 to 5-1/4  I think a 1 point spread--I find it  a little more comfortable than a 1/2 point  I think we are zeroing in a little too closely on the  federal funds constraints if we make it only a 1/2 point spread     On the M1 and M2, the differences between alternatives A, B, and C are minuscule, and I  find that we’ve sort of become dedicated to a 4 point spread here  I see nothing wrong in this  instance to have a 3 to 8 on M1 and a 7 to 12 on M2  Not with the purpose of embracing all  three assumptions, which sounds sort of Machiavellian, but rather just to indicate that, again, we  are not going to have trigger points that are really unreal here  And I think the spread both ways  would give us a better feeling with regard to the way we are using the federal funds     As far as the money market versus the aggregates directive, I have a slight preference for  money market, but it’s very slight  "
308,1977-02-15,"  Did he say why?    Just one observation following up on what Steve was saying  I think there is  another phenomenon that’s added to uncertainty that we tend to forget in-between time  We  have almost a semiannual regularity of the August doldrums and February depression, in terms  of attitudes, and I think this has been accentuated this year, and as they say, this too shall pass   The stock market decline has not helped it, either    I really have no trouble with alternative B, Mr Chairman  I think you could  make a case for keeping the federal funds range just where it is now--4-1/4 to 5--on the grounds  that we don’t know about the weather and so forth and so on  But I think I would be rather  shocked if we took advantage of going even to 4-1/2, much less to 4-1/4  So there seems to be  no great [problem] here other than the usual one of not being able to see clearly     I have no problem with the M1 and the M2 growth rates as they’re spelled out here  I  think that wrestling with that problem is at least one more month down the line  And I don’t feel  that we ought to consciously try to curb the M1 expansion too much in anticipation of the  rebates  I think we’re in a more appropriate posture to play that as we see it when they come  about   "
335,1977-03-15,"  Is there any concern, Alan, about the viability of South Africa as a gold  producer because of their racial problems?    Seconded    This is cumulative for the year?    Well, there’s also been the theory, Mr Chairman, as you know, that with the  advent of greater inflation in the last few years, agencies have padded their estimates more, just  as a protective device  And that all of this hasn’t been wrung out by the executive budget  process    I think it’s faded, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, I have never felt any confidence in the velocity projections   I asked my staff, though, to go back and chart the actuals of annual rates of change from one  quarter to the same quarter a year later to see what it looked like, and I find the projections a  little more comfortable with that background in mind  Not only have there been, oh, I think it  comes to about 26 quarters out of the last 30 years that we have had more than a 5 percent  velocity change; but more important than that, I note in charting this that there is definitely a  primary and secondary peak in every business cycle all the way along the line, with the possible  exception of ’70-’73, where it isn’t as apparent  The secondary peak typically is not quite as  high as the primary peak, but there is a definite recurrence of an expansion in velocity later in the  cycle    Yes  This is M1, though    Well, again, my remarks were made by Paul Volcker, to whom I give my  thanks  I have the same reasoning that he has, apparently  Maybe it’s because I’m holding in  my hand the Federal Reserve Bank of New York pencil, which I apparently stole when I was  there two weeks ago, and it must have some effect     But, anyway, in the precision, I’m slightly different, I guess  I wouldn’t care to move  below 4 to 8 for M1  I think I would want to move down from the 5 to 9 because I’m also  concerned about getting closer, not precisely, but getting closer to a bracketing of our long-term  range  Particularly since the last two meetings, we’ve skidded along fairly close to the very low     3/15/77 - 28 -           end of that range  And I don’t want to give the appearance here of as significant a change in our  short-term target as going 3 to 7, 5 to 9 would indicate     This may be imagery, but I think it is still of some significance  I would prefer a 4-1/4 to  5-1/4, Mr Chairman, for the range, just raising the upper end of the fed funds range a little  But  I don’t think I would tamper with the 4-5/8 to 4-3/4 as the inner range at this point  That is all    I note at the bottom of page 1 of the report of the subcommittee that one  member of the subcommittee, namely Governor Gardner, favored continuation of outright  System operations within recent limits and so forth  I find myself somewhat sympathetic to that  point of view--although there are no reasons as such given in the footnote--for a reason that  doesn’t appear really in the memorandum anywhere  We have in Chicago a development, which  is still in its infancy, to encourage the development of a bankers’ acceptances market in Chicago  which would be, in some phases at least, independent of the market in New York; maybe  independent isn’t the right word, but it would be able to stand on its own feet  Our banks feel  that there are certain advantages in this in terms of physical transfer of bankers’ acceptances,  which, of course, are trade-related, and we have a great deal of international trade going out of  Chicago, and it’s growing     The main reason that I can remember that we encouraged the continuation of the bankers’  acceptances operation at the Fed earlier was to in effect nurture a market which hadn’t developed  as well as perhaps we thought it might develop  Maybe that is true in New York  It hasn’t  developed as well as I think it should in Chicago, and there may be other centers, such as, for  instance, San Francisco, where this sort of development might be on the horizon     Adoption of the subcommittee’s report, I realize, does not close the door on the possibility  that there might be some way in which the Federal Reserve Banks, in areas where a bankers’  acceptances market is developing in the future, could participate in that  But I am inclined to  think that it would be easier to do it under the adoption of Steve’s favored plan here, rather than  the plan as recommended by the full subcommittee     3/15/77 - 37 -          "
361,1977-04-19,"  I have several questions for the staff, Mr Chairman  First of all, I don’t  want to phrase this too crudely, but the President’s anti-inflation program came out Friday  Did  this influence--is there any allowance for this in the revision of the projections?    Second question, there has been a lot of talk about people having spent their  rebate already, in anticipation of its coming  Did staff find that persuasive enough to make any  allowance in your revisions?    My third question relates to the projection of real GNP in your latest  revision, which shows an increase in real GNP with the rebate out for the fourth quarter, and first  quarter and second quarter next year  I guess I am a little surprised that you have introduced a  negative effect of the rebate--if I may put it backwards--in that projection  Am I correct in that  assumption?    I see, so you really have to look at the real dollars here, rather than the rates,  to completely understand    We tend to do this elliptically, to make it simple, but sometimes it gets more  complicated    Very few seasonal loans, Mr Chairman, even fewer than Kansas City   Maybe we haven’t marketed it as well as they have  But there’s very little interest in the  seasonal loan program even with the liberalization on selling fed funds    Well, I think this is part and parcel of a much broader subject, really, Mr  Chairman  Perhaps liberalization of adjustment credit generally  The line between the two is  extremely difficult for our banks to perceive      We’ve not heard this, Phil, in Chicago    Legislative action is almost certain to postpone the need for detailed  analysis too, I think  It’s going to take them a long time    Well, Mr Chairman, I agree completely with your recommendation on M1  for the very same reasons, this area of uncertainty and the potentially serious misunderstanding  of our objectives if, [at] the moment the rebate disappears, it seems that we are about to tighten  up  I think that would not serve us well in our administration of an even-handed policy  I feel,  in looking at our own charts on this, that to keep the 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 is actually a little more  conservative from the present base than it was from the base that we are leaving--in other words,  the fourth quarter     On the M2, I was prepared to propose that we go the half percent on both ends  I don’t  think this would be damaging, because whether we like it or not, the basic emphasis is still on  M1 and will move only very slowly into M2  I think it does put us into a position, if we use  6-1/2 to 9-1/2, of supporting our basic thesis of reducing the ranges over a period of time  And  yet I think it would be quite acceptable on economic grounds and quite acceptable in the area of  analysis that relates to some tightening of interest rates, which I think would be a reasonable  expectation coming out of the energy discussions     But the principle element in my reasoning is still the element of uncertainty we have  dispelled  One uncertainty with regard to the rebate, we are substituting another one, perhaps  even more serious, on the energy costs side, and I would prefer to bide my time on M1      I like your prescription of 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 Mr Chairman  I would keep the  M1 and M2 ranges just where they are  I would prescribe though, a continuation of our idea of  an asymmetrical inner range, and 4-3/4 to 4-7/8 appeals to me as permitting probably the degree  of flexibility that we need  I would interpret it in the first week or so, however, broadly enough  to encompass 4-11/16  I wouldn’t set the fire engine out    Mr Chairman, it seems to me that it’s flip a coin because our precision  doesn’t match our finite aptitude to focus on either one of them      Yes  "
389,1977-05-17,"  Just one supplementary comment, Mr Chairman  We have checked out  some of our heavy-goods industry people since the energy message occurred, and they have no  changes contemplated in their capital spending  Part of this is just time, but to the extent that it’s  been discussed, and it has been discussed quite a bit in these companies, they see no effect at this  point on capital plant and equipment spending    I might add, Mr Chairman, that farmland values and sales prices in the  Midwest are continuing up  We have 10 percent higher just in the first quarter of this year  We  were expecting that this would level off  This is a 40 percent annual rate--sales are basically at a  40 percent higher price than they were this time a year ago      Mr Chairman, there are two aspects of this farm pricing question  Some of  it is accounted for by speculators  A large part of it, however, is accounted for by dollar  averaging by the existing farmers who have such a low price basis for their existing farms that  they can get their neighbor’s farm at a decent price--I should say, even at an inflated price  It  still pays them to pick up that property and, in effect, dollar average it in, and they can still make  money on that basis     The part of it that worries me most, though, is those, like [those in] John’s statement, who  are amateurs in this business  And to the extent that they can persuade farm organizations and  congressmen and so forth for greater price supports for aid to agriculture to, in effect, support the  value of their farm later on--this is something that isn’t too evident yet, but it may be--     Not as such    Mr Chairman, as a preamble to my remarks, I should report an observation  coming out of my recent brief vacation in Greece  I decided that, despite my confidence in the  staff projections and in the ability of this Committee to do a good job, I’d like to consult the  independent sorts of wisdom, so I spoke with the Oracle at Delphi about monetary policy  The  Oracle is strangely silent about M1 and M2  The Oracle gave me the impression that these  things had to be viewed in longer[-run] terms, and one shouldn’t be too concerned with things  that are happening right at the moment     The Oracle in effect then suggested that I look around me and make my own observations   I observed that Greece at this time of the year was very green  It was raining when I was there  I  interpreted this as the Oracle telling me that we did have, indeed, at least plenty of liquidity in  the country and maybe too much  I also observed around me the ruins of half a dozen treasures  of the city states of Greece  I noticed that the treasury of Athens still had its walls intact, but the  roof had fallen in  I took this to mean that we, too, should be concerned about the affairs of the  Treasury     To get back from Greek mythology--the Oracle was often wrong on substance--I find your  prescription quite appropriate today, Mr Chairman  I wouldn’t object to going to the zero to 5  on M1, or the 3 to 8 on M2  I feel that, indeed, looking at this in a little longer perspective,  we’ve had this increase in M1  I suspect that this may be a place for a pause in our movement  upward, which I think may proceed over a period of time here  But I would prefer going along  with the 5 to 5-3/4 percent range in the money market directive  I think the 5-3/8 is a suitable  midpoint at this time  I have as a side issue a little concern that if we start paying more attention  to M2--I’m not disputing Mr Balles’s analysis, I think it is a very good one--[but] we may find  that we are giving ourselves too much stimulation in terms of over-reliance on a target of M2;     5/17/77 - 33 -           [it] may mislead us with regard to M1, to which the market, for better or for worse, still pays  most attention  "
406,1977-05-27,"  Dan [unintelligible]    We can’t hear you in Chicago    Is this a new ruling, Paul, with regard to the IRS coming down hard that RPs  are loans?     5/27/77 - 4 -       And this is within recent weeks?    Thank you    Mayo agrees    Just said that I agreed, Steve    "
425,1977-06-21,"  Of course, Dave, they never have and they never will  I think that’s part of  the--    No, the government  But I think this is a characteristic of the business  community    We have to evaluate [it] in terms of degree of decibels--it’s a little different   And I guess I basically come out much as the Chairman does  That businessmen are paid to  complain, and you have to--this is very sensitive--we do not have any index of businessmen’s  complaints  We have to judge it by what they are doing in spite of the complaints, and business  is good  Even the one of the most profitable huge food companies in the  Midwest--worldwide--the chairman told me the other day--“Well, it’s pretty good, Bob, but it  could be better”  But that was in view of an outstanding record for the first quarter and for 1976,  and he is one of the highest paid executives in the United States  That’s his way of expressing  things  And you get used to this  And you evaluate differences in the way they say it    It seems to me that’s the better course to go, Mr Chairman  I don’t  visualize this, just by reading the explanation correctly, as a seasonal at all  It’s an increase in  the money supply that is on the books of the private sector for a longer period of time during a  month, during the year      Well, I was on the same track as Frank--I think this is an absurdity in the  [sense that] it causes people to suggest, when they hear the explanation, that we are all nuts  down here  It isn’t even clear--even if we say it’s washed out, well, we are saying it really isn’t  washed out because it makes a difference in the way the rates go  And if it is not washed out--if  we are saying that, well, the Social Security recipient actually has on average more money in the  month of July than he would before, [then] I think there is a real increase over the entire year   Maybe it’s tiny here; maybe it’s only 1/10 of 1 percent in the overall, but isn’t that what we are  saying, that it isn’t strictly a seasonal?     6/21/77 - 26 -          But on average it is, and so that enters in--to put this absurdly, perhaps--this  enters in to maybe 1/10 or 2/10 of 1 percent higher money supply growth for the entire year , or  an annual rate of 2-1/2 for the month of July  And so we should theoretically set our long-term  target ranges one-tenth or two-tenths higher for what is an absurd factor  And I think this does  make us look rather foolish  So I would vote very strongly for an adjustment to wash the thing  up     Not necessarily  If you are a Social Security recipient and you have that  money two days earlier, you have an average balance of cash for the month of July that’s higher  than it would otherwise be, right?  It hasn’t anything to do with August, September, or any other  month  But it’s an absurd economic practice    It affects the monthly average by 2-1/2 percent, Paul  Now, what I’m  concerned about is the expectation in the marketplace that, by God, the money supply is  exploding on us again    I’ll second it    Mr Chairman, I feel quite strongly that the federal funds rate range should  remain exactly where it is  I feel also, though, that I would rather adopt the monetary aggregates  specs of C, because I am concerned--I don’t want to see us move as much as the fed funds range  would indicate if, indeed, we only get a 2 percent or 1-1/2 percent increase in M1 and,  correspondingly, with M2  So, I would prefer to see the lower ranges adopted by this Committee  for both M1 and M2 as being quite consistent with the 5 to 5-3/4 range  I also prefer the money  market directive, but I don’t feel strongly about it  But I think it is the preferred course this time    So the decision is basically whether the facility is worthwhile or not?    Do you want a motion to that effect or would you just rather have a--    Isn’t this function quite well justified, Paul, as part of, in effect, the  execution of monetary policy, in that we know instantly what’s going on?  If it were through  commercial bank channels, we would know, but it wouldn’t be that perfect information    If I were a central bank, Paul, and I went into the New York market, I  wouldn’t be content, would I, to just deal with one bank  I would split it up    And then these things get magnified out of all proportion in terms of what  you might call market turmoil  Now, theoretically, we are not concerned with market turmoil; it  always settles through  But as a practical matter, aren’t we?  Isn’t this what would happen?    And I think this is an appropriate central bank function and we ought to  enthusiastically support it  "
451,1977-07-19,"  Jerry, the high-employment budget chart strikes me as being even more  artificial than usual, if I may use that phrase  How do we calculate the high-employment budget  balance these days?  It certainly still isn’t back at 4 or 4-1/2 percent unemployment    Yes  And that’s why it looks so artificial    Well, I guess my point is, my problem, Jerry, is that the concept is just  becoming so obscure that I’m wondering why we even pay much attention to it, calculated that  way, with participation in the labor force on an entirely different structure  Even the goal of 6  percent unemployment seems difficult to attain these days  And to even show figures--I’m not  criticizing staff--the basic idea, I think, becomes misleading  Anybody who saw a chart like this  would say ho-hum, we’ve got everything under control, if they look at it just as the chart shows,  wandering between around zero here, or to the other extreme--it’s absurd  I’m dramatizing it  perhaps a little too much, but I feel that this is almost a waste of paper     I also have another question  It’s a much more short-term question  I was curious--on this  chart on personal saving, is there any theory that some of this dip in the personal saving rate     7/19/77 - 10 -    reflected an anticipated rebate that didn’t occur?  People spent the money before they got the  rebate, and now an effect is showing up?  Is there any of that in there?    Sounds like a Masonic Lodge to me  One further question that’s more  broadly based as it relates to our upcoming discussion on the range of our goals over the next  year on monetary aggregates  If you were to construct these figures--your outlook on 5 percent  as against 5-1/2 percent as a central tendency--would you have significantly different results?  I  am not asking for detailed answers, but do you find that the change in the basic assumption on  M1 and M2 makes only a marginal difference or a significant difference on the basic economic  factors?    Well, thank you very much    Chuck, I think you’re right on the allocation of time here, which is precious,  but I found the staff’s answer to my question important and yet I don’t want to pursue it in detail   They have developed a model--we certainly are all sophisticated enough to know the perils of  these models  And their judgment as to the increased perils in this particular case, we have that  in mind, plus the observation that over the next year it’s only 2/10 percent difference in real GNP  and 1/10 percent difference in the deflator  [But] even if it’s double or half of that, I find that  [result] sufficiently in what you might call a philosophical ballpark to have some influence on  my own thinking as to the long-range paths on M1 and M2    But we are revising these paths quarterly, so I take some shelter in that    Chuck has said what I have in mind very well  I think we are still in a  strong recovery, even though it is slowing and we see these various evidences and various  problems for which we have no solutions at the moment     I would merely add one other observation on the capital spending thing from one of our  principal capital goods [firms]  This is a [firm] that has decided to expand, but they can’t get the  people who actually let the contracts to go ahead and do it because not only do they feel  restricted by government regulations, environmental and others, but they are also afraid to spend  the money that the top management is now authorizing them to spend because they are afraid  that the measurement of their success and their productivity will be adversely affected  They  have lost a lot of their willingness to take risk in the present environment  It’s nothing new, but  it’s got a cumulative, pervasive effect that could be worrisome    We have the same problem as the market does in interpreting us--what’s a  wiggle and what is a trend?    It’s akin to the bar examinations    Mr Chairman, I come out with a preference for the 4 to 6 prescription for  M1  I feel that, again, it would not only continue our basic policy, which you have appropriately  announced over time, but this is an occasion where it fits in terms of a period where the economy     7/19/77 - 36 -    is growing strongly, and yet where I think we can set an example for the whole free world in  terms of our monetary goals, as they are widely publicized  At the same time, I wouldn’t change  M2 at all  I think it’s all right just where it is  This illustrates further our concern about the  development of substitutes for M1 that are in the M2 category  And if you again look at our  record on M2--and I wouldn’t change M3 either--we’ve really overshot slightly the last three  annual periods for both M2 and M3, even though we’ve been in the target range on M1     So I would take this opportunity to get a little better realignment of Ms--1, 2, and 3--by  lowering to the 4 to 6  That’s my preference on M1  I wouldn’t be disturbed, however, if the  Committee did adopt your prescription of 4 to 6-1/2    I was with you through the M1 and M2, Mr Chairman  I think that is the  right course to go  I would expand the federal funds range, however, to 5-1/4 to 6 percent on the  grounds that I think we need a little bit more freedom  I think it is in line with what we have just  talked about on our targets on the longer term, and that’s why I also subscribe to your formula  for M1 and M2, because I think that 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 effectively covers the 4 to 6-1/2 that we were  just talking about, realizing that you need a wider range in the short run  So that’s where I would  come out  I would see us moving toward maybe 5-1/2 to 5-5/8 as the central point only if we are  pushing that upper limit of 7-1/2 percent on M1    My proposal was that you didn’t move the fed funds rate until you get very  close to the end of your M1 range    As a practical matter, Mr Chairman, it seems to me what I was saying, it  conforms to rules 1, 2, and 3  "
477,1977-08-16,"  I don’t want to dwell too much on this, because basically, the comments we  have had out of our directors are, I think, quite consistent with the staff projections  And so it  gives support, I would say on the “feel” side, to what you might say is a more statistical  approach  We have some softness in the Midwest in farm machinery and some other heavy  equipment  We still have a drought situation right around Des Moines, with the corn crop being  basically a failure in about seven counties in Iowa     But the rest of Iowa and the rest of the Midwest in our area is rejoicing that even subsoil  moisture is beginning to build up again, and the drought is behind them  They have record crops  expected in Iowa and Illinois in soybeans and corn--[for those crops] they are the two leading  states in the country     The farmers, of course, are feeling poor because the prices are so low, but this is the  market economy at work  It has its effect on bank credit  They are against price supports [in]  principle, but they are looking forward to the benefits of new legislation that will give them two  bucks for their corn instead of $185    Yes, they are  Down to 60 days    Well, statistical studies to date apparently do not support the position that  the options market on calls has done anything to depress the general market  My elbow is still  uneasy about this  There is a counterculture, if you want to distinguish it that formally,  developing now with the evolution of puts, that will counterbalance the calls, and the market will  be better again  But this is getting into real mystique  I don’t think anyone really knows what  he’s talking about  And the effect of the options market, either puts or calls, it’s very minor,  except psychologically, and I would support what Willis said on the insider facet of the market     I think you are correct, Mr Chairman, in your evaluation of the almost smothering  uncertainty among businessmen or among investors, many of whom, of course, are businessmen   We also know that that is a characteristic of the [stock] market, that it goes in sheep-like fashion   I think I would give quite a bit of support to Chuck’s point, though, on the further uncertainty on  the capital gains side, even though much of the market is institutional, where capital gains are  only a secondary factor     As long as I have the floor, one other observation on the real estate speculation  We see  definite signs, Mr Chairman, as far as farm real estate’s concerned, that the wild, and I use the  word advisedly, wild increases in farm real estate prices that have taken place in the last two  years are leveling off  They’re still increasing, but the low prices for corn and beans are catching  up with us    The current fad of indexing hasn’t been mentioned here, which I think  supports the same analysis that’s been given, as an additional factor, with people saying, I give  up, I cannot--no investment manager can give me a consistent record of beating the S&P 500   Let me get an index fund that will buy the S&P 500  And they rush out of the big ones into the  little ones in order to balance their portfolio, in quotes  Now this is an important marginal factor    Well, I was thinking of the Dow Jones [industrial average] in particular   The general market has performed better in the last year than the Dow Jones has  And our thrift  plan has performed better than the Dow Jones has    Very strong in central Michigan, northern Michigan    2 percent    Second the motion    When you say prediction of M1 by the model, this is over what period?   How do you define the word prediction?    Where we are, or over what period?    I see    Mr Chairman, I am bothered here about something else in terms of our  yardsticks  We have again an illustration in July of a huge increase, way beyond what we  expected  Some people may say, well there’s the Fed with its seasonal adjustment factors again,  and yet it’s pretty obvious, in answer to that, that, well, forget seasonal adjustment, we are up 7  percent in M1 from a year ago, that washes out the seasonal adjustment factor  Which brings me  back to a concern that we are dealing here in a real world where interest rates are not seasonally  adjusted, thank heaven, where we are talking about flow of funds in the market that isn’t  seasonally adjusted  We appraised the stock market without any attempt, again thank heaven, to  put in a seasonal adjustment  I’m just wondering if, in sorting out some of our own analysis, we  are failing to be able to appraise except on a year-to-year basis  The difference between the  unadjusted figures and this margin, which you have mentioned so many times, Mr Chairman, of     8/16/77 - 29 -           the fragility of our seasonal adjustment factors  I guess what I am saying is maybe too  philosophical to be considered seriously at this meeting but--    Well, what I am saying is, I am trying to maybe even take refuge in looking  more at unadjusted numbers than we had before, and not that I lack any confidence in staff to do  the best job they can in seasonal adjustment, but it may be that we are dealing in an area were the  unadjusted numbers over a period time can be analyzed quite constructively along with the  others  Now, I hesitate to say this because we’ve got too many numbers already  But maybe we  need a substitution of numbers, not an addition of numbers  End of speech    No, I mean let’s get rid of some other numbers--it sounds like a budget  director--let’s get rid of some other numbers that maybe aren’t as valuable  I don’t mean a literal  substitution of unadjusted for adjusted  That would be a mistake  We are entitled to our best  evaluation of the seasonal     But if I may take one more minute of the Committee’s time  Thirty years ago I was in  charge of doing the revenue estimating base in the Treasury  We had to get our base figures  from Commerce  Obviously you do your revenue estimates not as seasonally adjusted figures;  you do them unadjusted  The Department of Commerce was able to give us unadjusted figures  on everything except farm and nonfarm entrepreneurial income, where they had to go to great  lengths to create unadjusted figures for us to use in the Treasury  The absurdity of that has  stayed with me to this day and, I guess, colors what I have to say  End of second speech    Oh, I understand that, Steve    Well, I understand that, and I guess I’m just asking for a further sharing of  that base so that the Committee judgment as well as staff judgment has a greater input on the  unadjusted figure    I bet it went up a great deal  But the question of--    My comment is not meant that you can explain all of the difference in M1 in  that one month  It’s probably only a small amount  It’s a question of being unable to sort out the  apples and oranges  We get a bale of fruit--a box of fruit; here I’m getting all mixed up with my  metaphors    Mr Chairman, isn’t it that we’re looking to a slowdown in the rate of  inflation as the net result of our policy?  The net slowdown in the rate of money supply growth is  secondary  It seems to me that this is very important, what Frank has said, because we’re saying  the real interest rate component of long-term interest rates is indeed rising, but the inflationary  premium inherent in those rates is declining    But again, the 18 percent has to be looked at in terms of our inflation rate  I  consider this a ship that passes in the night, the 18 percent    Mr Chairman, first a vote of enthusiastic support for the new concept of  transaction M1, M15, or whatever we want to give it as a nickname  I would hope that this is  the beginning of a serious effort of this Committee to study carefully the implications of a  reconstructed [M1] that would indeed lead to a redefinition  Perhaps it would be a redefinition  for range-setting purposes in your congressional testimony     Having said that, my arguments for my position have already been stated  I will merely  state the conclusions  [For the federal funds rate], 5-3/4 to 6-1/2; I agree with what Steve just  said  And I guess, come to think of it, I agree of what he just said on M1 and M2--0 to 6 and 3 to  9  I would not like to see us make changes triggered by about a 5 percent increase in M1  I  think that would be unfortunate  I believe in the asymmetrical philosophy on the federal funds  rate of 6 percent being the center  I feel we should have a monetary aggregates directive here  because I am ready to see a little more increase in fed funds, and I think the intention is properly     8/16/77 - 51 -           focused on the behavior of the aggregates right how  Some of that focus is out of my control, but  I think much of it is there     I want to give a word of support to Phil Coldwell’s statement on reserve requirements  For  the factor that you do mention, I would reserve judgment until friends under the dome at the  other end of Pennsylvania Avenue go home for vacation  Regardless of what happens to  legislative proposals, [and] unless I’m wrong in my estimate of when the seasonal demand is  over, I think we will still have time to take some action, and it will be less controversial  And  appropriate     I would do the discount rate change immediately  I think it would be essentially a  confirming action  I think Roger has put it very well in his statement  If we wait more than past  the end of this week, I think it would be misinterpreted as somehow a sign of further tightening  rather than a confirming action  My recommendation to my board a week ago was a quarter  [point]  I have seen what has happened in the interim  I expect if this were to come up again this  week, my recommendation would be a half [point]  But I think doing it immediately is more  important than whether it is a quarter or a half    Are you speaking of 12 heads?  May we remind you that Chairman Burns  didn’t lose his head when it went to 8 percent    So was mine    But if it is a dead issue, if they have no desire to revive it, is there anything  that is scheduled to happen, or is it in their court--if they decide not to pursue the matter, will it  just die?    Mr Chairman, the ball, then, is in their court  Governor Coldwell said that  he didn’t have the authority unilaterally to take action without submitting it to this Committee   But does anyone know that this Committee is presently discussing this or that action is being  taken?  Does the New York Times know this?    We’re not sure, sir, that the Times is even still worrying about this  We had  a terribly lengthy meeting this morning  Wouldn’t we have every reason in the world to say that  we didn’t get around to any decision on this  I just wonder what purpose we serve by being so  totally conscientious that we act on this and get right back to them, when they might have let the  whole matter drop    I think that’s a sound position, Mr Chairman  I would also raise two points  on the Hannaford amendment  First--just a political judgment, it probably isn’t worth the price  that you’re paying for it--but such an amendment wouldn’t get anywhere or would be twisted  around in a way that a few of our friends in different parts of the Congress from Wisconsin have  made it apparent that they were upset that we discontinued the Memorandum of Discussion and  would like to have the names mentioned and so forth, particularly going back to five years for  historical purposes  As we know, the people in question wrote to all of the, as far as I had heard,  living ex-members of the Board of Governors and Bank Presidents to solicit their opinion on this  subject, and as far as I know they failed to get any great resounding vote of confidence in the  need for the Memorandum of Discussion       8/16/77 - 65 -           So, on both of those grounds, I feel that the Hannaford amendment discussion here may  not be productive of something that would be helpful to this Committee  Therefore, I would lend  complete support to what Tom and Governor Gardner have suggested  Quite apart from my  personal feelings that, as to the merits of [alternative] one versus [alternative] three, we can  discuss that some other time    If there is reasonable doubt, let’s find out first    Well, it’s alternative four we’re voting on here    It’s alternative four on which we’re expressing ourselves    If they want to use it for political mischief, Mr Chairman, January would be  an ideal time for them to have it anyway  "
506,1977-09-20,"  Full employment is still defined as around 4-1/2 percent?    Oh, gee    But my point is less extreme than Herb’s  Isn’t 5-1/2, say, just to pick a  figure, a much more reasonable figure than 486?    And that puts quite a different complexion on the figures that you would be  using  You would be far short of a full-employment surplus if you adopted that    In other words, you have done the figures on something like the 5    That’s reassuring    I would have expected, Jim, that you would have placed more weight on the  effect of the stock market on capital spending plans than on personal consumption  Because the  small man is out of the market  Granted that he has a psychological factor of watching the  market go down, but I would have thought that you would have placed even more weight on the  seriousness of the effect on the managers, not only of investment portfolios but also of capital  spending plans [in] a deteriorating market    I could add, Mr Chairman, that as far as the Seventh District is concerned,  it’s rained just about every other day since the first of August, and not in the concentrated form     9/20/77 - 27 -   in Kansas City, but it has basically restored a good share of the subsoil moisture lost, and the  farmers are now shifting their worries to whether they can get the corn harvested because the  fields are too muddy    And let’s pursue further, Mr Chairman, the development you reported on  last time, of the development of M15 or whatever we care to see    Mr Chairman, I want to subscribe to your preamble  I must say, though,  that I also come out with a slightly higher M1 upper end and M2 upper end, as Phil Jackson did   Otherwise, I find that we may be pushing ourselves up a little too soon if, indeed, we have a late  September as well as an early October that gets us a little out of bounds  So I would prescribe 3  to 8 for M1, 4 to 9 for M2  This may not seem consistent, but I guess I have enough of a  monetarist leaning--if I redefine a monetarist leaning to embrace what has happened to the Ms  over a period of a year, which I’m trying to do here--I think I do become more sensitive to the  monetarist leaning when we get over a year of over-target performance     But I would go to 6 to 6-3/4 for the federal funds range and would not find it  uncomfortable if, indeed, we used the 6-3/8 midpoint, making it symmetrical  I think the time  has come when we have enough evidence, if that’s the word, vis-à-vis the targets that have been     9/20/77 - 44 -   announced and so forth, that I would not object, let’s put it that way, if the Committee’s  objective on federal funds were perhaps a little higher than those who have spoken thus far  But  only marginally  "
530,1977-10-17,"  Second    I’m wondering, though; it may be statistically possible because there is  some slope to the curve  It’s taking off of figures from the preceding year    Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, on the international [outlook], I spent the  week before last in Japan and was faced with this very question, time and time again, as to the  dollar-yen relationship, and mostly with reference to what pressures were going to be within the  two governments  And my answer was the very simple-minded, “Well, we have departed from  Bretton Woods, we have a relatively free foreign exchange market, and indeed I have faith in  that market determining the proper relationship between the two,” and the yen moved from 263  [yen per dollar] to 253, and I didn’t get my name in the paper     On other things, the forecast, I’m a little troubled by the staff’s estimate of housing starts  being, I think, too optimistic for 1978  Many of our people, not just analysts, but the economists  of suppliers in the building industry, feel that we may already have topped out in terms of the     10/17-18/77 - 7 -         new housing starts  And also, I note that the consensus, for what it is worth, for ’78--at least  around our area--is under 2 million, not--what’s yours, 215 or something like that?  And so our  chart on housing starts would look quite different from yours  This is the only place where I find  a significant departure on the analysis side, and I was wondering if there were any particular  factors that gave you this optimism    Well, the range that I saw, the very highest, was something like just slightly  over 2 million, and the average was well under it, say 18 to 19, and your figure seems to be a  little above the top of the range of quite a few economists that we’ve talked to    Yes    Partly, they have no wallboard; there are all sorts of shortages that are  holding things up  It was different from the shortages three years ago that held a lot of things  up--for instance, you couldn’t get plumbing fixtures, but you could build most of the house and  put in the fixtures at the end  This type of building material shortage now means you don’t get  the house up to put the plumbing in in the first place and don’t have walls    Insulation is a problem, wallboard is a problem, and I am not up to date on  this, but I have the impression that some forms of framing lumber are in very short supply    Yes, I think that’s right, Phil  And furthermore, our people have come to the  conclusion that, as far as the impact of disintermediation is concerned on the thrift institutions, it  isn’t the 6 percent breakpoint, it’s a higher point than that because most of the new money has  gone into CDs and a lot of it into six-year CDs, where the penalty of getting out would raise the  entire breakpoint of disintermediation      I have two other observations, if I may  This is relating--    This is relating to agriculture    Just briefly, Mr Chairman, one of which is on the subject that we’re all  following but wasn’t mentioned in the forecast  I don’t think anybody tries to make a forecast of  this, but it relates to the valuation of farmland, sales of farmland  We have had an astronomical  increase in many of our Midwestern states in farm values  We have preliminary results, which  we haven’t published yet, on our own survey at the Bank on the value of farms in our five states,  and we find a decline for the first time in Illinois of 8 percent, a decline of less than that in  Indiana and Michigan, no decline in the other two states    A decline over the preceding quarter  For the first time since 1960 for the  District as a whole    No, there isn’t really any--this is a decline in sales prices of land    8 percent in Illinois  But Illinois rose more, it rose 41 percent in ’76 or--    This is estates selling property at auction, in part, and just the open market  price, Mr Chairman, of farmland  And this is what’s in our survey, and this is the first downturn  in the value of farm land in our district since 1960  Quarterly    Yes, I am    Well, no, but a corner has been turned    Oh sure, but a corner has been turned, and we haven’t had a corner for 17  years  The second observation relates to the credit side  Many more of our banks are recording  some worry about the need for a renegotiation or extension of loans that are current loans on  farm operations, that the situation is growing rapidly  I’m not saying it’s serious, but I’m saying     10/17-18/77 - 13 -         that there are a lot more loans that they’re just going to have to extend that are not going to be  paid off this year  That’s all    I’ve heard less of this recently than a few months back, but that may not  mean anything    So moved     SPEAKER(?)  Seconded    Mr Chairman, I think you have given at least all of the reasons for various  alternatives that I have thought of  I think your narrowing of them to the two is quite  appropriate  I find myself strongly in favor of leaving the M1 range unchanged  I believe that  the achievement of our basic objective of lowering the monetary aggregates ranges can be best  achieved by a reduction, perhaps even more than you have suggested, on M2 and M3 and let that  stand as our monument, if you please, to our dedication to a reduction over a period of time of  our monetary ranges    Well, monument isn’t the right word  Okay  I accept that, Mr Chairman--  let’s say as the illustration of our dedication to principle here, and the principle is, I think, very  important  I would find that to change M1--in my book, at the moment--runs significant risks of  misinterpretation without any compensating substantive value  To reduce M1 in the light of our  experience over the last two quarters, I think, would be widely interpreted--whether properly or  not may be beside the point--as an exercise in, well, maybe even stubbornness in view of our  failure in the eyes of many people to achieve performance that matches our ranges     I would not feel it appropriate either--as apparently you have concluded in your disposition  of the third alternative--I don’t think that widening the range on M1 really buys us anything but  trouble--misinterpretation of both the reduction of the lower [end] and great puzzlement or even  giving up on inflation on any rise on the upper end  So I come down fairly strongly, Mr  Chairman, for holding the line on M1; as showing, again, our dedication to a monetary  range--which, I think, for M1 alone is an adequate representation of our determination--to keep  the rate of M1 growth, with all of its frailties--at least the midpoint--roughly equivalent to the  real economic growth, with only a small accommodation for inflationary factors  But I would  reduce M2 and M3 perhaps as low as suggested in alternative B, 6 to 8-1/2 percent for M2, 7-1/2  to 10 for M3  Thank you    I’m not far apart from Governor Jackson  I think I would prefer 6-1/4 to 7  with a 6-1/2 asymmetrical midpoint  I don’t share John’s concern about the relationship of the  upper ends of the short-term range vis-à-vis the long-term range because I think the same  argument can be made on the lower ends, that we are below the ranges that we just suggested, so  I don’t think that I’m particularly worried about that  For M1, 3 to 8 is fine with me, or I don’t  mind the shading [of] 1/2 percent[age point], and M2 the same way  Either B or C ranges on M1  and M2 are, I think, satisfactory in these circumstances  "
560,1977-11-15,"  Mr Chairman, it seems to me that there are two parts here  I’m  emphatically supportive of what Steve has said on the procedure on the legal side  I think we  have an obligation to ourselves, if to no one else, in that regard  But I’m sensitive to Henry’s  point, too  But it seems to me this is a proper [project], of how we frame our directive at this  table today--with an eye that maybe we will have to release it on December 1 and frame our  directive accordingly  And that I think would--    No, I don’t mean that, Mr Chairman  What I mean is, the selection of a  money market directive versus a monetary aggregates directive to me has some significance here  with reference to this point of release on December 1  Whether we determine a midpoint in the  directive or just state a range has significance, if we’re going to get stuck, let us say, on  December 1  I don’t think that’s changing any rules of the game    That’s what I mean     11/15/77 - 11 -          Yes    But I would let that appear in our discussion of the directive today rather  than having it necessarily done as part of the discussion as to whether we appeal or not    Oh, it will--a range    Sure    That’s what I have in mind, Chuck, exactly    No    Or you could omit the funds range     Yes, you could, approximately    Today’s meeting    It seems to me it has  We’ve changed it many times    Mr Chairman, let me make my point a little clearer here  I really don’t  subscribe to the idea of getting rid of the ranges  I think that would cause great attention right  away  But we have used subtleties of words in widening of ranges in a statement of  asymmetrical midpoints and zones of indifference so many times, I don’t see that there’s  anything wrong, for instance, if we should decide today  I’m not proposing it  Supposing we  decide that we want a full 1 percent spread in the federal funds range  Is that something that  would [get] the court’s attention or the Congress’s attention?  No  And this is the sort of thing  that I have in mind, that is completely within our prerogative and can be established traditionally  in our practices, [and] that we just keep this in mind as we go through our debate later today    Right     11/15/77 - 14 -          He’s left of center field  He’s still in the ball park, let me put it that way    One more procedural question or legal question  Tom, is our instruction by  the court to publish the directive?  It isn’t to publish the entire Record of [Policy] Actions?    Okay  Thank you    So moved    I generally concur with the staff projection  I think it’s just about the same  as my own  I would merely mention one other factor, which I dwelt on a little bit the last time,  and that is that, at least in the eyes of many of our bankers in the Midwest, we do have a  somewhat depressed state of agriculture in our District  We have this survey that we do  quarterly on what bankers think or what their attitudes are  It’s largely attitudinal, supported by  some figures, but there is a higher proportion of bankers who are mentioning a deterioration in  credit conditions than at any time in over a decade  Almost half of them now consider that their  loan-to-deposit ratios are higher than they really desire  I mention that they are talking about  figures in the 60 to 65 percent area, which may not seem high by urban standards, but they are by  rural standards     I would mention also that the sale of tractors in our District is down 38 percent as against  only 25-28 percent nationally in September  [The sale of] combines is off 25 percent, as against  10 percent nationally, and it’s even worse in Illinois and Iowa, by the way  These are, at least,  things to keep in mind  I don’t suggest they are serious, but they are a little bit unnerving at the  moment  Land transactions--the prices of land in Illinois and Iowa--Illinois, particularly--have  gone down 8 percent since the last quarterly survey  This doesn’t, in itself, worry me too much  because [the prices] are still at least double what they were just a few years ago  But to the  extent that this gets built into the credit analysis, I think it does unhinge some of the bankers      11/15/77 - 24 -         Most of the bankers we have talked to say that they think this trend, not only on land values but  also on credit conditions, indicates some further deterioration    A 6-1/4 to 6-3/4 [percent range for the federal funds rate] is fine with me  I  have a slight preference for the 1 to 7 [percent range for M1] and the M2 that goes with it    Why don’t you ask the question, Mr Chairman, would anyone object to a  money market, or to an aggregates--    Sorry about that    Mr Chairman, might I raise one point on specificity--a very good word; I  can’t pronounce it  Would there be any advantage in our rephrasing our statement, under either  directive, to say “at about current levels,” rather than saying “at about 6-1/2 percent” when we’re  describing the central point of our directive?  Lines 31, or 81-82, or 63-64?  I would think, in  view of our earlier discussion, there might be some advantage, but it’s--    --63-64, where we describe the central point at 6-1/2 percent  Would it be  better--I think we have as good a case as we’ll ever have for doing it this time, to say “at about  current levels”  "
585,1977-12-19,"  Well, just continuing on the same theme, I think this is an excellent report,  and my only question is, I guess like Phil Coldwell’s, to put it a little different way, I think there  is perhaps a slight violation, in the 1/2 point recommendation, [of] the basic principle that the  Chairman enunciated quite well, that the Partee [sub]committee was not making policy  I think  we are trying to judge this prematurely  We may come down in the February meeting to a  decision that maybe a 3/4 spread is what we would like to do, and I don’t see any necessity of  inhibiting such a policy decision by a very more pontifical decision now that, well, 1/2 percent is  probably as much as we should do  I would obey the conservative instinct here, but I wouldn’t  give it a quantity  I guess that’s all I’m saying      Ordinarily, yes, you have all the escape you need  I just come back to the  Chairman’s recitation of what we have been doing over the past year, we’ve had a 1, and a 3/4,  and some halves, all of which have been justified in our minds at the time we did it  I don’t see  any reason to decide today that we are going to depart from that, so I feel that we are discussing  this too much, I guess is what it amounts to--thereby adding to the discussion     Sure  Well, that’s really all we are saying     12/19-20/77 - 21 -          We are starting from a half, and it’s logical to consider that [as being] home  base as we feel our way here  And we will be feeling our way  I had one question which was  raised by the speculation earlier  Well, suppose the aggregates are coming in stronger, and we  decided we do have to make a move  This may seem like a silly question--it would have been a  silly question two years ago; maybe it isn’t so silly now--but, honorable counsel, are we well  protected in the Freedom of Information Act from somebody coming in and saying, “Say, you  are moving the federal funds kind of fast within your ranges  Do you have information that we  don’t have as to the behavior of the aggregates?  I demand such information under the Freedom  of Information Act”      These are reports from all of the member [commercial] banks that Steve  Axilrod gets in, and so forth  To what extent is this privileged?     Oh, you are making judgments on undependable information?    I am trying to state, be a devil’s advocate here, to be sure that we understand  our degree of protection    That’s about it  Well, the preliminary information is supposed to be  information as against forecast  There’s a line here, today is the line  Are we protected?  I hope  your answer is yes  I think I’ll be sorry I raised the question if it isn’t      Okay, thank you    We may want the announcement effect of a change in spread sometime--it’s  quite conceivable     Congress won’t get that excited about it    So moved    Give us the answer, Dave, as to when the policies are going to change    We could make a lot of money on this    It sure does, very closely    Your remarks on energizing, remind me, Mr Chairman, that when I was in  Japan, I had the pleasure of going through the [unintelligible] color television plant, which is, if  not the largest in the world, close to the largest in the world  There were only 4 lines operating,  and we asked the question, “Well, what’s going on?  Is demand off?”  [They said,] “No, demand  is heavier; this plant was built to have 12 lines, we put in 8, and we are operating them  We are  now making the same number of television sets on the 4 lines that we did on the 8”   So we have some encouragement from abroad to be more efficient, too  The point I  wanted to make, other than my basic agreement with the staff forecast, which I think is sound-- except maybe for housing starts, which may be overestimated a little--is to mention two things   First of all, on the auto side, some of our informants do give quite a bit of credence to this idea  that it is discomfort, so to speak, with the downsizing of the new models; and that this is not a  switch out of automobile purchases into savings--it is a switch of automobile purchases into     12/19-20/77 - 62 -         purchases of other goods, and that it may not be affecting demand as much as some people are  attributing to it    On the agricultural side, no one has mentioned it today  I have nothing really new to  report, except that I think the agricultural credit situation has stabilized a little; at least it doesn’t  seem to have gotten worse  The farmers’ strike seems to have three goals, one of which is to  stop buying farm machinery  Well, they already did that before the strike started; farm  machinery purchases are way down  Second is, they are going to refuse to plant crops, and  nobody in the Midwest plants crops in December anyway  And the third is to get 100 percent of  parity  So I think the fact that the farmers’ strike hasn’t even been mentioned here today is a  correct interpretation  It isn’t of any significance     Second    Mr Chairman, unlike Henry, who says that all of the recent directives have  looked like money market directives to him, even if they are stated in the other words, I think a     12/19-20/77 - 76 -         good case can be made that all of our directives over the last year have been aggregates  directives because we do, I think, tend to pay too much attention in our short-run specs to the  aggregates     I just mention that as a balancing point to a more general statement that there isn’t really  tweedle dum and tweedle dee between the aggregates directive [and the money market  directive]  It depends on where you want to put the “whereas”  Having said that, I would go  along with the money market directive this time  I would retain, though, the words “current  level,” which somehow have surreptitiously disappeared from page 5 of the directive suggestion   There might be a reason for that  But I prefer that to the 6-1/2 that would normally pop up there  if we didn’t say anything    Well, it’s page 5, the very last page, I guess it is, of the directive formulation  that was circulated to us yesterday  Lines--well, it’s specifically line 80      Yes, I’d keep it there  That was what this Committee agreed to last time,  and I see no reason to change it  Roger reminds me that we had in mind that this may get  published, and I think the same reasons--    Well, I’d like to suggest that it be put back in, the “current level”    On page 5, it’s crossed out    It’s very clear this time    To continue, I find alternative B quite congenial--2-1/2 to 8-1/2 is all right,  and I don’t worry as much as some of my associates about that 8-1/2 despite my remarks on     12/19-20/77 - 77 -         statistics  I think we are quite capable and will be alert and the Chairman can call us in session if  indeed there seems to be a quarterly aberration, as I think of it, that would otherwise cause us to  make a change in the Desk action     The 2-1/2 to 8-1/2 is all right  I feel strongly enough about Governor Jackson’s point that I  would go 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 on M2, given our statement--that I don’t propose to change--that we  give equal weight to M1 and M2  I actually don’t think we ought to give equal weight to M2  this time because of the point he makes on big CDs, and therefore, I would remedy that  [problem] by raising the range just another notch, so that way we wouldn’t pay as much attention  to M2    It does, but I would just go you one notch further, Phil    That isn’t the midpoint Phil  [Unintelligible]    Let’s do it at lunch    Approval of loans  "
604,1978-01-05,  Bob Mayo is here    
626,1978-01-17,"  Do you consider, Ted, that the new Japanese agreement will contribute   anything toward an improvement?     First on the answer to Mark’s question, isn’t the staff’s answer contained, Jim,   in your memo of January 13 where you give the assumptions of 5-1/4 percent M1 [growth] and  then 4 percent and 6-1/2 percent on each side?  Isn’t the 5-1/4 percent line consistent with these  charts?      So, there are figures down here--     My other comment is really in the form of a question [to] you, Mr Chairman   There is an assumption through all the staff [materials] here, in the presentation we have just heard  and the Bluebook, that indeed there will be a 1/2 percent increase in interest rate ceilings on time  deposits  Would you or any other member of the Board of Governors care to comment on that?       1/17/78             20  It’s a preferable, good assumption  Is it a realistic assumption from the standpoint of the Board?   Obviously, no official answer is expected      I understand completely the reason for the assumption  I was just wondering if   anyone would care to comment on the likelihood of action that would validate the assumption     Chuck, what would the Home Loan Bank Board’s basic objection be?     Thank you     No, I would merely say that I think the projection is a reasonable one  I would   not quarrel with it  Come to think of it, though, I should put in a footnote to my remarks last month  on agriculture  Our latest survey on land transactions in the Seventh District, which is always  thinner for the fourth quarter than for the other quarters, does indicate for a change at least a  stabilization, and perhaps even a turnaround, in the decline in transactions or in the value of farms  in the Midwest  So it may be that my alert of a month ago was premature       Thank you Mr Chairman, I guess I have less confidence in the January   seasonal adjustment factor again than some of my associates around the table  Given that, I have  some difficulty in going back to an aggregates directive  I still feel that in this environment a  money market directive is quite appropriate  I would not want to see the Desk move, if the [M1  growth] rate even gets to 8 percent  I would prefer to see us get together on the phone if it does that  for the period of two months  But I just don’t have that confidence in the figure  I am a monetarist  over a long period of time; I’m no monetarist on monthly changes  I really prefer 3 to 8 percent to  the 2-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for M1, although that may be quibbling  Perhaps as a qualification to  what I just said--and I’m not being a monetarist--I think we ought to tighten up [the width of the     1/17/78             45  range]; the 6 point difference is a little too big for me on the M1 with reference to the current  period  I would like to see us get together on a telephone meeting if we get close to that 8 percent  just to discuss the situation again     On M2, I find the lower end of that 5 to 9 percent range unacceptable  I don’t think it [is]   relevant at all to suggest that we might ease, giving equal weight to M1 and M2, if [M2] gets down  to 5 or even 4 percent  I would use the same lower range for M2 that I use for M1 because it  becomes irrelevant  The reason we would get down to 4 percent, say, for M2, would be a reason  that is inconsistent with our idea of easing  It would be a response of disintermediation, which  requires a different brand of aspirin  I would stick to the 6-1/2 to 7 percent [on the funds rate  range] though, Mr Chairman, with the 6-3/4 midpoint  But like last month and the month before, I  would suggest that our directive not say 6-3/4 percent but say “the current rate”  Anybody can look  it up, it is true  But I think there is enough stability in the 6-3/4 percent right now that we can use  “current rate” and not use a specific digit regardless of which type of directive we employ      You mean the base?   "
654,1978-02-28,"  So moved     I don=t believe we have an alternative     Take it out of your left pocket!     Is there any intervention by the Bundesbank in Swiss francs?  Is that a fair   question?     They don=t?     Yes, Mr Chairman, thank you  I find I am a little more in agreement with the   forecast in the Greenbook than perhaps Dave is  Like Chuck, I=m glad to see the housing starts  figure move down to what I think is now a completely reasonable estimate  I think it was high for  several months  At our Board meeting last Thursday we had quite a discussion on the outlook,  with particular reference to housing and to automobiles  And I found a little more strength of  confidence in our directors= discussions on both of these areas  [As] I expected, in both areas they  feel that financing is adequate and that there will not be any particular problems of crowding out   They find their suppliers to be in reasonably good shape, and indeed they are looking quite       2/28/78           22  confidently to the rest of the year and would not characterize the outlook for either housing or  automobiles as weak--perhaps not quite as heady as last year, but still a strong outlook      I would also mention--although, again, one swallow doesn=t make the summer--that I get a   little more of an impression of improvement abroad than was implicit in Chuck=s remarks  We  have seen some industrial production increases in October and November and in the figures that are  available for December for some of our friends abroad  And I am hoping--maybe it=s only a hope  but this does give us quite a bit of encouragement--that indeed this solution, which is obviously the  preferred solution, of better business abroad rather than poorer business at [home], will help  significantly in rectifying our own balance of payments problem and, in [turn], have some effect on  our sagging stock market before we get too far into the summer       I’d also note on the credit side that the flow of funds data, which I must confess I don=t   always look at but I did this time, do show to me that the economy can accommodate the increases  in credit in ’78 without any increases in interest rates that are in excess of what=s in the Bluebook  I  assume those projections are, of course, consistent  So I come to the conclusion that higher interest  rates are not impeding our opportunities for economic advance this year and that we are in pretty  good shape     On Ernie=s point, the farmers strike and the action in Texas, I can report that approximately   30 beautiful farm vehicles, including a couple of mobile homes but mostly huge tractors with air  conditioned cabs, complete with stereo and so forth, were parked outside of my window on LaSalle  Street about three weeks ago as they gathered to protest to the Board of Trade in Chicago about the  middle man sucking out all of the profits, et cetera  They couldn=t have made a worse impression  because of the luxury of the vehicles, most of which had Texas license plates      Is this essentially [because of] restrictive provisions in Ohio law?     First a question to Steve  I think I=m correct in interpreting what you=ve been   saying here and in the Bluebook that what the staff has set up for M2 and M3 does assume on the  various dates an increase in Regulation Q ceilings      I find that a difficult assumption to make right now in our consideration of the   targets for M2 and M3  If it were completely in the hands of the Board of Governors, I wouldn=t  make this point, but I have a very definite opinion that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board may  have something to say about this and that there will be considerable opposition in various quarters  to a raising of  Regulation Q  If I am correct or even partially correct on that, I think we might be  ill-advised to continue in our M2 and M3 targets for growth or our growth range statement here an  assumption that would encompass an increase in Regulation Q  I would, therefore, wholeheartedly  support what the Chairman has said [with regard to] a beginning of the eventual need to lower the  targets, particularly for M1  I would wholeheartedly support the idea that our credibility [and] our  determination as to whether we do believe in a 6-1/2 percent top on M1 is being tested right now in  the public eye  Until we get the performance record well under 7 percent, I wouldn=t want to  change that 6-1/2, so I would subscribe to the Chairman=s status quo recommendation on M1  without reservation  I would, however, suggest that we go to alternative C on both M2 and M3 and  lower the M2 target by 1/2 percentage point from where it is now and the M3 target by either a full  point or, as in the case of alternative C, by 1-1/2 percentage points      We=re all realists     Prudence came from New England, didn=t she?     Mr O=Connell isn=t here to defend himself     I prefer the 6-1/2 to 7 percent [fed funds range], although I agree with Paul and   others that the likelihood of going below 6-3/4 percent is very, very remote  I just have a  constitutional objection to that narrow a range on fed funds  I prefer a wider range in “normal”  circumstances  I like the idea of shading downward [the ranges for] both M1 and M2; 0 to 5 and 4  to 8 are fine with me--or 4 to 9 for that matter is all right  I would prefer the money market  directive           2/28/78           50  Apparently I=m playing a little game with the staff on the phrasing of the directive  Two  months in a row and again this time I=ve suggested, and the Committee has bought, the idea of  stating the directive in terms of a weekly average federal funds rate of about “the current level”   Each time, the next month the Bluebook comes along and crosses out “the current level” and  substitutes “___ percent”  I still think it=s a good idea, when we have the opportunity, to state it in  terms of the current level rather than the precision of a digit  That=s a terribly subtle thing, but I  think it may serve us well if we lose the Merrill case, for instance      I=m amused, not annoyed     I guess I=m making the same point in a different way that Frank just made   about prevailing [money market conditions] but in a 1978 environment instead of a 1968 one   Terribly minor, but I think it might have some significance      That=s all right     It depends on the ranges     I didn=t either     Aggregates, he said     Mr Chairman, would it be fair for you to ask for a show of hands of those who   prefer a money market directive with a 1 to 5 or 0 to 5 percent range as against those who prefer a  monetary aggregates directive with the 1 to 6 range?      Yes   "
697,1978-03-21,"  Does the initiation, Scott, come essentially from the Desk rather than the   Treasury?     Was it more than mentioned, Paul, or was it embraced with any degree of   enthusiasm?      Thanks, Mr Chairman  I am mindful of Frank’s point on the optimism and   that we might get too enthusiastic about a rebound from the first quarter  I don’t feel, however, that     3/21/78              35  the staff projection has incorporated an overly optimistic tone on the second quarter; the staff has  toned down its figures for the year in a realistic fashion, I think      We have had what has now officially been declared the worst winter in Chicago’s history   We haven’t done it quite as spectacularly as Boston and Providence, but we’ve had the worst  winter in our history, both from the standpoint of cold and from the standpoint of snow  However,  the coal strike has not impinged on most of our area  Illinois relies 35 percent on nuclear [power]  and this has been our salvation  Michigan has bought at least that much of their needs from  Ontario Hydro and that has added to our balance of payments problem, but it has been their  salvation  Indiana has been hurt more than the other states     But I find that there is a thread of solid optimism that is pervasive even in Indiana and in the   other states, too, as I move around the District  [People] feel that the figures are something to be  taken with a grain of salt because they really don’t mean anything in this particular period  Most of  our retailers, although not all, are optimistic on the rebound that has already taken place And I  think there is a general feeling among those who are in the market for additional capital spending  that this is coming along very, very slowly but that there will be continued growth through this year  and through the end of 1979  So, I find the staff’s projections very reasonable but I think we could  all agree that they are inadequate if they are interpreted as goals of our policies  Certainly none of  us likes to see the inflation rate move up even a couple tenths of a percent at this point  Also, I  think our agricultural people feel that the Department of Agriculture estimates that agricultural  prices will be up 4 to 6 percent this year are now out of date  I think there’s a general consensus  that retail food prices will probably be up more like 7 percent instead of 4 to 6 percent  And that,  of course, is bad news for inflation, too       Steve, one of the intriguing aspects of the disintermediation dilemma this   time is that there are, of course, two parts to it  An investor is faced with a choice if he has new  money to invest as to whether he goes into a thrift institution or into a government security  That’s  reasonably easy to figure out--at least the arithmetic is  The part that’s so intriguing is that such a  large percentage of existing thrift accounts are in this wave that have gone into certificates that are  longer-term and the penalty aspect does enter into the situation  There is a little different  evaluation required on whether a man withdraws funds from a thrift institution or leaves the funds  there  Have you done any analysis that would be meaningful on this?      That may be the wrong assumption, but I don’t know just how to correct for   it  I think there is a correcting factor that’s necessary     The penalty isn’t all that large; so if the differential spreads a bit more, you   could get quite a bit of follow-up     Oh, yes     Or there may be people who would say I’ll take a 90-day certificate and see   what happens which, in effect, is a way out of the same situation     You’re right, Mr Chairman, that the Congress wants clarity but many in the   Congress confuse clarity with simplicity  They would like to have a digit for everything and once  they get into this game they can trap us by remembering figures that we would just as soon forget   [Laughter]  No, I mean that seriously      No, I want to keep the Chairman off the spot by not getting him to expose   figures that we would rather all forget later on  It’s not that we are irresponsible but we are human  beings  I’d also suggest that one of the precedents set by setting up target ranges on the monetary  aggregates in the first place was, I think, to dignify those as overly simplistic definitions of what we  are doing in the public’s eye  And [I like] the fact that we have been able to resist thus far the  projection of interest rates in particular  I agree with Henry’s point that the more figures we give  them the more they like figures and the more they will slant them, and we could be getting  ourselves into a trap      Yes, Mr Chairman, thank you  I thought up until this meeting that I was   perhaps the greatest cynic around the table on seasonal adjustment  I think Chuck has challenged  my self-established description  But I do feel that on the monetary aggregates we have a lot to  learn yet on how we make seasonal adjustments when year after year, even with the adjustments  that have been made recently, we still have undulation with regard to the first month of each  quarter  Therefore, I feel like Governor Jackson that it would be much better to have an 8 percent  top on the M1 range; whether the bottom is 3 or 4 is immaterial to me  I think we proved last  month that we probably would have been better off with a zero than the 1 that we came out with,     3/21/78              57  but that’s neither here nor there  As far as M2 is concerned, again 5-1/2 to 9-1/2 or even 5 to 9 is  all right with me      I seem to be about the only one around the table who feels that a money market directive   would be the more appropriate stance at this point, although I don’t feel that strongly  I think we  are aiming for a continuation of 6-3/4 percent [on the funds rate] unless something really gets out  of line  So, why not say it?  I feel very strongly, Mr Chairman, that your description of the 6-1/2  to 7 on the federal funds range is correct  I would not want to change that, not only for the reasons  that have already been mentioned, but I have somewhat of a PR reason that may not be significant   You would be the only one probably to pass final judgment on that, but 6-1/2 to 7 is where we are   I think there is enough uncertainty as we look at the outlook today--I share some of Frank’s views  on this--that I would not want it changed because there may be weaknesses we’re not sure of yet   You would be in better shape, in my book, going up to testify right after the minutes of  this  meeting are made public, if you were testifying in an environment where we had made a decision  today to stick with a 6-1/2 to 7 percent federal funds range     "
721,1978-04-18,"  Yes, I just wanted to make [a comment that is] another way of saying Paul’s  point  The way I interpreted it, we are dealing with a market that has been going down, and  disorder there I think has a different weighting in our purchases and sales as against a market that is  going in the other direction  Once a real trend is discernable in a reversal of [the dollar’s] basic  movement, then I would expect the Desk to operate in the opposite way  Now, maybe they won’t,  but that would be at least an expectation  I think they have a duty here to perceive, as best as any  of us can, the underlying trend of the market and in effect roll with that--not try to offset it And if  the underlying trend is in our favor then we can make hay, so to speak      But the upside really hasn’t started yet, Phil      Very simply, I would support wholeheartedly the view of the Subcommittee on  the Directive  In fact, in a sense I think they have been overly polite towards Ernie’s proposal as  such  I have a basic agreement with Ernie on the desirability of what we are doing internally, but I  find myself terribly resistant to the idea of exposing ourselves further in an area of trying to  measure mechanically any goals that to me are not measurable mechanically  We can never  improve our credibility in my book by succumbing to the desire to pinpoint many of these things   My fellow Chicagoan, Milton Friedman--I am sure his ears are burning at this point at the  suggestion that we [adopt] a 3-year [projection]--would agree wholeheartedly if he were consulted  on this  He would put us on automatic pilot  I think that is the inevitable result of this  If you go  through what Paul was saying, what figures would be put down?  What Frank was saying is that we  will probably end up with the same targets  But I think it is unfair to suggest that this Committee  targets just on the basis of interest rates  Indeed, we have such imperfect linkages in all of these  things that we should be very careful that we don’t get trapped further on the mechanical side   Even though, on balance, the resolution that is now law on 1-year targets has had a beneficial  effect, I think there are some real negatives  [One is] trapping us to impugn our creditability in an  area where we could never in the eyes of the students of monetary policy--much less the media and  the general public--be credible because of factors that are completely outside of our control      Yes, following up on your last comment, Bill, I have a question for the staff   The deposit growth chart reflects what the Chairman just mentioned  If that does not take place,     4/18/78             15  would you anticipate a deposit growth curve that went down to the level or below levels of ’74--or  have you attempted to work that out?      Would it be appropriate to ask, Mr Chairman, if any progress has been made  in discussions with the Home Loan Bank Board on the question of ceiling revisions?      I have one other comment, if I may      The staff forecast I think is excellent, as always  I have only one area where I  think our people take a little different point of view and that is on the international side  We are not  nearly as pessimistic as the staff is  Whereas the staff has something like a $37 billion trade deficit     4/18/78             16  projected for 1978, we get something closer to $30 billion in our analysis  I won’t pursue it at great  length; I’d be glad to [initiate discussions] staff versus staff if you wish      It’s a big difference, Mr Chairman, and I think it adds up to two things  First  of all, there are certain temporary factors--let’s just call them disorderly factors for the moment--  that I think made the figures look much worse than they really were for the first part of this year   They relate to iron and steel imports and the reference price stuff that is coming along, the bulge in  Japanese exports, the anticipated import restrictions from their standpoint and, of course, the coal  strike  But on the more positive side, we see a little better outlook for oil imports, for what it is  worth--a leveling off this year  We see better economic growth abroad than the staff does, although  again this is pretty hard to document  We see a better agricultural trade balance than I think the  staff has implicit in their forecast  We also have done some work that would seem to indicate not  quite as great a lag as I see implicit in Ted’s figures on the effect of the depreciation of the dollar   We, therefore, also disagree with the suggestion that there may be a further 5 percent decline in the  trade-weighted value of the dollar  Again, this is a terribly speculative area, but not only does that  point of view reflect our opinion of the trade deficit--that it may have been overestimated--but we  think also that there is a better chance now than for some time that the capital flows should improve  in our favor and that this will moderate, if not virtually eliminate, a lot of the other factors in the  decline of the dollar  So, I will knock on wood, Mr Chairman      Mr Chairman, thank you  I support your recommendation of 4 to 6-1/2 and  the other ones that go with it on the current ranges, with 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 on bank credit  I think that  is advisable  I don’t feel that there should be any change in this [M1] range  I think our credibility  is better served by our determination, which everyone seems to agree here, that we get by being  within the [4 to] 6-1/2 percent range rather than by changing the range at this point  We’d just  become less credible if we change it on either side  The low side doesn’t mean anything; it seems  symbolic  On the upper side it would mean something and I think it would act against our  credibility  I would emphasize Chuck’s point again--and I believe Phil said this as well--it is a  restrictive monetary policy stance that we have taken  And I think it is appropriate       In our own discussions of this within the Chicago Bank we have come to the conclusion--it is  obviously a speculative conclusion--about the line labeled 5-1/4 percent M1 growth rate, which is  the midpoint of the present range and the suggested range  The projections of selected economic  and financial variables seem more comfortably associated with a 6 percent than a 5-1/4 percent  [rate of growth in M1], as we look through all of these figures  So I am merely making perhaps an  intellectual point that I approve the 4 to 6-1/2 range, with my interpretation that 6 percent is about  as low as we can get and still maintain what I [believe] to be sound economic goals  But that is     4/18/78             34  within the 4 to 6-1/2   It is merely a rationalization of my position and it need not be anything that  is exposed to the [Banking] Committee  But I favor the 4 to 6-1/2      Well, I disagree with Mark on his last statement  I find that we live in a  political world  And what I am willing to say informally in a speech in Chicago I am willing to say     4/18/78             37  because I know that I don’t have to make any formal justification of that to the Congress of the  United States  I think I can give better speeches and I can [provide] more informal support for  what we are trying to do in that way  I think it would be used against us  They love to play the  figures game in various ways to try to bring out different points of view and so forth  Therefore, I  enthusiastically support the idea of your giving your personal forecasts and giving them in writing  and with whatever qualification you want to give      This may be unfair for one of us to say, but I think this is perhaps one of the  burdens of being Chairman of this Committee  Someone has to speak for the Committee and I  think doing it--      Well, sure  That’s right  We have all been in that position in different parts of  our life and no one has been to jail as far as I know      Only one Senator will show up!      Well, I am prepared to come full circle, Mr Chairman  I came in with figures  jotted down here that happen to conform exactly to what you started this discussion with 6-1/2 to  7-1/4 on the federal funds range, feeling that some tightening should take place and some of it  immediately, [and] I would say 5-1/2 to 9-1/2 for M1 and 6 to 10 for M2  I feel that we are trying  here to struggle for an element of consistency with our short-run versus our long-run [ranges]  It  really shouldn’t bother us that much at this point, especially since we have quite a bit of the period  already behind us  I, too, have great problems, as everybody knows, with the staff projections and  the seasonals, and so forth  But I think Steve’s explanation is valid here  And if you combine that  with the fact that even with all the work we put in on the seasonal adjustments, we are still not too  sure of ourselves, I don’t see any reason why we can’t have a 2-month range that is seemingly  inconsistent with our long-term projections or ranges, given the assumptions for these months that  fit in with those projections  So I come out the same way as you did, Mr Chairman, and with an  aggregates directive    "
762,1978-05-16,"  We have a big shortage in the Midwest, too, Bill  They can’t find box cars   They are accusing ConRail of taking them to New England and losing them somewhere       Well, these are hopper cars, too  They’re not moving the export grain the way  it’s supposed to [be done]  In fact, they’ve even gotten unitrains, going all the way to Los Angeles,  because that’s the simplest way of getting some of the grain out of Iowa      I have no quarrel, Bill, with the staff projection on real GNP; a range of 4 to  4-1/2 percent certainly covers my personal feelings and those of my staff as logical for this year  I  think we will be very lucky in this country, however, if we keep the inflation rate under 7-1/2  percent for this year  I think the outlook for agricultural prices is perhaps even a little more bleak  than the staff has estimated, and they certainly have been more pessimistic than they were earlier in  the year  I feel fairly strongly that we can’t get the unemployment rate in this cycle under 6 percent  because I have seen so much evidence of companies grabbing up help because they anticipate some  sort of a boom--in which way they aren’t quite sure themselves  And this is one of the reasons for  our very low productivity figures that we have seen, for what they are worth, in the first part of  1978  So I guess I’m just a little more pessimistic on the inflation front than the staff and a little     5/16/78              17  more pessimistic on the labor force side  And yet I must say that I’m very skeptical as to how  much help monetary policy can be--we can be of some help--in alleviating what seems to be  another potential, at least, boom and bust situation  It’s not as bad as 1973-74, but it is one that  could be rather serious      I have two 14-foot canoes!      Well, I guess I’ll join Chuck in confessing  Nobody ever thought it--and I  wouldn’t want to repeat it--but I am a monetarist over a period of a year or more  I think money  does matter in that period of time but again I hope it isn’t a monthly speech that we are committing,  if I may use the term, “idolatry” in worshiping statistics that are the best we have and the best in the  world  But they’re really not good enough to [base short-] term decisions on without a  considerable degree of perspective and flexibility in realizing what we’re doing  To illustrate my  point on statistics, I have a table in front of me that shows the 12-month moving average on the  money supply going down very substantially from its peak of almost 8 percent last September and  October to under 7 percent including April  Figures on M2 show an even more dramatic reversal  in [terms of] showing our resolve in keeping the money supply under control  I join Roger in  feeling that we made a courageous decision in this Committee a month ago  I think it has paid off  in many, many ways--whether you look at the stock market, whether you look at the foreigners and  they look at us, whether you are looking at the prestige of the Federal Reserve and its influence on  the fiscal side  In just any number of ways we are riding pretty well  Let’s not let that go to our  heads and try to overdo it  I think we’ve made our major move for this quarter for tightness  We’ll  be here again next month  I don’t see any reason to tighten further       On the other hand, for psychological reasons I see no reason either, if the aggregates are  bumping up a little bit, for being shy about going to 7-1/2  We are actually at 7-3/8, I believe, are  we not now?  [That 7-1/2 is] a practical expression on the federal funds rate  I don’t see much  reason for going beyond that without a special meeting, even if the aggregates are not behaving as  we would like  I don’t have that much faith in our weekly figures of the aggregates and that’s no  complaint about the staff  I think it’s merely an expression of realism  I would go with the 7--or  even the 7-1/4 is all right--to 7-3/4, keeping it at 7-3/8 unless things seem to be pushing a little  I  think this will keep our market image proper--if we are indeed concerned about that, which we  should be  I would widen M1 to 4 to 9 and go with 4-1/2 to 9-1/2 on M2  I see no reason to go  lower in either maximum or minimum M1 or M2  I think it would again be an expression of overly  fine-tuning      These are all good ideas, but we’re getting into the position of the Committee  writing the directive  I would like to [suggest that we] refer this to the Subcommittee on the     5/16/78              51  Directive to combine with their discussion of a quarterly or whatever it is on the 2-month [issue]  and to come back with a recommendation  I think to take an interim step might merely cause the  market to puzzle over why we are doing that--especially if we change it again in a couple of  months  So I would like to refer it to the Subcommittee on the Directive    "
790,1978-06-20,"  Mr Chairman, I have great sympathy for the staff=s dilemma here  My  interpretation of what you might call the wishful thinking department of it, however, relates not  only to what Larry described as wishful [thinking] but rather to the assumption that has been  forced on them by us of the 5-1/4 percent M1 growth central point  The model, as I recall the  figures, comes up with from Q2 this year to Q2 next year an increase of only something like 23  percent in real GNP  And what I would call their more real-world model in the Greenbook  comes up with an average of 38 percent  I think this is a much more realistic model  But to tie  it back to 5-1/4 percent involves straining staff credibility in a way that I think we should all be  aware of  Really, to me, we=re talking about a consistency of the real GNP forecast with more  like a 6 percent M1  I don=t think we have to go as far as Phil=s question suggested, to the most  recent 18-month period, but I think we should view realistically the assumption  Really, we=re  assuming 6 percent [M1 growth] here in moving from the model to the judgmental forecast  I  think this is supported by what Larry pointed out--that we have a rather absurd set of figures in  terms of velocity to tie to the money supply figure estimates for the last quarter of 1978  I was  just wondering if the staff would care to comment on what I just said      Well, I guess not     6/20/78                11      Mr Chairman, I have a basic agreement with what Chuck Partee and Phil  Jackson said with regard to perhaps a little more strength than the Greenbook forecast for the third  and fourth quarters  The economy is still very strong in the Midwest  People are optimistic  But I  see the ingredients here of a slowdown, which makes me feel that the staff forecast is too optimistic  for the first half of next year  We still have the social security increases, and I think they will stick,  to temper any tax cuts that will eventually take place  I would venture to say that in picking our  period here for comment today, Mr Chairman, you have caused me to be a little more pessimistic  than the rest because my elbow tells me--and that’s all it is I guess at this point--that the second  quarter of next year is going to be kind of soft  I would expect unemployment, therefore, of more  like 6-3/4 percent  I=ll probably end up high man on the totem pole but, after all, we are talking  about the rate of unemployment in the second quarter because the year-to-year figure doesn=t mean  anything  I think we will have a soft economy by the second quarter and some [softness] in the first  quarter, too, as we work through whatever you want to call it--maybe a growth recession is as good  or as bad a term as we have  I would consider that the overall increase in real GNP from the second  quarter to next year might only be about 3-1/4 percent, which I don=t think is anything to be ashamed  of  I think it is part of a moderating process that is going to be taking place almost regardless of  what we do on monetary policy--not that I am fatalistic or a defeatist on that  But as we get into the  next part of our meeting I think [we ought] to realize a great humility regarding our ability to  contribute substantively to some moderation of the process that I am trying to describe      I feel that the price pressures are very great  I am more pessimistic than Roger on food prices;  I think food prices ’78 over ’77 may be up 9 to 10 percent  Therefore, I come out with a personal  appraisal on the GNP deflator of more like 7-3/4 percent  I hope I am wrong  I pray I am wrong   But I see a basic block here that I don=t see how we can crack on the labor negotiations front in terms  of the price pressures that are already built in  Even if the President is reasonably successful in his  5-1/2 percent wage increase program for much of the economy, I don=t think he will be successful  with big labor  I am a little more optimistic, I think, than Paul Volcker with regard to the danger of a  coincidence of a slowdown here and a slowdown abroad  I still have an innate optimism on that   Well, Germany improved again in April, for whatever it’s worth, after several bad months  I see  some improvement abroad that is lagging ours but is not going to be turned around by a slowing in     6/20/78                20  our own economy  So that is about where I come out, with real GNP maybe only 3-1/4 percent, as I  say, second quarter to second quarter  I wish it were better, but I don=t think it is in the cards      Well, Mr Chairman, I think our dilemma here is pretty obvious, even to those  of us who feel that some sort of an economic growth now and a slide maybe next year is likely   Again, I think we have a responsibility to exercise a very careful monetary policy that will steer us  on this narrow road  We can=t take the peaks off completely or fill in the valleys; our bulldozer isn=t  that big  I think we can have a real effect, however  And although I=m not eager to go to 7-3/4 in the  next week or two, I think we ought to take a stance that will continue to see the string that we have  here fairly taut in terms of the market pressures and the market understanding that indeed we are  working toward a somewhat tighter policy as long as the growth signals are as strong as they are  now  We can reverse that policy later on  I hope we will do it sooner than we did last time  I would  buy the 7-1/2 to 8 percent with a money market directive  I have mixed emotions, as many of us  seem to, on the ranges  I am perhaps even more skeptical than Roger on the July figures; we just  haven=t developed any confidence in our [projections for the] first month in a quarter  If it weren=t  for that, I would press for a little lower range, but I=m satisfied with 5 to 10 on both of them      Not if you look at absolutes       6/20/78                36    Let them sell agricultural ones and support the housing ones, not on the record    "
818,1978-07-18,"  My question has been answered      Well, Mr Chairman, I think the economy is still quite healthy and is growing  vigorously and I don’t find implausible--at least over the next year--the staff’s forecast of a  slowdown in economic growth  I think it is likely to be achieved partly because the expectational     7/18/78              14  caution being generated, which we hear so much about, may indeed avoid the excesses that  produced the last recession and may extend the expansion at least through the year ahead, as we see  it  Just to round the figures off, I come out with 3-1/2 percent for real GNP growth, and I think that  would be a very good record in terms of a long-term trend, given the problems that we have before  us  I am a little more concerned on the price index; I would come out more like 7-3/4 than 73  percent  And I think the 57 is a fluke on unemployment and I would say we would have at least 6  percent by this time next year      Mr Chairman, I find myself in complete agreement with Chuck Partee on the  M2 arguments  I think this would be exactly the wrong time to move to a broader measure, even  though I am enthusiastic in the longer run for more properly defined money supply concepts than  we have to date  In the long run, Frank is right  Right now I think it would be a bad mistake for  the reasons that Chuck gave  Rather than repeat those I’ll go on to my other point  I must say that  Henry Wallich expressed exactly the way they [feel] on the foreign side  [I have] some question on  Frank’s statements on the likelihood of the demand deposit/savings demand shift effect  I would  keep the targets exactly where they are--not just for public relations  But I will admit that if you  use that term loosely to incorporate foreign relations, corporate relations, and market relations, I  think it is a legitimate concern  And I would not want to be in the Chairman’s shoes to have to go  up and try to defend any change in either target at this point      Yes, in Bob’s table, I think--      But even without automatic transfers, Steve, wouldn’t you agree that base drift  makes 6-1/2 doable?      I think it does      We are going to come closer this time, Chuck, than we have; and very frankly,  base drift helps us do that     SPEAKER(?)  There are two sentiments that I hear, Chuck  One is that we are going to have  these ranges and explain later our going over them  The other is that we are going to have these     7/18/78              33  ranges and live within them  And those will be the debates at our following meetings  It seems to  me that is what the issue is      Alternative C is acceptable to me, Mr Chairman  I would not be in any hurry  to get to 8 percent but if it comes naturally in the Desk’s operations, I would just let the funds rate  go to 8  I wouldn’t want to see it go over 8; I would be a little uncomfortable about that without a  meeting, but I think “C” is still my preference  And I would accept [the specifications in] “C” on  the M1 and M2 ranges as well      Mr Chairman, I have thought long and hard before deciding to say this, but I  guess partly growing out of my experience in the Nixon cabinet, I must question the basic premise   We say here it is known that information from these intercepts is being used, among other things,  to develop economic intelligence on the United States and to improve the bargaining position of  foreign governments in dealings with public and private organizations in the United States  I think  I am a fairly imaginative guy, but I can’t quite figure out how any information derived from the  morning call, most of which--with a couple of key exceptions--is known by the end of the day  anyway, is going to affect one way or another the evaluation of the economic intelligence  information on the United States      In the absence of any known threat in this regard--that is, known to me--I then turn [to  whether it] is also possible that information gained from telephone eavesdropping is being used to  engage in financial market dealings for the purpose of financial gain  Do we actually have any  evidence that any dealer or any broker, or any outsider for that matter, is capitalizing on this?  I  must say that there is a tendency that exists in the government--and I think particularly in the  Federal Reserve, Mr Chairman, for understandable reasons [because] we must be secure on so  many of our operations--[to exaggerate]  I don’t feel that this is a security risk, though I realize I  am probably talking about something that I have only partial information on  But I am concerned  that we may engage in an exaggerated response where the actual threat is kind of a bogeyman  Am  I out of order in saying this?      Well, I can see the potential threat and I suppose an ounce of prevention is  worth a pound of cure  But I don’t see any real threat and I personally am willing to take the risk   But, of course, I am not in your position, so I--      I think it does, Mr Chairman, if I may continue just for a moment  Granted,  there are many occasions when our participation as individual Presidents monitoring the call  consists of saying “yes” and “I haven’t any comments” when the approach [being contemplated] is  more or less an orthodox one  But there have been many, many occasions in my experience--and I  know some of the others I have talked to about this feel the same way given their experience-- where there has been a positive contribution  There is rarely a Governor on the call; Paul doesn’t  participate in it because his people are there  I think it is perhaps important that one of us do it   And I must say, selfishly, from a regional standpoint that I think it is part of my job description to  be able to say to my board of directors and to my banks that yes, one of my functions is the  participation, when called upon, to serve my duty on the morning call  It keeps the System as a  whole in a much more orderly way of looking at things      You haven’t very many Governors even when you have seven, and there is so  much work to do  I think it--      Sure  That is true      But it’s haphazard  That is physical presence by chance      The cost is not material to my point      Well, it probably isn’t quite that simple though, Phil, at this point  What I am  arguing for is the status quo      I see no objection to that      It wouldn’t do you any good if you have an outsider on the call      I think that’s right      But it is difficult, Mr Chairman, for any President to read between the lines as  to the reasons and so forth  The telegram is cold      Disappeared  I think that is right, Paul      But I understand there is also competition in this, Mr Chairman  There is at  least one other company--it has three initials--with the same research and offering the same service  and it expects to come out with something      Well, that may work [in favor of going] the lease way      The wire has a delay of 2 to 3 hours; at least that is my experience      And the facsimile could, I think, be done immediately       But it really isn’t after the fact  It indicates that there may another round of  repurchase agreements necessary in the afternoon and so forth  So it is a real--      Sure    "
842,1978-08-15,"  Is this publicly known, Scott?      Was yesterday a disorderly market?      Just to support the staff's response to Phil, one of the nation's largest retailers  reported to us just three days ago that their delinquency rate is lower than at any time in the past six  or seven years  They're amazed themselves, but they're having no problems whatsoever      We share the point of view that has been circulating around the table here  that the economy is slowing perhaps, but is in pretty good balance  We don't see any serious  problems, nor do the people that we have direct contact with  I would say again 3 to 3-1/4 percent  for real GNP and I consider that a quite reasonable sort of projection--not a pessimistic projection   Prices we have at 7-3/4 to 8 percent  For unemployment, I think we're already at the 6 to 6-1/4  percent range, if you look at the figures over a more sensible period of time than the last two  observations on a monthly basis  And I don't think it is going to get significantly worse than that      I have no problem with your suggestion, Mr Chairman, except that I, too,  would move the M1 range down but only slightly  A 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent range would give you a  6-1/2 midpoint, which is at the upper [end] of our long-term target range  [I favor an] aggregates     8/15/78             27  directive  The discount rate I think should be raised if not this next week, soon thereafter  But it  could be part of a package; I think that might be the best way to do it  The 7-3/4 to 8-1/4 I think is  an appropriate range for the federal funds rate and I would wait until the figures come in on this  week's M1 and M2 to see how things are moving  I wouldn't go immediately tomorrow to 8  percent, but I think there's good reason to go maybe next week unless the aggregates are quite  weak      Well, I have to say that I do have some enthusiasm, although it's in a lesser  of evils department, I'll admit  I think Scott has given a good explanation of the technical side of  this and I concur in what he has had to say  I know exactly what John Balles is talking about  I've  had the same experience, having been in Japan several times, and I feel that in the Japanese  economy, their traditions have been harder to shake than those of any other country in the modern  world  The Japanese have had a marvelous experience in their export industry because they have a  rate of personal saving, for example, three times our own  So they can raise capital and this in turn     8/15/78             41  generates the enthusiasm over there for export industry  The attempts by the Japanese government  to encourage the Japanese people to buy more worldly goods run up against a stone wall in that the  Japanese [home] is not big enough to acquire furniture even, much less a lot of other gadgets  I've  discussed this problem with Japanese bankers, some as recently as last week, and I think there is a  real feeling that, despite the political difficulties, the Japanese are getting to the point where they  feel too that something more drastic has to be done  I think the American business response to the  Japanese situation has tended to become more and more emotional and not understanding of the  political problems that the Japanese have      It seems to me, therefore, Mr Chairman, that we should go into this but with our eyes wide  open and with the idea that maybe we are in the best position now to strike a hard bargain with the  Japanese that we have ever been in before  It's no great solution or cure-all  The basic solution to  the Japanese-American trade balance problem is far more complex than just the initiation of swap  agreements that can [not] have any real effect on it  But I think it can have a stemming effect to  show that we're not just a sitting duck for the makers of disorderly markets, if I may put it that way    "
869,1978-09-19,"  I had the same question         9/19/78            3   I would join Dave's comments that the staff projection is a little on the   optimistic side  I look for a little more inflation than the staff does and a little less GNP production     I have another question that I should have brought up earlier  We keep   hearing rumors but no facts yet that the housing boom may be nipped because the savings and  loans are getting cold feet now on the 6-month T-bill certificate  I was wondering if staff had any  input on this question--whether they consider this to be an ominous possibility or whether it's just  talk      Mr Chairman, I think I'm probably as concerned about inflation in this   country as anybody around this table  I also feel very strongly that monetary policy has an  important role to play  I recognize that the lags in the effect of monetary policy are substantial-- and substantive in amount, not just in time  And I must admit that I have some concern about  pushing too hard here  I would buy the 8-1/4 to 8-3/4 [on the funds rate range]  I have no  particular problem with that  I would not move; I would consider the present 8-3/8 percent as the  asymmetrical midpoint and wouldn't move from it, however, until we see our next spate of news-- bad or good, whatever it may be--on the monetary aggregates      I guess I'm a maverick though, Mr Chairman, on our seeming over-attention to the   embarrassment--and it is an embarrassment--about the 6 to 10 percent M1 range that's in alternative  B  I refuse to get embarrassed about it because I don't think the 2-month averages mean a damn, if  I may use the phrase  I have suggested, and I think several of my associates have also, within the  past two years that we ought to find a way of going to a quarterly range  That at least is a little  better than the two months  So I refuse to get excited about the 6 and 10, even though it is a  thermometer by which we get measured  I think we can dispose of it, not as irrelevant but perhaps  as inconsequential, in view of the broader perspective      I must say that there are all sorts of ways of doing figures and the linkages of course, as we   all know, are very imperfect  But if I take our present ranges, Mr Chairman, of 4 to 6-1/2 percent  on M1 and 6-1/2 to 9 percent on M2 and I pay attention to our short-term directive, which always  says we give approximately equal weight to M1 and M2, I find that this comes out [using the two  midpoints] as 5-1/4 percent to 7-3/4 percent for a long-term range  It's rather interesting to me that  if you take the moving average of M1 and M2 over the past year, August to August, you come out  with a 77 percent increase  That, of course, is rather close to the top of 7-3/4 percent but it's within  the range  I illustrate this not to say that I am smitten by the accuracy of such figures but just to  point out that you can do all sorts of things with figures  Also I would point out, more seriously  perhaps, that that moving average figure a year ago at this time was 89, so we've made an  improvement of 12  So I would like to join with your statement, Mr Chairman, that indeed the  Fed has made a contribution to a fairly efficiently working economy at this point, even though  obviously we haven't gone as far as we would like to      So I'll stick with the 6 to 10 [on M1] and perhaps join you in the embarrassment of   explaining it, but I think it could be explained away  I would join the staff on alternative B on M2   And as I say, 8-1/4 to 8-3/4 is my preference [for the funds rate range], too, but I wouldn't move  yet I'd wait for some more figures  My feeling is a little different from Roger's with regard to the  calmness with which the markets have accepted the last 1/2 percentage point increase in interest       9/19/78            30  rates  I think we have an international cover that has protected us on that  I don't want to overplay  our cards in assuming that that will continue    "
894,1978-10-17,"  Mr Chairman, I found the international charts more than usually exciting this  time  I think the staff did an excellent job on them  One of the phenomenon in here that I think is  sort of fascinating, but was only partially brought out in the presentation, relates to the comparative  inflation rates here and abroad  A good share of the good showing by Germany and Japan, who are  great importers of oil, is directly derived from the fact that they're paying for oil in US dollars,  which means that it becomes cheaper and cheaper as the dollar goes down in value  I know that  this is just an analysis of a segment but it gives me some hope that, indeed, if the US dollar is  oversold at this point the turnaround will come eventually  I'm convinced of it, and that in itself is  going to improve the international price competitiveness even if nothing else happens      You have made no attempt have you, Ted, to do an analysis of what these  indexes would look like if the price of oil were abstracted from them?  It becomes pretty much of  an academic exercise, I suppose, because of secondary effects      Mark's last point is an interesting one  I've sensed a little of this, too, Mr  Chairman, in a feeling that businessmen in several areas in the Midwest are more anxious this time  around to protect their profit margins than they were in the 1973-74 experience  They still feel a  little bit wounded from that  And the net effect of the President's anti-inflation program as it is now  interpreted in the market may be some tendency toward greater unemployment  This goes in the  face of some of the other things that have been said here  I [would note] also that just about every  restaurant in suburban Chicago has a “help wanted” sign up  They just can't get people, even at the  lower skill levels; people just don't want to work in that sort of activity      So we have a mixed bag here  Although there have been some things on the good news  front since the last meeting, I feel a little more pessimistic than I did a month ago  Again, [as for]  taking solace in figures, I'm somewhat of a cynic in that area  But I am a little concerned  The way  I read the consensus forecast outside of the Fed, our staff forecast for the next year is one of the  highest, and I think we are too high  I come out with 2 to 2-1/2 percent real growth  I don't think  there is more than one chance in ten that we can hold the inflation rate next year under 8 percent   There are too many things that are already built in  And following up on my own [unintelligible]  on unemployment here, I think our chances of holding the unemployment  rate under 6-1/2 percent  next year are rather slim      Mr Chairman, I think we're trying too hard again  I would like to see us keep  to the M1 range of 4 to 6-1/2 percent on the grounds that we really don't have much idea as to  what's going to go on, not only on automatic transfers and how long it's going to take but we also  don't know on New York NOW accounts  Let’s keep our straight definition  We're going to  change the ground rules in another few months anyway  [Let’s] keep it at the 4 to 6-1/2 subject to  interpretation as we learn--as we take our temperatures  I don't see any percentage for us, Mr  Chairman, in making an estimate now as to the effect of this  It could be very slow in coming   There is an awful lot of inertia  And despite advertising campaigns, I think it can be even slower  than the NOW accounts in New England  So I don't see why we need to stick our necks out; I  would prefer to stick to the [current] M1 definition  I'm [not] enamored of M1 but I would resist  changing it now  I'd wait until we are at a better position to do that, maybe with the new system  under Humphrey-Hawkins      Footnote      Couldn't this be handled in the text [of your testimony], Mr Chairman,  without--      Well, my arguments have all been given  I would come out at 8-3/4 to 9 [for  the funds rate], with 3-1/2 to 6-1/2--the 3-1/2 being irrelevant--for M1  A 6 to 10 percent range is  okay for M2, and I'd leave it at that  I would interpret the present rate as being 8-7/8 and if we  want to go above 9, I think we ought to have another meeting    "
921,1978-11-21,"  I find this a difficult scenario to predict at this point  There are all sorts of  possibilities  Like Willis, I think we could have in this time perhaps a sharp but brief recession that  would still give us 1-1/2 to 2 percent growth over the period here  I am still pessimistic on the  price side  Even if we do have such a sharp dip and recovery, I don't think we can do much better  than 8 percent  And we could have close to 7 percent unemployment by this time next year      We do, Mr Roos, have facilities at the Chicago Fed for examining the woolly worms  The  President does this over the weekend, and he finds that the woolly worms are very woolly--if that  helps you      I hope that postage is prepaid  On Chuck's point, though, if the size of the  crowds and the traffic jams in the shopping centers in Chicago are any indication, the  pre-Thanksgiving surge in Christmas sales is tremendous  Now, that doesn't give me a very good  basis for [extrapolating] it out beyond Thanksgiving  But the crowds are just terrific in this  pre-Thanksgiving period      Well, State Street after Thanksgiving I think is a poor economic barometer  because all the school kids go there      That's right, they don't spend anything      No      Mr Chairman, I would buy the 9-1/2 to 10 [funds rate range] with the 9-3/4  midpoint  I would buy 9-3/4 to 10, for that matter, with a 9-7/8 midpoint  It's getting awfully  narrow but I think this is the consolidating, so to speak, that Roger described  I would take a  money market directive  I think it is a better judgment at this time, too  I don't think we are that  close to the economic problems that we might dictate with an aggregates directive  I have more  confidence in M2 than in either of the others, though I think I would put it at 5 to 9--a little more  restrictive than alternative B  I would put a cap of 5 percent on both M1 and M1+  Although the  months differ a little, the sum of the two months is essentially the same  I don't think the lower end  of the range makes any more sense on M1+ than it does on M1      Giving due regard to the developments in international exchange markets       11/21/78              33  "
947,1978-12-19,"  Yes, I think that’s more important      Peter, many years ago there was some effort made to suggest that the  Treasury should sell its securities on a commission basis and go like the stock market on the  turnover in the secondary market  I haven’t heard anything about this for years  Is that dead or  does what you are describing here give any impetus to that discussion?       Are any of the dealers that have a very broad base in other parts of the  securities market using the government operation as a loss leader in any way?      Isn’t this true of the New York community generally--that they are always  projecting a bigger budget deficit?      Well, Mr Chairman, we just witnessed a new form of “Mark” intervention!   To capitalize on what John was saying a minute or so ago on the strength of the fourth quarter, I  would add to consumer restlessness that prices may go up, producer restlessness--and maybe  consumers, too--with regard to potential strikes and still a potential for mandatory controls, even if  those mandatory controls take the form of court-enforced voluntary controls, if I may put it that  way  We are going through an interesting phase of suits in this day where everybody sues  everybody, testing what the executive power really is with regard to voluntary controls  I wish the  President well on this  And yet I see success as being closer to the mandatory controls which we  all abhor        When I add all this up, Mr Chairman, I find that an 8 percent inflation factor for next year  is unfortunately too low  I hate to be that much of a pessimist, but I feel that it may be closer to 10  I hope feverishly that I’m wrong  But I see again food doing worse than the 8 percent--worse being  higher  And even though the oil figures in the cold light of day are not that much different from  what had been put down in most of our assumptions, there’s the psychology again  As Scott has  said about the Bundesbank, I think we are getting into an emotional state on the inflationary impact  here, too  It is a frustrated state rather than a constructive state, and this bothers me as much as  anything      Having said that--and maybe this sounds inconsistent--although I have no real quarrel with  a 1-1/2 to 2 percent increase in real GNP next year, I think the first quarter may be somewhat  stronger than the staff predicts  And it may well be that we will get into a negative growth period  by the end of the year  So we may have the worst of both worlds in 1979, in that inflation will not  have cooled down under the impact of greater unemployment by year-end and some mild recession  by year-end But we’ll have both the inflation and the soft economy looking ahead to twelve  months from today      I, therefore, find it even more difficult than usual, as I guess Ernie mentioned as well, to try  to interpret this for policy  Yet I think we have no alternative on the psychological side but to  maintain our resolve in keeping restraint in place even at the chance that we’re going to be accused  of causing any recession anyway at this point  I don’t say that in a defeatist attitude, but I think we  still have to edge [rates] up just a little tighter partly because it’s expected of us in the whole aura  here of worrying about what to do about inflation  We are the last bastion in the eyes of a great  many people and I think it would be a mistake just to hold still right now  There are risks but I  think we have to tighten a little further--not dramatically like we did November 1, but a little  further      Is there a reason, Steve, that you’d stick to a range for M1 and M2 rather  than just putting a cap on each of them?      Well, that’s the problem  I think it should be considered a meeting  If we  are going to have it, I’d consider that we are going to spend several hours         But they are different  This would be a mandatory meeting on a [specified]  date         It’s a big step forward, I think, Mr Chairman       Well, no  To work in the direction that Chuck’s committee has given us  here       I feel much the same way, Mr Chairman  I would say if number 6 was a  great step forward, this is even a greater step forward       Mr Chairman, I think it makes two bits of difference, if I may use the  phrase, with regard to Frank’s point on communications with the public  I think that is the main  advantage of this  I hope we are all smart enough around this table that we can divide by 2 and  divide by 3  [If] not, we are in trouble       But we always have this problem  Again, I’d rather use it that way--the  bigger figure       Just so it doesn’t die     "
975,1979-02-06," Jerry, 1 find myself quite comfortable with almost  every page of this fine presentation except the unit cost indicators  I'm just wondering if you're whistling [in the dark] a bit both on  compensation per hour and on productivity On the trend in  productivity, I suppose there's a natural inclination to say Well,  we really don't understand It, so let's level it out Yet there's  also a natural tendency, if things continue tight this year, as  projected in other parts of this forecast, for output per hour to  decline further And, of course, if both compensation and  productivity should move in the wrong direction, unit labor costs are  going to look rather sick   I find it optimistic That's my problem, I guess  I hope you're right, but I don't believe it at this point   Except that we're substituting some velocity for  some money supply   So the published figures are going to come out--   Yes, that's right In other words, we're sticking  our necks out a little on some velocity estimates We need to pay a  little more attention to them this time, if we read the Bluebook  literally, than we have before   Thank you, Mr Chairman As one of the elder  people around the table, I do indeed thank you!   First, my answer to Chuck on the Shepardson phenomenon is  that this merely indicates again that people on the staff are more  comfortable with actuals than they are with estimates, and my solution  is to make the solid lines straighter instead of putting more jiggles  in the dotted lines   Right I find that this phenomenon is typical of  a lot of businessmen, too That is, they say Well, we might have a  recession, but I don't see it in my business; I'm not going to have  one And by gum you can go back to 1973 and 1974 and they were saying  exactly the same thing So they have a dotted line problem as well;  it isn't just us economists   I have one question and one observation before we get to the  figures The question, Steve, relates to the assumption of a 3  percentage point adjustment f o r  ATS accounts--and I assume New York     2/6/19 -18-   NOWs--throughout 1979 What is your feel on this? I would have come  to the conclusion independently, without doing any real work on it,  that this would be a declining percentage during 1979 and that by the  end of the year it might only be 1 or 1-1/2 percent But I don’t know  what I am talking about; it’s just a feel   That’s all it could be at this time, that‘s true  My other point is an observation on the President‘s Economic Report  It’s terribly obvious, at least to me, that the Council was trying  very hard to come up with figures that somehow will tie in with the  Humphrey-Hawkins goals down the line and has concluded that it is  impossible This is more evident, obviously, in ’81 and ’82 than it  is in their look at ‘79 and ‘80 But to me that explains why we are a  little more pessimistic   I have heard about that, yes! My second  observation on the Council report, which hasn’t been mentioned here,  is that there is a [notable] lack of discussion in the report of the  whole capital investment problem, and investment is one of the items  in Humphrey-Hawkins that gets a pretty high priority as I read the  Act I sympathize with the Council‘s inability to figure out what can  be done to achieve a proper level of investment and productivity, but  they really haven’t come up with anything   ~   To turn to the issue of the moment, I have no real objections  to Steve’s prescription for M1 of a 2 to 5 percent range I  originally thought we could perhaps get away with 2 to 4 percent, but  I think narrowing the range by 1 percentage point is about all the  discipline we should enforce on ourselves with the lesser flexibility  in our goal-setting procedure than has been the case under the joint  resolution So, 2 to 5 percent is all right with me I feel a little  differently than Steve does, though, on M2 and M3 I think once we  deviate from the range we might just as well not be timid about it  I’d deviate a little more and not just by 1/2 percentage point as he  suggested So, I would go to 5 to 8 percent on M2 and 6 to 9 percent  on M3 The importance of the analysis in the eyes of the public, in     2/6/79 -19-   the eyes of the market, and in the eyes of the Congressmen is perhaps  a 10 to 1 on emphasis on M1; that's the critical measure They will  accept our reasoning more logically on M2 and M3 if indeed [the  ranges] do turn out that [way]; some would criticize us for, in  effect, undermining the housing market and so forth by goals that were  too low on M2 or M3   Surprisingly, I agree with Mark for a change I  think it would be a mistake, Mr Chairman, to cut [the upper limit of  the funds range1 from 10-1/2 to 10-1/4 percent When it is published,  it would give a wrong signal   I would buy the 3 to 8 and 4 to 8 but I would  stick to the 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent funds rate range   I'll bid 3/53  "
1003,1979-03-20," To follow up on this, I keep forgetting Steve, MS  still doesn‘t include money market funds or RPs, does it?   Both?   Mr Chairman, I still see considerable economic  strength Though the signs are increasing that we may now have some  of the characteristics of the last stages of the boom, I don't think  they are as strong as they have been at comparable times in the past  But I still would not be surprised at all if we have a couple of  quarters of zero [GNP] growth at the tail end of this year and early  1980 I don't get terribly distraught about that prospect because I  think it is a function of a monetary policy that, despite all our  picking at it, has been a fairly successful one over the last year or  so given the circumstances we had to deal with We are in a trap I  think we all recognize that; if we don't, we should The business of  [being accused of] overstaying our [policy of] restraint is still  true; that will be true inevitably each time we come to this pattern,  regardless of what we do And I say that advisedly because part of  our job description is to be a convenient whipping boy I don't say  that with any bitterness; I think this is part of the function of the  Federal Reserve System We are handy [as a scapecoatl We can  portray an image that is very greatly oversimplified in the public  mind--to the extent that they pay attention to us at all--and I am  willing to suffer with that Even our best efforts at economic  education seem unable to put a dent in that   So I think we are in for some problems later this year, but I  don't feel any sense of panic about that To the extent that we have  an influence, and we certainly do, I think we are part of the creation  of the leveling out--1 hate to use the word recession I won't be  like Fred Kahn and make it a banana much less a kumquat, which I     3 / 2 0 / 7 9  -18-   gather has succeeded the banana We have some concern, and properly  so, about a very low level of economic activity But I view it as  something that we can build on, not something to be afraid of   I find Steve's analysis very good Sure, he is in a  position, given his job description, to have to overly quantify some  things that are extremely difficult to quantify in order to be as  helpful as he can But I think the tenor of his remarks is basically  sound, and I interpret [his remarks as supportive of] my own feelings  that it is too early for any easing I would prefer to stay where we  are and lean a bit toward--and really just a little--more pressure  because I don't think it would do any harm   On the international side, although I'm not as pessimistic as  Paul is, I think the basic tenor of his remarks is correct We still  do have a very serious problem in maintaining the value of the dollar  The improvement that we are seeing now, the ""stability"" in the value  of the dollar, I think is going to continue partly for a very negative  reason--that there is more concern about the stability of the  Deutschemark, the yen, and the Swiss franc That is damning with  faint praise But I think this will help us stabilize the dollar,  even though it seems to some people that we're all going down  together We are still looked upon as a leader in terms of  [unintelligible] government action To overstate it or simplify it,  we are seen as the Rock of Gibraltar I would prefer to see us stand  up and take the rap, since we're going to get it anyway, and keep the  pressure on a bit longer   It so happens that I've also jotted down 10 to  10-1/2 percent on federal funds I would treat it asymmetrically,  rather than jump immediately to 10-1/4 percent But if the market  urge tended to push it toward 10-1/4 percent, I wouldn't resist it  For M1 4 to 8 percent is fine and 4 to 8 percent is all right for M2,  although I don't feel strongly about that versus the 3-1/2 to I-1/2  percent I would do a money market directive   I’d prefer the 10-112 percent upper limit I  don’t care that much about the 9-112 versus 9-314 percent [on the  bottom]   I have just one slight worry, though I'm not going  to oppose approval In ""a"" I have no objection to the $300 million on  any day, but I think this is--   Oh, we are not on '""a""?   Yes, my only question is on paragraph l A ,  Mr  Chairman The $300 million on any one day doesn't bother me; I'm a  little uneasy about the $1 billion since the most recent meeting  This is a very volatile [market] and I guess my question is, Alan Do  you really need that much room on the cumulative amount?   Yes   Well, I don't either, Mr Chairman I just wanted  to hear this sort of discussion It has helped me  "
1027,1979-04-17," M r   Chairman, I think the Board staff‘s forecast  is a very good one though improbable I agree with Mr Volcker; it  never happens that way But to make it have jiggles is even more  improbable S o  let’s keep our balance on the improbability theory  Like so many others, I feel that if anything the Board staff’s  forecast is too high on the real side and too low on the price side,  unfortunately But I am not saying that we are going into a  significant recession We may get awfully close to zero, though,  before this calendar year is over   In the Midwest, inventories are not excessive at the moment,  although I grant the point that they can turn around very fast I  think the risk is still much greater on the inflation side than on the  recession side I am getting sick and tired, though, of hearing  market analysts and the press blow up the fact that we are having so  much difficulty at the Federal Reserve interpreting the monetary  figures and, therefore, we feel we don’t know what we’re doing It is  getting ridiculous As a non-monetarist to start with, I’ve been  having trouble interpreting the monetary figures for the last ten  years and I don’t see that this is any worse Really, I’m serious!  I think the emphasis on the confusion has done us harm We have  tended to feed it and we should stop if we can, simply because our  ability to be precise on the monetary aggregates--a precision that I  feel was never [possible]--has been exaggerated So I’d come out and  say that we do know what is happening to the aggregates within the  usual guidelines of our interpretation here I might even go so far  as to stick my neck out and say that I think monetary policy has done  a good job in the last six or nine months in terms of achieving some  slowing in the aggregates--not as exaggerated a slowing as the  published figures on M1 show But given the environment in which we  had to work I think we have a [good] record Having said that, I feel  it would be premature to ease because of a fear of recession It  would exacerbate the inflation problem, so I would not like to see us  ease Any tightening we do should be no more than 1/8 point or so at  the most To change our basic [posture] from alternative B, or from  where we are right now, would risk a very bad result I don’t want to  cut off any strength in the dollar by easing at this point I don‘t  think we need to accentuate the strength of the dollar by tightening  so at this particular juncture I’m as much in favor of standing pat as  I’ve ever been     4/17/79 -21-   C H A I R ""  MILLER Thank you, Bob Roger   Mr Chairman, I would stick with alternative B I  would not object, however, to a tightening of 1/8 point or so, which  would bring us closer to 10-1/4 percent [on the funds rate] I think  that could give a sign of resoluteness without getting us in trouble  of over-reacting Again, I would follow it as we go along and to some  extent see what the market is telling us; I would accept a 10-1/4  percent rate if the market seemed to be telling us that Otherwise  I‘d leave it where it is I have no particular quarrel with the  digits on M1 and M2, and I could buy either type of directive A  monetary aggregates directive might be a little better this time   I’m flexible within a 1/2 point on those   I had aggregates But Paul is right In effect,  we’re using a money market directive   In preference to 3 to 7 ?    I agree with John, Mr Chairman   Yes   Yes   I find myself supportive of it, Mr Chairman It  seems to me that it does give us another tool And I certainly trust  this Committee and even more I trust the Manager that in the  intermeeting periods the spirit of this would not be violated     4 / 1 1 / 1 9  -43 -    I agree with John that I don’t want to see this  used as a super intervention tool or--well, he didn’t say this--as a  way to throw our weight around or something like that But I think it  can be quite supportive of additional flexibility in monetary policy  in a broad sense Like Phil, I think we have to be very careful in  how we do it, not only with the Hill and the Treasury but also in our  relations with other central banks But that‘s why we have such a  capable Manager and that’s part of his job So I would vote for this  "
1051,1979-04-27," I’d leave it the way it is, Mr Chairman The economic prospects  seem, if anything, a little more sluggish to me than they were when we met in April and I consider  that more important than what Bob Black has called the April acrobatics I have no faith in so short  term a movement; if it continues for 3 or 4 weeks like that, I’ll eat those words but not for now   I need three more weeks   Fine  "
1079,1979-05-22," I must add for the benefit of everyone else that  this T-shirt is being offered to member banks for $ 2  0 0  and to  nonmembers for $1000 It's part of our improvement of service!   Mr Black, I shouldn't admit this, but the T-shirt  was issued by our credit union, which is independent   Thank you, Mr Chairman Jim, to what extent do  your figures embrace the latest increases in crude [oil] prices by the  individual OPEC countries? And, secondly, do you allow anything for  the increased pressure on the oil companies to deal in effect in the  black market on the spot market?   But you feel that has already been built into your  forecast?   That's all?   Well, I'll start off where Roger left off I,  too, feel that an increase in the discount rate would not be  inconsistent with a policy position that is essentially a stable one  I think it would have some announcement effect in terms of our  continued concern about inflation without really having a substantive  effect, if I make myself clear I think we have passed a [cyclical]  peak in this current quarter My guess, for what it's worth, is that  in the years to come the National Bureau of Economic Research will  record this quarter as the turning point It has all of the  ingredients, without some of the distortions, of the early '74 period  Credit expansion and many of the aspects of the real economy, as  pointed out by the staff, indicate a turning point   I'm not ready, however, to see us respond to a recognition of  that turning point--even if all of us agree that it is here--by a  significant move toward easing I think that would be premature  because of our continued very high levels of inflation It would be  misinterpreted I'm not sure yet whether I buy Steve's widening of  the range for M1 I'm more inclined to narrow it and be willing to  jiggle [the funds rate] up another eighth of a point or so if indeed  the aggregates come in strong in the rest of May and June, although I  don't expect them to do so I am more ready than I have been in many  months to see us ease, but I'm not ready to do so today Let me put  it this way I have opened my mind a little more in that direction   And let us pray   I don't have any particular problem if we use a  money market directive in going with 0 to 5 percent On M2 I'm  indifferent on whether the range is 4 to 8 or 4 to 9 percent If we  did go to a monetary aggregates directive, I would narrow the ranges  on both M1 and M2 There is a little quirk here that probably should  be mentioned, but it may not be of any importance And that is that  our present directive has a fed funds range of 9-3/4 to 10-1/2  percent Granted, we don't let out the new information until after  the next meeting, which is a long time from now But I'm just  wondering if it would look as if the Committee had indeed tightened up  from 9-3/4 to 10 percent on the lower bound of our funds rate range  So I'd prefer an asymmetrical midpoint of 10-1/4 percent and I'd keep  the 9-3/4 percent as the lower bound   No then it's a money market directive   You're not going to retire on that note!   This is separate from the $1 billion?   Yes  "
1098,1979-06-27," Mr Chairman, I think I would subscribe completely to the Volcker  thesis We are within the M1 longer-term target ranges that we set for ourselves I find the  projection of a weak July-August for M1 a little reassuring to the extent that any of these M1  figures can be reassuring I feel that we have to recognize the limitations of monetary policy here  and save our ammunition--for the moment anyway--but I certainly would watch carefully I’d  stay where we are  "
1124,1979-07-11," Did you answer the question?   Jim, I have a little problem with your statement  that one of the reasons the recession may be milder this time, or that  we won’t have a great problem this time, is that there might not be an  identity this time of recession abroad and here I would take some  issue with the latter statement Some of the tea leaves tell me--and  it‘s more than tea leaves, I guess--that we may be forced into a  situation again with an identity of recession throughout the free  world, not just here That would tend to make me a little more  worried about the shallow saucer projections Also, although this  gets into the financial side, I would say that while we don’t have  REITS this time, there is much more concern about the volume of  foreign bank loans by American banks at this point and whether we are  getting too close to the saturation point on handling the recycling of  the 80 percent increase in OPEC prices This gives me an additional  concern that hasn’t been mentioned here yet   I find Mark's assertion congenial and I--   Yes, I think it can be proved, but I will make the  same caveat that Mark did Although the staff forecast is a  reasonable one, I find myself a little more pessimistic I am  concerned about both the likelihood of less real growth and more     1/11/19 -21-   inflation I really feel at this point that if we can beat 12 percent  this year we will be lucky on the inflation side I think we will  improve on that next year, but I don't hold much hope for getting  materially under 12 percent for this year as a whole Having said  that, and having agreed with Mark's basic assertion, I find the 3 to 6  percent range for M1 this year a pretty good range I wouldn't change  that For next year, if we have to do something--which we do--  intellectually I would say that we should widen the range and make it  2 to 7 percent I would go the other direction from some of the  others But I don't think it is a practical approach   Yes, 3 to 6 percent for '79 or 3 to 5-1/2 percent  --I wouldn't quarrel with that   I'm adjusting it   I am talking about the second line in the  material distributed--the ""M1 measure,"" as it is called here   It's 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 now and it would be 3 to 6--   Well, that's [no] change It's the way Steve has  it down here   And that's the way I am looking at it--through the  old ATS   Sure   I prefer the 3 to 6 percent, but I find that a  minor point of difference Now, since we are required to go out to  1980, I would say that if 3 to 6 percent is okay for '79,  intellectually the range should be something like 2 to I percent for     7/11/79 -22-    ' 8 0  because [it seems logical to1 widen the band But I find this  insulting to the process that we are being asked to do It's sort of  a throw-away bid So with that in mind, I would find 3 to 6 more  congenial again--or 3 to 5-1/2--for 1980 I see no reason to try to  encourage a lot of journalists to interpret whether a half percent  more or less has any significance for 1980 I think that's  foolishness So whatever we come up with for '79, I'd leave it that  way for our first stab at ' 8 0     5 to 8 and 6 to 9     I would leave the figures the way they are, Mr  Chairman, but say in your text that we are still firm in our desire  over the longer run to see the aggregates [slow]   Because we were in a recessionary period   Alternative I1 is fine with me I don’t share the  position that we should try to adjust the ranges to reflect the  possibilities of an international crisis of any kind, basically for  the reasons that you have outlined It seems to me that to try to do  it just by jiggling up the upper [limit of the funds rate] by a 114  percentage point wouldn’t solve anything really We should have it  much higher than that if we were going to assume that we will have no  telephone communication over the next four weeks I’m not willing to  make that assumption, so I would go with alternative I1 the way it is,  with a money market directive   Yes   I’d have no change We are going to redefine the  aggregates in January or sometime soon, anyway, and I think this would  just be confusing But John’s point is basically correct   With the same range [for fed funds1 of 9-3/4 to  10-1/2 percent?   I agree with Paul's statement  "
1149,1979-07-17," Well, Mr Chairman, I would give it one more day and that's all It seems to me that if intervention doesn't quiet things down or if the markets don't quiet by themselves by this time tomorrow, we should move with a quarter percentage point on fed funds rate and a half percentage point on the discount rate I would put it strictly on the basis, as both Paul and Henry have said, of a move that is required for support of the dollar I would not, however, announce that it could be reversed People know that and I think it might have a backfire effect The President's speech, from what I've heard--and there was a lot of conversation about it among executives from all over the country prior to the dinner with the Chinese Finance Minister dinner here last night--was generally viewed as the most brilliant speech that President Carter has ever given But there was general agreement, too, that it was a bit too ""preachy"" in the first part and a bit too long-range and [expansive] in the second part, with no concern shown for the short-term situation either on the inflation front or the [energy front] Many of my friends say it was really a missed opportunity to take a positive leadership role in the restoration of nuclear power as an important source of energy for the next ten years [That] could eliminate half the problem if he would have gone forward on that And we are far enough away from Three Mile Island now that a lot of the emotional response--and most of it was emotional--could have been reversed with a strong leadership position But as I say, on our own problem I'd give it one more day and then I would move if things don't quiet down "
1193,1979-08-14," What's the average length of the System portfolio at this time? Do you have that, Peter--or someone?  I had no idea it was that long That adds a little maybe to the reason for Henry's question  I would have thought it was more like 2 years  -2-    8/14/79  I'd like to move approval, Mr Chairman  But it wouldn't just say that the Committee approved this It would say [the vote was] 9 to 3, or whatever it might be  It seems to me, Paul, that this last sentence is a delightful art form that preserves our independence, while achieving an objective  Is that for calendar 1980 or what, Jerry?  It would be much more than that I would think in its economic effect, because your figures would reflect the collections on corporate taxes and they would still be running pretty high  If corporate profits fall off next year, then we are going to have a much bigger effect than $3 billion, I would think, by fiscal 1981  Mr Chairman, I'd like to look at this as an opportunity rather than a box  Inflation is our number one enemy This has been declared far and wide, by the President of the United States and the leaders of the Congress as well as by the Federal Reserve This may not always be the case There may be some folding on the fiscal side In fact I would be willing to bet a Suzie to a penny--well, I've got to help publicize [the Susan B Anthony dollar]--that we will have fiscal stimulus regardless of what we do, as long as we're responsible, of course If we put the discount rate at 20 percent that's something else We will be blamed for high interest rates and for causing the recession regardless of whether we move [rates] up a percentage point or down a percentage point at this juncture We tend to be too thin skinned about that I don't think we can take it seriously as long as we act within a reasonable margin, which is a much greater margin than this Committee has typically envisioned We all grant--I think Phil Coldwell put it very politely--that we have a generally shared low level of confidence in the accuracy of our figures on the monetary aggregates But having agreed with that, I don't know what to do with that fact I think we have to take the central point of the low level of confidence and work with it partly because--and here we are in a box--we have agreed to and the law has been passed that we are to have targets and those targets have been elaborated on We obviously have a very concrete belief in some targets that we ratified again just one month ago  So for foreign reasons, namely the value of the dollar, and for inflation reasons--and not only for substantive reasons but for symbolic reasons--I think this is an opportunity, while everybody is hating inflation so much, to move ahead and to tighten somewhat I would define ""somewhat"" as it was just defined--I forget by whom but I think it was Frank--as an 11 percent central rate A range of 10-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent [for the federal funds rate] is fine with me Maybe we could [trim] our aggregates [ranges] down a half point but I wouldn't go farther than that because I think we would make trouble for ourselves But I'd be ready to reverse, again partly for symbolic reasons and partly for substantive reasons, with this rather hazy concept we have of the distribution of the lagged effect  Steve's point is one I was going to make I think we could do that As far as the figures are concerned, surprisingly, I would support what Henry just said 10-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent with a central point of 11, and for the aggregates 4 to 8 and 7 to 11  Preference or acceptable?  Do you really mean better or just acceptable?  I think that's silly I'd just leave it at zero "
1224,1979-09-18," Doesn't the new bill give us some promise, though,  that they're going to try to put in a system where the [increase in  the debt ceiling] would be sort of automatic without all the testimony  and hocus pocus?   Well, it's such a waste of time The Secretary of  the Treasury and the staff have to spend untold hours getting ready  for something that really involves just spinning wheels   M R   PARTEE It seems like it comes around a couple of times  a year now   So moved   One of the main problems on the crop issue is the  inability to move the crops Rail capacity is very low With the  Rock Island strike and so forth, the Iowa farmers are really going to  [unintelligible]; they just can't move anything They still have a  large share of last year's crop sitting there   Mr Chairman, I have increasing difficulty in  trying to define how tight credit is We see the ambivalence, if one  can use that term, in our own area with farm credit, small business  credit, credit for builders and so forth very tight Banks are very  tight and it doesn’t filter down like it’s supposed to in a fluid  system from the big banks We don’t have the moral suasion problem  that we had five years ago--or if we do, we really haven‘t recognized  it--where many of us made real efforts to contact individual banks  about their overextension of acquisition credit and REIT credit and so  forth So I guess this leads to a question to Steve or anyone else on  the staff who wants to volunteer What is your interpretation of the  extent of the insulation of the large banks from our attempts at  credit tightening because of the availability of funds from abroad?     9/18/19 -20 -    That makes it extremely difficult for us to define how far we can go,  much less [how to1 implement whatever definition we arrive at   So you think we can offset the availability  through the rate?   I'm raising the issue, Paul I haven't made up my  own mind on it It's an issue that we have not discussed around this  table in this cycle and we certainly did five years ago   No, I'm throwing this up for grabs at this point  I don't know how to attack the moral suasion issue this time, Paul,  because of the availability of such a flood of funds in the  international markets We are not talking about what was an attempt  in a mild way at ""credit allocation""--if I may use the naughty tern--  five years ago when we were trying to get [banks] to stay away from  purely acquisition credit and trying to keep the REIT situation stable  yet not expanding This time what I have in mind in bringing this up  certainly doesn't relate to our banks and foreign loans; it isn't that  aspect of it And I don't know to what extent moral suasion could do  us much good here It's a much broader question to go out and say to  the big money market banks that we would prefer that you not borrow  from abroad That's a very hard thing to say What do we do about  it? I don't know, but I think it's a worthwhile question to kick  around a bit   That's true   Well, to the extent oil money or OPEC money is  involved and that's sloshing around, that somehow gets to the big  banks and insulates them from monetary policy I hope that Steve's  answer on [rates] is an accurate statement I certainly do   That's the real problem   And the compensating balances   6-1/2 to 10-1/2   I didn't elaborate on my own position earlier but  I find I am much more comfortable with Alternative B as presented [in  the Bluebook] I would not object to going to the 11-1/2 percent  midpoint with the 11-1/4 to 11-3/4 percent range I don't think I  would widen the range right now though, to 11 to 12 percent, say I  don't find the 9 percent [for the M1 range] too high either; I think 5  to 9 and I-1/2 to 11-1/2 are all right Once I decide that I want the  midpoint [of the funds range] at 11-1/2 percent, I think [the  question] is about the tightening that I want to see done And, like  Mr Guffey and Mr Winn, I would rely on a little psychology here and     9/18/79 -39-   move up the discount rate a half percentage point and have that be our  announcement effect rather than have any tightening other than what I  might say is more of an accommodation to the market If the market  tightens, I wouldn’t have any problem going to 11-1/2 percent but I  wouldn’t do any more than that I think we have to keep the pressure  on; I don’t want to see any sign of easing whatsoever And I think we  can do it with that prescription   Well, I am too, Bob, but I have trouble paying too  much attention to the two-month figures     9/18/79 -40 -    That's what I'm arguing for, Bob I think we've  got a position in place now where we have the pressure on Sure, we  ought to be ready to reverse but I think we ought to be very careful  not to tighten unnecessarily more than the 118 point we're talking  about   A very technical point Paul 6-1/2 to 10-1/2  percent is a smaller range for M2 than we have for M1 Does that make  sense? Should it be 5-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent? It’s the least  important [number] we‘re talking about   Or at least have the same [width] range   It’s a question of consistency   It just seems, if we’re going to have a 5-point  range on M1, that we should have no less than a 5-point range on M2   I‘m suggesting 5-1/2 instead of 6-1/2 percent on  the lower end of the M2 range   I don’t either, but I don’t [hear] any objection   Splendid  "
1264,1979-10-06," We have plenty of tightness at 90 percent of our  banks but they probably don't account for more than half of the  business And the other 10 percent can get money whenever they want     10/6/19 -3 -    Sales at Sears Roebuck were ahead of last year for  the first time in twelve months   Well, Sears has gone through particular problems   M R   PARTEE It seems to me that they were in bad shape about  a year ago   M R   MAYO It shouldn‘t be used as an example for the whole  country   Yes, but Penneys and Kmart are still doing fine   Paul, in your review you made no mention of  controls I hear more rumors about those than you can shake a stick  at these days   Mr Chairman, I would like to enthusiastically  support the change in emphasis in our operations I have felt for a  long time that we were doing the best that we could, but I've changed  my position on that under these circumstances of the most sensitive  monetary situation that I can remember at any time in our history It  seems to me that we are dealing with an essentially psychological  situation, both abroad and here at home I'm not going to suggest  that we do something dramatic just to do something dramatic I share  John Balles's feelings that this isn't something that is so unknown to  us that we should register fear and trepidation and do it blindly I  think the RPD experiment, looking back over the history of it, failed  because we were too timid on the federal funds ranges that we  associated with it, and it killed itself   So, I think now is the time for us to take the plunge, so to  speak I would do it for international reasons, too I don't think  it is just a question of fallout from what is good for domestic  reasons I have talked over recent years with a number of people  throughout the world in their home offices about the role of money  targets and so forth And I've come to realize that for better or for  worse these [targets] are there; there is an acceptance of the idea of  a more monetarist approach than we have taken It seems to me that  this is the time to do something a little more [dramatic] If I may  be so crude, the patient has been constipated for a long time and  Ex-lax will no longer work I'm suggesting an enema or, if you want  the full prescription, an enema plus some change in diet Dr Mayo is  speaking, though I'm not one of the Mayo brothers, thank you   Anyway, at this point I think we can capitalize  psychologically on monetarist support throughout Europe in particular,  as well as in the Congress of the United States and much of the  journalistic fraternity today That doesn't mean that I, Bob Mayo,  agree with all the arguments of the monetarists, but I recognize that  they are there and they are important They can give us support in  what is essentially a psychological situation I would not worry  about whether, in going with the new emphasis, we are taking a risk  that we cannot reverse [our decision] if we have to go to something  else later This is not black and white We could decide--to use an  extreme example--that we don't want to say anything about a federal  funds range in the directive today, but keep to ourselves the idea  that the Desk should have plenty of leeway If the market dictates--  in the way it responds to what we're doing--that the federal funds  rate should go temporarily to 15 percent, we'd let it go I wouldn't  worry about that If sometime after 90 days--or it may take even  longer--we find that this [new operating technique] has served its  purpose, we can go back to including a federal funds range that is  broad but nevertheless there, if we wish to I think we have these  options as we move along A decision today to go to the technique  described in Steve's and Peter's memo is not a decision for all time,  either on the technique or obviously on the policy We may wish to  reverse it before we get locked in [at] too high [a rate], as Paul has  said If we believe in targets at all and believe that we have a  responsibility to meet our targets, I think our best bet--not our  riskiest--at this point is to take the bull by the horns and change  our emphasis of operations   I'm probably getting ahead of myself or ahead of the group,  but I would combine this with some increase in reserve requirements,     10/6/79 -18-   particularly aimed at the larger banks where the tightness is not  apparent Our agricultural banks are tight as a drum It's not  needed there bur it is needed for the bigger banks And I would think  that any discussion of the discount rate today would probably be  premature; that would follow along with whatever the market is  showing But we should keep on the alert on a day-by-day basis to the  way the market is responding to our shift in emphasis And I would  give considerable publicity to the change in emphasis In my view  this can be very important psychologically at home as well as abroad   CHAIR"" VOLCKER Roger Guffey   Paul, at some point I think we need to hear from  your associates in New York as to how they would operate under this  technique if we adopt it I think that is part of--   No way   [Growth for] September to December   Steve, 4 percent for September to December would  give us a 5 percent growth rate for the year, right?     10/6/79 -39-   Well, that’s why you are emphasizing September to  December because that would at least bypass a variable   Yes   Well, that’s true   Well, I agree with Bob   It seems to me we are better off, Mr Chairman, to  aim for a growth rate for the year and let the staff work it out   Yes   If we have a discount rate change to 12 percent,  why would we want an 11-1/2 percent lower constraint on the federal  funds rate?     10/6/79 -43-   HOW symmetrical do we want to make it at this  point? I grant that 12 is close to 11, closer to 11-1/2--   I agree, too   Just to pin it down, are you thinking of $15  billion?   Would you expect to get action from us and our  boards of directors on Monday?     10/6/79 -48 -    Almost to the full 4 points, if we are going to  sell it   It would look as if we are just chug, chugging,  more [of the same] It lacks the announcement effect of the other  approach   I would, too   Mr Chairman, would it be too much of a straddle  to say that we were going to aim for a 4 to 4-1/2 percent range [for  Ml] for September-December?     10/6/79 -53-   Well, my point isn't just to straddle more, but to  cite an intention within a half point range It seems to me that  we've been range conscious on all of our aggregates so there's no harm  in saying we are aiming in a range of 4 to 4-112 percent for September  to December   No   Yes, I accept Chuck's point I think it's well  taken  "
1307,1979-11-20," So moved   SO moved   That would be favorable   I'd say a couple of things I have no fault with  the staff forecast except that my elbow--which doesn't quite have the  problem o€ Nancy's elbow but maybe it will get that way--tells me that  the economy will be weaker than in the forecast The chances are  greater that it will be weaker with greater unemployment and  unfortunately maybe even a little more inflation I still feel very  strongly that the Fed's job is to concentrate more on the inflation in  our economy now than on the real sector, again partly because we are  the only game in town Even though our effectiveness may be limited,  psychologically it is far more effective than anybody else's My  answer to John Balles on the reason why long-term interest rates have  gone up is that there has been, even among sophisticates, an almost  complete turnover and disillusionment as to whether inflation can be  controlled This is reflected in long-term rates and it makes our job  even more of a challenge   I welcome what we did yesterday, Mr Chairman, as well as  Steve's additional input this morning But I think we may be engaging  in a bit of self-flagellation here that is over and above the call of  duty We made a giant step on October 6 AS we sit back and look at  it, it isn't that giant a step in terms of what I would call an  evolution of monetary policy and its strategies and techniques We  have been concerned with reserves before; we just were too timid to  let the system work We have freed the reserve control concept now of  its interest rate bounds to a considerable extent And yet we must  grant that we have found no magic formula as to additional ways of  making this process of monetary policy as simple as some of our  academic friends believe it can be made We still have lags; we still  have multiplier effects that differ; and we still have disputes as to  how to do our seasonal adjustments We can go right down the line,  and we still have basically the same problems we had before This has  been a very important step, but I would rather view it more as an  evolutionary step than a revolutionary step The press has taken it  up as a revolutionary step and we can live in the glory of that in the  short run I don't think that it is understood yet what we are doing  apropos of the Chairman's statement about [being asked] when is policy  going to change   I welcome Larry's speech on defining ""it"" as having a  longer-term span than many people had argued before; I certainly agree  that that is true And it's for that reason that I don't share  Roger's worry that a big December number is going to get us into any  trouble I prefer ""B;"" I would not object to the Morris formulation     11/20/79 -31-   of ""C"" with the $1-1/2 billion [on initial borrowing] I do not see  anything particularly wrong with that I would take us at our word,  though, on the releasing of the federal funds constraint and go with  11 to 16 percent I would broaden it by 1/2 percentage point on  [each] side to indicate again our willingness to see the rate  fluctuate a little more I see nothing wrong with that But I come  back to the point that I think is terribly important Although I  welcome the soul searching [and the attention] we are giving to the  change in technique and the way the Board staff and the Desk have  approached it, we are still dealing basically with the same animal  that we did before We have a chance here to sharpen things up--and  we have sharpened things up--but certainly there is no way to make  this process as simple as perhaps some of us would like   The other way around--a strong ""B"" or a weak ""C""   Paul, that doesn't bother me for a change It  seems to me that we've demonstrated that we're willing to let that  rate go up to 15 percent and if it does a second time--if it should  happen--I think less attention would be paid to it   I object   I feel the same way as Mark does, that the  Chairman is getting too close to [targeting] interest rates   That's right   I would support that, Mr Chairman   We basically have that flexibility, though,  either way we do it   What do you mean? Is it 8-5/8 percent for M2?   My whole point on all of this is that 8-l/2  percent works in the direction of Steve's suggestion Why don't we  make it 5 percent, 8-l/2 percent, and 1 - 1 / 2     That's why we can live with it   M R   WALLICH That's what I don't like   We're not going to do it for February and March  "
1338,1980-01-08," I don't see that we have any alternative Nothing seems to have been suggested as a clear alternative to continuing this and monitoring it awfully closely  Peter, would you have done anything differently if we had had a 10 to 17 percent funds rate range for this past week?  I thought that would be your answer  Well, Mr Chairman, just to start this part of the discussion going, it seems to me--  --that we're better advised this time around with these new measures coming out to settle on, say, M-1B and adjust it if necessary later on rather than try to straddle an average of M-1B and M2 because we don't know about nationwide NOW accounts I think it would be cleaner and easier to explain if we just settled on one [measure], even though we recognize that we might have to make some adjustments to it later on  Well, I think that's true But I'm arguing a little different point That if we get into placing a lot of reliance on M2, a considerable part of which we would have no control over, it will give the wrong public image, too  That may be all right Certainly no one in the preceding discussion has suggested that we average nonborrowed reserves with total reserves I'm just arguing that we ought to get away from this averaging regardless of which--  Or M-lA with M-1B What does that mean?  Did you do well in the market last year, Larry?  Do you consider the 63 percent consistent with the range of 3 to 6 percent, though?  Mr Chairman, I find myself philosophically interested in the idea of reducing the ranges, but I don't think this is the time to do it I think we need all of the flexibility we can have here I find myself at least at the moment utterly opposed to going above 6 percent on the upper end of our range for whatever we call [narrow money]--Ml, M-1A, M-lB--for psychological reasons It would give a wrong impression abroad regardless of how much we tried to explain it, and to some extent that would be true at home as well So I come back to the 3 to 6 percent range that we had, not just because we had it this [past] year but because I think we have established some modicum of credibility in keeping [actual growth] within the 3 to 6 percent We're certainly very close to the upper edge, but we still have established a credibility which I have the impression at least was not achieved even by some of our more austere partners, Germany included I feel that this a restrictive policy  Like Willis, I feel that the variability of the outlook is even greater now than it has been, certainly in my memory as a member of this Committee That's one of the reasons I wouldn't narrow the range I would also urge that we keep our powder dry until we see how things are moving along six months from now As to whether we want to change that range, I certainly wouldn't make [our intent] public, and I certainly wouldn't stick to 3 to 6 percent through, shall we say, hell or high water I feel very strongly that to use a [number] of any kind beyond 1980 is foolish I feel, much as Ernie does, that if we state our intention in the present environment as defined by the President's messages and so forth and so on, our own analysis and related intention to reduce the expansion of money supply further as  -42-    1/8-9/80  long as the inflationary forces rage as strongly as they do is as far as we can go in talking about '81 and '82 I join Nancy [in her view about long-term projections] I'm not going to question whether she's made even more 5-year projections than I have, but we made the first one on the budget in the 1971 Economic Report It was a fine paper exercise, and the way to start is to start But I would hate to go back and review that now, even with all the adjustments, and realize how shaky it was at the time  I'll move  How much of your 8 percent [inflation forecast] would be energy-related then?  Jim, first a question I assume that these projections were glued together before the President's grain embargo statement was issued and therefore do not reflect either the suspension of additional exports to Russia nor the promise by the government for grain storage, whatever that may mean Have you had a chance to evaluate what adjustment there might be to your forecast because of these twin factors?  Of course, there's also the question of what happens to the grain It can't be stored indefinitely  My other point is an observation It seems to me that one of the factors making consumers spend much more is that, for better or for worse, they have had such an increase in the equity in their homes that they consider that their kitty That could be very dangerous if there is a prolonged slowing in [housing prices] But I know of instances involving personal friends who feel much more prosperous and are willing to spend more of their disposable income just because they have a house that they think has gone up in value by 50 percent in the last couple of years  Yes Well, don't try to get me to predict the timing of some of these things; it just comes in waves As we said, the product--whether they're buying automobiles or refrigerators or whatever the composition is--is elusive here But [the rise in home prices] seems to me to be an important factor  One of the aspects of this that is important, too, is the extent to which there is excess capacity in the defense  -60-    1/8-9/80  industry that could take up a significant increase in defense spending We learned again in the Vietnam conflict that we couldn't spend as fast as was budgeted because the factory wasn't there; they had to tool up and so forth It takes a much longer time to acquire a sophisticated product But that is one of the considerations that perhaps--  Mr Chairman, I want to make a couple of points First of all, I want to agree with Dave Eastburn's philosophy of not monkeying around with fine-tuning among the quarters This makes us think we are smarter than we are, among other things, to use his language The purpose here is to set a long-term range and, unless we see some rather dramatic reason for changing it, to make our quarterly [objectives] basically consistent with that, subject to some small variations--and I mean small--that Steve may feel he has to introduce into the staff projection I feel also, although we have made a giant step forward in moving [from 2-month horizons] to September-to- December and now December-to-March [time periods], that we need to make one more refinement of that in the interest of not being too overwhelmed by monthly changes [in the growth of money] It would be much better if for the current quarter, or the decision which is being  -67-    1/8-9/80  made today, on January 9, to use the month of January as our center month and in effect take the fourth quarter of 1979 and go to the quarter centered on the current date That means comparing the average for the fourth quarter with the average for December, January, February Next month we would do January, February, March; in other words, it would be literally fourth quarter-to-first quarter I think that makes a lot more sense and gets us over part of our hangup where we spend, it seems on occasion, an interminable amount of time trying to explore the seasonal adjustment deficiencies of a given month Granted that going to three months is in the right direction, I would urge strongly that the Committee consider going from quarter to quarter It may look awkward because in the first instance in effect we have to have December at both ends of our equation But as we move on out, of course, that overlap would not occur It's just a neater proposition and would help in the smoothing of this Again, the point is--and I think Dave made it effectively--that we can do a better job that way  I would add that I prefer alternative B partly because I like the 3 to 6 percent long range and the 3 to 6 percent short range, which yields a midpoint--whether by coincidence or not--of 4-1/2 percent for the quarter-to-quarter change I guess that is for the fourth quarter to the first quarter literally, Steve I don't know what it would be for December, January, February; maybe it doesn't make much difference I feel very strongly that the answer to the question of ""Do we pay attention to interest rates?"" is that, of course, we pay attention to interest rates We pay attention to interest rates just like we pay attention to real GNP, unemployment, and an awful lot of factors In my mind we shifted in the October 6th package from a primary public emphasis on interest rates to a primary public emphasis on the aggregates, with the targets going through reserves We have not abandoned all of our secondary emphases We emphasize plenty of things, one of which has to be interest rates because we live in the real world and the execution of monetary policy must be through a market that pays attention to interest rates There's no substitute for that; at least I've never heard of one in our type of society  One other point I think the Federal Reserve System would be making a serious mistake to publish M-1A and M-1B and M2 and M3 and L and say to the world, in effect We don't know which of these is right; take your choice Now, I'm perhaps overstating I would pick M-1B myself and call it Ml, drop the B And if we have to qualify the description of it because of NOW accounts or other changes, we should qualify it But we are being almost too research oriented, too much students of this rather than decisive leaders If we can't determine which one we think is better, with some qualifications and so forth, nobody can And I think our leadership role depends in large part on our ability to go through this whole redefinition of the aggregates and to avoid coming out with a definition that looks like the mouse has really squeaked by coming up with M-1A I would recommend strongly that we publicize M-lB as Ml We can handle the consequences End of speech  I'm not arguing against that, but I think we should indicate a dominant preference  We are forced to do it Let's be proud and carry the flag and not say we don't know but maybe this is the better of the two I see us being too academically sound, if I can put it that way, rather than carrying leadership for a figure And if we can't carry that leadership, nobody can  Don't mess it up! "
1366,1980-02-04," Well, most of my speech has already been given But I would say of the three alternatives Steve presented, I certainly would agree with the staff, or the reserve requirements policy group, that a return to contemporaneous reserve accounting would be the preferred solution I think it is better than lagged reserves But I too feel, though I probably can't say it as eloquently as John just did, that it very definitely ties into the membership bill, and I would postpone it if only for that reason I also feel, even though I am known around this table as a pragmatist or eclectic or something-- no comment Mr Roos--that there are two other ways that have not been thoroughly presented and discussed by the Axilrod Committee but should be They have been subjected to a lot of good academic thought Maybe they are cockeyed, but I can't see the holes in them myself yet, and I think they're worthy of discussion One of them is Bill Poole's paper, Frank, on what amounts to a 100 percent marginal reserve requirement on the most recent changes since the last determination The other is the idea of some sort of reverse lag where, as we all learned in our elementary money and banking text books, the Federal Reserve or the Central Bank sets the reserves That isn't as silly as it may sound We are not saying to a bank that it can't accept any more deposits because its reserves have already been set That can be handled by the way it works through the accounting system But it seems to me that both of those ideas have enough merit that they at least ought to be kicked around a little more by the SRAC and by Steve's group So, while I agree that the major reason for delaying the implementation of this relates to the membership issue and the timing, I would suggest that we have a little more work to do in terms of analyzing these two ideas, just as examples And if we want to blow holes in them, let's do it But some of us, at least, are intrigued by these two ideas and the possibility that, if they work,    2/4-5/80  they will bring us closer, though obviously not completely, to a chain drive rather than a belt drive, if I may use that [analogy]  There are good gimmicks and bad gimmicks We deal only in good gimmicks  These are professional gimmicks!  Why don't you give us the quarterly figures It may help us  It happens to be the same; it's 92 percent for the fixed weight price index, too  Me, too, Steve  Why don't you stand up, Phil?  You want to say that again?  First, to go back to the charts for just a minute I greeted with some astonishment the chart on unit [labor] cost indicators where output per hour, having deteriorated badly from the beginning of 1976 to the present or the last available quarter, suddenly takes a new spurt of enthusiasm and becomes positive And your unit labor cost, of course, shows just the opposite trend I would like to believe this, but I am not sure what the staff has based it on  In effect, you're suggesting that whatever labor hoarding has taken place to date really isn't going to continue And that's one of the reasons your unemployment rate is moving up as much as it is Is that correct?  My other question on the charts relates to defense spending Frank stole my headline on that by his mention of long lead times on defense contracts I find the assumptions both in the budget and in your table on real defense spending unreal I don't think it is possible unless there is an awful lot of shelf items involved--more than I can imagine--to add 6 percent to real defense spending in the remaining six months of the fiscal year And that's all there is left in this fiscal year We have a history over the last 30 or 40 years of projecting increases in defense spending prematurely, and I think this is happening again in the budget figures and in the staff forecast Instead of being up 7 percent and up 8 percent or whatever is shown on this chart, I would say it's more likely to be up 2 percent and up 12 percent So, that would affect the attitude toward these figures in 1980 On the other hand, I would support the total that you have in your staff forecast because I think it's more likely to burst out on the nondefense side in light of other factors between now and the beginning of the new fiscal year Now, that doesn't mean there isn't an attitudinal and expectational response But I think it stems mostly from the evaluation of the inflation and the real GNP outlook a year ahead, rather than manifesting itself in defense spending in the fiscal year of 1980  Having said that, I won't repeat Mark's caveats, but in terms of point estimates I really don't have much quarrel with the staff forecast on real GNP As for the probabilities, I would say the probability is that there will be less growth--in other words a bigger decline, net, than the [minus] two percent the staff has--maybe a [minus] 3 percent for the year I am not quite as pessimistic as Henry, but I will take shelter under his umbrella on the price index I don't think there is more than one chance in ten that we can get down to 10 percent on either the CPI or the fixed weighted deflator by the fourth quarter of this year The chances are very good--I hate to use the word ""good"" that way--that it will still be above 10 percent On unemployment, despite my question on the labor hoarding problem, the chances are unfortunately also very good that unemployment will be above 8 percent because the inflation rate is so sticky and so built into consumer expectations that I think this is the way it's going to crank out No tax cut, please  Mr Chairman, unlike the humility of Mr Schultz and Mr Willes about being somewhat simple-minded, I must be humble in saying that my mind finds things very complicated I have tried hard to move toward being simple-minded on some of these things We have different approaches to some of these problems However, I find that the factors are so complicated and have such a margin of error that I must stick to the 3-point range Some people might accuse the Fed of being a bit cowardly because the range is so wide But the factors that we are dealing with are indeed so complicated that we must allow ourselves this flexibility I feel, if anything, even more strongly than John Balles put it that we are [making this] unduly complicated Again, I am striving toward being a little simpler We are making it hard, and even harder for you, Mr Chairman, when you try to explain to your audience on Thursday why we have decided to use both M-1A and M-1B when both of them will need adjustment when we get NOW accounts And I agree we will get them nationwide I think we'd look a lot more sensible to forget M-1A--as I said last time and I'll say it again this time--and call it Ml, show some change, and not give the impression by stressing M-1A that the lion has labored and has produced a mouse There's too little change from the old M1 in what we are proposing, and I would rather see us stick with M-1B and give the explanation of the adjustment in NOW accounts in a simple-minded fashion rather than try to adjust both M-1A and M-1B to NOW accounts when they come This is the way in which my attempt to be simple- minded would direct us I'd prefer alternative II with the 3-point range I'd obviously prefer to concentrate just on M-1B and call it M1, [with a range of] 4 to 7 percent  Yes, it does  Why don't we just see what the vote is, Mr Chairman, on the bottom of alternative III and the top of alternative II, widening the range by 1/2 percentage point  It has some merit  It depends on one's point of view  What are we talking about? The 2-1/2 points?  In the interest of simplicity, I am prepared to shift my vote to alternative III  There's a multiplier here, Paul  The ""et als"" are still around  That is true in the short run, Paul, but as the year moves on, we have that flexibility We just finished using it the last time  The same thing that we just voted on  Are we content with a point target here? Is that the way we should read this?  There could be some argument, Paul, that we're farther along in the quarter and should narrow that range Or we could say 4-3/4 percent, which is--  How do you explain, Paul, why we have a point target even with the ""about"" in front of it for the short run and we have a range for the long run?  It's an instruction to the Desk Okay, I buy that "
1409,1980-03-18," Why does the Bundesbank  Yes  May I piggyback on Mark's comments for a minute? On your agriculture point, Mark, I wasn't sure I followed you Is it that the banks are not making loans at close to the prime rate but are falling further below? Is that what you're saying?  Well, the city banks won't buy them except at a discount--  --is what you're saying We have that same experience, and the banks in our area are very tight  Yes, the country banks There is some complaint, too, on the way the Farm Credit Agency credits enter into this Some of that is not credit we're trying to discourage, like Farmers Home Administration per se The more Farmers Home Administration does, the less of that type of credit the commercial banks will do, and they are restive about that even though they are tight  Mr Chairman, I would only add on the agricultural side that I think some of the trauma accompanying the announcement of the grain embargo has subsided There is a much calmer approach to the problem and a little more Federal government credibility than [earlier] in the farm community, although they are still somewhat skeptical We are, of course, in a very poor position on autos and housing throughout our District But capital goods are still running quite strong This is typical of what one might call ""this stage of the cycle"" I feel more comfortable than I did last month with the Greenbook [forecast], yet I would not be surprised if we got down to a minus 5 percent quarter [for GNP] before this forthcoming recession is over I think we are getting closer, much closer, to the peaks that we keep visualizing and postponing, and we could easily have a credit crunch--though I don't know how best to define that--perhaps in the next 4 to 6 weeks  Having said that, I would be happy enough with ""B,"" but I would tilt also a little toward ""C,"" agreeing with what Dave had to say On the federal funds range, though, I would just leave the [lower limit of] 11-1/2 percent It has no real significance now and I wouldn't want to see us push that up at this point It restricts our image of flexibility when it gets published Instead, I would just go to the 20 percent on the up side and be done with it, recognizing that that would give us cover for an interim period, rather than have to go back frequently to jiggle it up another half or one percentage point I don't see any objection to going to the 20 percent, given the rate structure we have today  We could say ""taking account of our needs in bank credit, consistent with the 6 to 9 percent [objective] for the year"" "
1432,1980-04-22," Well, Mr Chairman, most of my points have been made I would stick with the targets I would not see any objection, however, to our interpretation of ""about"" 4-1/2 percent being 4-1/2 percent or a little less rather than 4-1/2 percent or a little more Okay, so that's fine-tuning, but I think we can lean in that way for one reason or another Having said that, I would only add one other point I think the main advantage of the credit restraint program that we have embarked upon, with great pain, is that it perhaps has added the public awareness frosting to the cake, if I may put it that way The average consumer--I think for the first time really--has made an association, even just from reading the front page of his daily paper, that somehow credit restraint does have something to do with inflation I've heard even from builders, believe it or not, that they can wade through this and that the whole idea that the banks are now clamping down a little on consumer credit and so forth is great in that it is going to help a great deal on inflation All right, maybe that is overly magnified But I think we have the public's attention in a way that our October decision failed to get public attention It was still a market-oriented attention that had some limited significance outside of the financial community but [the average consumer] really didn't understand it They understand it when the First National Bank of Chicago puts in the paper that they're going to charge $20 for a Visa card They understand it when they find that on their Sears bill they have to pay 10 percent rather than 8 percent of the outstanding balance These things come home I think the main advantage of the credit restraint program has been in public education; and that in itself can have a tremendous effect on inflationary expectations, giving us a few months- In the meantime, during the difficult period that Paul referred to, for the next two or three months, we just have to grit our teeth and bear it If interest rates go down, that's fine; but I would tend to lean a little toward the lower end of our aggregate range--if not clear to the [lower] margin, a little below the midpoint "
1474,1980-05-06," Bob Mayo here, Paul Just to put it on the table    5/6/80  I move that we go to a 10 to 17 percent tolerance range [for the funds rate] That's 3 perentage points off on both ends The symmetry with removing the 3 percent surcharge is purely coincidental But I think that would give us the flexibility we need  My support of 10 percent, Mr Chairman, is really to give the Desk the flexibility that I think it badly needs I'm not saying that we ought to go to 10 percent; we should do what comes naturally in terms of the way the market responds But I see no particular point to moving [the lower limit] to 11 percent and then having to come back in another week or so and move it to 10 percent  The Chicago board has just approved that  Same way with Chicago  Keep the money markets mutual funds control on a little longer "
1496,1980-05-20," What about the $20 billion budget deficit that you have for fiscal '81? Do I understand that that would be even larger if the import fee were cut out?  So from your standpoint this is a swing from a $16 billion or so surplus projected by the Administration?  I think's it's a very reasonable assumption, but it is a very important ingredient in the Greenbook presentation  First, on the credit restraint program I, too, think it should be dismantled, but in parts The time is already ripe for getting rid of the consumer part I don't see any particular damage in taking it off piece by piece if only because, based on some of our traditional observances, the bank credit hangs on after activity starts down But also as a counterbalance, I feel we should keep at least the special deposit on the money market mutual funds for perhaps a little longer than some others have suggested simply because of the public perception If we take the special deposit off, people might feel the Fed is out of its mind to do that if we really believed in limiting their growth in the first [place] We know the reasoning, tying it to what the mutual funds invest in, but I think the public perception would give us a black eye And phasing out the equity [requirement] on the bank side too soon would give us a black eye But I think a case can be made for dumping the consumer credit [part] pretty fast  Moving on to our policy question, I lean the way Willis does We should be getting back on target or we will have a credibility problem again I don't think [our recent adoption of] a 10-1/2 percent lower limit has strained our credibility but [adopting] any lower limit higher than 8 percent would tend to strain the credibility of our decisionmaking today when it comes out because, for better or for worse, we have announced that we're going to concentrate mostly on [achieving] our targets for the aggregates Sure, we can change those targets in July if we wish, but for the moment we haven't given any indication--and I think properly so--that we have any desire to change those targets So I, too, would prefer ""B"" or almost a ""B-"" to get us back [on path] by September--we can always have a consultation in between [meetings]--and I'd pick figures of 8 to 14 percent [for the federal funds range] I consider the 10-1/2 percent [lower limit], which could become a sore point, something like a temporary intervention point, if I may draw the analogy from our foreign exchange side I would like to consider it that rather than as a real constraint that might upset our credibility on what we said in October and again in March  I suppose also we could cut the discount rate, Mr Chairman "
1545,1980-07-09," Your capital spending assumptions tie into this productivity assumption, too, don't they?  I'm thinking really of the capital spending that's already in place or under way  First, I think the staff forecast is very well put together My staff's forecast is close to that of the Greenbook but I personally feel a little more pessimistic just because I think we're coming out, I hope, of a very wrenching inflationary experience, which I believe tends to lessen our ability to rely on econometric models And I think some of our past sins, so to speak, in not encouraging enough capital formation and productivity in this country are catching up with us Maybe I'm just getting older, but this causes me to distrust even more than usual the figure factory, if I may call it that, on the projections for 1981 So, I'm just a little more pessimistic personally  I have one detail question on the unified budget You are more optimistic than the Administration for fiscal '80 Following up on Lyle's point, is this $55 to $60 billion [deficit projected by the  -19-    7/9/80  Administration] fairly set at this point or is the [potential] variation really more than you've indicated here? And why are you more optimistic? Is this a shift--shall I call it a political shift-- of a deficit from one period to another by the Administration?  Well, [comparing] the $59 billion Administration [preliminary deficit estimate], for what it's worth, and your $52 billion, I take it that you feel the receipts will do a little better That's part of it?  Yes, for 1980, the year we are in right now  This is also minor, but do your projections for '81 assume that what the Congress is trying to do on speeding up corporate tax collection [will materialize]?  Thank you  Mr Chairman, I'm quite comfortable with alternative 1 as stated, [namely to maintain] the present ranges I would, of course, do the proposed revision of the bank credit range But I don't consider that in the same box as the four aggregates As a matter of fact, I think we have gone out of our way to make it clear to the [Congressional] Committee--I'm relying on memory here, so someone can correct me if I am wrong--that [our aggregates targets] would be ""associated with"" bank credit expansion of such and such We've said that bank credit isn't a target in the sense that the aggregates are a target As far as next year is concerned, I subscribe also to the idea of [describing our objectives] qualitatively  I see no reason though, Mr Chairman, why you in your testimony couldn't indicate that we are at a different point in terms of the outlook for the ranges for this year--that at this time we are closer to the low end of the range for M-1A and a little higher than the midpoint for M-1B, and so forth You could do it qualitatively without disturbing your credibility; I think it would enhance your credibility And for next year, somewhat differently from Larry, I would put a little more reliance on M2 because I think it is a more stable aggregate against which to measure than M-1A or M-1B We are going to have a lot of volatility and unpredictability even [though we're more than] a third of the way through the year So I would lean toward more reliance on M2 looking forward It isn't as important in calendar year '80, but I think it is very important in calendar year '81 So, I think you can indicate qualitatively [how] we are leaning in our thinking without getting into quantities and without disturbing credibility Fred Schultz's point is very apt that Proxmire would like nothing more than to see us try to fine-tune some of these ranges He would say ""Aha, you are working in my direction but you are too cowardly to come out with a point estimate"" I would argue very vociferously against either fine-tuning or a point estimate  Well, you have to go further than I indicated, Paul, in that M2 has certain qualities that remove it a little from transaction accounts That's why we have M1 I don't see any harm in indicating that we may not be able to reduce M2 but that we expect or hope to have slightly lower M1 ranges I don't think that would get you in too much trouble because M2 does include the ingredients of housing finance and so forth That would not detract from the credibility of a qualitative statement of that type  I think you forgot to include the international considerations  We still have the housing market out on M2 We wouldn't want to emphasize reducing that on a long--  Mr Chairman, we could accept the logic you're propounding here and come up with [a set of targets] halfway between ""B"" and ""C"" but keep the 8-1/2 to 14 percent [funds rate range of ""B""] That's the way I would lean I'd say 7, 8, and 8 percent--to the extent that we like point targets [for M-1A, M-1B, and M2] and we seem to have gone toward point targets in the short run for simplicity--as long as we understand what we are doing  I don't want to change it  I don't see any problem in accepting the 87 percent for July if it turns out that way  I'd round them off, too [Using] quarters on the growth rate percentages strikes me as silly  We could use 8 percent for M2, couldn't we?  Well, I didn't mean to get us off the track  -64-    7/9/80  We talk in terms of consensus  If we try to sharpen this pencil too much, we're going to be voting on what words you use in the testimony I think this is getting ridiculous  Yes, I think this is putting the Chairman in a very peculiar position  But at the risk of more inflation in '82 and '83 perhaps I think that has to be put in "
1573,1980-07-25, And Chicago  And Chicago 
1594,1980-08-12," But if we used the bill rate, Lyle, given what bill rates have done, we would have a different problem on our hands  Well, the Canadians--  We always used to show a three-way average rate to our directors, just as a point of contact, [using the rates on] finance paper, Treasury bills, and commercial paper--all fairly short term We have had to abandon that recently We give them the table but we don't talk about it because we think it's out of whack  A $60 billion budget deficit doesn't help on the rate side either [even] if we keep our eye on the ball of the monetary aggregates  The stock market seems very unreal and a lot of people are predicting that we will have a correction Of course, our former Secretary of the Treasury announced he was selling all his holdings and the market went up 20 points in the next two days!  I see a lot of the investment people from LaSalle Street and almost without exception they are expecting at least a 75 to 100 point correction  I know  Basically, it's all right  -20-    8/12/80  A couple of points Ed made the point very well on savings bond redemptions; that has eased off a little now But a lot of that money is just parked waiting for what people think will be [higher] interest rates, I think Also, the Treasury has a 9 percent bond coming due August 15, which was subscribed to by a lot of [individuals], at least in our area They are already making inquiries as to what [return] is available [on Treasury securities] and typically are saying ""Oh well, I'll put [the proceeds] in a money market mutual fund when it comes due So we will be seeing more of that, which again leads credence to the fascination with M3 But it also gets to the point that the further out we go in the Ms, the less control we have over what we are doing So I think we have to be careful not to get too fascinated with M3 I'm inclined to differ a little with Chuck [on the relative merits of] M-1A and M-1B We'd have to adjust either one of them, whatever we were doing, and M-1B may be the better one going out a year or so Also, that is what the market is looking at I think not much attention is paid to M2 in the everyday market Whether Peter [Sternlight] and Allen [Holmes] would agree with that or not, [I don't know]  Well, we hope so We will have a different reason maybe a year from now But the further out in the Ms we go, the more trouble we get into in terms of what we can influence I feel we are better off sticking pretty much with M-1A and M-1B for the moment  Paul, there is one other option that we haven't explored for a long time It's probably not practical, but as I told a number of you, when I was in Frankfurt some years ago, Emminger said ""Mayo, we've got one advantage here over you folks that we are never going to give up"" I asked ""What is that?"" He said ""We have no weekly figures on the money supply and we're never going to have any"" Arthur Burns even threatened at one point to put out daily figures on the money supply to point up the absurdity [of following short-term fluctuations so closely] and then obviously thought better of the idea Is there any chance in the reporting from all these 40,000 customers we have now--it's probably too late even to suggest it--that we can solemnly decide that we should have only monthly figures on the money supply? Or is the world too sophisticated to accept that?  Well, that's the problem But it's tempting to talk about; we'd have one eruption a month instead of four  We are again, I think, magnifying very small differences I could be comfortable with either ""A"" or ""B,"" but I lean toward ""A"" basically for the reasons that have already been stated As for the recession, everybody is looking for good news now and I think they have over-emphasized what little good news has been in the papers We probably have at least another six months to go before we get any real positive signs of economic recovery I would rather, as the cliche at the moment goes, ""keep our powder dry"" and stick with ""A"" I do not worry at all about the overshoot in M2; in fact it helps, especially with M-1A coming out at the low end under either ""A"" or ""B"" It tends to illustrate again the fragile nature of these figures It isn't that we should say cavalierly that the targets aren't worth anything, but let's be practical about it We have our own little security blanket here of being at the low end on M-1A, in the middle on M-1B, and overshooting on M2 So what? It doesn't bother me It gives us a beautiful array to illustrate our point that there is no such thing as the perfect aggregate I would also comment that if we narrowed our ranges, which some of our friends on Capitol Hill wish we would do, it wouldn't solve anything We might end up below on M-1A and way over on M2 and be in the same situation we are now It wouldn't make us any better hewers to the line, if I can put it that way So, I lean toward ""A"" as the solution  What we did before was 7, 8, and 8 percent "
1632,1980-09-16," Would it make your job easier if there were a change, or is that an unfair question?  Mr Chairman, I have a question, which I could have asked last time too but didn't, on the gross domestic business product fixed weight price index That is the index the staff uses in its projection as the best index of inflation [The projection has for] the first quarter of '81 of [an annual rate of] 103 percent, for the second quarter 95 percent, and for the third quarter 85 percent I can't understand what causes that tremendous improvement in the inflationary outlook in those two quarters Also, my second question is Why do we use this rather than the GNP deflator, particularly since we usually respond in terms of the GNP deflator when Congress or others ask us for figures along this line?  In the 1980 pattern, though, you have a higher rate of inflation in the fourth quarter I assume that's the Civil Service [pay] increase and you don't have that for the next year  It's 9 percent  Mr Chairman, I don't want to get into a debate as to whether the New York staff makes better estimates than the Board staff, but I'm fascinated--if I have my figures right--that for the fourth quarter New York has expansion in M-1A of 32 percent and the  -33-    9/16/80  Board staff has 7-1/2 percent The same [pattern] is true for M-1B; it's a little less so on M2 If I am reading these right, the differences seem unusually large I'm wondering if anyone from New York or the Board would want to say anything about it  I find myself much more comfortable with the New York figure That doesn't mean--  It may be a derivative figure  I see  Okay Well, the fact that they are so different doesn't influence my own opinion, which is that alternative B is the right way to go I think it's a much more prudent approach, but I found I was covered with curiosity  A sharp drop in interest rates?  My opinion is in favor of alternative B I do question why there should be any difference in the fed funds range under either ""A"" or ""B"" I think [the current range is] sufficiently broad to encompass both of them "
1655,1980-10-21," I would favor going ahead with this, Mr Chairman I have just two points The loss and gain business doesn't make it any harder for us to explain this to a busy Congress under the new system than under the old As far as I'm concerned, we shouldn't worry about the losses and gains except on general principle And I find Henry's equation and the equation in effect that's in the memo easier to understand than our own equation on domestic monetary policy So, I would favor going ahead with this I think it's the right course  It's all Chuck's fault!  That isn't Chuck's 50 percent  That's just what I was going to say, too, Chuck Let's turn it around the other way Yes, it can be done--it has been done--if one is willing to look through the second quarter and the third quarter and at the broader record The subject of our study is, can it be done better? And if so, we want to find out how But we still have to stress the successful side of this if only to keep up our credibility and our confidence Credibility has two sides  Mr Chairman, I can't quarrel with the staff's projection I suppose I still lean, if at all, toward the view that the economy may be a little weaker rather than stronger and that we may have a little more unemployment and a little more inflation than the staff forecasts Even with that, although I have never been a great advocate of monetary targets, I find I am thankful that we have several targets and ranges rather than spot targets for one or two aggregates The latter assumed a performance measurement device that is far more risky than any of the FREPS measures that we fiddle with in the Federal Reserve System in terms of the individual bank performances I find that we do have a public credibility problem when the heads of the two [Congressional] banking committees plus quite a few other people have embraced the idea, simplistically, that target setting and target achievement are the be all and end all on inflation control by the Federal Reserve System Even though I don't believe that that's the way to measure our performance, I acknowledge the fact that [such a view] is there And I still feel that we will  -27-    10/21/80  have a better chance of [achieving] credibility through the end of this year by leaning toward ""A"" rather than ""B"" to give a little better insurance that we will remain within the aggregate targets Despite my agreement with Nancy on the interpretation of many of these things, I must respectfully disagree on the emphasis I think we have to place to keep the balance of factors in proper perspective I would lean toward the more restraining position even though the differences may be slight We're being measured From a purely theoretical approach, I think we're being measured unfairly by any of these things But I'm just old fashioned on that particular subject I recognize that we are being measured in many different ways, not just by the Administration or the Congress but by the market  It isn't a simple world "
1725,1980-12-05, It sounds fine to Mayo 
1746,1980-12-12," Paul, Bob Mayo [in Chicago] I think I should add, just on the commodity market, that the Board of Trade did open this morning and went down its limit but has recovered somewhat since, in what I imagine would be the [unintelligible] in financing of those accounts They felt reasonably comfortable as of 11 o'clock this morning, with perhaps one exception, that things aren't going to blow up on them The president of the Board of Trade is in the process of putting out a statement this morning Our people are over there watching to see what is going on and we have our fingers crossed that things don't seem to be continuing to [reflect] all the excitement that the rumors produced yesterday afternoon "
1765,1980-12-18," Yes  That's all right I had my hand up long ago, but I didn't get noticed  -56-    12/18-19/80  Mr Chairman, Messrs Schultz and Corrigan gave quite a bit of my speech, so I can shorten it up But I must join very strongly with what Jerry had to say [about our performance], and maybe even more strongly than he said it If our record in meeting the targets for 1980 is the temperature gauge one is going to use for our success or failure, I think we got a B in the course The reason we didn't get an A is the volatility; I feel very sensitive about that and agree with what has been said here But if you look at the monetary aggregates--adjusted for OCDs as I guess we call them now, Steve--we are within 10 percent of our ranges on all four of the Ms If we got so statistically crazy as to average all of our target results with some sort of weighting, we could prove that we were within the targets for 1980!  -57-    12/18-19/80  SPEAKER(?) I'd like to see that  You know how statisticians are! Anyway, even if one acknowledges that we are outside of our ranges, we are less outside of our ranges than are I believe most, if not all, of the countries in the western world that have set up monetary targets All the chips aren't in for this year, but I think that's a fair statement if not a completely accurate statement Having said that, I agree with Jerry's point that there are too many apologists around, including I suppose most of us on some occasions when we feel on the defensive and spend more time pointing out why we didn't do this and didn't do that and what went wrong than we do explaining the positive side of this We didn't have a failing record for 1980 by any stretch of the imagination  Point two is that I share Fred Schultz's question mark about the extent to which we are going to get real relief from our ""only game in town"" syndrome during calendar year 1981, despite the sincere and I think conscientious intentions of a new Administration, which still hasn't gotten its act together I hope it will get its act together We have to do something in terms of a coordinated policy but until they put out their statements in January, there isn't much more we can do other than what we are doing today, repeating [that desire for a coordinated policy] in discussing the background for our problem in February There is uncertainty in both directions from precipitous action by the new Administration, one of which is being considered seriously and obviously has congressional support The other is whether they are going to jump in too fast and jeopardize the entire program or whether they will take a more reasoned approach, with all of the adequate staff work that requires, and meld these two things We won't know for some time yet  As for the outlook, I think we will have a recession, though not as steep as in the second quarter of 1980, but I fear a little more during the first half of 1981 than is implicit in the Greenbook That may make our [success] in controlling the aggregates seem a little better, but [that could provide] a false sense of security I hope we handle it a bit better despite what I said about the basic adequacy of our record We have to keep our eye on the ball and dig in  I also don't think there is any alternative whatsoever to the confusing technicalities we--and even more the Chairman--have to explain on Capitol Hill and to the public next year There is no pot at the end of the rainbow Even to Nancy's suggestion, of which I am somewhat enamored, or the suggestion that we go back to reserves or that we average M-1A and M-1B, or come out with some new M I say forget it In terms of our public stance and keeping our eyes on the ball within this group there is no simple answer It's like putting a questionnaire around this table and asking ""If you had only one thing to eat in the next six months, and could have plenty of it, what food would you choose?"" Would it be peas or beef or milk or what? Everybody would say that's a ridiculous questionnaire Everybody knows it is necessary to have some balance in one's diet and that one's excitement over a given type of food is relative to something else We're trying to get the ideal M and there isn't any ideal M So let's realize that and, as the British say, just muddle through on what we can do That means a lot of technical confusion and a lot of  -58-    12/18-19/80  public relations confusion I see no alternative to that Any way we do it, it's going to affect at least our statistical credibility, which I think is a little different from our economic credibility Let's keep those two things in mind  I certainly would not go to the proposal in Bob Black's charts That would not only give us great problems in 1981, but is a very dangerous precedent If that precedent is one we like, let's make up all of our overshoots for 1975, 1976, 1977, and 1978 while we are at it, which to me would be a reductio ad absurdum Let's face it, we have a confessional at the end of the year in this church and we are going to start a new year Let's observe it that way We have justified or will be justifying what happened in 1980 Let's go on with 1981 and not try to make it up I must say that when push comes to shove, as they say, strategy I is okay with me It maintains a public position which is quite acceptable; perhaps in some ways it's a cowardly ""don't rock the boat"" approach, but I still believe in it The differences among the strategies in 1981 and their economic effects [are minor]; the differences are all within the margin of error in my book So let's not take those differences too seriously as we try to aim for a simplistic approach as to what [the outcome] might be by 1983 I suppose I should stop there But I also have a euphoric goal in that I'd like to see us get rid of the blankety-blank weekly figures; given the state of the world, I guess that's still an impossible goal  Can we try to have it fairly quickly because changing airline tickets late in the afternoon is going to be an awful problem today  That was the Arthur Burns technique!  Well, let's decide quickly  I think it's a good statement, Paul, except for the next-to-last sentence where it tips our hand that we are expecting some shortfall  I'm sure we need that sentence  Wouldn't they come out on February 6th?  That's all right  I'd say 15 to 21 percent; we are there now  That's simpler and more straightforward  There are still two weeks  No  -84-    12/18-19/80  No, no  SPEAKER(?) It is a period of days "
1796,1981-02-02," Steve, does it make any difference in your analysis whether you aim at a fixed quarterly cleanup, so to speak, or a quarterly moving average?  It may give you the illusion of a little less rigid definition of your intermediate goals, but I agree with you that it probably wouldn't make any real difference over a period of a year  The $33 billion was weekly?  I would just add briefly that I took great comfort in Steve's analysis I think all of us agree that even 15 months is a terribly short period; nevertheless, Steve told me not that this had been a great success, using Frank Morris' word, but that it was not a failure And I think we owe it to ourselves to pursue it further with whatever refinements we can do  Yes, I just wanted to say that I think one of the brightest things this Committee ever did was to start the targeting procedure not only with ranges but with a family of targets And this is absolutely the worst time in the ten years I've been here to abandon that and to seek, as some people on the Committee want to do, a single aggregate that is better than the others They are only marginally better or marginally worse [I don't care] if someone wants to say that it's cowardly to seek refuge in a family of aggregates with disparate movements and admit that we are feeling our way in this; I think that is the honest approach  We can't do it under the Freedom on Information Act, can we? Period  Well, that's dancing on the head of a pin If it's there, it's there  Send them back [a request] to change the Act  That's the bureaucracy at work Our alternative then is to publish a new set of figures on our evaluation of noise  Especially if you put in the guarantees, which are obviously in our private sector  Coming from what with due humility we consider to be the lousiest performing District--economically speaking we have a recession--what surprises me is that we don't have more difference with the staff forecast for the national economy Actually we are right in the center of the range here, which I guess I can attribute to our native optimism that somehow some of this is going to work out all right or, to put it the worst way, that our bad performance this year in the Chicago District will somehow be offset by Jerry's great efforts in the great Northwest, Bill's down in the Southeast, and John's in California We are just going to have to muddle through on this I think it's too early to come to Lyle's conclusion that we haven't really accomplished anything We have set in place a lot of things and, although I'm usually the one who is more despairing of what the Reagan Administration is going to be able to do in the next year, I find that some of the comments here today are just too pessimistic for me If his initial effort looks too small, I think the President is going to have to get into entitlements and he'll figure that he has three years to reelection and will swallow some sort of change in the indexing provisions now It's the only way out Unfortunately, our very vigorous new Budget Director got off on the wrong foot by starting off with proposed big cuts in foreign aid and, bang, he ran right against the new Secretary of State I submit that he picked the wrong horse to start his campaign I think it would have been better if he had started on the domestic side, even though there is always a tendency for a Budget Director to start on foreign aid because it has no voting constituency Anyway, I think he can get some spending down; I hope by as much as the staff forecast shows I would say that is fairly optimistic on spending cuts  You mean interest rates  Sure, it's only $100 billion! It's up to what--16 or 17 percent of the [total budget]  But the two-thirds, Paul, is implicit both in the range and in the growth figures, is it not?  -103-    2/2-3/81  But the $64 question, Paul, is How are we going to state our ranges and what will be published?  Well, Paul, one of the interesting mathematical outcomes of Steve's table is that the average of M-1A and M-1B is the same; whether one takes the target ranges adjusted or unadjusted, it comes out to 4 to 4-1/8 percent Now, whether that helps you any or just confuses the issue--  I'm looking at the right-hand figures exclusively I'm looking at the 1/2 point reduction, which says 1-3/4 to 4-1/4 percent for M-1A and 4 to 6-1/2 percent for M-1B  If you take the midpoint of those two ranges, it's 4 percent If you do the same thing with the adjusted figures on the next to the last line in the table, the arithmetic mean is 4-1/8 percent I don't know whether we can use that to advantage in explaining that basically this is merely a switch within the M1 concept, [regardless of] what is M-1A and M-1B; I think it's rather interesting that it comes out to that  That's right  While it sounds like a statistical gimmick to explain it that way, it does indicate the basic transference between the two to explain the adjusted versus the unadjusted ranges  Well, Paul, the fascination of this arithmetic that I was just doing is that basically averaging the two--M-1A and M- 1B--neutralizes the transfer evaluation problem All one is doing in that way is just isolating what smaller part of this may have come  -109-    2/2-3/81  from M2 into one of the M1s It seems to me that perhaps part of the defense we could use when people say our figures are no good on these transfers is that it really doesn't matter if one looks at M-1A and M-1B together  Well, now wait a minute I don't think the half and half has much to do with what I'm saying I am only saying that we are neutralizing; it doesn't matter whether it's half and half or two-thirds or three-fourths This averaging says how much is coming from M2 or somewhere outside of the M1 concept  Well, I don't want to take time here  The more we can make the transfer issue a subsidiary issue, the less trouble we are going to get into on that  My first fascination, Mr Chairman, was with the M-1A and M-1B ranges of alternative II on the grounds that it helped get over any problems you might have in testifying with regard to base drift The longer I thought about that, the more I came to the conclusion that the base drift isn't significant enough, at least in thinking it through myself, to cause you that much trouble As a practical matter, I think we're better off with alternative I after all It retains the promise of a 1/2 percentage point [reduction] and I think we might be risking more economic stagnation with a 1 percentage point promise I find it congenial to go right down the line on alternative I I don't think we need to worry about the M2  -120-    2/2-3/81  problem The 7 to 10 percent looks higher; it is higher than our old 6 to 9 percent, again because of the farther drift that we have from the aggregates that we can control I would have a very minor qualification if the Committee were to accept alternative II for any reason, and that is that I'd get rid of those quarter points We're boxing ourselves in too closely using quarter points; it's better to have either 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 or 7 to 10 percent than to try to split it into quarters I think that's foolish precision So, I would come down with alternative I  I wish I could agree with Fred Schultz that we could explain this once and not have to go over it every week But as long as we have weekly money supply figures, I'm resigned to our fate of having to explain this every week We're going to have to be prepared to use publicly both sets of figures; we should decide on the emphasis, though, right off the bat and then gear it each time to remind people who only look at these for 20 minutes on a Friday afternoon or whenever they pick up their papers They will say ""Oh yes, I remember something about that"" And then they will come back the next week and have forgotten all about it and we will have to say the same thing over again I think we will have to do that Even though it may seem to add confusion, I think it actually will add some clarification in the public mind  I don't think we would do that, but we should indicate our caveat every week--the principle that's involved here  I don't think we need to go to the extent of giving the precise figures, but we should give some qualitative caveat every week when we publish the data as to what they mean  Paul, does the President's program, which ostensibly is going to put money back in the hands of consumers who are going to save it, give more credence to the continuation of a 10 percent figure?  He's going to have a program by the time you go up [to testify] Do you agree with it or don't you agree with it? I don't know  I'm afraid you're right, Frank  I think Lyle's right on that  The answer is yes  Wait a minute I didn't follow why you adjusted 1978  Okay  Two million foreign workers still?  The highlight of my career at this table was summarized by Mr Gramley in his inadvertent remark this morning that I had made a remark that was that of a genius And I'll go home with that thought!  I agree with that  The top is 20 percent  Well, since I'm the oldest person around the table, I'll brag that some 50 years ago I learned for the first time that the square root of -1 is an imaginary number It was only when I arrived at this table that I really learned what imaginary numbers are all about! I think we should repeat our humility that we really don't know what we are doing on any of these alternatives and that the best we can do is to take the staff's very loose translation here and play with it, granting that by next week there may be a different set of numbers I think we have to do that in this particular intermeeting period; our only refuge is really the way the federal funds rate behaves regardless of how much bowing and scraping we do about the aggregates Having said that, I come out also shading ""B"" toward ""C"" Just to start that discussion going, I'd say 5-1/2 percent for M-1A and/or M-1B, 8 percent for M2, and 14 to 20 percent for federal funds  Well, we could vote on whether we are 10 percent or 20 percent worse off! That would be further expression--  Well, that's one reason for using 5-1/2 percent  Why don't we use 5-1/2 or 6 percent? It's the cowardly way out perhaps, but it isn't too far from the best analysis of our staff  -161-    2/2-3/81  Is this December-to-March now?  We've worn Steve out!  Larry, I'm really going to miss the Open Market Committee meetings!  It doesn't make a difference anyway "
1830,1981-02-24," Bob Mayo I would support you, Paul Chuck has given my reasoning for the sort of floating idea that you have stated in a little different way I wouldn't formalize [the approach] at this point We'll just keep our ears open until we get some figures that we're a little more comfortable with This is a real puzzle  Sounds pretty good "
