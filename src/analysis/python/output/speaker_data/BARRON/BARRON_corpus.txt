 Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in the Southeast have   remained subdued since the last FOMC meeting  Although we are witnessing some   improvement in manufacturing and especially in the tourism and textile sectors, consumer   spending has actually slackened off somewhat  With respect to tourism, Florida seems to be   rebounding strongly Cruise ships have been fully booked without the need to resort to the heavy   discounting that we had seen over the last several quarters  Single-family housing remains   healthy, but multifamily construction seems to be clearly overbuilt Conditions in the   commercial construction sector, especially in Atlanta, are even worse  Office vacancy rates are   at 20 percent, and we’ve been told that it may take until 2004 to absorb the current capacity  But   even that would require a return to high levels of growth and employment  This weakness in the   commercial market is showing through in lease renegotiations  One large deal was recently   completed for a twelve-year office lease with two years completely rent-free  Not surprisingly,   new speculative construction activity is virtually nonexistent     In our discussions with our directors this month, we focused on profits, investment,   inventories, and labor market related issues  Profits are still being maintained mainly by   continued cost cutting and not by productivity-increasing investments or increased revenue    Further, the majority of our directors reported that their contacts, which consist mainly of smaller   companies, were largely unaware of the changes in the tax law designed to stimulate investment    And in those few cases where firms were aware of the changes, the incentives reportedly were   having no effect on decisions to invest As for large companies, our contact at UPS indicated           June 25-26, 2002 92 of 179  that the tax changes were having virtually no effect on its investment decisions This was due in   part to the fact that most of its major investments were tied to longer-term contracts and also   because the window for taking advantage of the changes was so long     Clearly, the persistence of uncertainty and the effects it is having on inventory decisions   are quite telling Many retailers and manufacturers indicated they were in a wait-and-see mode   at least until after the Fourth of July  Organizations are simply more willing to run the risk of   incurring the added cost of just-in-time additions to inventory from domestic sources rather than   risk placing large orders with lower cost sources abroad, based on highly uncertain sales   projections   Finally, on the hiring side, one bright note came from our contact in the growing   Southeast auto industry He indicated that auto producers had been generating 20 percent of   their production output from overtime for the past four months  If production is maintained at   the current pace for a couple more months—and he saw no reason why it should not be—he said   that they would likely begin hiring again  We did not find much of a strategic story with regard   to how temp workers are being used at this point  Temps are being hired, but only in conjunction   with increased production and primarily as a hedge against the risk of further weakness     In short, these anecdotal stories suggest that growth in economic activity over coming   months is more likely to be moderate than robust and that investment spending is likely to be   restrained because of the perception of high risk and uncertainty   On the national front, we share the view of the Board staff that growth will be slightly   below potential, at least through much of the rest of this year  Our reading of the data since the   last meeting suggests that there has been no material change in the baseline economic outlook    As a result, the same questions we have had about the likely path for the recovery remain in     June 25-26, 2002 93 of 179  place Inventories continue to be liquidated, and there are few signals that an upturn in inventory   investment is imminent  The prospects for robust and rising corporate profits or investment   activity have not improved  The factors that contribute to this mixed economic picture are also   helping to keep inflation at bay Mediocre growth rates for final demand and low rates of   capacity utilization will help to moderate price pressures over the short run     A period of extended low interest rates is not unprecedented  We experienced such a   period in the 1990-91 recession and into the subsequent recovery  Interestingly, a rereading of   the minutes from that period suggests that the Committee, prior to its initial move to tighten   policy, had clear indications that the economy had turned the corner and was in fact expanding   strongly The Committee moved aggressively in 1994 once the decision was made to combat   any signs of a rising inflation outlook However, there were unusual factors that were restraining   both inflation and the economy to a large degree—beyond those that are present today  As a   result, although we may have some time to monitor the economic outlook for the signs of   strength and a durable expansion, inflation risks may not remain as dormant this time around     We would note some important differences between the economy during this slowdown   and the 1990-91 period For example, unemployment is currently much lower than it was during   1990 and 1991 The level of economic activity is clearly much higher than it was then, and the   falloff in economic activity from the pre-slowdown period has not only been much less but is   virtually nonexistent in either consumption or housing  Productivity growth remains much   stronger and has not exhibited the usual slowdown typically associated with an economic   contraction The point of this is not to suggest that now may be the time to act but only to point   out that it is not difficult to perceive a circumstance in which the economy could pick up quickly        June 25-26, 2002 94 of 179  and thus force more-aggressive policy moves  For now, though, it would simply be nice to see   growth return to levels near potential  Thank you    I support the recommendation
