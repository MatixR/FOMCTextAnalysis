6824,2002-06-25," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in the Southeast have   remained subdued since the last FOMC meeting  Although we are witnessing some   improvement in manufacturing and especially in the tourism and textile sectors, consumer   spending has actually slackened off somewhat  With respect to tourism, Florida seems to be   rebounding strongly Cruise ships have been fully booked without the need to resort to the heavy   discounting that we had seen over the last several quarters  Single-family housing remains   healthy, but multifamily construction seems to be clearly overbuilt Conditions in the   commercial construction sector, especially in Atlanta, are even worse  Office vacancy rates are   at 20 percent, and we’ve been told that it may take until 2004 to absorb the current capacity  But   even that would require a return to high levels of growth and employment  This weakness in the   commercial market is showing through in lease renegotiations  One large deal was recently   completed for a twelve-year office lease with two years completely rent-free  Not surprisingly,   new speculative construction activity is virtually nonexistent     In our discussions with our directors this month, we focused on profits, investment,   inventories, and labor market related issues  Profits are still being maintained mainly by   continued cost cutting and not by productivity-increasing investments or increased revenue    Further, the majority of our directors reported that their contacts, which consist mainly of smaller   companies, were largely unaware of the changes in the tax law designed to stimulate investment    And in those few cases where firms were aware of the changes, the incentives reportedly were   having no effect on decisions to invest As for large companies, our contact at UPS indicated           June 25-26, 2002 92 of 179  that the tax changes were having virtually no effect on its investment decisions This was due in   part to the fact that most of its major investments were tied to longer-term contracts and also   because the window for taking advantage of the changes was so long     Clearly, the persistence of uncertainty and the effects it is having on inventory decisions   are quite telling Many retailers and manufacturers indicated they were in a wait-and-see mode   at least until after the Fourth of July  Organizations are simply more willing to run the risk of   incurring the added cost of just-in-time additions to inventory from domestic sources rather than   risk placing large orders with lower cost sources abroad, based on highly uncertain sales   projections   Finally, on the hiring side, one bright note came from our contact in the growing   Southeast auto industry He indicated that auto producers had been generating 20 percent of   their production output from overtime for the past four months  If production is maintained at   the current pace for a couple more months—and he saw no reason why it should not be—he said   that they would likely begin hiring again  We did not find much of a strategic story with regard   to how temp workers are being used at this point  Temps are being hired, but only in conjunction   with increased production and primarily as a hedge against the risk of further weakness     In short, these anecdotal stories suggest that growth in economic activity over coming   months is more likely to be moderate than robust and that investment spending is likely to be   restrained because of the perception of high risk and uncertainty   On the national front, we share the view of the Board staff that growth will be slightly   below potential, at least through much of the rest of this year  Our reading of the data since the   last meeting suggests that there has been no material change in the baseline economic outlook    As a result, the same questions we have had about the likely path for the recovery remain in     June 25-26, 2002 93 of 179  place Inventories continue to be liquidated, and there are few signals that an upturn in inventory   investment is imminent  The prospects for robust and rising corporate profits or investment   activity have not improved  The factors that contribute to this mixed economic picture are also   helping to keep inflation at bay Mediocre growth rates for final demand and low rates of   capacity utilization will help to moderate price pressures over the short run     A period of extended low interest rates is not unprecedented  We experienced such a   period in the 1990-91 recession and into the subsequent recovery  Interestingly, a rereading of   the minutes from that period suggests that the Committee, prior to its initial move to tighten   policy, had clear indications that the economy had turned the corner and was in fact expanding   strongly The Committee moved aggressively in 1994 once the decision was made to combat   any signs of a rising inflation outlook However, there were unusual factors that were restraining   both inflation and the economy to a large degree—beyond those that are present today  As a   result, although we may have some time to monitor the economic outlook for the signs of   strength and a durable expansion, inflation risks may not remain as dormant this time around     We would note some important differences between the economy during this slowdown   and the 1990-91 period For example, unemployment is currently much lower than it was during   1990 and 1991 The level of economic activity is clearly much higher than it was then, and the   falloff in economic activity from the pre-slowdown period has not only been much less but is   virtually nonexistent in either consumption or housing  Productivity growth remains much   stronger and has not exhibited the usual slowdown typically associated with an economic   contraction The point of this is not to suggest that now may be the time to act but only to point   out that it is not difficult to perceive a circumstance in which the economy could pick up quickly        June 25-26, 2002 94 of 179  and thus force more-aggressive policy moves  For now, though, it would simply be nice to see   growth return to levels near potential  Thank you   I support the recommendation  "
7778,2006-10-24,"  Thanks  It’s good to be here    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Data releases and reports we have gathered   over the intermeeting period do not indicate much change since the Committee last met, so far as   the Sixth District is concerned  Overall growth has been moderate, with the index of District   October 24-25, 2006 37 of 203    economic activity showing a year-over-year increase of about 27 percent, and reports of activity   varied considerably among sectors of the District economy  Retail sales have been mixed, and   the outlook for tourism is reasonably optimistic  Auto sales remain sluggish, and the housing   market—even beyond Florida, where both prices and sales have declined significantly—  continues to show additional signs of some slowing  On the positive side, construction is   shifting somewhat from residential to commercial  However, the lack of availability and the   high cost of home and business insurance in Florida and along the Gulf Coast is a serious   concern for our region  Manufacturing activity appears stable  Prices of some commodities are   reported lower  Although gasoline prices are lower, fuel surcharges remain in place  As in the   national economy, the slowdown in housing and moderation in overall activity have shown little   signs of spilling over into the labor market     Employment gains through September softened somewhat  However, all states in the   District, except Georgia, added jobs, and together accounted for 20,000 of the nation’s 51,000   jobs added during the month  The overall unemployment rate in the District, accordingly, moved   down to 39 percent  Shortages of skilled labor continue to be reported in some areas, and   overall labor quality, as Tom Hoenig noted, continues to be a problem, both of which I interpret   as indicating a relatively firm labor market  We had a meeting this past week of our Advisory   Council on Small Business, Agriculture, and Labor  Nearly to a person, participants reported   things were good—not great but good—and the common problem was finding qualified workers   willing to work  Most council members were willing to hire if they found the right people, but at   the same time, they would forgo expanding their businesses if it meant hiring individuals who   were less than qualified  One member from the construction sector noted that an individual   walking around a job site with a piece of pipe, without doing anything else, would fully meet the   October 24-25, 2006 38 of 203    requirements for continued employment—that is, they were carrying something, and they were   moving  [Laughter]    Concerning the national economy, opinions differ as to how much of a slowdown we will   see this quarter and how long it will last  Most professional forecasters, as well as our own   in-house models, suggest that growth will slow in the third quarter and then gradually accelerate   thereafter  On the positive side, the labor market is very healthy  Corporate earnings continue to   be healthy, business investment is supportive, and equity markets not only are at record highs but   show no signs of letting up  At the same time, our headline inflation has come down, in the most   part because of the decline in energy prices  Core inflation, especially in the service price   component, continues to drift upward  Further, it’s not clear that the energy price increases have   played a major role in explaining the increase in core inflation, so it may be problematic to   assume that the recent decline will provide a significant downward impetus to core inflation, at   least in the near term  Federal funds futures prices, the TIPS spread, and inflation expectations   seem to be saying that the Fed’s credibility remains intact and are consistent with the belief that   the Committee will get policy right, rather than signaling that slower growth is ahead in the   foreseeable future  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The bottom line is that I’m comfortable with   the current policy stance and see no need to move until we become convinced that our forecast for   inflation moderation won’t be realized  As for the wording, I’m supportive of alternative B as   currently provided in the Bluebook  While I’m attracted to Governor Kohn’s suggested change,   given that it has only been five weeks and there is likely to be some pull-back in the third quarter, I   would be inclined to leave the wording as it currently is written  But I would be cautious about   changing other wording—again, given the short duration between our last meeting and this meeting   and given the lack of evidence that a lot of things have changed dramatically   As for my reasons, I think that there is clear evidence that output is slowing, but my sense is   that there’s uncertainty with regard to the degree of the slowdown—that is, how slow we will grow    Despite the output uncertainty, businesses and consumers seem reasonably comfortable with their   prospects  Employment gains remain positive, albeit at a slower pace, and income and spending   continue to grow  There are, however, real-side concerns in the housing sector, yet none of these   scenarios we’ve run seem to suggest anything approaching a recession-level slowdown  Concerns   remain weighted toward an upside risk to inflation, but not necessarily one that demands immediate   action  Despite the concerns on the inflation front, I think we can afford to wait a bit longer so that   October 24-25, 2006 107 of 203    we can assess the actual outcomes regarding inflation and output, see how they match up against the   forecast, and then determine whether the current level of the federal funds rate provides enough   restraint to reduce inflation  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In light of the hour and the fact that many of   my more learned colleagues have yet to speak, I’ll try to be brief  My comments come from one   October 24-25, 2006 162 of 203    who has been with the Federal Reserve System for some thirty-nine years, has been seated on the   sidelines of this Committee for fifteen years, and has observed the evolution of communications   and the critical importance of transparency   I’d like to make two observations  First, if the goal of adopting an explicit target is to   institutionalize credibility, then this should not be a big concern now  The Committee has   credibility, and the recent market evidence on low market volatility and contained inflation   expectations is clearly consistent with the conclusion—the recent Wall Street Journal article   notwithstanding—that this Committee has credibility  Over the long run, however, there are   some looming fiscal issues—specifically, the projected growth of nondiscretionary spending—  that make the conduct of monetary policy very difficult  From this perspective, an explicit target   may provide additional reassurance to the market that the Committee can pursue its low-inflation   objectives with some independence from the pressure to accommodate fiscal deficits  Second, as   many have noted, to move to an explicit numerical target raises a number of both practical and   political issues  These issues concern not only the specifics of the target, the choice of the time   horizon, and the methods employed to ensure transparency and accountability but also the nature   of the negotiations to ensure congressional acceptance and support  The System’s mandate has   been modified several times, most recently in December 2000  If, and I would emphasize “if,”   the Congress required or even suggested additional legislation, I believe the risks and potential   costs of opening up the Federal Reserve Act might be great  For example, the Committee might   also get numerical targets for employment or even specific targets for housing or other sectors   that might be of special interest to individual members of the Congress  My bottom line is that,   given the risks, I take some comfort in the current vagueness of the wording of the Federal   October 24-25, 2006 163 of 203    Reserve Act as it relates to monetary policy objectives and the way it has been interpreted over   the past many years     My sense is that the Committee may well be close to having the right balance with regard   to communicating its objectives and ensuring credibility  Although, clearly, the Congress can   change our mandate any time, I would urge caution in providing the impetus for such change   until we have thought long and hard about the costs and benefits of that change  Having said all   that, I find a great deal of comfort in Governor Mishkin’s approach at gradualism  I would   certainly be comfortable with that approach if we could avoid nailing, so to speak, a tablet to the   halls of the Congress saying, “This is going to be our explicit target”  I think to do so would   simply lure them into a fight that I wouldn’t want to take on at this time  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
7801,2006-12-12,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Over the intermeeting period, the Sixth   District’s economic activity largely reflected the trends in the nation as a whole  But the   magnitude has been amplified by the region’s relatively large exposure to housing-related   activities  Specifically, while Florida continues to bear the brunt of the housing correction, we   have increasingly heard reports of sales declines in other areas, too  For instance, an   announcement at a recent conference of Atlanta homebuilders was that “Atlanta’s ability to   outrun the downturn has run out”  The recent survey of the Beige Book would confirm this, in   that contacts indicated that 67 percent of the District builders consider their inventory of unsold   new homes to be either high or extremely high   The decline in housing market activity is affecting housing-related sectors such as   construction, real estate services, wood products and manufacturing, and carpet production, to   which our District is more exposed than are other parts of the country  For instance, Florida has   a concentration of residential construction that is about 50 percent greater than that of the United   States as a whole, and Florida’s construction employment has been declining at an annualized   pace of 10 percent each month since May  Georgia is home to the largest concentration of carpet   production in the United States, and these firms have reported that they are scaling back   production as well as employment  We expect the negative effect on construction-related sectors   December 12, 2006 52 of 134         to intensify over the next few months as builders complete current projects and significantly   curtail future projects  Lending related to real estate has been a significant source of revenue and   growth for District banks in recent years  Our banking contacts report that the pipeline of real   estate lending has all but dried up  Some also noted concern about the prospective financial   strength of smaller builders, although most expect the larger builders to be able to weather the   downturn  On the consumer side, asset quality remained good, but some banks noted concern   about the potential negative effects from adjustable rate mortgage resets that will occur in 2007    The good news for the housing outlook is that the continued decline in starts and the leveling-off   of sales may have arrested the run-up in the inventories of unsold new housing  It’s hard to tell if   we’re getting close to the bottom of the housing slump  Several of our builder contacts in   Florida say that they expect sales to improve in the second quarter of 2007  Also, most contacts   expect a pickup in the multifamily rental market in 2007    Outside the housing sector, indicators of economic performance in the District were   mixed  Nonresidential construction remains at modest levels, with the pace for October and   November being about what it was in 2005  Builders expect that the overall pace for 2007 will   match that of 2006, and signs are that the demand for office and industrial space is picking up,   with lower vacancies and rents beginning to firm  Early reports on holiday retail sales were on   the positive side  However, tourism performance in Florida has disappointed in recent months    Visitors to all areas of Florida are down so far in 2006, which could give the state the first year-  over-year drop since the September 11 terrorist attacks  The shuttering of the Ford auto   assembly plant in Atlanta and the weak performance by GM, Saturn, and Nissan have led us to   cut District auto production  However, on net, the strong performance by Mercedes, Honda, and   December 12, 2006 53 of 134         Hyundai has been more than enough to keep overall auto production in the District moving along   at a relatively solid clip    Along the Gulf Coast, much uncertainty remains about the long-term economic recovery   of New Orleans  One hope for a signal of recovery was the restarting of the Crescent City’s   tourism and convention business  Unfortunately, indicators such as airport traffic and   convention bookings have not strengthened over the year and remain well below pre-storm   levels  In contrast, a key Mississippi Coast economic engine is up and running—the casinos    [Laughter]  All the casinos damaged or destroyed by Katrina have reopened, and gaming   revenues have returned to pre-storm levels, in some cases even above those levels  This signal   has generated optimism about the eventual recovery of the Mississippi Coast    Putting aside the problems of accurately calibrating growth in real GDP for the national   economy that were discussed in the Greenbook, it seems clear that the slowing of the economy   that many of us noted last meeting continues  At the same time, some of the pressures on the   inflation side may be abating as well  Housing and its potential spillover effects to other   segments of the economy remain a question mark, as does the slowing in manufacturing that now   appears to be in progress  However, several factors suggest that the slowdown is transitory and   that the risk is relatively small that it will turn into a full-fledged recession  For example,   corporate profits remain healthy  Business investment has continued to expand, although a bit   more slowly  The most recent labor report is quite positive, with job growth now averaging   about 138,000 over the past three months  Going forward, the decline of the dollar suggests that   net exports will be less of a drag on our output  This conclusion about the likely path of the   economy is also consistent with our own District model forecasts that have changed only slightly   from October  They have shifted in almost the same way that the Greenbook forecast has, and   December 12, 2006 54 of 134         the differences are relatively small when all things are considered   Let me stop and save my   other comments for the policy go-round      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I feel that current policy is about right,   given the risk to the economy and the potential that inflation will not turn down in the near term    Thus I would favor no change at this time  We’ll get further readings on employment before our   next meeting, and we’ll also know about the level of spending that is likely to occur over the   holidays  Although it’s doubtful that we’ll have a clear reading in January on the future direction   of housing, the additional data will perhaps provide us with some clue as to how long and how   deep the downturn will be for this sector  The longer the downturn in the housing sector   continues, the greater the potential for spillover into other sectors, creating the potential for some   easing in the relatively tight labor markets that we’ve all talked about today  That said, my own   take is that, without some significant spillover, we should be on track for a soft landing     As far as the wording is concerned, I’m not sure how many options we’ve got on the   table, but I would prefer alternative B, dropping the “more than anticipated”  I’d be a little   cautious about introducing a new phrase, whether it’s production or spending, because we might   have to specify what spending  I think we’re talking implicitly about business spending, but we   have to remember that the consumer sector has held up quite nicely for us  So let me just stop  I   prefer alternative B in exhibit 4, and I would drop “more than anticipated”    "
7826,2007-01-30,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I thought I’d focus a little more today in my   comments on the State of Florida as it relates to the housing sector  We’ve heard a lot more positive   comments in just the past few minutes about housing  So let me offer a contrarian view, if you will    Florida accounts for about 41 percent of our District employment and 6 percent of overall US   employment  As for housing, Florida represented 8 percent of US home sales in 2005 and 6   percent in 2006 as sales and construction continued to decline  To put these numbers in perspective,   single-family existing home sales in Florida have dropped 40 percent since January 2005 versus an   11 percent decline in the United States as a whole  Anecdotal reports are that builders are   continuing to work down existing inventory and are not starting new projects  In most areas of the   January 30-31, 2007 62 of 255    state, starts have fallen even more than sales, which should lessen the run-up in housing inventory   over the immediate future  Permit issuance for single-family homes is down 54 percent in Florida   since January 2005 compared with 28 percent in the nation as a whole  There are certain   encouraging signs from reports noting, as mentioned earlier, that buyer traffic is better in some   areas, and several of the building contacts that we spoke with expect or, perhaps I would note more   accurately, are hopeful that new home sales will improve by the second quarter of 2007   Home prices have declined modestly but remain well above the levels implied by the pre-  2003 trends in most areas  This places housing affordability at a relatively low level by historical   standards  As I noted at previous meetings, the demand in coastal markets is being constrained by   the steep rise in homeownership insurance that has caused monthly housing costs to rise sharply,   even as house prices moderate  We’ve heard reports that in markets where prices accelerated the   most in recent years, such as south Florida, employers are struggling to recruit staff because of the   high housing costs, with some firms electing to leave south Florida and others beginning to convert   corporate owned land to corporate housing just so that they can recruit employees  As I reported at   our last meeting, the decline in housing activity continues to have a negative effect on housing-  related sectors specifically in the South because of our concentration in the carpet and other related   industries  Housing-related employment is no longer a net contributor to year-over-year   employment growth in the United States, even though overall job growth has remained very firm   District banks reported that credit quality has softened but remains at very strong levels    However, banks are beginning to be a bit more vocal in expressing concern with regard to the   possibility that builders will face financial problems in the coming months  In addition, banks   express concern about the number of speculative condominium projects in south Florida  District   banks have lower earnings targets for 2007, and the expectation is that bank merger and acquisition   January 30-31, 2007 63 of 255    activity and layoffs will increase in the coming year  Some banks are even putting out the “for sale”   sign in the hope of cashing out now, noting that things could get ugly over the next two years in   some areas   Outside the housing sector, indicators of economic performance in the District were mixed    Reports on holiday-related sales were on the positive side, whereas tourism remains relatively   mixed across the District  Reports from the manufacturing sector were also mixed, with a weakness   in the housing-related industries offset to some extent by the expanding activity in industries related   to defense and energy   For the US economy as a whole, the drag from housing that we experienced over the   second half of 2006 does not appear at this time to pose a serious threat to the overall economy,   although some forecasters anticipate below-trend real GDP growth for the end of 2006 and the first   quarter of 2007  Most would say that this situation is temporary and would anticipate that real GDP   growth will rebound and be close to the trend rate of 3 percent for the rest of 2007  Our staff   projections of real GDP growth have had about the same tone as those of the external forecasters    Our staff believes real GDP growth will be sustained in 2007 by job creation that should match the   experience that we’ve seen in 2006   Measured core inflation was well in excess of 2 percent at the end of 2006  The staff   forecast is that core inflation will continue to hover just above 2 percent for all of 2007  The   expectation is that price growth in services will continue to dominate core inflation going forward    In my comments I’ve focused a bit more on housing  I would just close by noting that my   continued concern would be the lack of impetus to drive down inflation over the long term  Thank   you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me say at the outset that I was truly   impressed with your summary of everyone’s comments yesterday  If I had known that you were   listening so intently, I might have scrutinized my own comments a little more  [Laughter]  Many   participants, as you summarized, reported an improved outlook in housing and, perhaps to a   lesser extent, an improved outlook for inflation  To play off our immediate past Chairman’s   phrase, I think it might be appropriate to guard against what I might call “premature exuberance”   on both fronts with regard to the bottoming out of housing and the improvement in inflation  I   don’t think we gain much at this point in the business cycle by declaring victory on the housing   front, and I didn’t hear anyone say that  But I think we have to be cautious in our comments as it   could well prove to be a drag going forward    For the overall economy, my own take is that we have more upside potential than perhaps   we have seen so far, putting aside this morning’s report  Corporate balance sheets remain   extremely strong  Although I do not anticipate that profits in 2007 will match the levels that we   saw in 2006, I see no reason that they would drop below trend, and perhaps they will even come   in above trend  With that as a backdrop, the job outlook might even be brighter than we’ve   discussed  If the job market remains firm, I would have every reason to believe that the level of   January 30-31, 2007 101 of 255    participation outlined in the Greenbook might be understated, and so we could well have more   positive income effect from the consumer going forward than we’ve witnessed or that we are   thinking of for the future  A final point relates to exports  Yesterday evening I looked back over   the information we had with regard to the consistency of a high level of performance of all the   economies of the world  I couldn’t find a time in which we had all the economies of the world   performing at the level they are today  If you take that into consideration and put aside, as Dave   so eloquently noted, the special factors that we had in the fourth quarter in exports, we could   well see a more positive effect going forward in net exports    On balance, though, I still have a concern that the effect of housing going forward will be   a drag  However, I fully anticipate that, at the national level at least, we will be able to bounce   back in the second half  If we do bounce back in the second half in housing, then GDP growth   could well exceed what we are forecasting now  All of that said, I’m very comfortable with the   current stance of policy  I’m not going to try to wordsmith on the fly  My own bias is to be   somewhat supportive of alternative B as presented this morning  Thank you       Thank you, Mr Chairman  It may come as a surprise to some of my   colleagues, given my expressed concerns over publication of numerical inflation targets, that I   am very supportive of publication of forecasts by participants  The Committee has for some time   now made routine references to the outlook in the statement, without an explicit Committee   forecast  Explicit forecasts will, in my opinion, add to the already improved transparency and   accountability of the actions of the Committee and will, over time, serve as a reference point for   expressing the important differing views among the Committee members at this table and in   public speeches  As cumbersome and as painful as the process might be, at least initially, the   Committee also needs to develop a consensus forecast that would embrace a central tendency   outlook  However, this forecast should embrace, not truncate, outliers and use those as a signal   of dispersion of views around the forecast    As for the basis of the forecast, it seems logical that some agreement on assumptions   would lead to fewer outliers in the forecasting process  While I can appreciate the benefits of the   “common assumption” approach, I would suggest that the Committee follow the “appropriate   policy” approach as it relates to the federal funds rate, at least at the outset  That said, one   alternative might be for the staff to suggest a set of common assumptions that would be used in   January 30-31, 2007 180 of 255    the development of alternative forecasts by the participants  However, it would be understood   that each participant’s baseline forecast would be free from imposed assumptions    I believe it is imperative that any forecast be accompanied by a story to support the   outlook  This is consistent with my own recommendation as it relates to question 7 that we   should minimize the number of variables that we use in the forecast for the public  With just a   few key variables put forward, we should be able to agree on a narrative for the forecast, much as   we agree on a narrative for our current policy statement  I recognize that this will be   cumbersome and time-consuming, but numbers without the story would be analogous to asking a   doctor to treat a patient by seeing only the skeleton  The story could be developed in a minutes-  style description, but I would suggest that the forecast and description be an addendum to the   minutes  This would enable participants to share their forecast and opinions at the meeting  In   the discussion process, participants would be given the opportunity to absorb the discussion of   the meeting and the various forecasts and then go back and visit with their staff to consider if any   changes are warranted in their own forecast and outlook    I hope that, after the resolution of the start-up problem that would no doubt be   encountered in this process, the current publication schedule of the minutes for those meetings   where we do set forecasts would be restored  That said, I hope also that the debate over the story   would be limited to substantive issues somewhat like a dissent on the current policy decision and   not a vehicle to capture every nuance in everyone’s forecast      I suggest that the forecast frequency be limited to two per year to start out but that we   would eventually move to a quarterly forecast, much as has been said earlier  Listening to my   staff talk about the planning period and the policy action requirement so far as time is concerned,   I am struck that a three-year planning period would be ideal from a forecast standpoint  The   January 30-31, 2007 181 of 255    process would be more effective, at least at the outset, with fewer rather than more variables, and   I suggest that those variables be some inflation measure, real GDP, and unemployment  My   preference is to exclude a fed funds rate forecast because it could be interpreted, as mentioned   earlier, as a commitment  As for the uncertainty, clearly our story must address uncertainty and   potential changes that might come in the future  I would choose not to use fan charts, at least at   the outset, as I could almost bet that a fan chart on unemployment would be on some   congressional committee member’s desk at an upcoming hearing, illustrating the point that, if we   miss our target, millions of people will be unemployed  Thank you, Mr Chairman   "
