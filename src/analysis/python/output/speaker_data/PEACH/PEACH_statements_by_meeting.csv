7531,2005-06-29," Hardly a day goes by without another anecdote-laden article in  the press claiming that the US is experiencing a housing bubble that will soon  burst, with disastrous consequences for the economy  Indeed, housing market  activity has been quite robust for some time now, with starts and sales of single- family homes reaching all time highs in recent months and home prices rising  rapidly, particularly along the east and west coasts of the country  But such activity  could be the result of solid fundamentals underlying the housing market  After all,  both nominal and real long-term interest rates have declined substantially over the  last decade  Productivity growth has been surprisingly strong since the mid-1990s,  producing rapid real income growth primarily for those in the upper half of the  income distribution  And the large baby-boom generation has entered its peak  earning years and appears to have strong preferences for large homes loaded with  amenities    One of the conditions of an asset bubble is that the price of the asset has risen  well above what is consistent with underlying fundamentals  In the current debate,  two measures of relative value have been applied to single-family home prices—  price relative to income and rent relative to price  In the comments that follow I will  concentrate on the price-to-income measure, but my conclusions apply equally to the  rent-to-price measure     In most analyses of the ratio of home price to income, the measure of home  price that is used is the repeat-sales home price index published by the Office of  Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (exhibit 1)  This index tracks changes in the                                                                 June 29-30, 2005 12 of 234  average price of homes purchased (or mortgages refinanced) with loans purchased  by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or conforming conventional loans  Therefore, it  excludes cash sales as well as purchases or refinancings financed with FHA [Federal  Housing Administration], VA [Veterans Affairs], and jumbo conventional  mortgages  It is called a repeat-sales index because it is derived by observing the  sales prices—or appraised values, in the case of refinancings—of properties at  specific addresses at two or more points in time  Finally, it is a transactions-based  index in that it reflects the prices of homes that are sold (or refinanced) rather than  the entire universe of single-family homes   A lesser known home price index is the constant-quality new home price index  published by the Bureau of the Census (exhibit 2)  This index is based on a sample   of new homes sold, regardless of how the sale was financed  Hedonic methods are   employed to hold the physical and locational characteristics constant over time This  index is part of the Census Bureau statistical program through which the single- family residential investment deflator of the national income and product accounts is   derived As shown in exhibit 3, the increase in prices indicated by these two indexes   is quite different  For example, over the four years from 2000 to 2004, the OFHEO  index increased at a compound annual rate  of 82 percent, while the constant-quality  index increased at a 54 percent annual rate  As shown in exhibit 4, the current ratio  of price over median family income derived from these two indexes is vastly  different  If the OFHEO index is giving an accurate picture of what is happening to  home prices, I think one could say with some confidence that prices have been bid  up to unsustainable levels  However, if the constant-quality index is a better  reflection of reality, home  prices actually look somewhat low relative to median  family income, particularly compared to the late 1970s  I believe the constant- quality index provides a more accurate indication of what is happening to the price  of a typical single-family home  In contrast, the OFHEO index is subject to upward  biases that accumulate over time and distort ratios such as price-to-income and   income-to-rents   To help us understand the biases in  the OFHEO index, exhibit 5 presents the  distribution by value of all single-family homes in the US in 2003, with the specific  values at the 25th, 50th, 75th, and 80th percentiles 4  The median value in 2003 was  $150,000 with the distribution skewed toward the right  The value at the 25th  percentile was $90,000 while the value at the 75th percentile was $250,000  We do  not know with certainty where  the OFHEO index falls on this distribution, as it is an  index rather than a series of values  But we can be reasonably certain that it lies  somewhere between the average price of all existing single-family homes sold and  the average price of homes purchased with conventional loans  That means the  OFHEO index is a closer reflection of what is happening at the 75th percentile rather   than the 50th percentile  Moreover, it is very likely that over time the point on that   distribution represented by the OFHEO index has been drifting to the right  One    4 In the American Housing Survey, home values are self-reported  Previous research has concluded that self- reported values tend to overstate somewhat the price at which a property would actually sell  We are limited to the  80th percentile due to top coding of the home value variable                                                       June 29-30, 2005 13 of 234  cause of this rightward drift is what I call transaction bias  As shown in exhibit 6,  the American Housing Survey (AHS) data suggest that both appreciation rates and  turnover rates increase as one moves out the home value distribution  For example,  from 1997 to 2003 the compound annual rate of appreciation at the 25th percentile  was 45 percent, increasing to 87 percent at the 80th percentile  Corresponding  average turnover rates for the period from 1997 to 2003 were 59 percent and 74  percent  That means, of course, that the average rate of appreciation of the units that  turn over is higher than the average rate of appreciation of the entire distribution   While the amount of bias in any one year is likely to be small, it does cumulate over  time and becomes quite important when one is comparing levels versus income or  rents   Another potential upward bias in the OFHEO index is that while it is a repeat- sales index, there is evidence to suggest that it is not a constant-quality index  In   addition to the strong pace of new housing starts, another aspect of the housing  boom of the past decade has been a significant increase additions and alterations to   the existing housing stock  Exhibit 7 presents in the top panel the ratio of the  OFHEO index over the constant-quality index plotted over the  period from 1977 to  the present  In the lower panel are plotted real improvements per unit of housing  stock per year over the same period  Over the past decade real improvements per   unit have increased about 25 percent, which appears to be associated with a further  increase in the ratio of the OFHEO index over the constant-quality home price  index  Research suggests  that higher-income households have a higher income   elasticity of demand for improvements to their primary residences, suggesting that   this source of upward bias is likely to be more pronounced in the right half of the  distribution of all single-family homes 5   Another way of looking at the issue of home prices over income is to go back to   the AHS data and see what is happening at various points on the distribution of all   single-family homes  This information is presented in exhibit 8  At the 25th   percentile the ratio of  home price to income has been relatively stable, while it has  increased sharply at the 75th and 80th percentiles, reminiscent of the price-to­ income ratio computed with the OFHEO index  Let me pause just a moment and  emphasize that I am comparing home prices at a percentile with the incomes of the   people who live in those homes at the same percentile This chart is likely the  equivalent of the finding that the increase of home prices has been most pronounced  in areas of the country where home prices were already relatively high due in part to  relatively inelastic supply It is likely that in these areas of the country, where land  values are high, the inclination to make substantial improvements to existing  properties is the greatest   Clearly, not everyone agrees that the constant-quality new home price index  provides an accurate indication of what is happening to the price of a typical single- family home  For example, it has been  argued that most new construction takes    5 See Joseph Gyourko and Joseph Tracy (2005), “Using Home Maintenance and Repairs to Smooth Variable  Earnings,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Working Paper Series                                                               June 29-30, 2005 14 of 234  place at the fringe of metropolitan areas where land prices may not be rising as fast  as is intra-marginal land  There are several counter arguments  First, the theory  leading to the conclusion that intra-marginal land values increase at a faster rate than  land at the fringe is based on a theory of the development of a metropolitan area with  fairly restrictive assumptions  Modern metropolitan areas have multiple  commercial/employment centers  Many households have preferences for rural or  suburban residences over urban residences  Restrictions on development to counter  suburban sprawl have reportedly resulted in sharp increases in prices of parcels of  land suitable for home building  Finally, I would like to note that the increases in  land prices implicit in the constant-quality home price index, shown in exhibit 9, are  substantial, particularly in the Northeast and the West  These estimates were derived  assuming that land represents 50 percent of the value of the total property and that  the prices of the other inputs increase at the same rate in all regions of the country     In closing, I would like to comment on one other aspect of the housing bubble  issue that has received substantial attention  Earlier this year a major real estate  related trade association released the results of a survey indicating that a significant  percentage of single-family home sales were of investment properties and second  homes  This was widely interpreted as evidence of speculative buying of rental  properties, another feature of a housing bubble  Again, I believe that such reports  should be viewed skeptically  According to the AHS, in 2003 single-family  investment properties, defined as homes renter-occupied or for rent, represented 142  percent of all single-family homes while second homes represented another 47  percent  Therefore, we should not be surprised that such properties represent about  20 percent of the sales that take place at any point in time  Moreover, the American  Housing Survey data indicate that single-family investment properties have been  declining as a share of all single-family homes for some time and declined in  absolute numbers from 2001 to 2003  A principal reason the rental vacancy rate for  single-family homes has risen in recent years is that the number of renter-occupied  single-family homes has declined as people switch from renting to owning  So if a  lot of people are buying rental properties, it must also be the case that a lot are  selling as well That concludes my report  Thank you   Well, let me make just a couple of observations    I have just three comments  First, I’m not disputing that land prices where   houses are being built would be lower than land prices closer to the center of a metropolitan area    The issue is the rate of increase of those land prices  And we don’t really know what’s happening to   the rate of increase of land prices at different points along the continuum   That’s true  That assumes that there is this nice gradual gradient of price   change for land as one moves out from the center of a metropolitan area  I don’t know the answer,   but my observation is that that is not what occurs  In the New York metropolitan area, for example,   I think one could cite many locations where land prices closer to Manhattan, say in Newark, are not   rising as rapidly as in Short Hills or in Hunterdon County  So, that relationship probably just   doesn’t hold in reality   Another thing that we’ve observed, particularly in our metropolitan area, is that state and   local governments are now aggressive bidders for parcels of land that are potential sites for   residential development  So it’s conceivable that the price of land on which one could build a home   now is rising extremely rapidly—and perhaps even more rapidly than land closer in that has already   been developed   The average lot size also has been declining rather rapidly, indicating that the   price of land is going up rapidly    I wanted to make one other point with regard to Josh’s work, and that is that   using the tenant rent component of the CPI and comparing it with the OFHEO index is, in my   opinion, a real apples-to-oranges type of comparison  As I pointed out in my comments, the   OFHEO index measures what is happening around the 75th percentile of the distribution of single-  family homes where we know incomes are rising more rapidly  Using a rent component that on the   one hand is looking at what is going on in the multi-family housing market to a large extent—   Not in the tenant rent component he is using   Just one follow-up comment  There’s a lot of evidence to suggest that a   good part of the reason for the rapid rise in home prices in California, Washington, DC, and along                                                    June 29-30, 2005 42 of 234  the East Coast, for example, is because of relatively inelastic supply—not that demand there is   necessarily stronger  That’s pretty clear in the data  Whether it’s due to these land use restrictions   or other factors, the fact is that these are already fairly densely populated areas and there’s definitely   a more inelastic supply in these areas of the country   If I could just add a point  In the spring of ’87, we had a very rapid increase   in rates—200 basis points—as we did again in 1994, and the housing market proved to be   surprisingly resilient in the face of those fairly steep increases   Well, I think there’s something to it  There is the view that people,   particularly higher-income people, place a high value on their time  If you don’t want to be caught   in Washington, DC, traffic, say, you might decide to sell your house in the suburbs and move into                                      June 29-30, 2005 64 of 234  the city and in the process drive up land prices in DC, which happens to be one of the metro areas   with the highest rate of price increase   I’m not a regional specialist, but I know there are people at our Bank who are working on   this issue of agglomeration benefits  And I think their conclusion is that there are a lot of reasons,   particularly labor market associated reasons, why there may be more agglomeration benefits now   than previously  That is exactly the opposite conclusion a lot of people thought would be the case   as we move to more telecommuting and that sort of thing   Well, I think in part it may go back to one of the issues discussed earlier   about the rate at which replacement is taking place  Now, I haven’t done this in the most scientific   way, but if you just take periodic estimates of the stock of housing, whether from the Census or   from the American Housing Survey, and try to line up changes in the stock with new production, it   appears that we’re in a period when a lot of destruction of old housing is taking place  As you   mentioned, the average estimate on tear-downs is 300,000, but I’ve seen estimates as high as   700,000 units   Right   Well, I think for a shorter time horizon you can say that    Yes, over the past four or five years, I think it does hold true   Right  Well, and also to the estimates of the stock   It has been going on for a long time, but I think the separation has been most   pronounced more recently  "
