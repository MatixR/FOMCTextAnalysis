2632,1995-11-15," Because those November 15th coupons are so close to maturity, the smallest increment in price that you can see on the screen is 70 basis points of yield If I tell you that it traded with a 1/256 change in price, I am telling you 70 basis points, which is incredibly dramatic But I can't observe anything that is smaller than that on the screen   A better comparison would be the bills that mature on the 16th, which also were of somewhat uncertain value then, but unfortunately I don't know the change in yield That is an easier comparison because it's a shorter instrument   Yes There does not seem to be a distortion in the November 30 coupons "
