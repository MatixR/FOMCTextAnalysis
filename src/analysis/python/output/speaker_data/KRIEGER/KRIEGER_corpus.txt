 Because those November 15th coupons are so close to maturity, the smallest increment in price that you can see on the screen is 70 basis points of yield If I tell you that it traded with a 1/256 change in price, I am telling you 70 basis points, which is incredibly dramatic But I can't observe anything that is smaller than that on the screen  A better comparison would be the bills that mature on the 16th, which also were of somewhat uncertain value then, but unfortunately I don't know the change in yield That is an easier comparison because it's a shorter instrument  Yes There does not seem to be a distortion in the November 30 coupons    I don’t think we’ve ever had a failed repo     Last year was not terrible  They managed their cash better    This year probably won’t be awful, but I doubt that they will have enough capacity    Capacity is likely to fall rather than rise as a result of a number of other developments    It can be     Thank you  As you noted, the markets are moving rather   quickly, so some of the point estimates I give you may be dated  Looking first at forward   rates, the spreads between LIBOR and the 3-month forward rate agreements and between   LIBOR and the 9-month forward contracts continue to show expectations of Fed easing  The 3-month forward and 9-month forward rates suggest easing of about 35 and 29 basis   points, respectively, a little more than at the time of your last meeting but not terribly so,   and they indicate a bottom in rates over the next nine to twelve months  Overall, these   rates are about 16 basis points lower than just after your last easing move       4/11/01 4   By comparison, in the euro area--and this does not take into account gyrations   currently as a result of the ECB not moving today--the forward markets continue to show   more aggressive easing but at a longer lag than in the United States  And in Japan, as you   know, forward rate expectations converge since the rates are so very low   In the Fed funds futures market, we saw some very sharp moves yesterday as a   result of the stock market’s gyrations  The market has been moving away from pricing in   expectations of an intermeeting move, and that continued this morning  The April   contract is now very near the current 5 percent funds target  The May contract is about   25 basis points below that and the June contract is a little under 50 basis points below  So, the market is still looking for a 50 basis point cut by June, but its conviction is shaky   right now I would say  And Eurodollar futures continue to suggest a pattern of declining   rates through the fall, but the shape of that curve also suggests that rates will turn up   somewhere around the end of the year   Treasury yields have been buffeted as much by the stock market--if not more--   than by economic data  Again, these yields are continuing to move upward today as they   did--sharply--yesterday  The two-year yield, at around 432 percent, is about 11 basis   points higher than just after your last move  But the really significant increases have   been further out in the curve  The 10-year and the long bond are maybe 35 basis points   higher than after your last move was digested, and the yield curve has a positive slope   across the entire curve  Equities have bounced off their lows as data such as the   Conference Board Index for March have shown some improvement  Also, there has been   an inordinate focus on statements from Fed officials, which have been read to suggest   confidence in economic performance later this year  That was a big driver in the upward     4/11/01 5   movement in yields yesterday  Additionally, in the 10-year area in particular, there has   been some upward pressure as a result of very heavy corporate issuance and related   hedging activity   Of course, the other factor that is taking on heightened importance is any   indication at all regarding first-quarter earnings  That has buffeted both the stock and   bond markets in recent days as well, and I believe it was a big factor yesterday in   explaining why the NASDAQ turned so sharply higher  That said, when we look at equities overall--and as you know we have tested   bear market territory in the few short weeks since your last meeting and we had a big   bounceback yesterday--the net changes have not been large  The Dow is only about 50   points higher than after your last move, the S&P is virtually unchanged, and the   NASDAQ is lower by about 100 points     Overseas, as you know, the Nikkei rallied on optimism about banking sector   reform in the wake of the Bank of Japan’s announcement just before your March   meeting  But since that time I believe actual optimism has dwindled, as people are   concerned about the lack of details  Also, a Bloomberg index of European stocks shows   some small positive changes on balance since March 20th  The dollar is stronger against   the euro and the yen, and risk reversals indicate a preference for dollars   Going back to our markets, I mentioned that the heavy supply we saw in the   corporate market in January and February has continued  Spreads for investment grade   corporates to Treasuries have widened by about 5 to 15 basis points since your last   meeting, and issuance has remained heavy as issuers take advantage of the lower yields  They continued to offer price concessions of about 5 to 15 basis points to get their     4/11/01 6   business done  In the high-yield area, we haven’t seen as much issuance but we’ve seen a   sharper widening of the spreads  Spreads were a little over 700 basis points around the   time of your last meeting and are closer to 770 or so now, according to a high-yield index   that Merrill Lynch publishes  And that’s about all I have to report for the moment    To the extent that we have seen a slowdown in the reflow of cash   from abroad, it has been incorporated in the forecast  But we didn’t build in an explicit addition   to growth related to the euro  Our analysts are following the pattern of foreign currency demand,   but they haven’t added anything extra, in terms of it escalating as the year goes on, because we   don’t really know how much to put in   4  Thank you  I will discuss at a high level some of the   operational aspects of the auction credit facility  Yesterday, SCRM (Subcommittee  on Credit Risk Management) members and discount window officers at your Reserve  Banks talked together about the operational details  Although they have had only  hours to learn and to think about this, they seem to be comfortable with the basics and  are helping to work out the open items      So, how would this work?  First, the watchwords for implementing this program   would be “simple and robust”  This means employing many of the procedures that  we already use locally to extend discount window credit  The discount staffs have the  necessary expertise to receive and to screen bid information  The local Reserve Bank                                                     4 Materials used by Ms Krieger are appended to this transcript (appendix 4)   September 18, 2007 131 of 188    staff members are in the best position to know the bidders in their District  They  would use many of the same procedures they use to accept discount window loan  requests  The applications we use to determine adequate collateralization for discount  window loan requests would be used to determine acceptability of auction bids, with  a supplemental calculation to screen for the excess of collateralization we would be  requiring for ACF credit  The discount window “hotline” telephone infrastructure—a  number with multiple lines known to depository institutions (DIs) in each District— would be used for Reserve Bank staff to receive and confirm bids and awards from  DIs in the District  The SCRM members and discount window officers are working  now with Board staff members on a communication plan for outreach to DIs should  this facility be implemented       Let me now walk you briefly through the auction cycle that is in the handout  We   have been contemplating that on Friday at noon the Board would announce the terms  of the next auction  It would include, for example, “On Monday, October 1, 2007,  there will be an auction for up to $20 billion of twenty-eight-day funds, to be issued  on Thursday, October 4, 2007  Bids may be submitted to local Reserve Banks  between times X and Y on the auction date The minimum bid size will be  $50 million, and the minimum bid rate will be Z percent  The auction results will be  announced on Wednesday, October 3, at 10 am eastern time”  Details pertaining to  the eligibility, the bidding, and the award procedures would be defined in an  announcement posted to the Board of Governors’ website, and discount window staff  would be available on the announcement date to answer calls to their local hotlines  regarding the terms of the specific auction  On the morning of the auction date  (typically a Monday), the Reserve Bank staff would perform the necessary calculation  to determine the maximum bid size for the eligible DIs in their District, based on  collateral pledged  Also on the auction date, Reserve Bank staff members would  receive and confirm or reject phone bids during the announced bidding window,  following defined procedures  After the close, the Reserve Bank staff would submit  formatted information to the auction agent by encrypted e-mail  Next, the auction  agent would combine the information from the individual Reserve Banks  A first step  would be to constrain the separate bids from branches of the same foreign banking  organization to comply with single-bidder rules       The administration of the other elements of the auction allocation is   straightforward  A predefined process would award partial allocations at the stop-out  rate when bidding at this rate exceeds the maximum amount expressed in the auction  announcement  The auction agent would communicate the awards back to Reserve  Banks on Tuesday afternoon, and the Reserve Bank staff would check these against  the stop-out rate information that the auction agent provides  On Wednesday, the  Board would publicly announce the auction results and post this information to its  website  At that point, Reserve Banks would begin to notify the DIs in their  respective Districts that submitted winning bids of the awards they would receive the  following day and the rate they would be charged  On Thursday, Reserve Banks  would post the term credit to the automated application that they currently use for   September 18, 2007 132 of 188    extensions of credit  Unless otherwise requested by the DI, the credit would be  posted to the DI’s reserve account at the end of the day      I have covered most, if not all, the details in the table of auction terms and the   auction dateline that are in your handout, and I will turn to Karen to continue our  presentation      Under the single-bidder guidelines, they’d be treated as one  But for   extensions of credit, that’s done at the local Reserve Bank  So their bids would be combined and   treated as one, and then they would be disaggregated so the loans could be booked at the local   Reserve Bank     Correct    Yes  We’ve given ourselves a lot of time just because of the   uncertainty associated with it, with an opportunity to change it if we were to do this over time   with learning      Right  The preference is for settlement always to be on Thursday, so   we can time it with open market operations and, to the extent that this is or is not combined with   actions in Europe, with some time parameters that might be sensitive to European time zones    But in terms of how long it takes to run a somewhat automated and somewhat manual auction,   we don’t really know  We don’t anticipate that it will be that complicated, but we’re giving   ourselves a little flexibility in the beginning    Well, starting with the last question, I think the sense is that it’s a dollar   funding problem  Obviously, the markets are deepest here, so that’s part of the interest in   offering it here to the broad range of institutions and the institutions that need it  It is also related   to your question about the limits  One thing we did was to look at what the Treasury does as an   auctioneer  They have a 35 percent limit  So we were working down from there, trying to see   how low we felt comfortable going and not departing from what are typical auction norms  Also,   if this is really meant to facilitate funding for those who need it, is there a possibility that, if you   go too low, you won’t have the desired impact?    But when you have that inadvertent overnight overdraft that you are   facing, you can’t wait until the weekly auction    We didn’t say  It was based on a market rate for term funding    No, I don’t think that had been the plan    The question is whether you identify a particular market rate that you’re   pegging or whether you say you’re looking at market-based rates  I think that’s a decision variable   of this program    But you have the auction announcement  You must tell the bidders ahead   of time what the minimum rate acceptable is    Yes     Thank you, Nathan  I am going to review the terms of the   auction  They were on page 17, in table 1, of the memo we circulated before the  meeting  In particular, I will note some changes from the terms that we discussed in  September  First, the TAF is proposed as a single-price auction  As previously  proposed, in this single-price auction, all winners will pay the same fixed rate  The  auction literature often touts single-price auctions as a format that encourages  aggressive bidding by eliminating the so-called winner’s curse—that is, the  possibility that the winner ends up paying more than would be necessary to win at the  auction  This also should be welcomed by smaller institutions that may have less  actual or perceived knowledge of market conditions  In practice, single- and  multiple-price auctions each have their benefits  The single-price auction is  operationally simpler, which is important given the limited time we have to prepare  and execute an auction process  The term is approximately twenty-eight days, with   December 6, 2007 7 of 51    some variation to facilitate auction scheduling  Spence Hilton will follow me in  talking about this in the context of auctions that would take place around the  upcoming holidays     The auction cycle is built around providing plenty of time for depository   institutions to think about what to bid, for the Reserve Banks to take in bids, and for  the auction agent to process bids and communicate results back to Reserve Banks for  review  There is also a day for bidders to digest the results  So, the typical schedule  is as follows  announce the auction details on Friday; hold the auction on Monday (or  Tuesday, if Monday is a holiday); determine the winning bids on Tuesday and  communicate these back to the Reserve Banks; announce the auction results to the  public on Wednesday and Reserve Banks contact winning bidders in their Districts on  Wednesday; and book winning bids as loans on Thursday     The minimum bid size that we propose is $10 million  In response to comments   from this group in September, this was reduced from $50 million to be more  accommodating of the desired bid sizes of smaller institutions  The maximum bid  size is a total of 10 percent of the announced auction amount  The maximum bid size  and the maximum award are the same for operational simplicity, and the maximum  award was lowered to 10 percent in response to the preferences expressed by this  group in September (from 20 percent previously)  The maximum TAF is available to  any single depository institution with adequate collateral  As I just said, any single  depository institution can be awarded only 10 percent of the announced auction size   This will mean that, to cover an auction, as least ten depository institutions will  receive funds  Also, bids will be constrained so that an institution’s term funding will  not exceed 50 percent of its pledged collateral value  So, on the auction date, when  the institution submits a bid, its outstanding TAF advances and any other term loans  with maturity dates that extend beyond settlement date plus its TAF bids should not  exceed 50 percent of the value of the institution’s margined collateral  This is to  ensure that adequate collateral value is available to secure primary credit borrowing  that may be necessary to cover unexpected funding needs  In the previous term sheet,  the threshold was 80 percent  If the institution happens to have an overnight loan on  the books on the day of the auction, the Reserve Bank typically would add back in the  value of the pledged collateral in determining the margined collateral value unless it  has reason to question whether this loan will be repaid on a timely basis     Eligible depository institutions are those eligible for primary credit—so those   determined by the Reserve Bank to be in generally sound financial condition  These  depository institutions also must have borrowing agreements and collateral in place   Reserve Banks have the flexibility to exclude particular institutions on a case-by-case  basis in the event that the Reserve Bank has supervisory concerns that it feels are not  adequately reflected in the eligibility criteria for primary credit  There is no  prepayment, but each Reserve Bank has the discretion to terminate a loan as part of  its risk-management procedures—that is, if it feels insecure  A minimum bid rate is  established to set a floor for the auction stop-out rates  We are recommending that  the overnight index swap rate—a measure of the expected average overnight fed   December 6, 2007 8 of 51    funds rate over the coming month—be the minimum acceptable rate  This rate is  made available on Bloomberg  The total amount auctioned is set in the context of the  complete framework for managing reserve supply  The Chairman is responsible for  setting the auction amount, upon recommendation of the SOMA Manager     A number of you had asked that we include an opportunity for noncompetitive   bids to be submitted  While for the purposes of the first two auctions we wish to  restrict bidding to competitive bidders, we hope to be able to accept noncompetitive  tenders in subsequent auctions  Noncompetitive tenders would have a separate  bidding window that preceded the window for competitive bidding  The amount  could be up to $1 million  Bidders who submitted noncompetitive tenders would not  be eligible to submit competitive tenders  Noncompetitive bids would be awarded at  the stop-out rate for competitive bidding (that is, at the single price determined in the  auction)  Noncompetitive bids would be add-ons to the announced auction amount,  to keep the other calculations straightforward for competitive bidders  The amount is  not expected to be significant enough to be problematic for reserve management     Foreign branches of a single corporate entity would be treated as a single bidder    The bids of each branch would be submitted to the local Reserve Bank in accordance  with the single-bidder guidelines, with the understanding that bids by multiple  branches of the same FBO (foreign banking organization) would be aggregated by the  auction agent and then again constrained to meet single-bidder guidelines  Thus only  two rates may be submitted across the branches, and the amounts cannot exceed the  10 percent threshold  If the bids must be reduced to comply, they will be reduced  proportionally across the relevant bidders  Similarly, the awards will flow back to the  branches (through the local Reserve Banks) in proportion to the application of the  auction results to the submitted bids     As noted in the paper we circulated last week, we did some preliminary analysis   on the use of an automated front end to receive bids from depository institutions  We  concluded at that time that automation was not cost effective or practical in view of  the uncertainty around whether a TAF would be implemented and, if implemented,  whether it would be used on a continued basis  It is sufficient to say that we  recognize that this is an important enhancement if the TAF is to be used regularly     The Federal Reserve statistical release H41 will record term auction funds as a   line separate from “other loans to depository institutions,” the latter being the  category under which primary, secondary, and seasonal credit is recorded  Thank  you  I will turn now to Spence       Under OC-10, a loan is callable, so we didn’t think anything in addition   needed to be said  So, yes, Reserve Banks have the opportunity to call a loan if they feel   insecure already, and these will be governed by OC-10  We want that term to be more explicit    “Might” was not the best choice of words there    Finally, just on the ratings, the seasonal program and the temporary   term primary credit program use as their criteria CAMELS 1, 2, and 3  So we need a really   strong rationale to distinguish ourselves  We would also, then, need to find a comparable   benchmark when you go to FBOs (Foreign Banking Organizations), where we have SOSA   (Strength of Support Assessment) 1 and 2 and ROCA (Risk management, Operational controls,   Compliance, and Assessment quality) ratings  So it could be a bit complicated to administer a   comparable system, given how harsh the ratings are and how they don’t really allow for that kind   of intricacy  But, again, Reserve Banks do reserve the right not to make loans to institutions that   they don’t believe are sound or where they feel that the supervisory ratings are not accurate   reflections  We hope that would provide sufficient comfort to a Reserve Bank speaking with its   depository institutions    Well, we’re preparing some Qs and As, which we would put on the   Board’s website, and contemplating an open conference call, which we would tape and make   available to institutions that couldn’t participate; and of course, the Reserve Banks would be   answering questions for the banks in their Districts  We can imagine that we can get the word   out to banks in the time that we have for this    I don’t have that number at my fingertips    It’s a large number of institutions  Right now, they need the borrowing   documents, and then, of course, if they already have collateral in place, they’re eligible    Institutions that don’t have collateral in place presumably could bring it in a short period if they   have some of the more easily pledgeable types of collateral  So I think the universe is pretty big    But that said, I think that the Reserve Banks know their institutions and would be able to   communicate with the institutions that are interested     Thank you, Debby  Regarding the longer-term TAF, a transition   from the current biweekly schedule of 28-day auctions, $75 billion each, to a  schedule of biweekly 84-day auctions, $25 billion each, will require four additional  biweekly auctions of 28-day credit for an eight-week period  We need to do this to  keep the amount of TAF credit outstanding at $150 billion  We contemplate a  schedule that permits us to auction the 84-day credit of $25 billion on the now-typical  Monday “cycle,” announce these results Tuesday morning, and then auction 28-day  credit Tuesday afternoon  The two auctions will settle Thursday of that week, the day  other TAF credit matures        July 24, 2008 7 of 50    We are also requesting that we enhance the collateral protection for the Reserve  Banks against term loans  Specifically, we are seeking a collateral cushion on term  loans  The cushion is meant to provide protection to Reserve Banks if there are  unanticipated needs for overnight credit during the term of the loan as well as serve as  a collateral buffer that provides for deterioration in the value of the collateral or the  creditworthiness of the depository institution (DI)  This would apply to both TAF  loans and term primary credit loans  Currently, there is a requirement that a TAF  auction bid, plus other term credit that will be concurrently outstanding, not exceed  50 percent of available collateral  However, this requirement is only for the time  when the bid is submitted  We imposed this as a modest measure of comfort that DIs  would have adequate access to collateral to cover unanticipated needs for additional  credit during the term of the TAF loan  This collateral cushion has not been an  element of the term primary credit borrowing program, first introduced in August  2007  Under the current collateral policy for the TAF bids, we observe that some DIs  add collateral just before an auction and withdraw the excess amount after the  auction  That is, they do not maintain the cushion during the actual term of the loan     Particularly for the longer-term TAF and also for the term primary credit loans,   we feel that Reserve Banks should have access to additional collateral  As I noted  above, this would provide a cushion for unanticipated needs for additional credit  during the term of the loan and for deterioration in the value of the collateral or the  creditworthiness of the DI  An alternative would be to alter the haircuts themselves,  but that could have other negative market consequences  In fact, for that reason, the  Federal Reserve stated publicly in August that it was not changing its haircuts amid  the uncertain market conditions  Specifically, the requirement we are proposing is  that a DI’s aggregate term borrowings not exceed 75 percent of available collateral   Most current holders of term credit have sufficient collateral to meet this requirement  We do not feel that this will restrict participation in any significant way  As is the  case currently, the terms for TAF bidding and outstanding extensions of credit will  require that Reserve Banks be collateralized to their satisfaction and that they take  additional measures, including the right to ask for more collateral or to call a loan, if  they feel insecure  Other terms of the auctions will remain as they are today   maximum bids and awards of 10 percent of the auction size, minimum bid size of $10  million, maximum of two bid rates, minimum bid rate based on the OIS rate, et  cetera  These seem to have been working well, and we see no need to request any  changes  We would be happy to answer your questions  Thank you                     Well, as I said before, we imposed it to provide us with some comfort   that DIs could stretch toward extra collateral, should they need it during the term of a loan  It   came against the background of a term primary credit program that didn’t have any such   requirements or expectations  So I think we were a little cautious about the measures that we   were taking at that time  It is spelled out in the terms and conditions  I think the Reserve Banks   have been comfortable administering it on auction day, and the DIs seem to understand it    Maybe they understand it too well because some of them have figured out that they can bring in   collateral and withdraw it    Yes, there is—10 percent of the auction    Of bid—correct    So, yes, what we have proposed is that the additional cushion be taken   against all loans more than one business day—primary credit and TAF, not seasonal credit    Clearly one could make a decision about where that point should be, and unless you can do it in a   trend line, which our systems don’t make operationally easy or comfortable for us, there will be a   discrete point  An alternative would be to do it at some particular point in time, and there would   be costs and benefits  On the one hand, it would make some more comfortable with the   collateralization at very short terms  On the other hand, you also want to be comfortable with the   incentives that we will create for DIs, if they are collateral constrained, to take loans of the short   term that go just up to that point and continue to roll them  For example, let’s say that your point   was one week  Banks that are not collateral constrained probably would take the longer-term   loan  Banks that are collateral constrained, the ones that you probably want to follow most   closely, are likely to take the loan for six or seven days and then roll it and roll it and roll it   again    In terms of the size of the cushion, we did speak with SCRM   (Subcommittee on Credit Risk Management) a bit about this, and, of course, there is a variety of   views there; and across the System, as we look at the loans that are outstanding, there is a range   of collateral that is used  A good portion of the collateral that is used is not priced securities; it is   loans, many of which we do not have the details on, so it is very difficult to establish a good   value  Then, even behind that in quality are nonpriced securities, and we have increasingly seen   more of those pledged to us in these times  So we felt, because it is difficult for us to feel really   comfortable with the values of some of these pledged instruments, that taking the cushion did   seem appropriate  For what it is worth, of the more than $150 billion of loans that we have   outstanding, they fall short of being collateralized by this extra margin by only about   $200 million  So virtually all the value can be overcollateralized   Now, it is not quite so pleasing a picture if you look at it by the number of borrowers   outstanding  Of the 140 or some borrowers outstanding, maybe 25 of them are short some   margin of collateral, if you would impose the 25 percent overcollateralization  But, again, the   values are quite small, even in percentage terms, for institutions  So as we try to balance, on the   one hand, our comfort with some of the collateral we are taking and our ability to value it with,   July 24, 2008 19 of 50    on the other, the longer term, we look to the preference of many in the reserve community who   have dealt with institutions whose quality has deteriorated  We felt we might be doing best by   the vast majority of Reserve Banks if we were to introduce the cushion
