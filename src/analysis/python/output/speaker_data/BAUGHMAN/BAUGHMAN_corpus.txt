  Mr Chairman, on the Mexican thing, probably a fairly minor detail   They have drawn about two to three times the amount of currency from the Federal Reserve  offices in the Eleventh District pre-Easter this year than they normally do  On the other side of  it, I guess it’s the other side of the same thing, there seems to be an unusual amount of shopping  by Mexicans in the border cities in Texas this year, indicating that they have apparently passed  word to the inspectors at the border to be a little more liberal with people carrying merchandise  back from this country  They drew $31 million in 50s and 100s from our shops in the week  before Easter       4/20/76 - 3 -             Well, there is more  It is our impression that there is more  speculation now in terms of conversation about a possible devaluation this year than there has  been in recent years, and presumably the managers of the Central Bank of Mexico felt that they  would have a heavier demand for US currency, and they wanted to be in a position to supply  without question in the interest of trying to quiet or hold down this rising conversation  And I  would think the same thing might well be true with respect to the shopping across the border     If they could convey an impression to their people that they are in a position to  accommodate at least the usual amount and maybe more than the usual amount of buying of  foreign merchandise, then that would also help to quell the concern about a devaluation     It gives us a little operating problem in that we have to round this up,  pass it out, and then process it when it comes back     Just a brief comment, largely impressionistic  Of course, it’s against  a background where we have had pretty good business conditions in the Southwest, but I do not  hear the claims of expectations of real bullish change from where we are at the present time  In  part, of course, that is because the drilling activity is down significantly  I understand that there  normally is a seasonal decline in that activity from the end of the year through the first quarter   But the decline is more this year than usually occurs, and there is a sharp difference of opinion as  to whether it’s going to continue or whether it’s going to turn around  I just want to register  that--to some extent--impressionistic feeling, that it is a little different in that part of the world  from what I have just heard     Mr Chairman, I just register concurrence with your  recommendation  I think it’s quite appropriate in the circumstances  I think the maximum  numbers we have here are still adequate to finance quite a substantial inflation, but the fact that  we have the maximums doesn’t mean that we will necessarily rise to them, as is demonstrated by  experience over the past year, so I’m comfortable with the recommendation     Mr Chairman?     I would be inclined at this point in time, I think rather strongly, in the  direction of Partee’s and Black’s comments, which I construe [to be] in the direction of being  prepared to [make] just a very slight firming in the funds rate  And then observe the aggregates  for another month before we conclude that we are seeing in them the beginnings of a rather  strong surge in monetary and credit expansion     I’d like to express support of that view  It seems to me that both your  recommendations are good recommendations, and I would like to see the Committee adopt them     4/20/76 - 62 -             The Memorandum of Discussion is a document of uncertain  parentage, in the first place  That is, it is not a transcript, and consequently is not a full record of  proceedings  And therefore, at whatever time and in whatever circumstance it’s released, it will  be a document subject to suspicion as to what’s included and what’s not included  I think it is a  document without any official standing  So it seems to me that, as I said on previous occasions,  that it’s unfortunate that it’s been around as long as it has  Because it seems to me it’s bound to  be an embarrassing document at some time and in some circumstances  And I happen also to  share John’s feeling, that it’s not particularly useful, especially when its cost is compared to its  usefulness     With respect to the two documents, which are referred to in the staff memo, I concur with  the proposal to expand the Record of Policy Actions  I am uneasy, however, with the idea or the  proposal that we continue to produce two separate documents which profess to record the actions  and deliberations of this body  Most groups feel that one document is adequate to record the  actions they take in their meetings  And it seems to me that when we produce two documents  which profess to do that, again we’re opening ourselves to a question as to just what the  relationship between the two may be and what’s included and what’s not included     So it seems to me the Memorandum of Discussion should be dispensed with, and I would  like to see very serious consideration given to the idea that the Record of Policy Actions be  incorporated into the Minutes of Actions of the meeting  And that one document should be the  official record of proceedings of the Federal Open Market Committee     Now the proposal to place certain items in the files, it seems to me, is something which in  the current environment, where the minutes of meetings are likely to be public property rather  promptly, does fit logically and conveniently into the format as I visualize it  There, it seems to  me, we would be obliged to make note in the minutes of the meeting that a certain matter was  considered and for various reasons could not be in the public area, and therefore, appropriate  record is noted in the Committee’s files  That, it seems to me, would put us in a more logical,  reasonable, and defensible position, and it would substantially reduce the total amount of  expenditure that’s involved in providing a record of the actions of this body     My inclination--I don’t know whether you can pull it off or  not--would be to use the most time-consuming aspect--that record which takes the greatest time  to prepare--as the basis for arguing what the time frame is within which we can make available  to the public the actions of this group  And it seems to me that the Record of Policy Actions,  which gives the reasons why we reach certain conclusions, should be released concurrent with  the action that is taken and that it should be a part of the same document     Mr Chairman, I’d just like to offer this one further comment, that it’s  not inconceivable, it seems to me, that we would discover a lag to produce the Record of Policy  Actions within a timeframe which would enable us to make what I would hope would be a  cogent argument, that that was the prompt time within the eyes of the law within which to release  the actions of this body     Pardon me?     I find it difficult to believe, when a succeeding record is specific on  matters which are of interest, that we will be judged to have satisfied the requirements of the law  by putting out promptly a generalization which no one can construe in a meaningful way, when  people know that the Committee decided what the funds rate would be, what the rates of growth  of the aggregates would be, but if that [detail] flows along 30 days later--     Is there possibly another--maybe trivial--point here as to special  meetings?  It’s conceivable that the Committee may meet one week after its previous [meeting]     Can I follow on with a somewhat related question?  Is there any  indication that Internal Revenue has been slower this year than in most recent years in processing  returns and collecting checks?      I have had a few people indicate surprise to me that the checks  mailed April 15 were not [debited in the period covered by] their April bank statement      If they were slow, that would result in private balances being  significantly larger than people had planned on them being     Mr Chairman, I’m impressed with what John Balles announced as  the situation and his suggestion about the need for paying respect to the long-term ranges that we  project  At the same time, I would have to admit to being a little bit weak-kneed at the present  time with respect to moving as aggressively as his prescription comes out from that particular  analysis  So if I were a voting member I’d be prepared to go with your suggestion, Mr  Chairman, on the federal funds rate and also with your suggestions on the aggregates  This  means that we would probably be at the top of the federal funds rate fairly soon     Alternatively, if we want to maintain the significant element of flexibility in the funds rate,  then--and I guess I’m winding up pretty nearly in the same corner that I believe Governor Partee  was--[I would support] a somewhat higher and little bit wider range on the federal funds rate; so  [then] you will be working pretty much around the middle of that range but expecting to be  associated with that somewhat higher rate of growth in the aggregates than proposed  So it  seems to me it’s kind of a 50-50 proposition and--notwithstanding my general orientation toward  narrower ranges on the aggregates and wider ranges on the federal funds rate--at this point in  time my inclination would be to go in the other direction, which leaves me very close to your  suggestion at the outset, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, Mr Volcker, it may be irrelevant here  We continue  to hear a very substantial amount of discussion relative to a  probable devaluation of the Mexican  currency  And we hear conversation on the part of US businessmen conducting a substantial  amount of business in Mexico in the context of a 10- to 12-month time frame  The San Antonio  and El Paso Branches have not seen a reflow of the large volume of large denomination currency  withdrawn prior to Good Friday, as normally would have been expected to take place by this  time  We do see indications of continued demand for large denominations of US currency   They are not pressing us for it when we say we are out at the moment; they say “we’ll check  elsewhere,” which suggests that they may be finding such currency in commercial banks     Mr Chairman--a speculative question, but I encountered in a number  of places a possible explanation of the weakness of retail sales, particularly in soft goods  recently  It is that, this year, people think there will be gas available for whatever kind of  vacation travel they might wish to engage in, and therefore that is affecting their current  spending  I was interested that this was not mentioned anywhere in the Redbook or Greenbook,  and I was wondering whether you had any reaction to it?     That’s what I’ve been running into     6/22/76 - 18 -           CHAIRMAN  Very interesting  I have not run into that  Mr Gramley?     Mr Chairman,  I think I substantially agree with the thread of  discussion here, but there are a couple of aspects of it that bother me somewhat  I fail to grasp  the reason for the desire that has been expressed to go to the money market condition directive  this time  I just don’t quite grasp the reason why that should prevail     I generally like the alternative B in terms of quantities, but I would share the view that the  top on a couple of those measures could well come down a bit  And I would be inclined to bring  them down in line, I guess, with the longer-term objective, or target  In particular, looking back  over the past year’s experience, I become pretty well persuaded that an M2 growth rate in excess  of 10 percent is probably not consistent with the move toward economic stability     As to the range on the fed funds rate, there again, it seems to me that, in the current  circumstances, 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 would certainly take care of the needs that might develop over the  next month  But I don’t really see that we accomplish anything positive by knocking a quarter  off of [the top and adding a quarter to] the bottom a 5 to 6 range  But I could go 5-1/4, 5-3/4,  and in fact, could go with the whole alternative B listing  On M1, I prefer the top to drop to  about 7 and on M2 the top to drop to 10      Mr Chairman, can I raise a very small point?     For some period of time it has bothered me that we have described  the rate of change in wage rates as moderate or something that is sort of vague  And it appears  again in the general paragraph of line 16     6/22/76 - 40 -             It’s quite inconsistent with the achievement of economic stability     Mr Chairman?     This may be an inappropriate question  Is it expected that the IMF  will continue to sell gold almost irrespective of price trend, or will the IMF’s volume of sales  likely be determined by the price trend?     Mr Chairman, I might just comment with respect to the Mexican  situation as observed along the borders, so to speak  We see no letup in the demand for large- denomination US currency     Pardon me?     I can’t answer that explicitly as of today, but we are shipping    They’re taking it up primarily from El Paso, however, to Dallas  We have recently drawn from  another Federal Reserve District a substantial volume which is being transferred to Mexico  We  continue to hear reports of substantial purchases of real estate by Mexican nationals, and also the  banks [unintelligible] despite that are recording rather phenomenal increases in time and savings  deposits attributed in part to Mexicans     Those that I’m hearing about are taking place in Texas     Mr Chairman, if for some reason we were to see a more rapid  decline in the deficit than is built into the projection, would we [unintelligible] a bullish or a  bearish development so far as economic expansion and prices go?  Mr Partee had one side of  that picture, the government expenditure side  If Mr Gramley would give us--     Mr Chairman, I would just like to call attention also to [the fact] that  we seem to have a very rapid growth in deposits and loans in country banks in our part of the  country  And the loan figures listed exclude their sales of federal funds, which are substantial   We are hearing what I think is a fairly optimistic discussion about possibilities of beginning  some part [unintelligible]  We hear smaller figures  [unintelligible] to the necessary increase in  rents and [unintelligible] they may be about a point further down  [Unintelligible]  It seems to  me I hear rather conflicting stories that, in some of these items, rather large inventories are being  held, possibly in a speculative situation, and rather bullish expectations [unintelligible]   One of our directors reported that the [increase] in the minimum wage has raised labor  costs 90 percent in their stores  Now I heard a number of store managements recently indicate  that they have initiated rather intensive programs, frequently involving the engagement of  outside firms, to come in to help them to hold down the longer [unintelligible] and increase the  output for worker [unintelligible] hours  I’m not sure that’s [unintelligible] anything, Mr  Chairman, but I just [unintelligible] indication of what’s going on     Mr Chairman, it seems to me that it should be possible to  characterize the conditions in alternative B--which are essentially the same as those described in  your recommendation--as a no-change posture, and it seems to me that’s what the current  environment really calls for  And I’m for not extending it beyond that     I have to register a little different view, I guess, and fill in also an  observation that at least some of the bigger bankers in the Southwest think that, in view of the  loan demand situation, they are looking at interest rate weakness rather than interest rate strength  for the immediate future, whatever that is  And it seems to me that if we embrace a very narrow  or point interest rate target, we are in effect saying that we can predict interest rates--that is, what  would be the normal path of interest rates in this uncertain economic picture--with greater  accuracy or dependability than we can predict most any of the other great array of economic  variables     That--along with John Balles’s observations that historically, at least, riding the funds rate  fairly tightly seems to have imparted greater volatility to the aggregates--would lead me to  urge--though I can’t vote on it--that the Committee conclude that there should be a fair amount  of range on the interest rate so that the Manager could begin to respond to sizable or cumulative  deviations from the objective on the aggregates  It seems to me that, historically at least, it  would seem to have given us a little better record  That leads me also to have sympathy for a  monetary aggregate directive rather than a money market directive     Yes, it’s still going out at about 10 million a week       Yes  They refuse to take anything smaller than 50s  We have tried  to pawn off 20s on them but     We did undertake to get people of our Branch to get a little  indication of what their future expectations were as to need, and they said they could not project  their needs  They also volunteered that most of this currency is paid out at the airport branch of  their bank, and [they] suggested that from there it may go to many places in addition to Mexico     Mr Chairman, may I be permitted to slip in one extra question for  reassurance?     [Unintelligible], interest rates are sure to remain low, and maybe drift  even lower, through at least the first half of next year  The reasoning is that corporate earnings  are much higher, and that corporations are not making their [unintelligible] payments until the  first and second quarters of next year  At that time, this will increase the payments of  [unintelligible] will not need [unintelligible] no reason to expect that interest rates will be  pressing up  I need some reassurance     Mr Chairman, just a question  Possibly an outlandish one  That is,  whether the rather slow growth in money stock through the last quarter of last year and first  quarter of this year and the current slowing in some of the economic measures are considered to  be rather completely unrelated developments, or whether there may be some relationship  between them     Appendix table 1-A in the Bluebook, Mr Chairman, shows the  numbers fairly--     Appendix table 1-A in the Bluebook  I believe the page is not  numbered     Yes, the M1 column in the center of the page     Mr Chairman, I haven’t spoken, but I really have nothing  worthwhile to say  I’ve concluded that alternative B is an appropriate posture [in which] to  continue in the present circumstance     I would register support as strongly as I could for Coldwell’s suggestion that we reduce  reserve requirements at every opportunity     But the only other thing I would comment on is that I think we probably don’t qualify as  psychologists  I’m not sure that anyone really does, and in terms of [determining] our actions,  we should go pretty much by the numbers in our judgments of the economic situation and not be  influenced very much by our guesses as to how others will interpret our actions  Because I’m  not sure that we can make very useful guesses in that respect     With respect to giving signals, there’s at least one place in the country where the board of  directors of a [Reserve] Bank would not be averse to considering a signal on the discount rate   But I think that would be a bit premature at the present time   SPEAKER(?)  You mean an increase?     Pardon?   SPEAKER(?)  You mean an increase or a decrease?     8/17/76 - 25 -       Decrease   SPEAKER(?)  Decrease     Mr Chairman, I question first the different signals from the  household survey and the nonfarm payroll employment data on employment last month--will you  draw any particular significance from that in terms of trend of employment, or not?       I could make a couple of comments, Mr Chairman, with respect to  the local impact of the devaluation of the peso  I may say that the action which has been  taken--and I didn’t find it reported in the Wall Street Journal this morning, but I assume it will  be recorded very soon--will be very welcome news soon along the border  We had been  receiving a fair number of telephone calls, primarily from banks on the US side of the border,  indicating something like this was very much needed, because there was a rising feeling of  uncertainty, particularly on the part of Mexican nationals of significant wealth  Of course, as  you know, runs on banks were developing, and some banks were having to close early because  they ran out of currency  And in our own shop, we saw return flow for a few days, but then it  turned right around, and we’re now shipping sizable volumes again to Mexico as they undertake  to respond to that sort of development     We’ve had some reports from business firms of cancellation of orders for capital goods as  a result of the reduced purchasing power of the peso  Of course, the merchants along the border  who were serving a sizable Mexican trade [have seen] their sales drop very sharply, and  presumably they are looking at a very awkward inventory situation  It’s interesting that some of  them have apparently chosen to run ads in Mexican papers in which they offered higher-than- market prices for pesos rather than reductions in prices of merchandise as a merchandising  device       9/21/76 - 14 -     We have reports that Mexican officials have closed some Mexican businesses that did not  take their advice to resist temptations to mark up prices of merchandise  We don’t have any  indication as to whether that is widespread at all  We do have reports from US bankers of quite  a bit of what you might call suitcase money moving across [the border] and opening accounts in  US banks, apparently in response to a rumor that deposit accounts in Mexico might well be  frozen and the border closed to movements of currency  But, again, announcement of the actions  taken yesterday I believe would bring substantial stability to that situation     To Mr Axilrod  Would you feel any better in the current situation if  you saw a little more evidence of price flexibility on savings and small CD accounts?     Mr Chairman, just to express the view that I agree with the  suggestions that it might be appropriate to see a little more flexibility of our operation  I would  hope that it would tend to reduce the indication that we’re supporting those elements in the  markets which are resisting the tendency for rates to move down  It seems to me that the  situation is one which would look better if we saw a little more downward flexibility in the  private part of this market currently     It seems to me also that within our frame of operation, the best way to get a little more  flexibility is to go the route of the aggregate directive  I guess that’s not necessary, but as we  operate, it seems to me even more like [unintelligible]  As to the specific  figures given, I have  no objection     Mr Chairman, just a couple of quick observations which may be of  interest  One  We had expected by this time to see a return flow of dollars from Mexico, that’s  not materialized, and we continue to see the reverse, actually--a fairly sizable demand for  dollars--     It appears that even at the current exchange rate, there are some  holders of pesos who still desire to get into dollars  With respect to the generally weak loan  demand, we are seeing a reverse in the agricultural areas, with strong loan demands  And the  country banks, of course, are rather happy about that because they have both strong deposits and  strong loans     Turning to the current economic outlook, it seems to me a very difficult problem is  captured in Lyle Gramley’s comment that he doesn’t think we can [deal with] the current  lethargic situation in the economy through monetary policy  I think I agree with that  But it  doesn’t give one any peace of mind  Particularly, there is a little different situation in the     10/19/76 - 15 -   outlook we are looking at currently than what we’ve been looking at in the past  Mainly that we  were looking at a rising rate of inflation rather than a diminishing rate of inflation  Now, it just  seems to me that the possibilities of continuing very low levels of performance, or maybe of  even what you call stagnation--if we are in fact looking into a fairly extended period of rising  rather than declining prices, [those possibilities are] substantially increased  And unless we can  find some way of impacting upon that trend in prices, that the possibilities of moving the  economy toward that desired objective of full employment and price stability become more and  more remote     Well, all I’m doing here is expressing, I guess, frustration and concern and what I think is  the major aspect of the additional concern that I see in our current projection  That’s all I have,  Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, I would simply say that I concur with Mr Partee’s  recommendations, which use your numbers and slightly lower fed funds midpoint  It seems to  me that the market situation is one which justifies additional pressure on that prime rate and  possibly even on the savings and small CDs       A clarification  $150 million [from the] Federal Reserve and $150  [from the] the Treasury?     Do we have an impression as to what the policy of the government or  the central bank will be with respect to shoring up private business firms that find the  devaluation places them in an untenable debt situation?     Mr Chairman, I just might report that the qualitative types of thing  that one picks up indicate that the uncertainty--and I guess I could even use the word “tension”  now--is still building up rather than leveling off with respect to the people who move across and  do business across the border on a rather personal sort of basis  There is coming into these  conversations now hints of concern about personal security as well as financial security  This  comes to my mind in connection with the reference to the possibilities of some agricultural  reforms or something like that coming into the picture  I heard reports, after the initial  devaluation, of a number of people approaching border banks and inquiring as to whether they  could borrow funds to take a speculative position in the peso  I’ve not heard such reports  following the further devaluation, notwithstanding the fact that the value’s a good deal lower  now  It may be that there’s less confidence in the current value than there was in the earlier one     Mr Chairman, I simply reiterate the references that have been made  to the conservative outlook or feeling of caution that businessmen seem to be expressing at the  present time, and this notwithstanding the fact that those that I have come in contact with are for  the most part sitting in a rather vigorous economic setting  I find a rather widespread expectation  that there will be a move to more stimulation of the economy, and along with that, or shortly  thereafter, a need for bringing into the picture some form of price-wage restraint or control     And there is amongst the groups that I have contact with a widespread feeling that it is  important that the anti-inflation posture be maintained  And I think flowing from that is this  concern that this may not be maintained and is the reinforcement for this feeling of conservatism  with respect to commitment on future economic activity  And, of course, in the petroleum  industry, there is so much concern as to what the government policy is going to be  And so  much of business there is related to the developments in petroleum  So just more of a feeling of  sitting and waiting than I have observed, I think, [than at] most any time that I can recall in any  particular setting       11/16/76 - 22 -           With respect to our economic forecast, it seems to me that there is reason for doubting the  relationship between interest rate developments and the projected general economic  developments  And [that is] particularly [so] if we should not see the indications of some  strengthening of inflationary forces  With the amount of slack that there would still appear to be  in the economy, [then] quite a few months in the future, if our projection of economic activity is  realized, it seems a bit odd that there should be associated with that higher levels of interest rates  than prevail at the present time     So I would raise the question whether there is not a distinct possibility that, for some  period of time yet, we may not see a continuation of what we’ve seen in the past month  Some  gradual rise in economic activity associated with some gradual decline in interest rates--it seems  to me that that would be a fortunate situation if it were to develop  It seems to me, further, that it  might be appropriate for us, as far as we can, to encourage this development     Mr Chairman, I can find quite acceptable your suggestions on  modified alternative B  I’m a little uncomfortable with a 2-1/2 on the bottom side of M1  And  so far as the fed funds rate is concerned, I guess I’d be a little more inclined toward 4-1/4 to  5-1/4 than the 4-1/2 to 5-1/4  With respect to the directive, I would endorse Governor Partee’s  very appropriate arguments in favor of an aggregates directive  It seems to me that that applies  to most circumstances, but I’d agree that it applies particularly well at the present time     I would agree also with those who indicated that they would welcome seeing some change  in reserve requirements  With respect to the discount rate, I would argue as strongly as I can that  we make a change of 1/2 [point] at the present time  I think 1/2 is justified for a number of  reasons  I think it’s superior to 1/4 on the grounds that a change of 1/4 now probably would need  to be followed by another change of 1/4 before very long, and I think two such changes coming  in sequence would tend to carry more of a suggestion to the public that the economy was  continuing to weaken  For five weeks now, the average of the three-month bill, the three-month  CD, and the three- to six-month finance paper rates have been more than 50 points above the  discount rate     Below the discount rate  And it seems to me that the rationale for  changing the discount rate should be aligning it with the market  And it seems to me that that     11/16/76 - 42 -           rationale cannot be used unequivocally if the change is only 1/4 point at the present time   Another observation I would toss in, I would qualify it before doing it as possibly not being very  significant  We’ve had 19 banks make arrangements for seasonal borrowings this year   Fourteen of them have borrowed, but as the differential between the market rates and discount  rate has widened, the numbers dropped off  We have three [banks] borrowing at the present  time  Now, of course, that’s not the only reason, and probably not even the preponderant reason,  for the change in the number of these little country banks that have been borrowing, although  information available to us from surveys indicates that there is a pretty strong demand for credit  out in the country down there  So, as I say, I would argue as vigorously as I can that we move  the [discount] rate 1/2 point  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I assume the Manager had substantial input in this  process  I, of course, wasn’t privy to that, and just reading the document, it seems that it ties the  Manager very securely  And I would feel better to hear the Manager say that the operational  procedures described here will not unnecessarily or unduly interfere with effective operations   The other point--     The other point--it seems to me the language is just kind of upside  down [regarding] the sequence of consultation  It [should read], it seems to me, that the  Manager in all circumstances must consult the Chairman; the Chairman then must decide  whether to go to the subcommittee and or to the full Committee  As I say, the words turn that  around, and as it’s written, I don’t really see that it’s working     Actually, my point was a bit different, but I don’t want to belabor it   It says the Manager shall clear with the subcommittee, but then it continues, if the Chairman  believes that it is not feasible, then he clears with the Chairman  Well, [unintelligible] Manager  clear the subcommittee  Now someone else decides whether that is feasible  And the same thing  in 2  The Manager clears with the Committee, but if that’s not feasible, the subcommittee will  decide that it’s not feasible  And so the Manager is told to do something with one group, but  someone else decides whether he can or not     12/20-21/76 - 19 -           Well, it seems to me that the instruction to the Manager is  inappropriate  [It should read that] the Manager shall consult the Chairman, the Chairman then,  if time is available, arranges the further consultation  I think that--     Well, all I am suggesting is that that thrust should be given to the  Chairman rather than to the Manager  The Chairman calls the meetings, it seem to me  He  winds up making that decision  But as I say--     Mr Chairman, I’m not sure I heard you correctly, but if I did, you  opened the question as to the frequency of meetings      I have thought about it a good bit, and I have to admit I’ve come to  the conclusion that, during much of the time, a very thorough meeting about once a quarter  would probably serve the needs fairly well  I think there are times--when the economy is in fact  changing or giving indications of imminent change, either in direction or pace--when that would  be too far apart     Since we don’t use the range we now publish, what reason is there to  think we’d get any mileage out of publishing a wider one?     Mr Chairman, kind of picking up on Bob Mayo’s comment, I’d be  interested in Mr Gramley’s reaction to the observation that if the current forecast proves to be  somewhat off the mark, that the odds might be greater that it would be low rather than high   We’re sensing a little bit of the same sort of thing that Bob has referred to  I might report that, at  a recent small meeting of business economists in our area that we sponsored, there was quite--I’d  almost call it a note of enthusiasm amongst these business economists flowing from their  observation that long-term interest rates had declined more than they had expected and that this  was generating quite a change in attitude on the part of their principals  They thought that they  were viewing the outlook a good deal more optimistically to a considerable extent because of  that development     So I would just toss in one other bit of information which seemed to me to provide an  index of where we are  Commercial rents in relation to current construction may have a bearing  on prospects there  One of our directors, who is a rather sizable real estate developer and works  over a large geographic area, reported that he has three sizable commercial office buildings  coming up--Minneapolis, Cincinnati, Houston  In the Houston market, they were able to make it  a feasible project at current rentals  But in the Minneapolis and Cincinnati markets, which he  judged to be more typical of the country, the only reason the projects were viable was because  the major tenant was willing, in the interest of getting the job done, to commit himself to pay  $200 a square foot more than the going market, or more than they can expect to [get for] space  [from] other occupants  It would seem that his experience suggests that, in most markets, either  construction costs have got to come down something on the order of $200 a [square] foot or  rentals have got to rise something on the order of $200 a [square] foot before we can expect any  sizable amount of increase in activity in commercial construction     I would think about 15 or 20 percent--20 might be a little bit on the  strong side  With respect to--     He also reported that, as he shops for opportunities, he finds that  banks are holding large inventories of real estate and, from his point of view, at prices well  above what in his judgment the market is  I don’t know whether Lyle [unintelligible] presume  that he has given us a forecast for which he thinks the odds are 50-50 above and below     There is, along with it, an indication of leveling off or even decline in  registration of students in the professional schools     All I suggest is that we may hold lesser numbers of the labor force in  educational institutions, that they will be in the labor force     May I ask a question?  What do you observe in the market that  suggests that a change in the discount rate did promote the downward movement in the federal  funds rate?     I was just asking for a bit of elaboration on the observation that the  change in discount rate played a role in the downward move on the federal funds rate     Well, I guess I was really wondering [unintelligible] essentially  conversation, comments?     Thank you     Well, Mr Chairman, I am in substantial agreement with what you  said, although I believe I am in substantial agreement in some respect with what Governor  Coldwell has proposed  A key part of the two proposals seems to me to [have] just a hairline  difference  I understood the Manager to respond to a question [by saying] that market rates  would likely come up a little if we stand right where we are  I think that would be an  unfortunate development in current circumstances and that we should undertake to move just  enough to preclude that from happening  And therefore my preference would be for a federal  funds rate in the 4 to 5 percent range with a midpoint just a hair below where are now     I’m also interested in the Manager’s comment that the announcement of a small change in  the discount rate, even though essentially a technical adjustment, had some modest effect in the  market  And it seems to me that the circumstances surrounding that change in rate are     12/20-21/76 - 65 -         essentially the same or possibly even a little more persuasive now--the technical aspects are, at  least--than when the change was made, and I think it would be appropriate to make another small  change in the discount rate     We are seeing the banks very reluctantly give ground both on rates charged and rates paid   And it seems to me desirable that [their] slow move be encouraged and continued  In any event,  it seems to me that it would be undesirable to [discourage them from] moving a little further in  both those respects  That, along with the fact that we’re looking at the possibility of fairly small  growth in the aggregates, at least temporarily, leads me to the conclusion that we should make  just a little further move in the federal funds rate, and probably the discount rate, in the interest  of ensuring that we don’t get some upward movement in the market rate     I would ask Lyle, would he care to express a view as to whether a  larger increase in wage rates would likely be restrictive or expansionary as far as economic  activity is concerned--regarding total employment and production?  As to larger than what, well,  larger than otherwise  Or if there was some way of reducing the increase in hourly wage rates  that apparently will be coming along--as to whether that will be an expansionary or  contractionary economic input?     I assume that you have noted that the oil companies have apparently  negotiated contracts with a 9 percent increase for the first year and apparently--     --and apparently this will be kind of a pattern for that industry   Whether it will extend into other industries, I wouldn’t know     Mr Chairman, I’ve wondered how we’re going to handle this  situation in the environment that we apparently will be in, and I hadn’t been as resourceful as  you have been in terms of how it might be handled, because I had tended to think in terms of  some change in the top instead of the bottom of the ranges  I’m prepared to support your  proposal  It seems to me it’s probably about as optimal a suggestion as could be, of the  proposals that could be put together, given the prospective environment that we’re going to be  in  I would go with you     Mr Chairman     I would find your recommendation acceptable, but with a preference  for the 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 federal funds rate  And I guess I didn’t hear you mention a preference on  the directive, but my preference would be for the aggregates directive  I was a little confused  with Governor Partee’s saving up theory, but the ensuing discussion I guess has kind of clarified  that really what this means is that you’d be a little more inclined to let rates go up now than if  you didn’t see that coming  Is that the context that you--     That’s about the only context in which I could hang it together     Mr Chairman, a number of somewhat disconnected comments  First  off, it seems to me that a reading of the Redbook this time [was] rather interesting   Notwithstanding the great number of very unusual and generally adverse developments around  the country, [in] almost every district there is a very strong flavor of optimism in the report and  also a very strong flavor of adaptability and adjustability of the local economy to unusual  developments  It seems to me that [is] there to an unusual degree this time     With respect to the inventory question which Mr Black has raised  At our recent directors  meeting,--where we had two retailers represented, one nationwide and one regional--this  question was discussed, and they were of the view that retailers will not make the mistake this  time that they feel they made a year ago, in which they had to, as they feel, sell excessive  inventories at substantial price reductions  The question was raised as to whether they might  make the opposite mistake this time, and they seem not to be concerned about that     We’re in a very strong economic environment in the Southwest,  which of course traces largely to the oil and gas business and, I suppose, in part to weather   There were reports from all members of our board of directors, who have had a wide range of  contacts during the past month, that they can recall no time when they have had so many  inquiries about industrial sites in that part of the country  And they are anticipating that the trend  to move to that part of the country is going to substantially accelerate  And it’s a rather  substantial trend at the present time  You know, it’s possible that this is simply weather talk, in  view of the fact of the recency of the weather phenomenon  But there is a feeling that there is a  good deal of substance to it     Notwithstanding the fact that it’s a prosperous area, it is a capital deficit area, and we had  reports that there is a continuing improvement in the availability, and continuing improvement in  the sense of more favorable terms, on funds to flow into the area  This is more obvious, of  course, in the construction and real estate development area  It is reported from some  individuals in the area who deal largely with small companies that the same thing is reflected in  that they can now place stock privately in small companies in a much more effective way than  they have been able to do in the past year or two     With respect to the outlook for the prime rate on business loans, we had a variety of views  expressed, but the one banker who has been closest to the mark during the past two years very  interestingly expressed the view that the next move is more likely to be down than up  That is all  I have     Because the loan demand is not that strong, and the availability of  funds is continuing to improve     Mr Chairman, could I ask Governor Coldwell if he could elaborate  just a little on what he thinks it is?  I think margin, in terms of the usual cyclical aspects, in  which there is a little pressure on capacity, a little pressure on inventory     I would think that alternative B would probably serve our needs for  the next month, with a monetary directive as the aggregates directive and understanding that, if  we go to the top of the aggregates, we would go to the top of the funds range as well      Mr Chairman, I have heard some rumblings in recent weeks as  people apparently are beginning to discover that, with the change in tax laws, they cannot use  certain benefits under drilling and exploratory work as offsets against other income to the extent  that they could previously  This is generally described as, in effect, a 15 percent increase in  income tax  The data on drilling activities, however, indicate a continued and rising level of  activity  Unfortunately the production figures don’t indicate the turnaround in the trend there,  however     One other thing that’s been reported recently is a McGraw-Hill report on plans for  investment in new manufacturing capacity extending over the next three years, and those figures  show a rather spectacular prospect for Texas, with a total which exceeds the sum of the next five  states in line--that is, with Texas having the largest amount and exceeding the sum of the next  five     For new manufacturing capacity  I would assume there is no reason  for expecting those to be realized, but they do indicate what present thinking and intentions are     And then it occurred to me that, just to avoid the impression that Texas is a one-industry or  one activity-center state, I possibly should report that their 18th annual rattlesnake hunt was  carried off successfully last weekend in the Sweetwater area, and this weekend in a community  called Luckenbach, with a population of three, that they will celebrate the annual return of the  mud daubers  You ask, Mr Chairman, “What’s a mud dauber?”  A mud dauber is described as a  Texas-size, wasp-like insect that makes it’s nest out of mud and does an awful lot of buzzing   But you don’t have those in New England     Mr Chairman, I am in agreement with what you have suggested  I  have to admit I had jotted down 4 to 8 for a range on M1, as compared to 4-1/2 to 8-1/2, but  obviously that’s a very small difference  I see no need to change the range on the federal funds  at this time  I am sympathetic, however, to Mr Eastburn’s suggestion that it might be  appropriate to widen the inside of the range somewhat  Generally speaking, it seems to me it’s a  period for standing pat  With respect to the form of the directive, I’d be inclined to favor the  aggregates directive rather than money market conditions     Mr Chairman, I guess I’m finding it rather interesting and somewhat  puzzling that the [unintelligible] items are still being made in support of the fiscal stimulus goal   It’s fairly common, I think, for Administration spokesmen to suggest that real GNP growth rate  would be affected possibly by as much as 1-1/2 or 2 percentage points if the program were not  put in place  It seems to me that we are [calculating] here that the effects of withdrawing would  be substantially less than that     The employment figures on the states in the Southwest, and I  suppose in other states also, have recently been revised, and these revisions are shockingly large   For example, in the period from February 1975 through November 1976--and November 1976  was the last [period] in which the old series was available--in Texas, the old series showed a total  increase in employment of 23 percent, and the new series showed an increase of 91  For New  Mexico, the old series showed an increase of 65, and the new series 135 percent  For  Oklahoma, 32 and 53; and for Louisiana, 17 and 80  Now when we inquire of the state offices  from which these data flow, we seem to get a little less than a completely satisfactory  explanation  One of the reasons, of course, is that the sampling process does not adequately pick  up and record the effects of new firms being established  But they do not attribute all or even the  main part of these changes to that  These increases compare with about 5 percent for the US  during the same period     For the US?  I don’t have that; I am not sure     I guess it occurred to me that, assuming they are, in fact, errors, I  guess it leaves a question whether the pre-revised or the current series gives you the greatest  confidence  Presumably, if there has not been much change in the national figures, there must be  somewhat similar offsetting adjustments elsewhere, and it does tend to raise the question as to  the confidence in the national figures  I guess these are based on establishment payrolls  So it  shouldn’t be a matter of wrong numbers but of firms covered  But the coverage of firms should  be the important question     With respect to what retailers are expecting from the change in the fiscal package, for  whatever it’s worth, at a recent meeting of our board of directors, where we have a representative  of the national retailing firms as well as local, they seemed to be in agreement that the  expectation is for about 1-1/2 percentage points in the year-to-year percentage change in the  second and third quarters and might be attributable to a change in the fiscal package  And they  are not talking in particularly bullish terms, although the percentage change figures that they  seem to be expecting appear to me to be fairly significant  They tended to be around the 10  percent level, which is roughly consistent with what we’re seeing in the consumer spending  change--a reflection of the reports from a number of the Districts in the Redbook of the  tightening up of credit conditions in the agricultural areas  We see [it] in the Eleventh District  also, and we’re told that the US Department of Agriculture is in the field with a quick survey as  of April 11 to try to get a better picture of that situation, which would seem to be in the context  [of] anticipating some additional federal program in support of agriculture     I think that’s about all I have to mention  There is still an  unenthusiastic expectation on the part of large banks in Dallas, in particular with respect to the  prospects for business loans  They apparently are having real difficulty rounding up business  loans, and they don’t see the situation improving  And this notwithstanding the fact that loan-to-     4/19/77 - 12 -           deposit ratios are rising at the smaller banks around the District  And they seem to have quite an  active demand     Their expectations were not very bullish for a period of months  So I  think very little, in this particular instance  Now the Houston situation is a little different     Mr Chairman, if I might just add one gratuitous comment here  In  granting that the recent severe drought situation does not reach into the Eleventh District in any  significant way at this point in time, it seems to me that this agricultural situation is one which  can easily be exaggerated and could easily touch off governmental actions which would be  difficult to withdraw from rapidly when they should be withdrawn     I’m trying to say, I think it deserves being played down a bit, rather  than up     4/19/77 - 15 -             Mr Chairman, just a couple of additional observations  There had  been a substantial interest in the seasonal loan programming in our District, but we only have  one borrower at the present time, and it’s this rate situation, where if you get funds at a cheaper  price than elsewhere, you’ll use them  With respect to the liberalization of the program, there  were a couple of small changes in the program fairly recently, about a year ago, which made it  easier to administer and, we believe, made it somewhat more attractive to the bank     Mr Chairman, I guess it seemed to me that, in the review of Mr  Broida’s document, it is essentially a report card, [and] he gives us, at best, about a “C” in terms  of what we might characterize as classroom performance  But the document does not grade us     4/19/77 - 36 -           on what we might call our lab performance, where you observe the results of the experiment, and  there it seems to me at the present time the grade would come in a little better     But we now seem to be looking into a situation where that lab grade, at least on the  inflation side, may start slipping back  And I reconciled myself, I think pretty much because of  what I judged to be the politics of the situation, to a stand-still posture during a couple months of  high uncertainty with the fiscal stimulus program coming in  [But] it seems to me that, with that  big uncertainty set aside, we should be moving a little further to try to improve the classroom  performance  And I come out with the prescription that Governor Wallich came out with, which  I believe, Mr Chairman, is the same as yours except a small move on the bottom of the M1  range as well     I haven’t been to either Minneapolis or New York, but I’ll have to  admit I come out at the same place, which means concurring with your recommendation on the  federal funds rate, but essentially alternative C for the aggregates ranges     4/19/77 - 46 -             Mr Chairman, we have no areas of significant difference with the  staff’s projection  It seems a good a characterization of prospects to me  And I guess it probably  comes as no surprise that the President’s energy program was received with a good deal of  wailing and gnashing of teeth in the Southwest  But that notwithstanding, the onshore drilling  activity is moving forward very well  There is literally no idle equipment around, but not enough  demand pressure [to drive] up prices yet, at least  But probably the most encouraging element is  that contracts are beginning to work down the idle capacity in offshore drilling rigs, where there  has been, and still is, a substantial amount of idle capacity     It seems to me that an area of possible concern are the indications of renewed speculation  in real estate  I would  be interested in anything John Balles might have to report on what I read  about what’s going on in California  It seems to me I see just mild indications of that sort of  thing going on in some of the Southwest centers, both with respect to residential properties and  with respect to farm and ranch lands  And it almost seems to have some of the flavor of people  having concluded that money is going to continue to decline in value at a fairly rapid rate  They  might just as well get into a margin situation in real estate so long as credit’s available     And thus far, I have seen no indication that the prospect of increases in the cost of fuel are  having a locational effect with respect to the areas in which this speculative interest is beginning  to appear  That’s all I have to say     It’s not evident to the farmers yet     Mr Chairman, as mentioned earlier, it seems to me I see indications  of a spreading speculative inclination in the economy, and while competitive efforts of extenders  of credit to put out funds probably don’t guarantee speculation--       It seems to me that the competitive efforts of lenders to put out funds  don’t guarantee speculation, but they do nevertheless provide an environment in which it can be     5/17/77 - 34 -           continued and spread  And so it seems to me that we’re at a point where we should be pretty  sure we don’t add further to liquidity in the economy and [therefore we should] possibly tighten  up just a little  It’s in that context that your specification has great appeal to me  It seems to me  that it just does the job about right--starting with the present market rate on fed funds and with  the intention not to move below that, and if we see the substantial growth rate in either M1 or M2  move up from that level  And it seems to me that’s appropriate     I would make one other kind of gratuitous observation, and that is, with the proposed well- head tax on petroleum products, that it would be appropriate to start [feeding] into the  conversation at the Washington level, if possible, that those funds, if collected, not be collected  [to] be fed back into the economy into the hands of petroleum users but rather be funds used  either for the purpose of reducing the federal deficit or for being available for some kind of  reduction in tax rates  And the experience with respect to the $50 rebate just might have set the  stage for some such operation being effective also      Mr Chairman, I guess I feel obliged to report that in the Southwest  we do continue to see a strong and growing demand for most everything, and the list of  activities-- that is, types of labor that are in short supply--is growing  And we’re seeing  indications, of course, of a rather rapid rise in wage rates, in part related thereto, but it’s probably  not a dominant factor in the rise in wage rates  We’ve also had reports on two recent occasions  of shortages of transportation, particularly trucks  A couple of months back, there were reports  of fairly serious shortages of capacity to move sizable equipment and also cement  And recently  there were reports of significant shortages of trucks to move produce      Produce  Specifically, a lot of melons apparently being permitted to  spoil in the fields because transportation could not be acquired to move them out to market  And  it’s reported, largely as a suspicion or an assertion rather than a fact, that there’s been some lack  of interest shown by the so-called independent trucker because of increased regulations,  licensing, taxes, that sort of thing       Well, not so much expanding, but even coming in, in the usual  volume, into this area to move these products at this point in time  I don’t have more on that   I’ve undertaken to learn more about just what’s involved  It appears to be a fact that the produce  has been permitted to spoil in the field in substantial volume and apparently for this reason--at  least they have not cited as an additional reason, thus far, an inability to acquire the labor to  harvest the product  Now, of course, in the labor force in that area there is a presumed  substantial elasticity of supply of illegal labor  And there have been indications of substantial  mobility of labor, particularly skilled labor, into the area     With respect to energy, we hear all of the conversation about the uncertainty, and lack of  program, and lack of specific goals and objectives which have been reported here  But even in  the face of that, all of the available rigs for drilling on land are in use, and the lease rates are  rising  The time lag to get a rig is lengthening--just to get on a list of a driller to drill  And here  again, you get into an area where it’s not reported as fact, not talked about openly, but there is a  pretty generally accepted view that quite a bit of this drilling is being done for purposes of  proving up supplies to be offered in the market at a later time, as compared with bringing [them]  into the market immediately  Here, of course, is reflected in a meaningful sense some of the  uncertainty as to the price [or] prospects for those products       6/21/77 - 15 -         We continue to see announcements of sizable commercial construction projects in the  major cities in the area  And it’s interesting that a fair number of these are being announced for  downtown       I’m speaking primarily of office building structures, but also multi- unit residential and hotel     There is some of it  Largely in the petrochemicals area  And that  tends to be concentrated in a fairly small geographic area down along the coast  Aside from that,  both indicated in the figures and just from observation as one travels around, it seems to be large  numbers of fairly small developments, largely in suburban areas around the larger cities     With respect to the pessimism, and it would seem unusual I guess, to find any of it in that  kind of a general environment, but there is a good deal of pessimistic talk, and it seems to me  that it traces both to the uncertainty of the application of regulations flowing from legislation  that’s already on the books as well as uncertainty as to prospective future legislation  The  regulations flowing from legislation already on the books has greatly lengthened the  developmental time or gestation time for bringing projects into being, into completion  And that,  it seems to me, is a matter which is irritating businessmen as well as the bankers who finance  businesses     With respect to the general economic outlook, I guess the sector of it that interests me  most, and in which I maybe feel less certain than other aspects, is this prospect for capital  investment  And I don’t have anything to add to the conversation that’s taken place here  But it  would seem to me that there is a very heavy dependence upon what develops there, as to just  what the pace of progress from here will be over the next year or two  That’s all I have, Mr  Chairman     The survey results are not particularly encouraging, either     I say, the survey results are somewhat in the same direction, are they  not?     I get the feeling that we are once again gradually building a  procyclical record of monetary policy  Granting the great uncertainty of the numbers--as we  attempt to peer a few weeks ahead, it seems this moves me into the direction of those who have  suggested a little firming, or at least posturing for some possible firming  And I find myself in a  position of substantial indifference as to whether that be done by raising the bottom or the top of  the funds range and riding with the aggregates shown in alternative B, or standing with the  present fund range and adopting the aggregates in C     My preference would be to ride with the aggregates in B and raise the ceiling a little for  the top end of the range on the federal funds rate  With respect to the form of the directive, it  seems to me the probability still is [that it is] desirable to ride with the aggregates rather than the  money market conditions directive       Mr Chairman, on that point, it is observed in the report that the  operation in the aggregate is a bit on the profitable side  What is the source of the earnings at  present?       What is the nature of the earnings on the foreign balances?     An assumed income?       Mr Chairman, a question with respect to the inventory data  You  have the impression that these data attempt to take into account the continuing shift of business  firms to the so-called LIFO method  Or [do] they just kind of pass that by and [are] based  largely on inventory estimates at current market prices?     I’m sorry, I can’t hear you     But if the attempt is to deflate the inventory, then we could be  looking at a series of inventory-sales ratios which do not adequately reflect the volume of goods  and inventory in relation to the volume of sales being valued at current prices  And I am  wondering whether there is a possibility that we’ve got more goods in inventory than either the  inventory figures or the inventory-sales ratios suggest     Well, I understand that [the] Commerce [Department] does go  through a process in which they attempt to neutralize the effects of the shifting proportion of  firms that are on LIFO  But I guess it seems to me the meaningful inventory ratio to be looking  at would be a ratio between inventories valued at market prices and sales, in view of the fact that  sales are always reported at current prices     Just by way of comment, I thought it was interesting that in the  Redbook this time there was reported quite a variety of views of businessmen--how businessmen  view the inventory situation  And in that connection I would like to mention that the retailers  represented on our board of directors--this was not in our contribution to the Redbook--have a  very bearish view, I would say, of the inventory-sales situation in general-merchandise retail     Meaning that inventories currently are relatively high compared to  sales  They are not optimistic on sales, and they observe a continuing high flow of new orders   And those who are in the manufacturing business, as well as retailing business, reported that they  see this continued high flow of new orders to the manufacturing part of their business, whereas  in the retailing part of their business, they feel that they are getting--     7/19/77 - 19 -       The placement of orders to the manufacturer     For--     Yes     Well, this is their concern  What they are seeing is the orders from  the industry flowing to the manufacturing part of their respective businesses and they report that  they are in a situation again where the managements of the retail establishments are finding it  difficult to hold down the placement of orders from their buyers  And they are concerned that  the buyers are setting the stage for a significant inventory problem later in the year     That’s all, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, it seems my views are rather out of step with the  group today  I’m rather impressed with the statement on page 6 in the Bluebook     I’m impressed that the staff concluded at page 6 in the Bluebook that  alternative D maintains the picture that we’ve had thus far this year, in terms of long-term  targets  And it seems to me that we do have a significant problem of base drift confronting us  It  seems to me that that’s likely to be perceived as a problem in the public arena  And it leads us to  that spot characterized as caught between a rock and a hard place in undertaking to convey what  our policy purpose or objective is at the present time  And if we adopt a set of numbers which  are essentially unchanged from what we have, that is, the present numbers--and it seems to me  we must acknowledge that our base gives us an escalation in the growth rate path of about 3/4  percent--that we are subject to the charge, and will be charged, that we have a policy of drift  In  other words, if we just go along with the current--whatever the current happens to be--I see that  [charge] as difficult to counter  I can well [anticipate] that, if we were to announce a set of  numbers such as are presented in alternative D, [then] what I would call our first-tier critics will  charge that we are making a significant tightening of policy  And it will be hard to explain that  away in terms of the base drift     On balance, however, I would rather attempt that explanation than a rationalization that,  notwithstanding the higher second-quarter base, we have adopted a policy of essentially no  change, and that’s reflected in a set of numbers which are essentially unchanged  It seems to me  that it would be easier to try to get across the idea that the shift in the base is affecting the  numbers, and while the numbers change, policy is not changed  So my preference actually  would be for a base which moved along the midpoint of the line of the prior announced path  each quarter, which would get away from the fictitious change in numbers  But this may not be  the time that we want to make that particular change  So this leads me to a posture of suggesting  something close to alternative D, notwithstanding--     D  The last one  The one which the staff characterizes as continuing  the current policy posture     I would find your suggestions on the aggregates quite satisfactory,  but on the fed funds, I’d be inclined to the 5 to 6 range     [In] appendix III, page 2, in the Bluebook, [there is a] reference to  the computation of the bank credit measures and [a] suggestion at the very bottom of the page  that the staff could develop a monthly average series for the components of that measure as well,  if desired  I assume the reference here is simply to the broad break between loans and  investments, rather than the detailed loan rate?     It would seem to me that it might be helpful, with the bank credit  measure being brought into the picture, that we have at least some of the broad categories     Taken care of as far as I’m concerned     Mr Chairman, I hesitate to generalize from one of the strong areas of  the country, but all the indications we see, of course, are suggestive of a continued, rather heavy  flow of funds into new investment and continued expansion in activity  And even our retail  firms represented on the board--we have three of them at the present time--who had been  speaking rather bearishly about a month ago, have recently felt obliged to acknowledge that  things have developed much better than they had expected during the past month and that they  are now viewing the future with a little more optimism     We are seeing some commitments for large projects, and, of course, they are all energy  oriented  We are also seeing indications that present capacity, in chemicals based on petroleum  and natural gas products, particularly, is coming under pressure  And it has seemed to me that  the sort of thing that’s showing up in Cleveland is likely to show up in center after center around  the country   But at a minimum, the staff projection will probably pretty well characterize what  develops  I would think, in so far as it may prove to be wide of the mark, it’s likely to be low  rather than high, both in terms of the dollar measures and the deflated measures of economic  activity  I would think that managements will find that a fair amount of their existing plant may  have been obsolete prematurely, in part as a result of the much more expensive fuel prices  And  I think it quite understandable that that could be a disconcerting thing in terms of the timing of a  decision to make additional investment  But, on balance, it seems to me that it’s going to call for  more investment than otherwise would take place and that we will see this coming along     Now having said all this, there is the further disconcerting aspect of the picture as you look  around and see the management of a fair number of firms apparently concluding that the most  profitable investment available to them is buying up their own shares  That, it seems to me, you  have to weigh on the negative side of the balance sheet when you’re trying to arrive at a  judgment as to how businessmen are looking at the future  My inclination would be--and I’m  repeating--to feel, overall, the staff projection is a good one, but insofar as it proves wide of the  mark, it will probably be on the low side rather than the high side     I had a little difficulty on a specific item  And this is certainly a small detail--the rather  large swing they show in private final purchases from fourth quarter this year to first quarter next  year and then back to the second quarter  This apparently is heavily weighted with an expected  swing in inventories  The basis of that particular aspect of the projection, I don’t comprehend     Thank you     Why should indexing have a negative effect on the overall level of  stock prices?  That’s what they’re saying     If I was to take $10 out of one and put it into something else, why  should that change the level of the market?     8/16/77 - 18 -             Mr Chairman, [this is a] rather detailed [point], I guess--I noticed in  the recent report of weekly reporting banks that deposits of foreign banks in US banks are up  about $16 billion, $17 billion from a year ago  Now, is it correct that those deposits run into the  money stock numbers?     And is there any basis for expecting that kind of growth in that type  of deposit to continue, or that what we have seen in the past year is a temporary phenomenon?     Mr Chairman, I think it’s already been mentioned that we have been  in the process of writing a record of monetary policy which will be described as having been  procyclical and that we do need to be moderating that as rapidly as possible  There was also a  fair amount of conversation this morning about the lack of optimism or confidence on the part of  businessmen  I think the process of moderating the rapid growth in monetary [aggregates] will  tend to shore up and reinforce the confidence of businessmen in the economic situation     With respect to monetary policy prescription, I have usually felt constrained from picking  one measure from one alternative and another from another alternative in the staff’s  representations, but today I don’t feel so constrained  So I’d be inclined to take the federal funds  rate from alternative B and the aggregate measures from alternative C  I’d be inclined not to     8/16/77 - 40 -           widen the ranges of either the aggregates or the federal funds rate  It seems to me that that  would move us in the direction we want to go, although I would not have a serious objection to a  lowering of the minimum in the two aggregates     With respect to the discount rate, I’ve begun to see just within the past week some  borrowing for--pretty clearly--rate purposes by banks who normally would get their funds from  the money market  So my inclination would be, within this monetary prescription, probably to  stick to the 6 percent funds rate for a week or two, and at that point then--I’m thinking about two  weeks--it would be desirable to move the discount rate up by a 1/2 point  This would kind of  separate the discount rate from a policy move and make it a move in response to market  conditions  I think the 6 percent funds rate will in another week or so have come through clearly  as a policy move, and that will have been settled  I would not be averse to seeing the discount  rate move, say, in one week, but it seems to me it would be a little better if we had two weeks’  experience behind us with a 6 percent funds rate  That’s all I have, Mr Chairman     But we never follow a consistent pattern     Mr Chairman, as to the characterization of the economy, I don’t  have any basis for differing with what’s been said  I thought I might just add a comment with  respect to oil and gas activities, however  [They] continue to pick up and seem to be at about a  practical capacity rate  Shortages of work crews in some areas and shortages of equipment [are]  both putting upward price and cost pressures on those aspects of the picture     Essentially, development of known deposits  And this is mostly low-  grade stuff, in the sense that it’s areas which [have] been tapped previously but [were] not  economic to develop or exploit at the preexisting prices  And now they’re going through the  drilling wherever they have a reason to believe that, with the higher prices, they can more than  cover their cost  And this is undoubtedly an important reason why, with the high level of drilling  activity, we still see the figures on production and approved reserves drifting downward     It’s interesting that not only are the land-drilling rigs fully utilized, but there’s been a sharp  pickup in the use of rigs for off-shore exploration, even including those designed for deepwater  drilling  There has been an increase in the total number of these available as a result of  previously placed orders, [but] still, the number of idle rigs has dropped to a fairly small level at  the present time  There is an experiment going on off the coast of Texas to adapt one of the  deepwater rigs to use in shallow water, and it appears that that’s going to work out successfully   And there is a report from firms in the District that manufacture drilling rigs that they are getting  an increase in inflow of new orders, and they expect that activity to rise     During the past week, I have come across--true, a fairly limited number, but still--several  specific examples of individuals speculating in new houses  They acquire title to anywhere from  three to six new houses, with the prospect of occupying only one or two themselves and the  others being held for resale     A matter of maybe not direct relevance to our consideration here, but it seems to be rather  interesting--in a visit to a southwest Texas ranch area in recent days, I discovered for the first  time the intensity of the feeling on the part of ranchers as to the activities of people to protect  wildlife  This has resulted in such a buildup in the coyote and eagle population that it has gotten     9/20/77 - 3 -   to a point where it determines whether they can afford to use cattle or sheep to harvest grass   I’m advised that, at the present price relationships, they could realize more in many areas [by]  using sheep to harvest the sparse growth of grass, but because of the greater exposure to the  predators, they have to go with the secondary use, namely cattle     On the inflow of Mexicans, it’s reported, as it has been elsewhere, that there has been a  substantial pickup following the President’s announced program  And I don’t pick up any  indication of any consensus of view as to what a workable solution to that problem might be--a  great variety of views     Mr Chairman, if I might just make a brief comment on this real  estate situation  It seems to me that what we have going here in both the residential and the farm  real estate picture is something more or less comparable to an inventory situation in the business  sector  And when it’s building up, it’s a strong stimulative element, and it seems to me [to be]  what we had in both these real estate markets in the last couple of years  And I think it’s still  expanding in the residential sector but probably getting ready to top out in the farm sector       9/20/77 - 12 -   But so long as people expect that those prices are going to keep going up at a faster rate  than it costs to carry, your demand for the property rises, and we see it in the farm real estate  market and we see it in the multiple holdings of new houses, both completed and in process   Somewhere along the way, presumably, there is going to be a diminished number of people who  want to be in the situation, and at that point, the supply relative to demand in the market is going  to shift, and presumably you will get a topping out of the rising price, or maybe even a decline   And I don’t think it’s possible to predict the length of run of that sort of development     I would hope, Mr Chairman, if there’s a serious consideration given  to recommending alternatives, that addressing ourselves to market structure be on the list as a  possible alternative to an incomes policy     You lifted that slightly out of context too, didn’t you, Mr Chairman?     9/20/77 - 25 -     You lifted that praise slightly out of context, too, didn’t you?     Mr Chairman--I’m sorry--     It’ll be very brief  It’s in a sense belaboring the obvious to remind us  all that the record we are building continues to look more and more procyclical, and also I guess  to remind us that historically this has tended to move us into a position which resulted in a  development which has come to be labeled a crunch  And it seems to me also that his has been  going on long enough now so that--even though we can’t point to the specific elements in the  real sector which would explain this development--we can’t really call it a random development  and have a fairly firm basis for expecting that it’s going to reverse itself     As to the general economic situation, I’m inclined to think that, insofar as the staff  projection might be off mark, it will be off mark on the low side rather than the high side  And  this is in part because of what we are seeing develop in the fiscal area and also what has already  developed in the monetary area and indications that we do have substantial liquidity in the  economy  It seems to me, Mr Chairman, that your suggestion has done a real good job pulling  these diverse elements together, and I would not suggest any change at all from your proposal,  with the exception that I think you suggested we start from our present posture--6-1/8, more or  less--as a midpoint of the 6 to 6-1/2 range, and I would share the view of those who think we  should take the bona fide midpoint of 6-1/4 and move to that posture rather promptly  That’s all  I have to say     I had reports with respect to the Houston market that, I think going  back a month or two, insurance companies were a source or an outlet for single-family  residential mortgages from that market  Another point I was going to make, Mr Winn has just  made--that there are significant markets in which the supply of labor is a significant limiting  factor on the rate at which residential structures are going up  And this one, I hesitate to mention  because I haven’t checked it out, but we picked up a few comments at the end of last week that     10/17-18/77 - 12 -         the mortgage rate in the Dallas market was having a little difficulty being maintained  Just a  little whisper of softness coming into the rate     [Some of] our directors are in the retail business, and we happen to  have a rather broad representation there at the present time  General merchandise retailing   They’ve been inclined to feel that the strength of the auto market has had a negative effect on  their sales during this past year  And so they in fact are looking forward with some optimism to  a leveling or some moderate weakening of the demand for automobiles, and this shows through  in their projections and plans for next spring  They talk largely in terms of next spring  So  they’re talking in terms of about a 5-1/2 percent increase in sales in real terms, and this is general  merchandise     In the consumer credit side of the picture, the question is raised--I can’t say they’re  forecasting it--as to whether, with the strong rise in housing starts, we may not have a strong  surge in credit demand for furniture and other household durables  And so total consumer credit  might not slow down even if we do get some slowing in the automobile sector  In fact, it seems  to me that, as one looks at the prospects for wages and employment, unless there is to be a  substantial rise in the consumer saving rate, that we [are almost assured of having a] pretty  strong consumer expenditure picture ahead of us for next year  This doesn’t necessarily lead  anywhere, Mr Chairman     This raises a related question, if I might inject, Mr Chairman, as to  whether we are anticipating anything unusual in terms of labor strife  It seems to me that that  could be a factor in the picture  We have a substantial strike going on in Houston at the present  time, where the union has unequivocally rejected a 40 percent proposed increase over three years  [as] being inadequate     Hughes Tool employees, Hughes Tool Company     Mr Chairman, can I address a question to Peter and possibly also  Scott?  Do you see any rather direct or more or less mechanical relationship between the  accelerated growth in holding domestic balances and what has just been described with respect  to the pressures on the dollar internationally?     I was thinking of the money stock     Mr Chairman, I don’t know whether it’s because I hold a little more  optimistic view of the general business climate than some that have been expressed around here  and whether I am possibly more impressed than some with the tremendous surge in the growth  of these aggregates in recent months  But I was inclined to move toward alternative D as listed  in the [Blue]book and to take into consideration the rate of growth that we’ve had in these  aggregates recently or, as an alternative to that, just a reduction of, say, about 1/2 to 1 percent in     10/17-18/77 - 45 -         all of the measures of the current range, which comes very close to your preferred suggestion,  Governor, but differs in some respects     I may say that, on Saturday and Sunday before coming down here, in view of the fact that  the American Bankers [Association] is meeting in the 11th District, I went to Houston and  wandered around there and visited with bankers from all around the country, and first thing  raised in the conversation was, are you fellows going to do your job or are you going to throw in  the towel  Everyone seemed to be fully aware of the difficulty of the problems confronting us,  and with only two exceptions, everyone that I talked to seemed to be concerned that we would  not give some indication that we will resist what they see as an indication of an accelerated  inflationary development  So I would think it’s quite important that our records show and that  your testimony show some reduction in these growth rates, and it seems to me it would be  desirable to give some acknowledgement to the higher base from which the growth rate targets  are postulated  So as a minimum, I would hope that the Committee would come out along the  line of your suggestion, and I personally would feel better if it came out with a somewhat lower  growth rate than your suggestion     Mr Chairman, it’s been very difficult for me to visualize  circumstances in which I would favor a money market directive  But it seems to me the unusual  combination of circumstances has arrived  It seems to me that what might be a feasible,  workable arrangement at this time would be a funds rate with a midpoint of 6-3/4; and I don’t  feel too strongly about the range  But with the idea that between now and this [next] meeting,  unless something unexpected develops, we’d gradually move to that new midpoint  If you’ve  got to put some numbers on them, I’d take those from alternative B  But I think the key thing  would be the fed funds rate     Mr Chairman, a question to Mr O’Connell  I, of course read the  court’s statement strictly as a layman, but it seems to me they have said, if you want relief, it  must be through the legislative channel  I found no reference there to the appeal process  They  apparently felt they were rendering a final judgment on an interpretation of present law  Why  does not their suggestion to us, that if we want to seek relief that it be through the legislative  channel--     Well, why does not that [suggestion by the court] open to us an  avenue of request to [the court] and give us adequate time to pursue the legislative process as  compared with the time which apparently is built into the legal proceedings, if we choose to go  through the legal appeal process and question their legal judgment?     But it is a foregone conclusion that they will blindly follow rules and  not consider other things     Mr Chairman, I substantially agree with the staff figures  I wouldn’t  offer any specific amendments in them  I would repeat what I said earlier; in so far as they may  prove to be wide of the mark, my guess is that they will be low rather than high  It seems to me  that I continue to see indications of some building strength in the economy and prospects for  further out--for it showing up more generally     With respect to the loan-deposit [ratio] situation, that’s been referred to in the country  banks  We see that situation also in the Southwest, but even in the Southwest, which I think  could be characterized as a very strong part of the economy geographically, the banks in the  larger centers still feel that they are overly liquid and that, unless they see a strengthening in  business loan demand, that even against their better judgment they will be gradually moving to  lengthen their investment portfolios That, it seems to me, suggests that the aggressive shopping  for loans, the giving of more favorable terms in addition to just lower discounting from the prime  rate, is going to continue, and it seems to me that that’s a supportive element in the prospects for  the economy       11/15/77 - 25 -         With respect to the commercial type of construction activity, there are reports of heavy  inflows of foreign funds into these projects, again on favorable terms relative to terms on which  domestic money is available  And I have also had reports from [real estate agents] that they  cannot fill all the orders that are available to them for purchases of existing commercial  properties, both office buildings and department [store] type buildings  And I’m advised that  this is gradually seeping into the picture elsewhere in the country     Well, I am speaking primarily about the Southwest, but I am told by  some of the builders who are domiciled there, but who work countrywide and even  internationally, that this is gradually appearing elsewhere in the country as well  And I view that  as both a favorable situation, given our balance of payments picture, and also a supporting  element in our economy  I have the impression that there’s a good deal of life left in this  particular expansion that we’re in     Mr Chairman, possibly linked to this, although I’m not sure, a  conversation with some bankers, which I referred to earlier  They indicate that, as they’ve been  waiting for the expected rise in business demand for funds, they have, in an effort to utilize  funds, developed loans to financial institutions in substantial volume, in banks where they  normally would not be engaging in any significant way in that type of activity  Now, whether  one can move on from that, which I construe as being a partial explanation of the surge in  demand deposit balance, I don’t know     Mr Chairman, my inclination when I came here was to move for just  a slightly higher federal funds rate, in the interest of getting somewhat lower aggregates, but it’s  quite acceptable to me to use the other approach--lower the aggregates targets and use the  existing funds rate  It seems to me you’d come out at about the same place, so I’m prepared to  go with your recommendation  However, if the aggregates as stated in [alternative] B were to be  accepted as targets, then it seems to me that it would be desirable to raise the funds rate a little  bit along with that to be sure that you get some move     In this connection, I’d like to mention that it seems to me that, with just the beginning of a  suggestion of some movement of funds between different accounts in the banks in the time area,  it might be appropriate for us to consider lifting the [Regulation] Q ceilings a little bit so as to  not start dictating to the banks where those funds rest in the bank deposits  And it seems to me  that it would be better to make such a move before the rates come under significant pressure and  before you begin to see the rates structuring the market  And it seems to me that the results  would probably be salutary for the residential construction sector     Would you have an opportunity to present views to the Court of  Appeals relative to an effective date?     That’s right     Mr Chairman, I’d like to raise a possibly heretical question  But if it  were to develop with, say, a 1/2 point interest rate spread, most of the time we were operating  either at the floor or the ceiling, which seems to me a fair possibility  Now, really, a two-stage  question  One, would the Committee be inclined to feel a necessity to meet and reconsider its  position whenever we were at the floor or the ceiling?   And then, two, which picks up something the Chairman alluded to earlier--the very  different world we’ll be in, having announced our program, and then people conducting  operations based on our [announced] program rather than on what they think it is; when people  may feel that we, in effect, have a contract with them not to deviate from our program and  therefore feel taken anytime we do deviate from it  And this raises a time-frame question-- presumably the program is announced for the next month, but if we come in and make changes  in the interim, a lot of people may feel that they are caught off base     Well, now the heretical part  Insofar as there might be problems of  this type, might we avoid them by using our general phrase and a federal funds rate point, as  compared with a range, so that we would not have committed ourselves [on] how acceptable to  us [it would be] to have the results [be in terms of] a deviation from a point  I seem to detect a  flavor running through the discussion here, that if the data come in above or below the range that  we have specified, then we might have difficulties explaining ourselves  It seems to me that  [with] data coming in above or below a generalized point, say, consistent with the federal funds  rate of about 6-1/2 percent, and [our] not having declared how much deviation from that is  acceptable to us, [then] we might be in a better situation     12/19-20/77 - 30 -           But assume that our performance indicated that the phrase might  have a connotation at some points in time of a 1/4 percent deviation and other times might have a  connotation of a 1/2 percent deviation     I accept your observation, and yet I am not completely persuaded     I was simply going to raise a question as to whether the intervention  thus far was viewed exclusively in connection with moving against disorderly markets or  whether it was oriented to a projected time and possibly amount in which we would expect a  reversal of this depreciation of the dollar against key other currencies  But the succeeding  discussion has answered that to my satisfaction     Well, I was going to ask Mr Pardee  I inferred from the remarks that  it was strictly a disorderly markets’ attack       But the other aspect is that we’ve been doing this thus far without  any fairly firm time frame in mind as to when we might expect a reversal?     Mr Chairman, with the minimum wage--     With the minimum wage, isn’t it likely to increase even more?     Mr Chairman, with respect to the staff projection, I have no  particular quarrel with it  I’m still inclined to the view, and as I mentioned before, it may be a  reflection of the economic situation in our District, that the staff projection may well be on the  low side rather than the high side  And that’s notwithstanding the fact that it’s currently on the  high side of many other projections  But, it seems to me, there are some expansive elements in  the economy, and they are likely to stay with us through a good part of 1978     Two or three bits of information that I thought I would mention--they might be of interest  to the Committee  We are seeing very strong retail sales in the District, running on the order of  about 20 percent above a year ago  And sales tax revenues, for example, collected in the state in  October were 22 percent above a year-ago level, and that’s without a change in rates  And the  oil and gas drilling activity continues very strong, with all of the available equipment in use, and  with a stretch out in lead times on orders for new equipment, and with capacity to produce new  equipment being expanded  There is a continuing very tight labor situation in the areas where oil  and gas exploration takes place, with some significant difficulties in putting together crews and  moving ahead with the work     It’s what I hear reported in the real estate area that leads me, in part--in addition to that gas  and oil business--to [be] rather optimistic  Just an interesting fact--we see that real estate loans  in the Eleventh District banks in the first 11 months of this year [were] up 32 percent compared  to the first 11 months of last year  And one of our directors, who engages extensively in  construction activity all around the country [and] in other countries, reports concern of  sufficiently widespread activity in the office-structure [market] that he contemplates we will  have a surge in stuff brought onto the market within the next one to two years, which will again  put that [market] in a position of being substantially overbuilt, and [result in] a lot of unrented  space around  The major reason he gives for this is that he reports that insurance companies, [as  well as] some other builders and financiers, those who extend a permanent credit, are reducing  the requirements [imposed on] the developer  They are willing now to enter into firm  agreements to take out permanent credits for these prospective projects with a much lower  amount of firm rental agreements for tenants  He sees this pretty well all around the country, and  he suggests, of course, that the builders will build all that the lenders will finance, and that this is  almost a certainty     Pardon me?     He indicates that’s another facet of the thing on which he sees ground  being given  Now there’s a related development there in that part of the country, and I’m not in  a position to generalize elsewhere--a rather strong foreign demand for income-producing real  estate  And this foreign demand is bidding up the price relative to the current flow of income on  this type of real estate, and this is both multiunit residential and commercial, and even to a lesser  extent industrial  And, of course, there’s been some farm real estate in that picture as well  That  also provides some thrust, it seems to me, to real estate development, in a sense that people who  currently own this, being bought out and having liquid funds available, if they normally invest in  that kind of stuff they are probably going to turn to further investment in it  Those are some  things I thought might be of interest      It is interesting, I think, that in addition to the strong growth we had  in the larger metropolitan areas, that many of the companies coming to Texas are putting their  plants out in the smaller communities       Mr Chairman, your suggested modification of alternative B is  acceptable to me  I would like to see the Committee move to give the aggregates a little more  weight in policy than they’ve had for awhile now  And it seems to me that, at the present time, it  might be all right to do that by going with an aggregates directive  I’d just like to say that I have  a good deal of sympathy for the point that Mr Eastburn has raised  Right at the moment,  however, I’d be inclined to go with your recommendations     Mr Chairman, do you see some indication on the part of government of   a willingness to move to what you characterize as permanent corrective actions?  Or does the  problem have to get worse before [that will happen]?       Could I ask Mr Coldwell a question, Mr Chairman?      You made reference to the beginning of a recession  Are you talking in   terms of slowing growth or an actual decline?     1/17/78             18      But which presumably would move on into an actual decline?      Mr Chairman, on this point, it seems to me that it’s a better strategy to   move early on this sort of thing than it is to wait until it becomes a pressing issue and gets  widespread publicity and you get a general acceptance of a point of view and a general trend  started  Then it seems to me that it’s probably impossible to stem disintermediation  In any event,  it’s going to run a good deal further than it would have needed to run and have more impact on  housing starts and the plans and expectations of people in the housing market than if action were to  be taken fairly early and before it becomes a big hot political issue       Is there anything specific in the law with respect to the timing of the   appearances [of the Chairman before the Congressional Committees]?      I would say not to a minor degree  We have seen spectacular retail   sales for this [period]      I hear it referred to periodically!      Mr Chairman, just a couple of comments  I’m reasonably comfortable   with the staff projections in general terms  I thought I might report that on the plane coming in  from Dallas yesterday there were a number of Texas farmers, presumably coming to Washington to  demonstrate  We have had a fair amount of demonstrations going on in Texas  But we have just  summarized the January survey of agricultural lending in the District and it’s not possible to find in  those data any really bearish information  Now, it’s not positive; it’s not on the plus side  It is on  the negative side insofar as there are changes, with the exception of farm real estate values where  the survey reports, surprisingly enough, small increases between the fourth quarter of last year and  the January survey of this year  There’s some increase in the proportion of banks which say that  from their point of view their loans are higher than they would like them to be [given] their  deposits  There’s a significant increase in the number of banks that report they are laying off loans  to correspondents and to nonbank lending agencies  They’re reporting increases in demand for  loans to finance feeder cattle and the storage of crops and also for farm operations and reduced  demand to finance farm machinery  But, these are all the kinds of adjustments that one would  expect to find and they are all of fairly minor magnitude  I just wanted to report that as an  indication, even though there are indications of distress in this sector, that in our particular region it  still does not appear that things are falling apart       What would be your impression, Peter, as to the market’s impression of   your funds rate target or objective at the present time?      Thank you      Mr Chairman, I find alternative B generally acceptable, but I like the   suggestion that we use 6-3/4 percent as the bottom--or the “midpoint,” or whatever you want to call  it  It does seem to me that the tops of the ranges there are high for the current circumstances, so I  would prefer a directive with lower tops on the ranges by as much as, say, 1 percentage point for  both M1 and M2  And it seems to me that we probably should have a monetary aggregates  directive as well       I think I understood the reports to suggest that when the Swiss   announced their new posture, which in a couple of respects presumably makes it more difficult for  people to acquire Swiss francs, the dollar responded favorably  It would seem to me that that  should simply divert speculative funds from the Swiss franc to the German mark and have a  negative effect on the mark-dollar relationship  Why is my view erroneous in that respect?       I assume it would be erroneous to take the next step and say that if the   Germans also had done something similar to what the Swiss did that that likewise would have had  a favorable effect on the mark-dollar relationship        Mr Chairman, I have no particular differences with the general   forecast  I think it=s a reasonable one  I think there is a reason for being concerned about the  prospect for accelerating inflation, which is recognized there, but I think it=s recognized  appropriately  The main thing I wanted to comment on is that, as I look over the scene in the  Southwest, I don=t see any indication of any easing in the boom that is going there  In fact, it seems  to be strengthening rather than weakening  It seems to me that the prospect is that it=s going to tend  to spread and influence other areas--that it=s going to contribute strength rather than weakness to  the general economic picture      I might mention a few little things that possibly have somewhat broader interest  One of the   things that we have inherited from the demonstrations utilizing farm equipment--in connection with  the agricultural situation--is that some farm equipment loans now have a restrictive clause that this  equipment may not be used in any public demonstrations  A couple of bankers have told me  recently that they are carefully reworking their bond portfolios  This is apparently in the  anticipation that credit markets will tighten up somewhat and that any weak bonds will look rather  bad in their portfolios; so they are undertaking to move them out at the present time       Municipals were mentioned specifically in this connection, but I have   the impression that it=s not exclusively municipals  In the Greenbook or the Bluebook it was noted  specifically that this does not show up yet--whether or not it will eventually--in the yield spreads   But it=s something I wanted to mention in case other people are hearing similar [comments] so that  it might be appropriate for us to know it          2/28/78           21  We=re seeing what I would characterize as really a rather spectacular rebound in cattle prices   It=s quite possible that that=s being overdone  And we have reports that the snow birds of the north  are flocking to the south, apparently in their pickup trucks, in such numbers--into a rather [snowy]  south I must say--that they=re interfering with the ability of the day-to-day activity that is being  carried on in some of the so-called valley cities  They=re fairly small cities we=re talking about and  they=re just so jammed with people that you can=t get into the banks, get through the streets, and [so  forth]  That=s all I have to say       Are they sold at yields higher than [Regulation] Q ceilings?      Mr Chairman, it seems to me that the staff estimate that alternative B is   consistent with the general economic forecast might well be given substantial weight at this  particular juncture  It does give us no change with respect to M1 and M2  It gives us some  significant change with respect to M3, but the conversation around [the table] seems to suggest that  it=s realistic  So I would be inclined to take alternative B all the way through, recognizing that this  doesn=t, based on our best estimates, indicate that we=re making any additional move against  inflation and that the projection contemplates some acceleration of inflation  But all things  considered, it seems to me that that might be an appropriate place to stay at the present time       Mr Chairman, I agree with the observation that this is a time to stand   where we are, and I construe that as meaning primarily staying at 6-3/4 percent  I can=t visualize a  development in the next three weeks that would seem [to indicate] that we should go below 6-3/4  percent on the fed funds rate  However, it does seem to me that it is possible that there might be  developments that would cause us to want to go to 7 percent or possibly above that  But I would  assume that such developments would call for a meeting of the Committee and, therefore, it seems  to me that a range of 6-1/2 to 7 is appropriate       That used to be cast more often in terms of net borrowed reserves   instead of the federal funds rate      Whether we will lose sleep, Mr Chairman?      Mr Chairman      May I ask a question either of you or Paul?  Have there been any   suggestions emanating from other countries that we consider selling gold in this situation?      Where and for what purpose do we shift from 50-50 in our dealings   with the Treasury to 60-40?      For the purpose of--      Is the expected continued rapid growth in the labor force based in part   on an expectation of continued strong increases in the participation rate of women or is it pretty  much just a pickup in population?       The large projected decline in unemployment seems rather strong   given the projection of the labor force and given the prospect of some slowing in real growth      Do you have any particular reason to be skeptical of some of the   changes in the BLS data programs?       3/21/78              29    Mr Chairman, in terms of the difficulties of getting some kind of   coordinated program which might have some appeal to the public--on the grounds that it would  appear to have some chance of making an impact on inflation--would you see the major problem as     3/21/78              34  getting a consensus view in the Administration or getting support from the Congress if the  Administration were to bring forth such a [program]?       I would second that  I sense a real demand for it out in the country      It seems to me, Mr Chairman, it might be easier to build a fence   against demands that individual members’ figures be revealed--and thereby opening access of the  [Congressional] Committee chairmen to individual members of the Committee--if the presentation  is retained in terms of the Chairman’s view without reference to a poll of members       That’s quite satisfactory      Mr Chairman, my preference is for the aggregates specified in  alternative C and for a federal funds range of 6-3/4 to 7-1/4 percent and an aggregates directive  I  could be persuaded, however, along the line of Paul’s comments, to go 6-3/4 to 7 on the federal  funds range if it looks like going as far as 7-1/4 would disrupt the market       Yes, Mr Chairman       [I’d note] a couple of things, I guess  First, I had not contemplated that  the Committee would unilaterally drop this on an unsuspecting world, but rather if the Committee  saw some desirable feature of this approach to the problem--which I see largely as reestablishing  credibility, and it seems to me that should be a very high priority for us at the present time--that  there would be negotiations with the two Committees on Banking in the House and the Senate and  with appropriate people in the Administration  [In those negotiations we’d say something] to the  effect that it was the view of Federal Reserve officials that it was necessary in the interest of the  long-term health of the economy that we move in this direction and that we felt so strongly about it  that we were rather persuaded that we had to take a public position and that we were undertaking to  get their concurrence and support before doing it  Also, this is a long-term approach within which  there is obviously room for week-to-week and month-to-month deviations even of significant  proportions  But still, the achievement of the long-term objective is a matter of high importance      I wouldn’t be able to forecast what kind of support one might get for taking such a posture  before in fact taking it  Now, I had not contemplated when I sent out my little note the sequence of  events that would transpire from that time to this  It seems to me, however, that the events that  have transpired have given us a very favorable setting within which something like this could be  picked up and carried forward  It seems to me that Mr Strauss has really the last opportunity to  rescue this economy from slipping into wage and price controls in a fairly comprehensive set of  arrangements  Whether he will take full advantage of the opportunity and responsibility that is laid  on him, I don’t know  But it would seem to me that the Federal Reserve, as a part of the  negotiations which must take place within the government and between the government and the  leadership of various sectors of the economy, could through its spokesman--with a consensus view  from this Committee--[suggest such a program]  If in those negotiations it proved desirable or  beneficial or strengthened our negotiating hand to have something like this in our hip pocket to be  revealed at the appropriate time--knowing that this Committee was of that view and was prepared  to back up that posture--conceivably [it] could be very useful  That could be a very useful  negotiating tool      Therefore, Mr Chairman, I would urge that the Committee not accept the report that has been  circulated as the view of the Committee at this point in time on a proposal that the Federal Reserve  establish some longer-term objectives in some [form]  My preference would be that the Committee  go on record that it has substantial sympathy for that sort of view and that it would be prepared to     4/18/78             9  support the Chairman if in the negotiations within government it seemed desirable that the  Committee take such a public position  I would recommend that the proposal be referred back to  the subcommittee for further study on three major points  One is that if we were to go this route,  what should be the monetary or credit measures for which we would announce the longer-term  objectives?  Secondly, what kind of time dimensions would be hitched to it?  [We’d have to decide]  whether to use annual averages or year-end to year-end changes--that sort of thing  And then  finally, the point that Mr Volcker referred to, what kinds of magnitudes would be considered?  It  would seem to me that the only thing that is pretty much given--it is an integral part of the  proposal--is that the magnitudes would have to become smaller from one year to the next if the  whole process were to have any possibility of building our credibility with the public in terms of an  effective anti-inflation program or attack on inflation       I would see it revised on the occasion of some substantial external  development       Yes  If, for example, the Arabs were to double the price of oil, then it  seems to me the thing has to be opened up and reconsidered       Well, this raises a further question  I probably should have made a  fourth point that needs exploration, and that would be the tone of the language in which the  announcement is made--just how specific and unequivocal it should be and whether or not there  would be any allusion to the circumstances under which we would contemplate that we would   reconsider or revise [the target]       I would think that would be another circumstance in which to  reconsider--       Mr Chairman, I have a couple of things   First, just a factual point  It’s  reported that steel for new high-rise office type structures in the Southwest currently costs $900 a  ton  As recently as 90 days ago, the same builder contracted for the same kind of steel for the same  types of structures and was buying it for $750       Well, I suspect it flows to an extent at least from what the government  has done with respect to reference prices  And certainly the demand has been increasing, as has  been suggested  In the projection, interest rates and the proportion of managed liabilities to earning  assets in the commercial banks both are projected to move somewhat above the rates we had in the  closing months of ’74  Would you think that the credit market might have many of the other     4/18/78             18  characteristics of late 1974, which as we recall was a crunch situation?  If so, is there anything we  could do now to help assure that Henry Wallich’s advice that we condition our economy for a soft  landing would be realized?       I might mention just one other fact, Mr Chairman  Large savings and  loan associations in the Southwest, though a small number of them to be sure, have been  advertising quite widely for 6-year money at 8-1/2 percent in large amounts--$l00,000 minimum   In part, this is probably anticipating what you are suggesting here in terms of the developments in  financial markets       Mr Chairman, I came here with views very much like those Phil  Coldwell has mentioned  But I agree that staying where we are--if we in fact do it--on the  aggregates will probably give us a significant tightening of credit  The difference [relative to my  view] will be very small, so I can ride with your proposal to keep the ranges that we now have       Mr Chairman, I have already expressed my view with respect to the  procedure  With respect to the specific ranges, they are acceptable to me  My expectation is that  the real economy and the price movement may both be a little stronger than [you indicated] but I  wouldn’t suggest that you change them       It is a little disconcerting that the explanation is that there was a  [shortage] of bills available       Mr Chairman, do you care to suggest whether you prefer a monetary  aggregates or a--       Mr Chairman, I think we should have a monetary aggregates directive  and along with it, a funds rate range which centers on 7 percent  Now, I can go with either 6-3/4 to  7-1/4 or 6-1/2 to 7-1/2   If we go to the wider range on the funds rate, then I’d go with the  aggregates of alternative B; with a narrower range, I’d use the aggregates of alternative C  My  inclination would be toward the latter       The “C” aggregates with a federal funds range of 6-3/4 to 7-1/4       It seems to me, Mr Chairman, that a key part of the consideration is  what funds rate range you hitch with it       4/18/78             52     Mr Chairman, I continue to hear reports around here of extremely  strong [business activity] expressed generally across [a wide] spectrum [of industries]  The real  estate area appears strong  I continue to hear reports also of a rising flow of foreign [unintelligible]  in this part of the world  My preference would be to move the funds rate above 7-1/4 percent  [unintelligible] at least show that if the market concludes that we are [unintelligible] at 7-1/4  With  [respect to] the discount rate, I would think it timely to move whenever the Board is ready to  approve the requests it has  [Unintelligible] increase when they meet next week       On Thursday       5/5/78              9     I would just raise a question as to whether there is a significant  possibility that we may see stronger capital expenditures coming on than is now currently indicated  in the surveys or from other sources  I guess I would make a further comment that I see indications  in the Southwest that capital expenditures are moving about as fast as the available real resources  will permit  And there are increasing shortages of the materials that are used in capital investment,  increasing delays in getting materials, and increasing difficulty in getting staff to work on these  projects       Mr Chairman, in terms of a specific forecast, I would not quarrel with  what the staff has presented  It seems to me to be a reasonable representation as to what may  happen  In terms of problem situations, however, I see increasing indications now that we may see  over the next nine months to a year that confluence of events which typically sets the stage for a  period of adjustment  I have not had such a feeling thus far in this particular period of expansion,  but at the present time it seems to me that we now see indications of that final burst of activity  which brings the distortions in the economy that then get washed out during a period of adjustment  which we call recession  This suggests that if we are to have a soft landing, we probably need to be  working very hard at the present time to moderate that final burst of activity that typically gives us- -toward the end of a period of business expansion--those distortions which give us recession     I’ve been trying to [determine the] significance of a recent observation made in our District  but haven’t been able to; nevertheless, I’ll report it to you  In one of the towns in western Texas,  there was a sign over a hall, which for recent months had read “American Agricultural  Headquarters”  I’m told that that has now been replaced with a sign that reads “Domino Hall”   Thank you       They’re moving just as rapidly as they can find the labor to move       Mr Chairman, if I could just [add a] footnote on that  I agree with the  observation of higher equity in real estate development, but that equity in our part of the country is  largely foreign money rather than domestic       That’s true  You’re right       May I ask a further question, Mr Chairman?       On the large amount of nonwithheld taxes, Steve, do you have any  impression as to how that’s split between personal and business?  Is it predominantly one of them?        About individuals  So you would not relate this development to the  strong surge in business loans and--       We used to hear, on a quarterly basis, quite a lot of conversation in  banking circles about loan demand for tax payments in the business sector  I just hadn’t  encountered any such conversations [recently]       Mr Chairman, I guess I assess the probabilities of making an error at  the present time, judged in the perspective of looking back twelve months [and] down the road, as  being somewhat different  My major reason for this is our historical experience  Granted, every  experience is a different one, but my impression is that our historical record of monetary policy  overall tends to say that we were too slow in undertaking the restraining measures as the economy  was moving toward full use of its resources  And that contributed both to the fact of a subsequent  adjustment, which took the form of recession, and to the duration and depth of the recession  So  I’m inclined to feel that the probability of achieving a so-called soft landing, which I judge is a  leveling off of activity at a level approximating capacity use of resources, is increased by moving  fairly vigorously on the restraint side at a point in time [such as] now in the pattern of this  economic expansion, but with a high sensitivity to easing off earlier  I realize that particular  judgment as to the timing of easing off is a high risk one because we have not demonstrated any  particular ability to pinpoint the beginning of recession     Coming to specifics, my preference this time would be to take a federal funds rate range on  the order of about 7-1/4 to 8, with a 7-5/8 midpoint, I believe, on that range  I would be inclined to  move rather judiciously within that range  As to the monetary aggregates, the difference between  A and B is fairly small and I could ride with either one of those       And you are pretty sure you won’t want it [in again] before a month has  passed?       Mr Chairman, I would like to ask Jim what kind of reaction he would  have to the proposition that rather than the current high level and rapid rate of growth in  consumer installment debt setting the stage, as it has in earlier periods for a number of years  now, for a slower rate of growth in debt and/or maybe an actual decline in purchases of  consumer durables that we might be seeing now instead a basic cyclical change  Could we be  seeing a phenomenon reflected in a change in consumer attitudes based primarily on a gradual  embracing of the idea that inflation is probably a permanent part of the environment?  So over a  period of time, we might see an acceleration in the rate of purchasing durables both in  anticipation of continued price increases and a willingness, or maybe even a desire, to carry  more debt and less dollar-denominated assets, which would be similar to what we seem to have  been seeing in residential mortgages  And, therefore, we might--or that there=s at least a fair  chance--toward the latter part of this year not be looking at a weakening in the demand for     6/20/78                10  consumer durables but possibly a maintenance or maybe even an acceleration in demand for  consumer durables       Mr Chairman, as you all know, the Southwest continues to be boom  country, and I have the impression that that is becoming a more and more common state of affairs  around the country  As to the general economic picture over the next year, I am inclined to think  that we are going to see, as has been suggested, a continued strong picture for some time  And it  seems to me that the odds are fairly good that that time frame may well run through our forecast  period  But I don=t think it is possible to predict with any degree of confidence when an expansion  period will reach that set of circumstances which will cause a turning point to come  At least  historically economists’ ability to predict turning points before turning points arise has been  demonstrated to be very close to zero  And I don=t see any reason why we should be more  successful this time than in earlier periods       Yes, I think the record shows that, according to studies that have been  done  I think how soon it comes to an end depends on how much of a speculative surge develops   While I am pretty sure it is developing, I would hope that it will not come forth with such a thrust  that [the expansion] has to be as short-lived as Chuck and Phil suggest  And as I say, I think there is  a fair chance of [continued strength for some time], particularly if, as Governor Wallich has  suggested, we [view] the inflation aspect as our major problem and undertake to give it our major     6/20/78                22  attention  So I would suggest that we might see somewhat more real growth over the next l2 months  than the staff has suggested, probably averaging 4 percent or maybe even a point or two above that   Along with this I think we are likely to see more price increase than the staff has suggested, probably  something averaging in the 7-3/4 to 8 percent range  With respect to unemployment, I wouldn=t  expect to see very much change in the percentage of the labor force unemployed during that time  period, notwithstanding the fact that, as has already been reported, the areas of severe labor shortage  probably will become more widespread rather than less widespread     A significant part of this pattern of expectations is my reading of the consumer’s performance  with respect to consumer installment debt at the present time  While I am not unaware that the  retailers represented on our board of directors are reading this development in the historical pattern  that we have had for a number of years, I am inclined to think that a different pattern may be  emerging this time  We are seeing consumers undertaking to find ways to get a bit of protection  against the impact of inflation in sectors other than residential real estate, which has been the one  that has been available to them thus far      I might just take a moment to make a reference to a very fine seminar that the Boston Bank,  under Frank=s leadership, sponsored at the end of last week  I was interested to note that the  preponderantly academic economists continued to present models and to draw inferences from them  which say, in effect--if I understood [correctly]--that the inflation problem is not attributable in any  significant way to structural aspects of the economy  [Their view was] that the economy does have  the flexibility to respond to appropriate monetary and fiscal policies  I would have to report that that  is the preponderant view among the economists and the staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas,  [unintelligible] to be persuaded that that in fact is the situation  And it seems to me that unless we  find some way to address in a more meaningful way than we have thus far what has come to be  known as the structural rigidities in the economy, we will not be able to achieve Governor Wallich=s  much publicized and I think very desirable soft landing       Mr Chairman, I would accept Paul=s suggestion and the alternative B  suggestion for 7-1/2 to 8 for the federal funds range  But I would like somewhat narrower and  significantly lower ranges on the aggregates--4 to 8 on M1 and 4 to 9 on M2--with the directive in  the aggregates form and embracing most of your suggested new language or, as far as I=m  concerned, all of it  I’d have a further instruction to the Desk that they move 1/4 point of the 1/2  point range, assuming the aggregates come in strong, in each of the first two weeks  And if at that  time we=re at the top of both the fed funds and the aggregates ranges we would have a meeting for  further consideration of the situation       Well, 5 to 9 would be stretching it a bit but I could ride there I guess       Mr Chairman, there was some earlier reference to moving from 7-1/2 to  7-3/4 but there was no comment in connection to the additional 1/4 point of the range  Is there any  need for comment to clarify that?       I don=t fully understand Phil=s suggestion       But is your comment to reduce buying?       We=re also getting in a position where we need collateral       Mr Chairman, while I=m willing to give that, it seems to me that Phil  Coldwell=s suggestion of just letting them run off is a preferable one     6/20/78                47       By way of one response to your question, I would see no serious erosion  of the surveillance if we picked [the information] up either a few hours late or a day late       Mr Chairman, I have a question--in fact two of them--relating  primarily to the assumptions  If the tax cut assumed were not to materialize and if we were to  operate the same monetary policy--assuming it is cast in terms of monetary aggregates--that we  would if there were a tax cut, would you judge that that would change your forecast significantly?   Or would that particular assumption be fairly well neutralized?       With respect to the energy program, you still view that as essentially  having a neutral effect--that whatever funds are picked up will be put back in the economy?       Mr Chairman, I think we still have significant expansive elements in  the economy and I share what I think is the staff’s view that the distortions are not yet great  enough, and that it will take a fair time for them to become great enough, to terminate the  expansive influences  And I think there is still some possibility of achieving something that might  appropriately be labeled a "soft landing" ex the inflation aspect  So I would still [expect]  something on the order of 4 percent or just slightly under on GNP, about 7-1/2 percent on prices,  and something a bit under 6 percent on unemployment       As now published, it doesn’t include the large CDs, does it?       Mr Chairman, Henry Wallich’s comments adequately expressed my  views  I would simply underscore that 4 to 6-1/2 today means about what 5 to 7-1/2 meant three  months ago  And that is a fairly significant upward adjustment for the targets, it seems to me, and  is adequate for the time being  So, “B” captures my views at the moment       Mr Chairman, my views are pretty well captured in alternative C  It  seems to me that that would call for a 1/4 point increase in the federal funds rate promptly  It  seems to me that the market is expecting it and actually installing it would tend to put the dealers  back into a [more] conventional operating position whereas they are operating on an oversold  position in the anticipation that something like this is coming along     7/18/78              39       We are already at 7-7/8       [The midpoint] doesn’t mean anything with a money market directive       Could you just run through the specific numbers again?       I was wondering if Mr Pardee could elaborate a little on the  characterization of “ridiculously low levels”  Can you put that in a setting a bit?       Mr Chairman, our numbers have come down somewhat from what  we had last time  On real GNP, we would now think that the staff's projection is a very reasonable  one  With respect to prices, also essentially [we agree with] the staff projection of about 7-1/2  percent and we have on unemployment about 6 percent  I would like to underscore what Willis  Winn has [reported]  I encounter a good bit of expectations that wage and price controls will be  imposed within this forecast period and I share that feeling myself  I [base that on] the continuing  evidence that the existing tools are not impacting significantly on the inflation problem and the  indication that labor is building a stage for very large demands, which probably will not be  vigorously resisted in the absence of controls  [So, I think] the political conclusion will in fact be  reached that that's the necessary and appropriate thing to do       I believe public opinion surveys are beginning to show a  preponderance of a willingness to accept price controls  It’s a saleable view       You see increasing indications of it in businessmen's administration  of prices also  For example, I believe, one of the Chevrolet products has had about eight price  increases since it was introduced       My thought process before the discussion was similar to that Paul  described, and in particular with respect to our short ranges relative to our long ranges  So the  proposal I arrived at was to narrow the ranges on M1 and M2 and also on the federal funds rate   This means that by going with the narrower ranges on the aggregates, I would use the narrow range  on the funds rate to constrain the funds rate movement  But it seems to me important that we go to  a narrow range on the aggregates at this point in time  So I would suggest on M1 something like  5-1/2 to 7-1/2; on M2, 6-1/2 to 8-1/2 or 9; and on federal funds 8 to 8-1/4  And I’d move to 8  promptly and after a week or so, if we were at the top of these lower ranges on the aggregates, I’d  move to 8-1/4  And I agree with the suggestion that it is probably timely to move on the discount  rate at the present time       Mr Chairman, first a question to Mr Pardee  Could you hang any  amounts on the concept of the operations you're suggesting as compared to the $4 billion?       Is it fair to say that you are thinking in terms of hundreds of millions  rather than billions?       Mr Chairman, I would have to admit to never having been an  enthusiastic supporter of the swaps program  And I guess I cannot generate much enthusiasm for  the [proposed] program  It seems to me that our problem is more basic  Unless we can  demonstrate by some means that we're going to make some progress in getting hold of the wage- price push or some progress in getting hold of the continued outflow of dollars on the trade  balance, then what we could do in this sort of operation has a fairly high probability of being rather  costly and not particularly rewarding  I think that's all I had on that      On the proposal for a zero reserve requirement on foreign CDs, is it suggested that we have  the authority to exempt foreign CDs from reserve requirements or--       So this wouldn't come under the 3 percent limit on time deposits       I think the staff projection is quite a reasonable one  Having said that,   I think the odds are about 50-50 that they will come out low as high  I think that's where we should  try to be  As to potential problems, the main thing that I've encountered is skepticism as to whether  we will avoid increasing numbers of bottlenecks--in other words, whether there will be as much  elbow room in plant capacity  The staff analysis suggests no real problems in that area; there is  concern around that there will be       Yes, there is a relevant observation that may be made, which is that   the Administration has said that they are going to bring forth a new anti-inflation proposal  If that  should appear to be a program of substance with some possibility of having a significant impact, it  could provide a basis for a wave of optimism through both the business and consumer sectors of  the economy  That would be quite positive  If, on the other hand, it appears to be quite  transparently meaningless--mostly talk and nothing that is likely to have a substantial impact on the  wage-price push--then I think there is a strong possibility that the effect will be quite the opposite       Mr Chairman, it seems to me that the objective of the policy posture   should be that of trying to keep enough constraint on the economy so that any capacity that it has to  moderate inflation it will undertake to do that  And I find myself, in trying to develop some  monetary specifics, leaping back to that  I'm coming out very close to where Paul came out  I don't  really see much value in going below 4 on M1, although I don't object to that  But I do subscribe to  8, which is the current projection, as the maximum for the target range  And I'd do the same thing  on M2, 9-1/2 being the current projection; I’d pick that up as the top of the target range  My  inclination would be to put the bottom two points below the top in both instances, which is the  projected bottom of the alternative B range  On fed funds, again my inclination would be the  alternative B suggestion, which is 8-1/4 to 9  And if we were to wind up with higher tops on the  ranges, I would think we definitely should retain the suggestion of 9 for the top of the fed funds  range  If we can lower the top of the ranges on M1 and M2 to the current staff estimates of what  the actual may be, then a top on the fed funds of 8-3/4 would be acceptable       I would move to 8-1/2      Mr Chairman, would it be appropriate to take a consensus on what I   think is essentially Paul Volcker’s suggestion of 4 to 8 on the M1 range and the others as you  [suggested]?         Mr Chairman, I have no particular difference with the staff's  projection with respect to production  With respect to inflation, I share the view that we are likely  to see stronger price movements than projected here  And along with that, it seems to me that  there's a good possibility we will see somewhat more unemployment than is projected  In fact, to  me the real issue as we attempt to decide policy--I'm using "we" in a very broad sense now, broader  than the Federal Reserve--is this  Unless we can bring forth some means of reaching more directly  into the wage negotiations that are coming up and getting an outcome from those that is different  than has been projected in the charts here, our prospects become dimmer rather than brighter     Even though I suggest that with stronger inflation there is a probability of greater  unemployment in total, I have to add that in my part of the country at the present time we have  predominately very tight labor markets  Business firms are engaging in extensive recruitment  efforts, ranging far outside the area, and are having difficulty bringing people in at the rate that they  would like to employ them      It seems to me that there is another important question in the picture  While we're projecting  a continuation of the present rate of saving--and I guess that may tie in somewhat to the projection  of essentially the present rate of inflation--it seems to me there's a significant probability that our  saving rate may change  As people see a continuation of inflation at a fairly strong rate, we may  see a continuation of the trend we have seen this past year in efforts to take protective actions   That, of course, will feed back on price developments and also, unfortunately, on production  developments, as attention shifts to protective [measures in] various production efforts         10/17/78 20                Could I ask Chuck a question about his comment that M1 after ATS  cannot be used as a target variable?  Would that comment also apply to the other aggregates?       I had understood you to say that M1+ likewise could not be used       Mr Chairman, I find alternative 2 acceptable, but I would be prepared  to put the bottom of the funds rate at 8-3/4   I guess I would construe Paul's comment as pretty  much embracing that  I think there's no need to elaborate further       I did not say [anything about] going to 9 immediately but I would  prefer that       I think this Committee should decide tentatively today to reassemble  the day after the President announces his anti-inflation program and address ourselves to that  program and how it relates to our responsibility  [We ought to discuss] what we could do in the  way of [unintelligible] a public announcement, which would undertake to underscore at least the  objectives of the President's program  [We should] consider, of course, everything in our area of  responsibility that could be cited as lending support to his program      I would view several possible positive things as coming out of this  One, and most  important, that we are doing everything we can with everything that's available from all sources on  an anti-inflation front  Two, an opportunity to try to minimize the possible boxing-in effects from  the announcement with respect to freedom of action in the monetary policy area  And I would  think there would be an opportunity for something to be said which may not be said in the  announcement--I have no idea what the announcement will be--with respect to the importance of  finding policies that will reach more effectively into this wage-price push part of the economic  picture than anything that's been put forth thus far  And finally, it seems to me that such an  announcement or statement or the holding of a meeting of this Committee at that point in time  would probably carry some meaningful message to the international sector that this country at long  last is meaningfully and unitedly attacking the inflation problem       I'm assuming that the statement will be something that either will have  or can be reasonably construed to have a substantial body of economic content       I think if it were done by the FOMC it would have the potential of  carrying substantially more weight to the public, both domestically and internationally         If we were not united, I wouldn't put out a statement       On that one aspect of it, it seems to me that holding such a meeting  quickly after the announcement would permit us to construe anything that we were proposing to do  as being supportive of this program and thereby blunt the charge that we were not being supportive  or that we were going contrary to his [program]       It's important that we respond to that immediately, it seems to me        Have they reached any decisions as to the maturities?       Then the $11 billion [referred to] in the footnote in the Bluebook is  from a previous period?       In view of the comments about the disparate forecasts and that we  might [talk] ourselves into a recession, I just wanted to balance the table a little bit by saying that  flavor of conversation is not universal around the country  There are regions that are not seeing [a  recession]        That depends on who's doing the judging  But I do hear reports from  bankers that they are seeing some “flaky” real estate proposals, now suggesting instead of a  weakening in the speculative interest possibly a pickup in speculative interest  I also hear reports     11/21/78              11  that people are not inquiring what the interest rate is when they come to the bank for loans even on  residential mortgages  The only question is can they find the money       Mr Chairman, I find the staff forecast about as acceptable as any  forecast that I'm able to visualize this morning  The major difference would be that business fixed  investment seems to me likely to be appreciably stronger than is incorporated in the forecast and  that inflation is likely to be a bit stronger than is incorporated in the forecast  But real GNP and  unemployment probably are not much different  It seems to me that there is a significant  improvement in optimism--or to turn it around a diminution of pessimism--in the business sector,  flowing largely at the present time from indications that the Administration is beginning to  recognize the nature of the problems that they're working with, even though I do not detect a high  level of confidence in their ability to handle them  But it seems to me that the mere fact that they're  beginning to address them is causing businesses to feel there are improved possibilities of coming  through this situation fairly well  My own personal feeling here is that if we could just find some  way of slowing wage increases, then we would almost certainly have flowing from that a higher  level of employment and a higher level of production than will otherwise materialize       Mr Chairman, I'm rather concerned--somewhat along the line that  Paul Volcker has mentioned--that if the conventionally observed policy indicators do not rather     11/21/78              23  [unintelligible] continue to show support for the program that we announced in November, we will  soon be discredited  And it seems to me that it's quite important that we don't run that risk at the  present time, even at the risk that we might be a little tighter two months down the road, looking  back on it, than we had hoped  It seems to me that if we were to accommodate something like a 10  percent growth rate in M2, it would tend to be construed that way  Also, it seems to me that a 10  percent growth rate in M2 would probably be linked to enough growth in reserves or monetary  base type numbers so it would tend to provide support for people who are already suggesting that  mostly what we have done is say words and not really follow up or give them substance  So my  preference would be to see a lower top on the M2 growth rate  I have thought in terms of 6 to 8  there, frankly       Well, yes  But then we carry over into bank credit and then we begin  to get to the question that Frank Morris has raised and which tends to emerge in Paul's comments   We are not projecting much of a slowing in the rate of growth of bank credit for November and  December  That growth rate has been pretty fast and it has been consistent through the year with  an accelerating rate of inflation notwithstanding a pretty good level of real output in the economy   And it seems to me, as I say, that people are looking at us pretty closely now and trying to evaluate  and construe just what our intentions are  They will be looking at bank credit along with other  figures  So I would like to see a policy at the present time that would move the [funds] rate up a  bit I agree that we don't want to be really hard-nosed on it, but nevertheless move it up a bit if we  see the indications of M2 and bank credit not slowing down  Our program was read by people as a  declaration that we are going to get some slowing in the rate of money and credit growth in the  economy for the purpose of making the Administration's program meaningful, both internationally  and domestically  So it seems to me there is a lot riding on it at this point in time in terms of  confidence in what we're trying to do       My preference on M2 would be 6 to 8, and on the federal funds rate  9-3/4 to 10  The other elements of alternative B I can accept as they are presented       "Giving due regard" could mean anything you want it to       Mr Chairman, I, too, am impressed with this conflicting evidence   As a result of that, I am more ambivalent than usual today in terms of policy  [Let me mention] a  couple of facts that may be of interest  As you know, we have a large builder on our board who  builds pretty much around the country and also a bit abroad  He reported that he recently bid an  identical building in Houston to one he bid a year ago and now has it about completed  And the  current bid was exactly 25 percent higher than the one a year ago  He was citing this as an  indication of the rate of increase of construction costs in that area  He indicated a similar estimate  for the Chicago area of 20 percent  He noted also that the ability to lease promptly is easing off as  a result of these higher costs and the necessary higher leases  He expects that that will bring on a  slowing in the rate of construction for that type of property       Conversations I have had recently with businessmen in a wide variety of activities suggest  to me that we are probably going to see more investment, particularly in new equipment and  possibly in the total of business fixed investment, than is being reported in the surveys and than is  currently being projected  In fact, I would expect that the projection may be low in that particular  component  Our banks are experiencing--and expect to continue to experience at least for some  time--very strong loan demands  In connection with that, they are expecting to make some further  upward adjustment in the prime rate  Small banks report that they are having more difficulty  upstreaming loans, and large banks report that they are having more difficulty downstreaming  them I think an indication of a little tightening up in the market is that they are all getting a little  closer to that situation which they will call “loaned up”      It is interesting that drilling activity is off significantly in the Southwest in the last month or  two  The explanation given is that there is a temporary localized glut in [natural] gas  And in those  circumstances, where they can, they like to schedule their output to the local market as compared to  moving into the international market  I simply report that; I don’t know whether that is a valid  explanation  That drilling activity is down, I think is a fact, but I’m not sure about the explanation     We see a few indications of the effects of higher interest rates and tighter credit on activity   Cattle feeders, for example, find that they use up their credit line with about half as many cattle in  the lot now as they did when cattle were much lower in price  And in one instance a builder and  operator of warehouses has reported that he has had to cut back his plant substantially because he  couldn’t get the volume of financing that he would like to have  But his volume is up very sharply;  his business is so terribly good that he is turning away customers, with no credit to meet their  needs     Well, from all of this, I come out in the total pretty close to where the staff comes out  As I  have indicated, I would up the investment figures a bit, I would reduce the personal expenditures     12/19/78          13    figures a bit, I’d up prices a bit, and I’d up nominal GNP somewhat  But those are not major  differences  As to credit policy, I could go today either with standing where we are and observing  a bit longer in view of what’s happening on the aggregates--I would not be prepared to abandon  them as Phil apparently would be--or I could be comfortable moving to a little higher fed funds  rate  On balance, I think primarily because of foreign [exchange markets] and inflation--not  because of domestic economic activity projections--I would be inclined toward a little additional  restraint as reflected in the fed funds rate        I can live with it       I understood a semi-commitment to the suggestion--I believe it was  Dave’s suggestion or someone’s--that we not let the funds rate drop  And I thought the inference  there was below 9-7/8  Your comment I construe as indicating the inclination to not let it drop  [below] 10  Could we get some clarification on that?        Do you contemplate that in the July report you would cast the  discussion largely in terms of the change from the fourth quarter to the second quarter?         Would you tend to cast the conversation in terms of quarterly  averages all the way through as compared with when you’re reporting in July maybe getting hung  up in a lengthy conversation of June?        But there’s an inference, I think, in picking fourth quarter-to-fourth  quarter that there is not a shorter period that’s really meaningful to talk about  No shorter than a  quarter, or about three months        Mr Chairman, it seems to me that a way of handling this today--and I  would propose a motion unless there is already one on the table--is to accept number 6 as an  interim posture but not as a policy action at this point in time  That will leave the door open for  continuing exploration        [Unintelligible] and a number of others, which I suggested in the  conversation  In fact, I’ll have to admit that as I read the discussion pertaining to 6, I found it on  balance a little more persuasive to come out a little differently on it than this specific  recommendation  It seems to me there is something there and we need to keep the door open for  further exploration, but at the same time we must move ahead to get a February statement out       Mr Chairman    This may not be the appropriate place for this  question, but do you see anything [in] the international developments  that are affecting currency [flows] that would help explain what we  are seeing in the measures of the domestic monetary aggregates?    Mr Chairman, on the general economic picture  I think the staff projections are about as defensible a set of  projections as one can put together at the present time, and I would  not pick on any particular aspect of them I have made a concerted  effort since our last meeting, in view of my judgment that the  prospects were rather good that we would have greater capital  expenditures in ‘ I 9  than was being forecast or than the surveys were  suggesting, to engage businessmen in discussion on this point I have  to report that I was unable to persuade even one of them that the  prospects for capital expenditures are higher than are currently being  forecast    That’s where I had most of my conservations  And this is on the grounds that they are playing their cards close to  their chests They would much rather fix up, patch up, or put in a  new machine when an old one breaks down and in fact go to overtime on  their labor costs as compared with expanding basic capacity It  leaves them in a much more flexible situation Also, they are able to  pass on cost and price increases without much difficulty The market  takes it So they just feel that’s the better way to go in the  present environment That substantially increases the possibility  that we may have a sustained low growth situation, at least until that  attitude is changed, because that seems to me to be a key element in  [downturns] And a major determinant of periods of economic expansion  has been a surge in capital investment, which has brought very heavy  pressure on the labor markets, materials markets, and credit markets  we do not see that at this time and, if our forecast is reasonably  dependable, we are not projecting that we will see it for some time  yet to come   There is another element in the picture that seems to  increase the possibility [of a low growth outlook], and that is that  neither consumers nor businessmen nor financial managers have yet  fully adjusted to an expected ongoing rate of inflation somewhere near  what we have forecast and, therefore, I think we will see a continued  rapid buildup of debt I’m concerned that the debt structure will  become increasingly shaky and that to me is one of the bad aspects of  a sustained period of either high optimism or rapid inflation It  means that when [inflation] does come to an end, we will have much  more widespread debt distress and a much more difficult economic  problem to handle But it seems to me that we are likely to see that  [buildup of debt1 continue for the next couple of years before we get  into the painful adjustment part of it     2 / 6 / 7 9  -22-   One other general comment is that I think a set of economic  programs and policies proposed by the government, which contemplates I  to 8 percent ongoing inflation, is quite inadequate and quite  unacceptable, particularly in this country I believe there is a set  of policies that could enable us to move promptly to wring inflation  out of the economy without going through a recession and without  substantially increasing unemployment, but thus far we seem to be  committed to the idea that we must disavow using it   Well, having accepted the economic prospects and what seems  to be a consistent set of monetary data along with them, I would opt  for alternative B Nevertheless, I am somewhat concerned about the  sort of thing that Mark Willes mentioned--namely, that it's possible  if we were at the top of the range on M1 to have growth that I think  would be too much That's all I have, Mr Chainan    But maybe for the wrong reason!    Given the presumption, M r   Chairman, that we  have a consistent set of numbers in alternative B, so far as one can  argue there’s consistency there    I think it would be a mistake at the present  time to adopt a directive, which would then be published, that does  not have a reference to monetary aggregates It will touch off a wave  of speculation and concern as to what this group is doing and what  changes we have made either in our mode of operation or our concept of  how the system works That would be unfortunate Even if we are not  going to pay attention to them, I think our statement should  incorporate some aggregates    I mean the short-term ranges    A money market directive with a 7-1/2 percent  top on the range    Or I can go with the biased alternative where  we have essentially a money market on the down side and aggregates on  the up side    I share that feeling; I think 9 or 9-1/2  percent [money growth] is too high for a money market directive    Mr Chairman, I suppose I'm as confused as  anyone else A nice warm bed is always attractive but--   M R   PARTEE I didn't know it was so warm!    --that particular bed is rather crowded right  now anyway We have worked the numbers, as presumably everyone else  has, and come to fairly inconclusive conclusions By inquiring around  I have attempted to get some impression of the activity in mutual fund  accounts because, as you know, one can draw checks on most of them but  the minimum size, though it varies, is very often $500 And it  doesn't take a very large number of $500 transactions to equal the  number of checks over $500 Now, the very small proportion of total  checks in the system over $500 does account for a very high proportion  of the total volume of expenditures handled through the check  mechanism So if there were some fairly persuasive evidence that we  were getting a significant number of transactions through these money  market funds--and after all it is expenditures not balances that move  the economic machine--then there might be some basis for feeling a  little less distressed about the indicated slow growth in [bank]  balances I take some comfort also in the indicated resurgence in  demand for bank credit; I hadn't been inclined to downplay it to the  extent that Steve has in his analysis this morning, although there may  be justification for that I hear generally from bankers that they     3 / 2 0 / 1 9  -20-   see quite a strengthening of demand for credit from their customers  and across a broad array of types of activities   Just an incidental point There’s a good deal of resentment  in the western part of our District with respect to the very large  amounts of emergency credit the government is injecting into  agriculture [because] the evidence is that fair amounts of these funds  are being diverted into conspicuous consumption on the part of the  borrowers    I can see them all back home! It is  interesting that we have had a fairly persistent decline in the number  of rotary rigs in operation The decline has been significantly more  in Texas and to some extent in Louisiana than in the country as a  whole And this [is occurring] in an environment of obviously short  supply of the items they would drill for I also hear more reports at  the present time than I have heard at any time previously relative to  “shut in” supplies As I say, this is a somewhat puzzling situation  I have raised questions with people engaged in this business as to  why The explanation given is almost universally weak prices and  excess supplies of natural gas within the Texas market, When one  asks, given the gestation period of bringing a well into production  and given the trend in supplies and prospective demands for oil and  gas, why a temporary price weakness in a given location should result  in a significant reduction in the amount of drilling activity, [the  shutdowns] seem to make a lot of sense to the people I‘ve talked to,  although I’ve had difficulty fitting it together in my own mind   The weakness in housing in Texas at the present time I think  is a phenomenon of usury ceilings I would raise a question as to  whether the national figures have been looked at state-by-state in  connection with the usury ceilings to see whether that might be a  significant factor--that such states might account for enough of the  [weakness in] total housing starts that it would be important AS I  say, I think it is the dominant element in the picture in Texas,  particularly for single-family housing at the present time  the demand is there; we’ve seen no indication of resistance to  interest rates It’s simply that with the legal ceilings and the  legal question about points as well as the difficult aspects of points  in the financing process that lenders have stopped making commitments  on one-family dwellings Of course, the fact that the legislature is  in session and is considering this matter [of the usury ceiling] may  be contributing to the shut-off of commitments at the present time as  compared with lenders making more intensive efforts to try to work  around the ceiling if that were not the case   I believe   I’ve raised questions with everyone I’ve come into contact  with who would seem to be in a position to know whether in the current  circumstances there is something in the international arrangements  which might be an explanation for the high volume of expenditures in  this country from what appears to be a falling or a low volume of  balances Again, [that effort] has not been very productive I     3/20/79 -21-   haven't uncovered anything there but I'll have to admit it still seems  to me that something may well be there which we have not discovered or  documented It seems to me--    It seems to me, although based on historical  experience it would be a very high risk position, that we should  maintain the position we have had in recent months with respect to  monetary policy    Mr Chairman, alternative B as presented in  the Bluebook is an acceptable prescription for me    Mr Chairman, I have no particular quarrel  with the staff forecast It's interesting, however, that the  discussion--with just a couple of exceptions--tends to suggest that  the risk is on the down side rather than the up side It seems to me     4/11/79 -18-   that the evidence is probably increasing that we have a fair amount of  risk on the up side, at least for a temporary period here Business  conditions are very strong in the Southwest and labor markets are very  tight Even in that tight labor market there is heavy recruiting  going on from rather distant areas The only rationality I can see in  that is that these out-of-area recruiters feel there’s a significant  element in that labor market that is familiar with the jobs in  aircraft factories because certainly they shouldn‘t be attempting to  pull people out of our market on the grounds of any significant amount  of unemployment   We’re unable to see any indications of tightness in credit,  with the exception of housing And in that particular market the  tightness in credit is a function of legal ceilings on interest rates  In fact it appears increasingly that what we‘re seeing in the monetary  aggregates is the old [pattern] we saw under price ceilings on  commodities in WWII We found the price ceiling on the commodity  disappears when there are alternative uses for the resources that will  bring higher returns And we’ve seen [such] alternatives develop with  closer and closer characteristics of money S o  if we keep the price  ceiling on, it seems possible to me that M1 as we describe it at the  present time is going to disappear   Foreign investments continue to come into our area in  significant volume A natural disaster struck recently, which  physically removed one bank Other bank buildings in the area were  not seriously damaged But all the banks are operating It is  resulting in a substantial demand for currency It did reveal,  however, that a few people in the population still use the mattress  Reportedly one party brought in some $5,000 of $50 and $100 bills and  said that he had decided the bank was a safer place than the mattress    A national bank I assume that it could be  characterized as an involuntary member Well, we immediately sent  people to the area [affected by the tornado] to indicate that we were  prepared to do what we could to assist They reported that there were  long lines of people drawing currency from the banks One question I  asked them was whether there were any indications that it was a run  type of situation or simply a matter that in the circumstances people  needed currency to continue doing whatever they were trying to do  And the report was that it was mixed People had some questions as to  whether the bank that was severely damaged--as I say, the above ground  portion just disappeared--would survive But other banks in town were  accepting checks on that bank and I think that helped to reestablish  confidence   Coming to policy, the recitations by Mr Volcker and Mr  Wallich, with which Mr Coldwell concurred, captured my feeling of the  present situation more closely than other commentary I think we  should at a minimum stand with present interest rates, but indications  are that those rates are dropping behind other developments in the  economy and, therefore, probably should be nudged up some    Mr Chairman, my preference is for the  specifications of alternative C except for the funds rate range I  would [lower] that down some to, say, 10 to 10-3/4 percent, with the  idea that we would move during the first week to above 10 percent and  by the end of the week probably to 10-1/4 percent depending somewhat  on market developments    With an aggregates directive    Mr Chairman, I don‘t have a voice in this  matter today, but if I did it would be on the negative side It seems  to me the potential disadvantages tend to outweigh prospective  advantages    I'm negative    I have just come on, Mr Chairman, so I am not privy to very  much of the preceding discussion My inclination would be that in the circumstances the federal  funds rate should be edged up and the record when it becomes public should show that we were  resisting at least to some extent a surge in the growth rate of the monetary aggregates    I agree    Mr Chairman, I, too, missed the turn in  Steve's comments I thought it was [going to be a recommendation] to  lean more on the aggregates and he winded up [suggesting] a wider  range on the aggregates But I assume--    Well, the speaker of the Senate under his  interpretation of the law has called the Texas Rangers into action and  sent them out to find these fugitives and bring them back But it's  reported that they have crossed the border And unless he's willing  to create an international incident, he probably cannot reach them   I have no particular quarrel with the staff's projection It  seems to me about as reasonable as can be made in the circumstances  However, in our discussion I think it might be appropriate for us not  to focus exclusively on whether real economic activity is going to be  a small plus or a small minus--the difference is possibly not very  great--but to continue to focus a little more on inflation Inflation  is probably doing more damage now and has more potential to do damage  to our economy than whether the rate of economic growth is a small  positive or a small negative That's all I have, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, I’m inclined to think about the same as the  preponderant views that have been expressed Given the uncertainties on both sides of the  picture here we probably should just stay pretty much where we are and observe [ongoing  developments] but be ready to take some action as soon as it becomes clear that such action  needs to be taken And I would share Roger Guffey’s view that there might be some possibility  in the fairly near term of getting a little mileage out of a change in the discount rate Aside from  that, I would not see a very specific move [for us to make] in the near term    Could I ask Scott for a judgment? If we had  used, say, a discount rate increase or a small federal funds rate  increase in lieu of the market operations, would your guess be that we  would have had similar results or better results or none at all?    Mr Chairman, [let me mention] a couple of  elements on the economy that might be of interest We are beginning  now to see a little pickup in drilling activities, after a fairly long  period of accumulating idle rigs   CHAIR” MILLER Is this for oil or for gas?    It‘s both, but with gas being the strong end  of it And we‘re told by a few firms that they are making plans for a  further significant step-up in that area, even to the extent that  firms that normally do not own or control rigs but for the most part  use leased rigs are anticipating enough shortage of supply of rigs  about 6 months down the pike that they are now undertaking to acquire  control so they will be able to get good rigs at that time The other  thing I’d mentioned in terms of a local situation is that we are  seeing indications of very strong retail sales in El Paso and San  Antonio And this is attributed to heavy buying by Mexican nationals  who are coming back into those markets in substantial numbers at the  present time, after a period when such buying had been fairly low  Those are the only two markets on which I have some data I guess  similar comments on other markets [unintelligible]   As for local labor markets, they are almost in disarray  There’s raiding and bidding away [of workers] and job hopping, which  is distressing It‘s a hard market to work in We’ve passed the 50  percent annual rate of turnover in the Houston area--which is not a  big increase from where it has been--but [employers] are having  difficulty staffing The electronic firms in the area are having  great difficulties staffing One of them characterized the market to  me recently as follows For electronic engineers the standard offer--  the offer they make to engineers currently employed in other shops--is  whatever you‘re getting now plus 20 percent, if you will come on over    Mr Chairman, alternative I1 seems acceptable  to me    I assume it's irrelevant, Mr Chairman, that  they have recently been [picking] up a fair amount of [large  denomination] bills from the El Paso branch    Mr Chairman, I am inclined to the view that what we are seeing may be the front end of a very substantial development It seems to me that it would be advisable to use some fairly strong and obvious ammunition fairly early in the game Therefore, I would be inclined to let the funds rate move up a bit now, particularly if the market has been tending in that direction anyway, but then follow along with a discount rate change as early it can conveniently be put in place Insofar as the response to the President's speech was less than supportive, it seems to me that it's primarily on two counts (1) the lack of attention to inflation; and (2) the indications of a tendency to go the control route as compared with a heavier reliance on competitive markets [to address] the oil and gas problem I read the sentiment of foreign countries as being that they will not view our energy program as realistic unless we do let our domestic prices fully reflect world prices   Mr Chairman, I think the minimum in the circumstance should be a quarter point move in the funds rate and a half point move in the discount rate And I think Henry Wallich's suggestion of something from the Treasury with respect to gold sales would also provide a significant indication of the Administration's support and participation   With the situation here, it seems to me that it would be quite unfortunate if Reserve Bank directors were to send in recommendations for increases in the discount rate now and they were not approved   Tomorrow is Friday and we will need to get going first thing in the morning to get--   If approved, when it is announced would we announce that it was in response to a request from the Bank of Mexico?   Mr Chairman, I must join the chorus that has been sung pretty much around the table thus far, although I guess I would have to say I'm not a singer, as John Balles reminded me at the last meeting Coming from an area where labor markets are [tight] and the turnover of labor is high because of that, [my singing] really doesn't have credibility in these circles With respect to the box that has been referred to, thus far at least we are calling it a box and not a coffin, which may prove to be overly optimistic   I'm not unaware of the [concern] that is bothering quite a few of us, namely that the historical record seems to say rather unequivocally that we have usually acted late in both up and down periods of the cycle And insofar as there is an argument in support of a heavier reliance on the monetary aggregates, it is largely because heavier reliance on them would help us to avoid making those errors, if we classify them as errors But it seems to me if our major problem is inflation, and we visualize ourselves as being in a box and we're trying to find a way out, then we're pretty much forced to orient monetary policy to a rather long-term horizon Doing that really means we throw in the sponge for our more flexible economic tool, so far as influencing economic activity And that in turn means that we turn responsibility for the short-term influence of economic activity over to fiscal policy While I don't like aspects of this, I'm persuaded that that's probably the route we're going to have to go if we want to find ourselves out of the inflation box Namely, we have to focus monetary policy primarily on getting a [handle] on inflation That seems to me to force us into a context of working [toward our objective over] a rather long-range horizon and finding some way of defining it Now a recent Congressional report spells it out in terms of a conventional monetary aggregate Right at the moment I think it takes a pretty heroic person to commit himself to hitching closely and rather unequivocally--especially over a long time frame--to a monetary aggregate But I don't really see much  -30-    8/14/79  escape from it if we're going to hitch to inflation and that aspect which I think flows from it--I agree with Governor Coldwell--namely, the weakness of the dollar in exchange markets That's all I have, Mr Chairman   Would you explain briefly for me how the  foreign exchange swap conducted by the Bundesbank sops up domestic  liquidity?    Thank you    Mr Chairman, first let me make just a comment  on retail sales We are probably the only District that has  maintained that questionable old series on department store sales, but  in the four weeks ending on September 8, such sales showed a very  strong increase relative to the year-ago period All in all, that  average was up 10 percent whereas cumulatively through [September 81  from the beginning of the year it's up 7 percent    It was up 10 percent from a year ago in the  four weeks ending September 8; and from the beginning of the year  through those four weeks it's up 7 percent So there was a definite  step-up, compared to what had preceded that 4-week period, which  occurred pretty generally across the metropolitan areas in the  District Those [whose sales] I had reported earlier as being very  strong attributed it to an apparent increase in purchasing by people  coming from Mexico They continued strong but they did not show the  surge that other centers did in that last 4-week period That's just  by way of suggesting that in our part of the country, at least, there  seems to have been something happening to nonautomotive retail sales  because these were department store sales   With respect to the financial sector, as I was listening to  Steve's comments, they seemed almost exactly to replay some  conversations we had in the District last Wednesday evening, at which  Governor Teeters was present [Those comments were] to the effect  that in a prior period with 13 percent interest rates, bankers were  working very hard to discourage borrowers At the present time they  are still out searching for loans Apparently they find it profitable  to add to loans now, whereas in the earlier period they did not They  say that they feel no credit restraint and they do not see a  reluctance on the part of their customers to borrow There was a  comment, for example, that 13 plus 3 percent for real estate loans--  these were bankers talking so the loans were not primarily residential  mortgage loans--just doesn't seem to deter people They go ahead and  sign up and don't even ask a question as to whether they couldn't do  it for less   With respect to labor markets, the thrust of the conversation  in our part of the world is tight labor, high turnover, and losses of  efficiency as a result of high turnover I don't know whether we have  that sort of situation in labor markets elsewhere or not But it  seems to me--and I am inclined to disagree a little with the view  Willis winn was expressing that we are lucky not to have more than an  11 percent annual rate of increase contracted for 3 years in the  automobile industry--that building that sort of [wage increase] into  the economy almost guarantees that we are not going to make any  significant progress fighting inflation for 3 years That's  particularly so in an industry where the indications are that it's  moving to supply a diminishing proportion of the domestic market So  we have a market structure that is permitting wages and prices to be  pushed up in that industry And we're really exporting jobs from the  industry and importing increasing amounts of automobiles produced     9/18/79 -17-   abroad That Seems to me to be inconsistent with moving toward the  objectives we presumably have in mind   I don't see any answer to this problem in our conventional  use of monetary and fiscal tools except a very, very long, drawn out  and very painful one So it seems to me that we should be trying to  encourage the government to think of ways to break into some of these  wage and price processes in the interest of trying to move more  rapidly to moderate inflation without going through the necessity of  creating horrendous amounts of unemployment for a long period of time  That's all I have, M r   Chairman    Mr Chairman, first I think the Board should  approve the half percentage point increase in the discount rate for  those Reserve Banks that have in a request for that Secondly, along  with those who would like to see more emphasis on the aggregates, I  think it would be desirable to go to an aggregates directive In  terms of the ranges, I could accept either those you have specified or  those in Alternative C Yours are a little more restrictive than  those in "C," but with an aggregates directive hitched to Alternative  C they would not be greatly different And along the lines of Willis  Winn's suggestion--and also consistent with the argument for more  attention to the aggregates instead of a very narrow funds range--1     9/18/79 -41-   would allow a little more [flexibility] on the funds rate with a range  such as 11-1/4 to 12-1/4 percent    Did you see evidence of a credit crunch in  that earlier period?    M r   Chairman, i picked up on your earlier  observation that we can get there either way--with some modification  of our present technique or by shifting emphasis to reserves to a  greater degree I’m somewhat inclined to think that if we do announce  that we have made a rather basic change in our mode of operation--in  our intermediate if not ultimate operational target--that unless it  obviously is a disaster fairly soon, it is something we are stuck with  for some period of time I don’t have any strong feeling as to which  way we try to get where it seems we want to go at the moment We can  do it through the route of a monetary aggregates directive under our  present format, with a broad range for the federal funds rate, lifted,  and with a continued focus on targets set in terms of monetary  aggregates Or we can go the route that is suggested in the wire of     10/6/79 -21-   putting greater emphasis essentially on intermediate targets or  reserves [Secretary's note The memo entitled "Proposal for Reserve  Aggregates as Guide to Open Market Operations," dated October 4, 1979  was wired to Reserve Bank Presidents] But it seems to me that  there's a good possibility that if we adopt that [latter approach] we  will be read as de-emphasizing rather than additionally emphasizing  the monetary aggregates as targets or objectives of policy    We will be read as accepting some reserve  measure as the objective--a kind of M target in the financial sector  before we get over to the real sector As I say, I agree with your  suggestion that we can get where we want to go by either route It  would seem to me that it might be appropriate to take [action] in two  steps The first step would be an announcement that we are  substantially broadening the operating range as far as the federal  funds rate is concerned and that we are committing ourselves to more  effective control of the monetary aggregates by that process It  seems to me that that would get the necessary attention in the market,  and operationally I don't really see that it's much different    Is it presumed, Mr Chairman, that we would  release to the public the same items of information as we do now?    Voting members or all of us?     10/6/79 - 5 0 -     We would concur with your recommendation, Mr  Chairman I’m not sure if this is being different, but to pick up on  Mr Guffey’s suggestion about going the full limit on the 15-1/2  percent, I agree that before running much above that for a week we  might want to compare notes again I think we probably should move up  some on the discount rate, and I would share fully those comments that  referred to credibility It seems as if we are out there now and we  must deliver    Did I understand you to say that you are  expecting essentially an equivalent move in the consumer price index  for these countries, from a 9 percent rate of increase to 7 percent?   M R   TRUMAN This quarter in round numbers it‘s 9-1/4  percent; a year from now it’s 7-1/2 percent It looks like their  consumer price inflation rate peaked last quarter at 11 percent plus  [We expect] some moderation And they don‘t have the assistance of  housing costs and things like that on their consumer price index    With the rising price of energy--and I’m  thinking now primarily of electric energy--and a presumed move by  industry to use it more efficiently, is there a possibility that that  will give us a lower industrial production index than we might  overwise have had?    Well, it simply implies, does it not, that total reserves is our overriding target? And if that's true, then it seems to me that it doesn't present any great problem to accept a response by the staff on nonborrowed for the purpose of trying to move toward what we want on total reserves   Mr Chairman, it seems to me that we're not going to have the privilege of avoiding making some fairly definite commitment as to what our policy posture will be beyond 1980 There's also a possibility of getting some positive mileage from taking a fairly specific posture as to our plans regarding the orientation of monetary policy beyond 1980 because if we're going to be able to make progress on the inflation front, we've got to begin to have an effect on long-term contracts Such contracts have become a fairly common part of the economic environment, particularly in the wages sector So it seems to me that we should be serving up notice to those who engage in the making of long-term contracts that insofar as the monetary policy environment within which those contracts will be made or lived through is concerned, it will be a changing part of the [overall] environment And it will be changing in the direction the Vice Chairman has suggested of trying to work toward lower numbers And, as I believed you mentioned, if we don't say it, there's a fair probability that the Congress will say it in harder terms than we would be inclined to say it So, I think the prospective benefits lie rather clearly on the side of saying something [about the period] beyond 1980 And what has to be said is that we will be moving gradually to smaller growth rate numbers both for money and bank credit, trying to make it sound as credible as possible   I would not give numbers unless in a final showdown we have to give numbers to avoid numbers being legislated But I would go so far as to be rather unequivocal in terms of stating that we have every intention of having diminishing magnitudes of monetary growth rates and credit expansion in each of the succeeding 2 or 3 years If it develops that it is simply not possible to live by those plans, I think we still might have purchased something beneficial rather than negative on balance Furthermore, we have the opportunity to make adjustments midstream; if developments come along which are so persuasive that we need to make adjustments midstream, the provision is there for that But I'd be inclined not to make adjustments midstream unless the case for doing so were very, very  -35-    1/8-9/80  persuasive--so persuasive that we would appear just not to be in touch with the real world unless we did make adjustments  Now, on where we come out for 1980, I find your observation persuasive that we simply cannot appear to be giving higher targets than our experience in 1979 With respect to a specific target or a range, my own preference since we started setting targets has been to set a specific target, recognizing that we will never hit a specific target but nevertheless having something specific to shoot at I would feel in view of the great uncertainties we're looking at that there may be some benefits to a range for 1980 But if we were to give a wider range than we used in 1979, we would lose credibility I think it would be a mistake to widen the range of the target, whatever target we select for 1980, from what we had in 1979 That's about all I'll say right now   I had hoped we would take that up tomorrow   Well, my inclination would be something on the order of our experience in '79 with a downward tilt In other words, if we [adopt] a range, I'd put the midpoint of the range below the experience in '79 If we pick a specific target, I'd say the highest it should be is the absolute increase in '79   Mr Chairman, it seems to me that the targets set out in alternative C have a good probability of coming pretty  -68-    1/8-9/80  close to serving the needs of the environment as they unfold in the next couple of months or so I've been rather impressed with the observation through time and in conversations here that we can't have much influence on how the expansion in money and credit is allocated between production and prices The indication is that the structure of the economy and expectations are tending to allocate it more and more to prices and less and less to production, which leaves us in an awkward situation of simply embracing or accepting it or seeking greater slack in the economy--and probably for a fairly long period of time--in order to make some increased impact on the inflation problem But it seems to me that the inflation problem must be given priority in part because the darn thing just keeps getting worse and worse I'd be prepared to accept pretty much whatever interest rate pattern evolved during the appropriate time period as a result of pursuing these quantitative targets   Mr Chairman, like Bob, my speech has been pretty well given I'll start with a conclusion I think it would be a mistake to make a change right now There are several reasons In addition to the ones that have been given, I think the magnitude of the problem has not been demonstrated to be great enough to justify the cost of a change at this time We knew when we made the change years ago to lagged reserve accounting that it would have the effect it is having But at that point we judged that the membership benefits overrode the negative effects it would have on the linkage between the policy target and achieving the target It seems to me that the balance today is even stronger in the direction of membership than it was at the time we made the change And my recollection is that the views we received from the Manager of the System Account then were the same as have been expressed today The Desk did not see it as presenting an insurmountable operating problem As to the suggestion that it's irrelevant if we're operating with a federal funds target, I find that persuasive But it does seem to me that it's inappropriate to throw into the same box the net borrowed reserve target That seems to me a different animal than the federal funds target And the suggestion that we have to achieve the monetary aggregate target through interest rate effects is a part of any operating procedure The people who borrow from banks and the bank officials who are handling banks' investment decisions are operating in response to interest rates And it's through the interface of the banks and their customers that the asset side of their balance sheet is affected, and then the liability side seems to me to flow from that So we cannot escape working through the interest rates in the market to achieve influence on the monetary aggregates I think that's true whether we try to work through some reserve aggregate or a federal funds target or a net borrowed reserve target It comes down to our ability, whatever the target, [to determine] the linkage between [our objectives] and the aggregate we attempt to affect But in the final analysis [the key is] our willingness to let our efforts influence interest rates in the market  Along with Bob's reference to a couple of items and gimmicks in the literature, I was expecting to see at least some passing reference--to use the vernacular on the table--to a "gimmick" that was kicked around fairly extensively a number of years ago namely, grouping banks into about five groups and having their reserve settlement dates come up on a different day of the week    2/4-5/80   Well, I don't know whether [those in] the profession--   On the willingness to let that [academic] feud quiet down Was it a matter of your persuading them or simply that they felt we turned off our hearing aids?   It seems to me that we should anticipate that that will likely surface again So, my view, Mr Chairman, is that we should not change at the present time I agree with the conclusion that our present mode of operation would work a little better if we were on a concurrent basis But I think the cost of going there would be excessive now   I move slowly now so I didn't really capture what you said in that very last statement If the Bundesbank sells dollars and takes in marks presumably, you say we may share in those marks What are you telling us?   Are you telling us that the procedure has a possibility of lightening our mark debt?   Are you projecting a reduction in our mark debt?   Our decision as to whether to use any marks we acquire for the purpose of repaying debt will hinge not on the fact that we've got some marks but rather on what is happening in the exchange rates?   Mr Chairman, a question [to the staff] first Insofar as there may be a windfall profits tax, are you assuming that the revenues raised thereby will be placed back into the economy or is that pretty much outside the projections here?   Thank you I don't have a view significantly different from the staff I think the degree of uncertainty in the outlook is not unusual at this point in time; it's probably less now than it was a couple of months ago It seems to me that the cork is out of the defense expenditure bottle now and that that will probably go along about as fast as orders can be placed and procurement can be stepped up That leads me to think that insofar as we may deviate from the staff projection it is likely to be in the direction of a stronger economy, less progress on the inflation front, and probably a little less build-up in unemployment But for our purposes here, I am perfectly satisfied to accept the staff projections If I were to shade away from them, it would be in the direction I have indicated In addition to the defense spending, I have a view similar to the New York Bank's view that consumers are still in the process of adjusting to inflation and that the saving rate is likely to stay very low until they do see some improvement on the inflation side   Mr Chairman, I am inclined pretty much along the line on which Bob Black started this discussion in that narrower ranges would seem desirable And if we take a narrower range, then it seems to me that alternative II is appropriate If we retain the wide range as stated in the Bluebook, which I am characterizing as wide, then I would be inclined to alternative III so as to get the ceilings down a bit I am impressed also with Governor Wallich's comments In fact, I have been inclined to postulate that the pace at which money substitutes or near monies are developed is quite possibly a function of the degree of restraint that we are attempting to impose upon the system Consequently, the system may have substantial leakage or, alternatively, substantial elasticity And that would tend to argue in favor of moving to pretty low numbers for the growth rates of the items reported here I rather expect that is what we will experience as we move through the next two or three years and that we will have to move to growth rates in these conventional measures well below any that are currently contemplated if, in fact, we are going to make much impact on inflation In presenting your views, I would think you are going to have to say something about 1981 as well as 1980 And it seems to me some rationalization along that line may be required in terms of fitting the growth rate numbers projected for 1980 with the idea that we need to have an annual reduction in the growth rate numbers until we do get to a non-inflationary environment   Did I understand you to say, Steve, that the March money growth  [projection] is zero?   I would go with the 14 to 18 In fact, I would go with taking [the  limits] off altogether   Mr Chairman, it seems to me that our posture of restraint had begun to bite before this past weekend [If it was] biting before this past weekend, presumably it will bite a little more now I have to admit I've held such views on several earlier occasions, so I don't know how much weight to put on my current view We did hear reports last week, however, of several real estate developers being cut off by large banks in our District Our recent survey of the agricultural credit situation does not reveal the tightness that has been reported elsewhere in the country And I do have the impression that our farmers are among those who are carrying excessive inventories at the present time, largely in the interest of deferring income tax liabilities  I don't know to what extent the Greenbook projections assume that the capacity of people to adjust to an inflationary environment is behind us or to what extent it might still be ahead us In my area I see indications of a good deal of capacity to adjust further Some of this, of course, flows from the firm linkage that seems to have developed between that area and foreign sources of funds for investment Just to indicate the extreme to which this seems to be going I am told that at the present time builders in our major centers who complete expensive houses which they don't sell promptly to local purchasers sell them to foreign buyers who then furnish them and rent them out And this is a means of investing funds at obviously very low rates of return currently for the purpose of getting into real estate, in this instance in fairly modest-size packages There are a lot of small business firms being sold to foreigners as well, all the way from the family-size motel to the family-size manufacturing firm That seems to be going on yet at a rapid pace I note that the oil drillers have been in Washington recently; they have about as much reason for being here at the present time as the farmers had a year ago and two years ago The number of active rigs is at a 23-year high; the increase during the past month was almost spectacular and the increase over the past year was also very strong  So, the signals are mixed As I say, it seems that credit is biting but activity is still very strong and the outlook is strong I think there's also a good deal of capacity yet on the part of individuals to adjust the management of their financial situation to continued expectations of inflation Possibly one indication of this is the alacrity with which they are willing to give up accumulated interest on CDs for the purpose of turning them in and getting a new one which will carry a higher yield This has resulted in actual lines of people at banks in some recent weeks when the new rate announced was significantly higher than the rates on outstanding CDs  -32-    3/18/80  As to monetary policy, the "C" proposal seems preferable today, primarily for the reasons that Steve Axilrod outlined in his oral remarks Others have commented along that line That's all I have to say   Well, I was going to raise a question as to whether the seasonal adjustment might not have been a factor But I would also like to ask Peter whether he could comment on his confidence or lack thereof in the projected rather strong money growth for May and June shown in the report which I believe was put out in New York   But they use, do they not, something approximating the Greenbook outlook for the general economy?   First, Mr Chairman--and it's possibly a trivial question--on page I-24 in the Greenbook it's reported that one of the reasons for strength in exports of nonagricultural commodities is the high price of silver in [the form of] exported coins Is that a significant business?   Aside from the silver price, was that about a normal volume?   And this is a product in which I take it we compete in the world market?   But it is silver exports in formal coins rather than--   With respect to the general economic forecast, I have no particular quarrel with it It seems to me that the direction and the amount of the revisions from a month ago are quite appropriate in the circumstances With respect to the remarks that have been made here that were oriented to policy, I think I agree with everything that has been said   It seems to me that it is When we adopted our current policy posture, we did it knowing that it was going to give us strong swings in interest rates as we undertook to determine whether or not stabilizing the rate of growth of the money stock imparts stability or instability to the real economy So as I see it, we decided that we would find out whether all of the statistical analysis that has been made through the years has a firm basis And it seems to me that we should stick with it until we do find out  -14-    4/22/80  whether stability or instability flows from stabilizing money stock growth We've redefined money with the idea that we're bringing that back to the real world concept, so to back away right at this point in time would just preclude our achieving what it seems to me is at stake   Could I raise a question on a different subject if we're through with this one?   In view of the policy action taken today, based on the prospects for the economy and so forth, I'd raise a question as to what kind of posture we should be taking now that we're getting our first reports on our consultations with the big banks and big holding companies [regarding the voluntary credit restraint program and its] 6 to 9 percent [limit on overall credit growth] Just by way of example, for all member banks in the Eleventh District thus far total loans have increased at a 12-1/2 percent annual rate But in March they did not increase at all Now, these first reports are going to give indications that [credit growth] will run well in excess of 9 percent, so we have geared up for some rather hard-nosed consultations calling for plans, projections, etc It seems to me that we could rather easily get into a posture here that would look foolish, and that's not a very good posture to be in So I raise a question as to whether you have any advice in that respect   Well, I've gotten what I asked for   I would prefer the 10 percent   We just had a special meeting to approve this We had a special meeting on the presumption that it would be announced promptly; otherwise, we would have waited until Thursday   Mr Chairman, I don't feel that I can dispel any of the uncertainty that has been cited here today It is a very uncertain situation On the credit restraint program, I think it would be desirable to announce that it seems to have achieved its  -21-    5/20/80  objective for the time being at least and, consequently, all required reporting under it will be discontinued with, say, the May reports But [I'd say] the program itself is being put in cold storage for reactivation if and when it is needed That latter part is simply on the assumption that it would be politically expedient to say that forthrightly [rather than imply] it at this point in time But it does seem to me inappropriate to continue a fairly comprehensive reporting program in an environment where it's not doing anything useful for us I think it will look rather foolish to the people who are reporting under the program and not--   Well, yes But we're not getting any of those anyhow, are we?   On the monetary policy issue, it seems to me that the risks are on the side of a fairly extended period of [money growth] running well below target and that, therefore, we should move fairly quickly and fairly decisively to try to get back within our announced target ranges So between alternatives A and B, that would lead me to favor "B" and it would lead me also to suggest that the bottom of the funds rate range should be reduced probably to 8 percent from 9 percent or, if not that far, I could go with Frank's 8-1/2 percent That's all I have, Mr Chairman   Yes   I don't know how useful the observations from down here are, but I do hear reports that houses are moving again and I think the references are primarily about used houses Our department store sales figures are showing increases over a year ago, after running several weeks with no change from a year ago We have questioned the banks on loan demands, and they continue very weak  SPEAKER(?) Texas is not useful!   Is it considered a political no-no to sell gold in the current environment?   Well, it's between selling assets and borrowing money That seems to me the significant difference   There would be some grass roots opposition to it I can report that, but I don't have any impression--   I don't see how it could be opposed   Mr Chairman, as to the general economic and psychological setting, I am persuaded that we are in a situation where our conventional belief no longer stands up that monetary and fiscal policy, if handled appropriately, have the capacity for nudging the economy along a path toward full employment and price stability And I am persuaded that we will not be able to achieve those desirable objectives without engaging in some direct interference in some of the  -31-    7/9/80  price and wage making processes But even if that's true, it seems to me that the best contribution monetary policy can make is to behave as if that were in fact the situation and hope that somewhere along the way the necessary [steps] will be taken to address the structural rigidities in the economy   Well, turning to what's immediately at hand, I think it's a close call as to whether to make any adjustments in the targets that were announced last February I can make a fairly persuasive case either way, I think It seems to me that we are under rather strong pressure to do something with the 6 to 9 percent range on bank credit Of course, if we do that, then we have made a change and that opens up the whole set of ranges for other changes If it were not for that, I would come out on balance for no change If we were to come out [for no change], we could just incorporate some words rationalizing that any time we are aiming at a family of targets, we obviously are not going to be able to hit all of them And in this circumstance we are simply pursuing policies which, as things have developed, give greater priority to the money measures than to the credit measures  With respect to next year, we have a choice of being either fairly specific or quite general If we go the route of being quite general, we should reiterate with some firmness of conviction, as already has been suggested and as we have done previously, that we are of a mind to move to lower rates of monetary growth until such time as we get to that level of growth which is judged to be consistent with full employment under conditions of price stability But as next year has the potential of giving us a fairly unusual looking set of numbers, until such time as we get to the point of presenting those numbers it might be appropriate now to take a little time to elaborate on the point that as the new legislation goes into effect, we think it's going to have a substantial impact Just by way of illustration, its impact could be such that a posture of moderate slowing in the rate of growth of our narrowest money measure might bring our target for growth of that particular measure down to zero So I would want to try to get across that idea It seems to me that if we are going to get much benefit in the economy from monetary policy in this next year or so, it has to flow pretty much from getting across the idea that we are going to impose a policy that will continue to move in the direction of being consistent with price stability, whatever those numbers might be That's all I have right now   Well, I take it as a given that there will be one It's not something that I have endorsed in any of the speeches I have made   We can't affect existing contracts   He will be asked the question of whether that means lower numbers   Dallas agrees   This is Ernest Baughman We--   I see All right   Mr Chairman, given the admission that 1/2 percent is a pretty small number and the emphasis on imprecision and also your expressed concern as to whether the Federal Reserve is really going to maintain an anti-inflationary posture, I'm wondering whether it would be advisable--even though we are thinking in terms of 1/2 percent--to say on the order of 1/2 to 1 percent That would give the impression that we are thinking of a minimum on the order of 1/2 percent   It is implicit in your observations that there is little or no reluctance to borrow in this equation   Is it also thought that the reluctance varies with the level of borrowings?   It seems to me that if the reluctance to borrow increased with the level of borrowings, that would tend to moderate the suggested inability to maintain a penalty rate when borrowings are high  -11-    8/12/80   Mr Chairman, I would be inclined toward "B" We see the economy essentially as the staff has in its outlook, with the exception of the strength in interest rates I am inclined to view the strength we see in interest rates as temporarily greater than justified by what is happening in the economy So I think there may be a softening rather than a continued rise in interest rates The [behavior of] inflation, as has been mentioned, is critical There has been no reference to the presumably substantial additional thrust to prices that is going to flow from the food sector I think it's going to be very difficult to keep that from simply passing through, as our policies over a period of years have permitted energy prices to pass through and raise prices generally through the economy I think it would take pretty substantial restraint to keep that from happening again, in this instance flowing from food Also, I am inclined to think that we're seeing a rather rapid buildup in liquidity in the economy, whether it appears in the particular measures we call money or in other measures In this inflationary environment, it's entirely possible that people will behave with less money the way they normally would behave with more money So I think "B" would be the preferable posture right now   It's not necessarily bad   Capital goods can be built to order   Are there any estimates yet as to the amount and the timing of capital expenditures associated with the energy programs that are now apparently getting shaped up and into form for  -15-    9/16/80  financing either directly by the government or by government guarantees of the interest rates?   Would you anticipate, assuming the program evolved, that we would be speaking about magnitudes of capital expenditures that would become a significant element in the trend of the economy?   As to your question on the turning point, Mr Chairman, I think the staff projection is about as good as can be done I see no reason why it doesn't have as high a probability of materializing as any that might be made And I certainly share the view that we don't seem to have the stage set for a sustained recovery I would visualize the next year or so as an ongoing battle between monetary restraint and the deeply imbedded and still spreading inflationary thrust, with the result that improvements in employment and production may well be a casualty of the struggle between continued [monetary restraint] and the surging inflation thrust   Now that you've provided an opening, there is a continuation of what strikes me as a rather unbelievable volume of new office building construction in all centers of significant population size through the Southwest It does not seem to be slowing down That is, new projects are being planned, funded, announced, and started And the financing for them, particularly the equity money, almost without exception seems to come from foreign sources I'm told that if you can't figure a project so that it looks as if it will be profitable and viable with some debt in it, that presents no particular problem The suppliers of the equity simply supply more  -16-    9/16/80  equity and are willing to take a fairly low computed return on the equity they put in It just goes on seemingly without--   That could well be   Mr Chairman, I think the target in Mr Eastburn's suggestion is probably the appropriate one We are at a stage where we should make a small move on the discount rate I have the impression that there is something of a last gasp with respect to the credibility of the Federal Reserve out there in terms of coming within our targets by the fourth quarter I realize that the ranges are such that we probably can't get all [of the aggregates] into them, but we have to get some of them in and I would suggest that, for whatever reason, those be the important ones I think Governor Gramley is probably right that if we don't come out about there, we are going to get more specific instructions [from Congress] on where we should come out and we may have less freedom of choice in the future   For different reasons   He had different reasons, but wound up in the same place I would like to note also that when we reported to our board of directors last week on the new Regulation A and what we anticipate the guidelines coming along with that will be, we got quite a strong negative reaction They felt it was a significant retrenchment in our posture at the window They have been engaged aggressively in the last couple of years in trying to build better rapport between the institutions in the District and the Federal Reserve and feel they have been making considerable progress They are persuaded that the institutions will see this as a more stringent face at the discount window and that they will have lost credibility with what they view as their clients in that respect   Doesn't even the short-term adjustment we are talking about have to come through interest rates? That is, banks individually presumably are not responding to what we are doing in terms of total reserves or total nonborrowed reserves I'll put it as a question Shouldn't we assume that whatever adjustment we get from our actions that impact on money stock growth has to come through the interest rate circuit? It doesn't come directly through the manipulation of reserves   I don't think you can; therefore, I don't think we are talking about two separate things In other words, the effects on the economy are through the interest rate and the effects on money stock are through the manipulation of reserves It seems to me that they are both through the interest rate and that should be recognized To me the lag aspect of the reserve part of the mechanism is not too important; if we focus on it, it seems to me that we are exaggerating its importance   That's where the focus needs to be And that brings to the surface again this idea that if one is going to focus pretty closely on the aggregates and accepts the desirability of stability in the movement of the aggregates, then one just has to accept a lot of flexibility in interest rates in the short term   And if we don't go that route, then it seems to me we come back to the old problem we had--which we apparently didn't handle too well--namely, our ability to project what level of interest rates will give us what we want in some other measure   Did you say project or reject?   I was going to make this remark later, but it may fit better now in view of the discussion It seems to me that another thing that falls out of this recent experience is the possibility that we need to move in the direction of relatively more weight on, or attention to, the broader concepts of money There are institutional changes taking place and, I gather, an increased amount of speculative activity flowing from the rising concern about inflation in the economy and an increasing tendency to shorten commitments I thought that was captured very well in the paragraph in part I of the Greenbook that begins at the bottom of page 14 and concludes on the top of page 15 on how funds are flowing between the categories we include in M-1A, M-1B, and M2 It seems to me that we are seeing relatively more stability in the broader [M2] measure, and that measure is one which is more and more becoming a closer  -20-    10/21/80  approximation of what people view as money or something they can use as money We may be exaggerating the importance of achieving targets in a fairly stable way on [the basis of] an unduly narrow concept of money or what people are looking at when they behave in a way that we think has a relationship to money   This has the further link in terms of what items we attach reserve requirements to It seems to me that book needs to be kept open to the extent we can keep it open   Mr Chairman, briefly I'll make comments in three areas One, on the local situation, we get reports of very high levels of activity across the border between the United States and Mexico Apparently that's still strengthening in just about all aspects, and it's presumed that both the legal and illegal traffic is moving apace Oil and gas activity, as you probably all know, is continuing to boom And prices of both the rights to make holes in the earth and of the equipment to do so are up sharply and continuing to rise rapidly, reflecting the views of the people who engage in that activity An illustration of the kinds of distortion which government programs can inject into an activity, with which we are all familiar, can be observed in the agricultural sector at the present time We are having very low production on land which has [been subject to] bad weather this past summer; nevertheless, with the high prices, it would still be economic to harvest the crop in that the market price would cover more than the harvesting cost But if the crop is declared a complete failure and not harvested at all, [farmers] will receive a bit more income than they would if they went through the harvesting operation So we have some reduction in [potential farm] production because the government disaster payments exceed the market value of the product  With respect to the general economic projections, I am less comfortable with them this time than I usually am If my recollection is correct, the current staff projections are about the same as those I reported when we had our round-up last July or August And I can assure you that there is no basis for drawing any comfort in having an economic projection which is the same as the one that I may have made With respect to progress on the economic and inflation fronts, as some of you know I have held the view for two, three years, that we're not going to handle this problem unless we develop some kind of machinery for direct interference, particularly in the wage market And it was of interest to me that a locally domiciled airline, which is struggling with a problem currently, has under serious negotiations with its employees the possibility of a 10 percent pay cut While I wouldn't expect to see that sort of thing spread generally through the economy, it seems to me that we've got to find some machinery for beginning to get those kinds of questions raised  -32-    10/21/80   With respect to monetary policy, it seems to me that the Committee should go with alternative A And bearing on the comments with respect to our communications with the public on monetary policy, it seems to me that we might buy a little in that area if we were to adopt the procedure of routinely moving the funds rate range at a meeting so that it centers on the current funds rate, as compared with leaving a specified range stand for a long period with market developments at times making it bump against the bottom of the range and at other times making it nudge against the top And I would not see such a change in what we report as necessarily providing any restraint on what we actually decide with respect to shaping and implementing policy That's all I have to say   Mr Chairman, I am a rather pessimistic guy these days and I couldn't get cheered up any with the discussion here this morning I think there is much to what Mr Partee has said about prices and wages, even given fairly strong monetary and fiscal pressures and whatever pressures [come from] substantial unused resources in the economy And that means to me that about all monetary policy can do is to avoid fueling additional inflation Even though we have had what we thought was a fairly tight policy for the last couple of years it has nevertheless accommodated additional inflation, so we must be pretty careful to try to avoid that situation continuing in 1981 I am not impressed with the idea that we can slowly and gradually wring inflation out of the economy using monetary and fiscal policy I see inflation strengthening and I see more and more people apparently making a very good living out of marketing inflation protection gadgetry and developing what seems to me to be very high risk loans or uses of credit for that purpose I read that as indicating that inflation momentum or expectations are still strengthening rather than weakening  On monetary policy, I would think that the surcharge will pretty effectively discourage borrowing by the large banks, so I would not expect high levels of borrowing in the weeks immediately ahead With respect to the monetary targets and the federal funds rate, alternative B seems to me about as good as one can do in the current circumstances I believe it would be appropriate to hitch on to the "B" aggregate figures the suggestion that they serve as ceilings rather than midpoints And I am sorry to share the view that we do have a fairly near-term end to this recovery that has gotten started, given what needs to be done in terms of monetary and fiscal [policy]   I would think, Mr Chairman--and I presume this is going on or will go on--that it would be desirable to get the new President to commit his credibility as early as possible to attacking inflation for the purpose of trying to erode somewhat the possibility that we will be standing out there alone   But I think that's a pretty small group   I know it's a very vocal group but I think it's pretty small   I assume we're not prepared to disavow that   Very often [the interpretation is] even narrower It's if you wouldn't print so much money   I have substantial uncertainty, but no reluctance Yes   In the Dallas District we haven't felt that the borrowing is at that level   This is Baughman It seems to me that I am sitting here listening to arguments for taking [the limit] off   The proposal is acceptable to me   Dallas Okay   It seems to me, Mr Chairman, that it might be appropriate for a lame duck to quack last  SPEAKER(?) No quacks, please!   Important things first My answer to Bob Mayo's question is pecan pie   As for the economy, it seems to me that the outlook is for no growth or worse for the United States Further, as Nancy has already alluded to within that framework, the numbers on housing and autos just chill one's teeth But I'm inclined to agree with that as the outlook With respect to the Southwest, it looks as if things will continue to boom along and for two reasons primarily the energy situation and the fact that the Southwest apparently will get a break compared with some other parts of the country from defense expenditures We assume they will be increased or, even if they are not increased significantly, that the shift in their make-up will [be beneficial to our area]  As has been the case for the last several years, the forces of inflation in the economy seem stronger than the forces of expansion Unless something different is done, we will continue to be compelled to trade off employment and production as we attempt to restrain inflation And the results of that exercise will not be  -59-    12/18-19/80  particularly satisfying; in fact, the results may well be a continuing acceleration of inflation and a decline in the growth [of economic activity] This suggests that the gradualism strategy or the slow persistent pressure hasn't been working, and I don't see any reason to expect that the situation will change Therefore, if the incoming Administration is inclined to embrace something they call an emergency philosophy and propose some program of action under that caption--and to my surprise there is some noise of that around now--I think that is a development that should be encouraged and supported And hopefully, under that kind of program, we would succeed in getting some restraint on the rate of growth in government spending and a fairly broad array of actions to begin to free up the economy and make it somewhat more flexible than it is Only by making progress in that area are we likely to be able to get the benefits of monetary and fiscal policy that we'd like to have in the way of a favorable tradeoff among growth and employment and inflation  A suggestion came up in our board of directors meeting last time around--and it came from the directors not from the staff--that a change in our targets on the order of a reduction of 1/2 percentage point would simply be shrugged off as inconsequential, particularly given the ranges of the targets And they finally wound up adopting a resolution suggesting that I carry their view down here that the targets should be reduced on the order of 20 to 25 percent for 1981 compared to what they were for 1980 There was a good deal of discussion It was initially suggested that we reduce them by 1-1/2 points; but after some discussion they settled on 20 to 25 percent as being a preferable characterization As to the base for the [1981] targets, I would rather present the targets to the Congress and to the public using the 1980 base; in other words, I'd avoid appearing to accept the drift in the base even if that necessitated using larger numbers than if we did accept the base drift It seems to me that base drift has become a pretty sensitive issue and one on which we are likely to lose if we take on its defense in the public arena  With respect to wider ranges, I can appreciate the statistical evidence in support of the need for that but, again, a public proposal of wider ranges is likely to erode our credibility So I think we would be better off not to widen the ranges even at some fairly high risk of not coming within them It also seems to me that we are almost going to be forced to talk in terms of something more than the next year if we are going to look credible, particularly if we were to take the position of accepting base drift and having rather wide ranges and then saying we are going to cut our targets by 1/2 percentage point That would be construed as raising rather than reducing the targets and probably would be construed as abandoning or weakening our resistance against inflation  With respect to [which aggregates to] target, granting all the [uncertainties] involved, we probably would be best off to try to emphasize M2 because it has less danger built into it for 1981 than the alternatives With respect to the strategies suggested, we pretty much have to go either with I or IV And since we have talked enough about gradually moving toward non-inflationary monetary growth rates, strategy I is preferable to strategy IV in that respect If we were to go to strategy IV, feeling that growth rates of that magnitude for 1981 were feasible, then I would think [we'd want] some downward progression there But we need to bear in mind that unless we put  -60-    12/18-19/80  them out, nobody is going to know what our projections are for '82 and '83 and, therefore, we will be read and evaluated on what we put out for '81 Looking at [the scenarios described in the Bluebook], we'd look better giving them the whole picture than just the first timeframe I admit I still hold the view that with all the uncertainties involved we can get more mileage out of announcing our plans and intentions over a longer timeframe than one year, even at the risk of necessitating revising it later on Well, for what it's worth, those are the views of the lame duck
