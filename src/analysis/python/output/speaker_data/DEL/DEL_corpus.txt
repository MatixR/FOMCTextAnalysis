  Let me address one thing about the misspecification  Of course, big   forecast errors translate into shocks in this model  That has to be the case  However, because   these models are estimated, the econometrician learns, and the model learns, from past mistakes    The model hates having big forecast errors  [Laughter]  And, therefore, parameter estimates   adjust  That happens, for instance, for the incorporation of financial frictions with data coming   from the crisis   June 21–22, 2011 14 of 282              Getting back to your question about the balance sheet, the New York model has, in a very   coarse way, an idea of leverage  Leverage is fundamental to explain the financial frictions in the   model  So, at a very high level, we can talk about leverage—of course, probably not to the very   specific extent that you want us to talk about it, but there is model development in terms of   having a finer banking system  We hope that in the future we will be better able to address your   questions  The other models also address, to some extent, these other shocks, like marginal   efficiency and investment shocks, that capture financial frictions  Thank you     I want to clarify a little bit of what Mike said  Gaps, I think, are an   important part of these models  In fact, getting back to your questions, the headwinds—a slower   recovery from the financial crisis—is largely a gap story; it’s not a trend in output now being   lower  It’s a gap caused by shocks that have a very prolonged effect on output, depress   economic activity, and therefore keep inflation low  Now, maybe what Mike was referring to,   and you as well, is that there are various ways of measuring gaps  One is related to the trend in   output, and another is relative to a hypothetical universe without nominal rigidities  Well, the   second way is actually very challenging, as shown in a recent paper by Justiniano, Primiceri, and   Tambalotti, because it involves a number of conceptual and measurement issues  We don’t yet   have measures of this alternative gap, but it plays a role in the model, and we can certainly   provide them to you in due time
