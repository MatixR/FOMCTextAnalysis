 Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]  Not that I'm aware of As I understand it, and of course we don't really have a great deal of information about it, it was more in the nature of urging all the participants to act and to act promptly  Well, it involved the EMS and the Swiss In addition, the Germans did talk to the Japanese I didn't mention the Japanese The Japanese did undertake some intervention but it wasn't entirely clear whether they would have done so anyhow or whether it was part of the German's attempt to mobilize a general effort  If we [encountered] another one of these situations, it would be perfectly reasonable to expect them to do the same thing Some of the Germans, as you know, have not been very keen on a coordinated dollar policy; they've changed their views on that subject So it is significant in that respect  That fits my definition  I was really thinking in terms of a sudden decline of a very major amount For one thing, it does develop among the participants of the market [a recognition of] the fact that this kind of thing can happen It would make the participants, I would think, quite chary about the extent to which they would get in there and make a market, if it's going to be subject to that kind of movement Even pork bellies have a limit on how much the price can decline It might in a sense undermine the strength of the market  I would think so, yes  Spreads widened and there was a kind of discontinuous market It moved down to a point and then the next transaction would move down the next step, all in the space of a very few minutes There have been newspaper articles on it People in the market described it as "madness" and various other lurid words, but apparently it was, at least to participants in the market, something that did shake them up considerably  Yes  It moved up once after the German effort; it went up from about 252 to 254 and then I think it went up a little higher But it's now 247, so it has declined substantially since they first made the effort, and they regard it as a very successful move  Yes, it seems to have the same problem of not having anything it can really hold on to There are no verities on which to operate  [Unintelligible]  [Recommendation--see Appendix]  SPEAKER(?) So, the proposal is to give us enough room to accommodate the interest receipts for about the next six months?  We're way below  The figure of $425 billion is made up of $1 billion in yen, $275 billion in DM, and $500 million in other currencies I assume it would be legal, I'm not sure, to modify the makeup of that in some way  Right  That's correct  I assume this is not anything that gets announced; it's just an informal [understanding]   [Statement--see Appendix]  The impact on the rate movement?  There was a large withdrawal--well, not a withdrawal, but a--  There was a run-off of securities--Treasury bills and notes that the Libyans held here--of a fairly substantial amount But I don't think and have not heard that it was an important factor in the exchange rate situation But as Treasury bills and notes matured, the Libyans have drawn down their holdings  Well, we're certainly doing everything we can to maintain it It's always a little easier if we're more involved in the operations, I think But we're trying to do what we can, of course, to keep in close contact and to get all the information we can There had been some talk by one or two of the lower level people in some of the European central banks that if the United States isn't going to be in the game, so to speak, perhaps we should not participate to the extent we have in the exchange of information At this point, it has not been anything other than a statement by one or two officials, and I don't see any reason at this point that they would not continue [to exchange information]   I've had to suffer a lot of comments on that! [Statement--see Appendix]  It was an occasion when the dollar was moving up very rapidly toward the 230 to 232 level It occurred at a time when questions were being raised about the German situation after the Chancellor's health problems and after some money figures here had suggested that interest rates might be required to go up again at that point The dollar spurted up from about 228 to 232 and that caused a considerable amount of consternation But [the advance] lasted only a matter of hours and the dollar then began to retreat  I don't think the rise could be associated with a single event at that point; it was certainly not comparable to the assassination of President Sadat  Yes I do, Mr Chairman All of our swap arrangements will be coming up for renewal before the end of the year, and I would request the Committee's approval to roll them over for another year in the normal way Since last year [there have been changes] in three cases The central banks of England, Canada, and Mexico have specified the investments against which the interest rates should be calculated in the event that the Federal Reserve were to draw on those swaps For good order we would propose that the change in the arrangements with these three central banks be incorporated in the language at the time we renew them  Yes  Well, symmetrical--    11/17/81  And these three do not correct all of them There are still some in that unspecified category  Some of them are not specified  Thank you    [Statement--see Appendix]       The question was  From where did the authority  come to intervene?  The New York Federal Reserve Bank was instructed  by the Chairman on the basis of discussions between the Treasury and  the Federal Reserve       The mark hit a peak in the Far Eastern trading  of about 236-1/2 and the rates in terms of the other [currencies]  were similar  But in terms of DM it went down to about 233 when  Europe began its operations  Also, the Japanese intervened in their  market Then as the European markets opened there was intervention by  the German authorities and also some profit-taking and the rate  continued to come down to 230  And then in the middle of the  morning here it was down to about 228  So, during the entire period  when our markets were open, the rates were coming back into balance  and the pressures were subsiding  But we had the authority to step  in had the movement gone the other way and had it looked as though  the rates were beginning to spurt back up with the dollar getting  stronger and the mark and yen and other currencies weakening  But we  did not use the authority       228       The market has been quite unsettled all week   On Friday the rate in terms of DM again--I hate to keep talking about  that one, but it is convenient--hit 230 in the European markets  It  started at 227-1/2 on the previous trading day, went up to 230, and  came back down to 227-1/2 during our trading day  Then after the  money supply figures were announced, it went up to 228-1/4 roughly  So there was an awful lot of movement during many of these days       That's correct  It has been a very thin market,  particularly coming as it does near the end of the year when we are  told that not only the banks but the corporations are interested in  getting their books cleaned up and don't want to take new positions  and so forth  There are not many operators out there making markets,  so if anybody has something that he has to do in terms of business,  it seems to move the rate by quite a substantial amount with a  relatively small amount of activity  I would agree with you that the  markets have been quite unsettled      Both the Germans and the Japanese intervened during this latest spate of activities  Well, I don't know when it is going to come to a head The banks were supposed to enter into an agreement, a prior condition of which was that they should receive the arrears But they didn't receive the interest in arrears They received a telegram asking if they could make $350 million of loans available The last we heard is that the banks were talking to each other about what to do But there does not seem to be, at least among the people we talk to, any great disposition to provide more money to the Poles  They requested what they called a bridge loan Some of [the banks] thought it looked more like a pier than a bridge  This covers three-fourths of the year The banks and the Poles were supposed to meet on December 28, I think, to sign the agreement; and they wanted the payment cleaned up two weeks early, which was December 14, so they wouldn't sit down at a table and not be able to sign But that day passed and the payments weren't made   Well, Mr Chairman, that comes close to the conclusion of what I was going to say [Statement--see Appendix]  It seems to have followed pretty closely, at least during these recent weeks, the changes in the interest rate differentials I haven't looked back to compare that very thoroughly with earlier periods, but it does seem to have happened in this period Mr Chairman, I also do have a recommendation  [Secretary's note Text of Mr Cross's recommendation not extant Staff notes indicate that he recommended a $1/4 billion increase to $3-1/4 billion in the informal limit on holdings of German marks and an increase of the same amount to $4-3/4 billion on the limit of holdings of all foreign currencies to allow for the accrual of interest on mark balances]  If we intervene, then we will need to modify that further  It's an informal agreement, I believe  We're very close to the [current] limit at the moment  Yes, $12 million  If you raise it now, then we have that much scope and we will be receiving those interest receipts over the next five months  The present overall limit is $4-1/2 billion The Committee could raise it to $5 billion, which would give us a little scope just in case  I would recommend [raising the overall informal limit to] $5 billion and raising [the informal mark limit] by $1/2 billion [to $3-1/2 billion]   [Statement--see Appendix]  I must confess I've been away for a few days, but I believe the Polish financing was to be signed as it affected the 1981 maturities And I assume that it has been signed  Oh, is it next week?  As of about a week ago they still were not current as far as we could tell from the banks They had paid off large amounts of it, but most of the banks indicated that they hadn't quite settled everything The assumption seems to be that they will meet those payments and be ready for the April 6 payment to cover 1981  Well, they seem to feel that if there is a coordinated effort, it will have considerably more effect in modifying the market psychology and in indicating that there will be a sustained effort to keep the rates from moving too strongly in the direction they're now moving One certainly gets the impression that among the major European countries, Germany does not seem to be intervening very much at present and Switzerland has intervened relatively modestly Japan, as I say, has done dollars of intervention; still, that's not massive And they do indicate to us in their discussions a feeling that if there is to be any sustained and successful effort to affect these rates, it does require US participation as well  The yen is weak I'm not sure I have an extremely compelling explanation One factor has been that, while we're all expecting the Japanese to have a very large current account surplus this year, the recent figures have not been that rosy They have not shown a very strong current account position in the past couple of months Another factor, I think, is that people are concerned that the rest of the world is going to take steps to reduce access to Japanese goods The EC has talked about bringing this matter up under GATT and they have brought it up under GATT There is, of course, legislation in our Congress which would apply a bilateral reciprocity rule to it Now, whether these are the factors that have resulted in this effect, I can't say The yen has been very, very weak and I'm not sure those explanations would be completely convincing But they are factors in it  Well, the devaluation by Mexico was certainly regarded initially as very useful--a successful move in that there were reflows of capital back into Mexico and a reversal of the dollarization that Mexico experienced So, during the first few weeks there was a very rosy and successful view about it But there has been a notable lack of a supporting program and increasing concern about the lack of such a program At the present time there has been a decree to increase wages by really very, very large amounts-- amounts which almost nobody thinks can be justified by the devaluation Mexico had a very large increase in the minimum wage in January of 33 percent Another 30 percent has been proposed; the employers haven't yet agreed to all of this So, that adds up to a [cumulative] 73 percent wage increase in the first 2 or 3 months of the year And everybody is beginning to wonder how long the peso can remain at the level it now is with these kinds of wage increases and the expectation that inflation will run at 50 percent or so this year at a time when US inflation is 7-1/2 percent or so So, it appears that the initial reaction, which was so favorable, is now giving way to second thoughts The reflows are perhaps tailing off and there is some concern about what is going to happen in the months ahead  In Mexico? The numbers that I received were 5 percent for the month of January, 4 percent for the month of February, and an expectation of 8 percent for the month of March That's [over] 17 percent in the first 3 months, so most of the people who are making estimates have estimates for the year of between 45 and 65 percent  Yes The 8 percent reflected the devaluation Last year it was about 30 percent    3/29-30/82   [Statement--see Appendix]  We defer to you on the assumption that you would want to make a proposal, Mr Chairman  That's right  It matured today but it may be extended a day or two if they don't work out that problem   [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, there certainly have been some other problem situations  The Argentines have been mentioned a great deal, and currently they have an IMF [team] down there looking toward the possibility of a Fund program for Argentina They also are seeking some assistance from the BIS and from commercial banks The Brazilians feel that they are being [adversely] affected largely by the spillover effects of the Mexican and the Argentine problems For a period they found it very, very difficult to roll over their maturing debt, but more recently they sounded a bit more encouraged [so] that situation looks a little better But you're quite right that there are a number of these very difficult situations, with monetary troubles in the period [ahead] for a lot of countries down there   [Statement--see Appendix]   [Statement--see Appendix]  Very likely  Gold tranche  Well, before six months  By the end of June  That's the scheme    I think so  It's already  We  I think their balance sheet is about $6 billion but a lot of it is tied up at this point  Also with the Brazilian deal the BIS provides the cash and there's nothing to be--  Right  I have a $19 billion estimate  -71-    12/20-21/82  Well, the Fund got burned in a couple of cases where they financed some programs and it looked as though some of their money was being used to pay off the banks and that made it much worse So, they've gone further and further along this line of insisting on getting the money there up front   We've been waiting patiently for two days  [Statement--see Appendix]   No changes are recommended  What kind of authority does this give us?  These are procedural restrictions, which set out limits on how much we can--  And the currencies we can deal in  Yes  Yes  There is an aggregate limit Let me check on whether Committee action is required on that It is required  It is required, but a change can be approved by the Subcommittee, which would be subsequently taken to the Committee [for ratification]  That's the only one  It was increased to $5 billion last year and the German mark portion of that was increased to $3-1/2 billion Now we are getting close to that $3-1/2 billion limit We do not expect to need it within the next few weeks, but we are not that far away from    3/28-29/83  the limit and we continue to earn interest on these marks, so it is a matter of time before we may need to change that limit  We're under [no] pressure on the yen limit  Yes, interest earnings  They're put in and then taken back out  The currencies you are talking about are the currencies held by the Treasury The currencies that we hold under warehousing [agreements] are in addition  Well, Mr Chairman, let me say that since we're getting close to the limit on [marks] and the Committee has had this chance to discuss it, you may want to consider whether to raise it  May and July  [Statement--see Appendix]  Mr Chairman, I would also like to get back to the question of the possible increase in the limits on the currencies we hold The present limit is now $5 billion overall of which $3-1/2 billion represents maximum holdings of German marks We are now at about $3450 billion marks--in other words, $50 million below the DM limit We're not going to run against that limit immediately, but with the continued receipt of interest earnings it would be appropriate to provide some additional room for these earnings to accumulate I would like to recommend that the Committee consider an increase from $5 billion to $5-1/2 billion for the overall limit and an increase from $3-1/2 billion to $4 billion for the DM portion  We have $500 million left under [the $1 billion informal limit]  Right  We're only $50 million below  We get about $25 or $30 million a month  The mark has been quite weak recently  Dollars  The others are very tiny balances of several currencies Holdings of Canadian dollars, I think, are very modest  No  It has changed over the course of the day There have been a number of days when these exchange rates have moved by, say, 1 percent The mark got down to over 243 today It closed at 242-1/4 on Friday The dollar in terms of DM got down below 243    3/28-29/83  again There have been a substantial number of occasions where the DM has moved a couple of pfennigs or even more and the yen has moved by a comparable amount So, a 1 percent movement in these rates is by no means unusual And there have been a lot of periods when there have been substantially higher pressures Throughout this period there has been a considerable amount of volatility in these rates and a considerable amount of nervousness and unsettlement  It would not be a large amount if our policy were one in which there were more intervention; $500 million is not a large amount if we're intervening with very much activity  Oh, yes And that would be time enough to convene the Subcommittee  All within the $8 billion  Yes, it would  SPEAKER(?) That's around $30 million a month  It would carry us for several months   [Statement--see Appendix]  No This is a special swap, which is a part of the BIS-US facility including [the Federal Reserve] and the US Treasury    5/24/83  Yes  It's $185 billion less what they pay next week It would be $15 billion   [Statement--see Appendix]  The Treasury has $500 million out of $1250 million   [Statement--see Appendix]  It's about $3-1/2 billion  Yes  The first day that we intervened, which occurred rather late in the afternoon, it was intervention by the United States [only] but we had talked with the other central banks about what we intended to do Then, subsequently, we were acting more or less in concert  Yes, I saw some reports that were wrong  Our share of the intervention was $250 million  Intervention by the Europeans and others was $24 billion    8/23/83   [Statement--see Appendix]   [Statement--see Appendix] I also have a recommendation, Mr Chairman All of the Federal Reserve System regular swap arrangements with foreign central banks and the BIS will come up for renewal in December And I recommend that all the swap arrangements be renewed We would propose no change in the terms of the agreements except that in the swap arrangement with the Bank of Japan we are discussing a possible change in the interest rate  -29-    11/14-15/83  provision The change under discussion would provide a more favorable basis for calculating the interest cost in the event of a United States drawing under the Japanese swap arrangement We still do not have that negotiated with the Japanese but if it comes about in time and we can do it, we would like to introduce that change in the renewed Japanese swap agreement  We would revise it  Well, I would inform the Committee  Yes There is a difference in the rate we would pay if we should draw on the Japanese arrangement and in the basis on which we calculate our earnings on investments with the Japanese because they were negotiated at two different times As we looked at them, tracking them over the period of the past several years, one seems to be consistently a bit below the other and we're concerned about that  If we drew yen, the interest rate that we would pay on those drawings is based on Japanese rates and would be slightly less favorable to us, we think, if looked at over time, than the rate that we would get on investments  No, they are not But when we draw we try to work it out so that what we pay is based on a short-term Treasury bill type rate In Japan they don't have any such thing, so we base it on a longer-term seasoned bond which is maturing but has only a short period to run That rate, for reasons I can't entirely explain, seems to be consistently a little higher than the so-called Gensaki rate, which is a [rate in the] much more liquid repurchase market It seems to have rates that are slightly lower and that's the rate we would get on our investments So, we want to try to bring about a change  The Bank of Japan is sympathetic but it is always a long and tedious process to have to negotiate anything like this with the Finance Ministry, so it has taken time But we are trying to work it out  There were no foreign exchange implications in that problem It was local  Well, there are a lot of rumors about banks and they are usually denied The foreign exchange market on Friday was subject to a certain amount of [fluctuation] when we were closed because of alleged problems with respect to German banks But, again, sometimes they talk about the situation in Luxembourg branches that we're not aware of  No I agree with everything Mr Truman said  Well, they generally have, with a certain amount of effort of pulling and clawing I think the success has been pretty good so far There are a lot of questions about whether they will be able to bring them along this next go-around, but so far it has worked reasonably well  The expectation is that this time it will be more difficult On the other hand, there is greater recognition of the depth and pervasiveness of these problems I think that the banks also are more aware of the situation and probably have less, or not much, chance of doing anything but going along  They can do it if things go as we are hoping they will go  -32-    11/14-15/83  That's one way around it   It's due to the change in the value of the dollar relative to these other currencies  We have to update, that's right So, when the dollar rises relative to the other currencies, in terms of dollars our currency holdings show up as bookkeeping losses not as realized [losses]  [Statement--see Appendix]  No We keep getting asked this question over and over What happens actually is that, of course, we are monitoring [the market] all the time When we see a situation where it looks as if rates could be moving too rapidly or are very volatile--kind of gaping, with one transaction here and then the next buy or sell order moving out of the range entirely--or just generally unsettled conditions in the market, then we talk to our colleagues at the Board and our colleagues at the Treasury And usually at very, very high levels in the Treasury Department there's a decision as to whether they feel that it is or is not a disorderly market Certainly, one of the factors that goes into their thinking is the attitude of some of the other monetary authorities On the occasion when we intervened in December [our action] followed some intervention by the Bundesbank-- indeed some intervention where the Bundesbank had come in at the end of their day and intervened in a way that was going to affect the DM in our market They had called us up to tell us about it and to see if we had any concerns about it and we decided, again after consultations, that it would be appropriate for us to go in But we intervened in a modest way These have all been very modest transactions; $50 million worth of DM, at a time when the market is as big and as active as it is, is not going to reshape the world  It shows some evidence of being willing to participate but in a very modest way And I don't think anybody thinks that these amounts have any great impact It can temporarily settle a situation if we do enough of it  On one occasion This was a very unusual situation in which the dollar was moving at a very, very rapid rate just at the time our market was opening, and they did intervene on that occasion in the amount of about $500 million Subsequently, they have intervened in the market through the New York Fed, with us acting as agent  Once or twice--not often  Well, we like to know what other central banks are doing in our market  For a number of the central banks--the Japanese, the Swiss--when they do, which is very rare, we act on their behalf And that to me is the best way to handle it Then we can do the operation for them and know what is happening and handle it And the Germans did operate that way subsequent to this one occasion when they acted directly; they were trying to make a big splash and to show the world that they were out there selling all these dollars  I do  We settled two days later anyhow  Well, it's very hard to say Certainly, they have been active, particularly in the past couple of weeks, in buying dollars For what reason, I don't know We have been trying to keep a log of what we hear and find out about their activities to see if we can figure out what their approach is But in the past couple of weeks they have been buying very heavily in the dollar And, as I mentioned, the Bundesbank has done really quite a large amount of dollar sales--over $1-1/2 billion The Russians have been buying a very large chunk of this on the other side, we think One thought is that they have some big year-end dollar needs, just as many others have big year-end dollar needs But I don't really have a good explanation as to why they're doing it They seem to be buying a lot of dollars and selling some sterling, for example Earlier this year they were operating on different sides of the market We're trying to get a better assessment of their approach, but right now we really don't know what their purpose is in buying dollars But they have been buying them heavily in Europe, in New York, and in the Far East   [Statement--see Appendix]  That was an arrangement the ESF made with the Jamaican authorities It has not been announced and I was just informing the Committee of it It ties in with a move by which the Jamaicans would have an IMF program and it's a kind of bridge financing looking toward that  SPEAKER(?) Didn't you call it a swap?  Yes  No What I said is that we have done this for the Treasury It's totally an ESF arrangement I only noted it for your information   [Statement--see Appendix]  Through the end of May  The original agreement said only 30 days Then it was extended by the Latins and by the Treasury for another 30 days And it may be extended further for another 30 days, according to the Latins, but the Treasury hasn't said anything  There are a few other things in there  The encouraging part is that they are talking to the Fund and for the first time have begun to make proposals to the banks about how to deal with it They are not home free  We did not hear a great deal of concern expressed about a spillover into the whole system Now, the dollar did come down a couple of percentage points during that period, mind you   Did you call on me?  I usually go first  [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, it's awfully hard to speak very generally The conditions vary a great deal from country to country and situation to situation Obviously, the Canadians found great difficulty in keeping their interest rates very far away from reflecting the rise in ours The Germans have been seeking to avoid following the increases in US interest rates but, as I said here, it has resulted in quite large amounts of intervention in the exchange market  Do you mean do I think that there would be a view that the dollar might do this? I didn't quite [hear you]  I think that most of the people in the market have become quite jaundiced after having seen a number of very large balance of payments deficits and large trade deficits and hearing repeatedly that this was going to bring down the dollar but not having seen it happen So the people in the market, as opposed to the people making the forecasts, do not really seem much impressed by this They know, as everybody knows, that at some point the dollar is going to come down But the matter of when is of extreme importance in the exchange market, and these people tend to take a fairly short time horizon anyhow So, I don't think there is a widespread expectation of any very early decline in the dollar  That's right Those who have are now in the hardware business!  Yes We did $135 million   [Statement--see Appendix]  Nothing to approve  They paid them $125 million   [Statement--see Appendix]  We raised the total amount of this limit and the DM amount The total [informal limit] is now $5-1/2 billion  Well, it is an informal limit We have a formal limit of $8 billion, which is recorded and registered as the decision of the FOMC and I imagine made public This $5-1/2 billion is an informal limit, which has been operative for a number of years, under which we seek the FOMC's views about how much we would operate within our total authorized $8 billion We now have an informal maximum of $5-1/2 billion for all currencies, with [limits of] $4 billion in deutschemarks, $1 billion in yen, and $500 million in other currencies  I believe you have the authority--  The Foreign Currency Subcommittee could authorize it  The present holding of DM is $39 billion equivalent Our limit is $4 billion equivalent and I am requesting--  No These are recorded on [the basis of] historical acquisition costs We could never operate in this day and age if we were operating on the basis of market value  Well, if we converted it into dollars, that would be, in effect, an intervention operation  It is not as though we have such massive amounts of these currencies that we need to worry about our balances being too high, it seems to me As I say, the United States [holdings] as a whole are way below what they were even a couple of years ago  Well, the total value of these at today's exchange rate would be less than $39 billion So, I think we are talking about a very modest amount of currencies and it is in our interest to have some of these currencies available  We get about $200 million per year  I would welcome an increase of $1 billion  No It's just that the past couple of times when we raised it, we increased it by $500 million and I did not want to give the impression that there was anything very major involved It seems to me it would be quite appropriate--and in fact it would be advisable--to increase it by $1 billion  $6-1/2 billion and raise the total for all of them?  Another possibility, Mr Chairman, if you wanted to consider it, would be to keep the informal limit on the total but to eliminate this difference between how much is in DM and how much is in yen, and how much is in Swiss francs and other currencies That would provide a little more flexibility  I would certainly agree that there is no very clear-cut explanation It is amazing how much the attitudes [have changed]; everybody seems to talk about what a good thing the dollar is to get into these days One can listen to how they talk now and think back to how they talked in 1978 and 1979 when it was going the other way and the United States was [viewed as] hopeless as far as the future was concerned It's hard to believe they are talking about the same country   Well, they don't sell only on those celebrated occasions when they have come in and hit the market, of course They do put some of this in over time For a long period of time they had followed, in varying degrees, the practice of putting these amounts in during periods when it seemed sensible to them or when they wanted to do it They don't follow and have not followed, as far as I know, the practice of consistently putting these amounts in the market on a regular basis  They've been doing this for many years and have always done it in this way The amounts I think are larger than--  Troop costs certainly used to be at least that much; that may have declined  I will assume the Committee agrees and will proceed accordingly   [Statement--see Appendix]  Only these two technical modifications have been proposed  They asked whether we were interested in continuing it and I told them we were   Can you hear New York? New York is on  We've been on for about the past five minutes but no one could hear me Can you hear me now?  SEVERAL Yes  All right Let me proceed [The overall limit] on balances for all currencies as you recall is $6-1/2 billion, and we have available under that overall limit $1-1/2 billion So we're very comfortable there This is broken down into [informal limits on] deutschemarks, yen, and other currencies The other currencies [category] would be relevant if we were to intervene in other than the DM or the yen, namely in sterling We have available under that limitation $167 million at the present time So, our authorized balances are not in danger of being breached at this moment  With respect to the market, let me give you a little rundown Immediately prior to the time Secretary Regan spoke yesterday, which was very late in the course of our day--our markets were closing--the dollar was cruising around 3175 marks The other currencies had moved more or less similarly vis-a-vis the mark After his statement, there was an initial fallback in the dollar in the South Pacific and other markets that were open; it fell back about 2 pfennigs But after hitting these lower levels and when the Far East became more active, there were buyers for dollars at these lower levels and that seemed to cover professionals and speculators We heard the usual-- that speculative operators were in there, namely the Russians and South Africans and so forth As a result of all this, the dollar then rose again somewhat and opened in Europe at about 3165 marks During the course of the European day the dollar was fairly quiet It just barely touched 318 marks once or twice but generally speaking was in the 317 to 3175 range during Europe's day Since I've been sitting here the dollar does seem to be rising and has now gone up above the 318 level; it's getting close to 3185  The attitude towards Secretary Regan's statement seems to vary considerably among the various market participants A number of them called attention to the fact that it was cited as a reaffirmation of the Williamsburg agreements, and they tend to think that that makes it likely not to be of major significance--that it might be something to placate the Europeans But there are a number of people who have read the Regan statement as reflecting the possibility, certainly, of something aimed at communicating more than that And the market is wary They read the comments that there may be some surprises and that we might operate on occasions when it would be helpful and not just [to counter] disorderly market pressures as in the past So, there is a general wariness and uneasiness And there is some likelihood that the market, either in the course of today or relatively soon, will try to test some of these [intervention] points and get a better understanding of the meaning of the Group of 5 statement As of now, that's the general picture I think very few people believe that it reflects any fundamental modification of our    1/18/85  policy But there are quite a few who think that it may have some significance and they are rather wary because of that Thank you   [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, it's very difficult to say what they might do I would think that the desire, obviously, is very much to have the United States (a) take the lead; and (b) certainly, participate Now, whether they will bring themselves to very large intervention in our absence--if we are out of the market entirely--looks pretty doubtful  I don't know that anybody is talking about any specific amount of money I think there is a problem in that the    2/12-13/85  operations that have been undertaken during this period--certainly on the United States side on the occasions that we have operated--have been limited to fairly modest amounts On one occasion it was $40 million and on another occasion $48 million; the most we did was close to $150 million There certainly is a feeling that one needs to act both in greater amounts and also with a greater forcefulness, as it were They understand the US view about not wanting, as I said, to bash the currency; but they do feel that something needs to be done to deal with these exchange rates more forcefully than has been done There was certainly some uncertainty in the market after the G-5 announcement about what it meant As time has gone by, that has tended to fizzle out and there has been the feeling that the intervention, while not insignificant, really hasn't been of a forceful and large nature, given the magnitude of the problem  Yes, I certainly think that Absolutely As a tactical move, the German operation of September did introduce a considerable amount of two-way risk and uncertainty in the market It was very heavy and it is seen as having been a very useful and attractive operation Now, in subsequent times when they have taken similar kinds of actions, they have not been as effective But I don't disagree with you I think it had a very powerful impact on the market; for some period of time it had the market wondering whether it was going to be hit again one of these days That certainly introduced a certain caution in the market and I would think that that is a useful thing to do There is certainly, on the part of some of the Europeans, a strong desire to see if tactics of that sort could not be used again with the same impact  Yes It went up on the day that they hit it [hard]; at its height it was 317 and it went down about 4 percent  It's at 329, but between September and February it went up It certainly was an element that introduced a great deal of caution into the market and I think it did have a lasting effect for some period of time On that day I believe they spent about $400 million; we're not talking massive amounts in the billions that were spent I think everybody is fully cognizant of the limitations of intervention; in fact, maybe too much so No one expects it by itself to solve all the problems in Europe or here But certainly there is a    2/12-13/85  view that, properly and forcefully used, it can be one additional weapon that can be very helpful in keeping this quite troublesome exchange market situation perhaps a little less volatile--I mean volatile in the upward sense  I think all, or certainly a lot, of the Europeans are going to be under upward pressure on their interest rates if their exchange rates continue to depreciate  I don't think anyone will disagree with what you've said I think you're right that we need to act more forcefully if we're going to go in there, and show that we mean business and that we are prepared to do something in other than token amounts  Well, resist? We're almost there They are concerned about the exchange rate They have raised their interest rates by an enormous amount and they have a very soft economy So in that sense, they really have moved very, very strongly They have not done an enormous amount in intervention They have done some, but--  --very little  I think they feel that the 4-1/2 points that they have done is really quite a response to the downward exchange rate--    2/12-13/85   [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, this was at a time when sterling was being particularly hard hit and our purchase was in part a cooperative gesture to the British, who were very much concerned that the pound was taking more than its share of the brunt of this change It coincided with the time of the high level visit of Mrs Thatcher  Well, I think it had some implications of being done in light of those political circumstances, yes  I would certainly think that the intervention had its effect We collectively--mainly other central banks--added really quite an enormous amount of dollars to the stocks sitting out there If you consider that we're running about a $10 billion current account deficit every month, we added another month there; and somebody has to absorb those dollars Some of those were absorbed at levels that now don't look very good So that has been overhanging the market and [the intervention] has called attention to the fact that the authorities can come in with a pretty heavy hand and do these operations This is undoubtedly part of the reason, but not the only reason, why the markets themselves are in such a sloppy condition People are increasingly unwilling to be market makers out there I think intervention certainly has had an effect It has reminded the market that the officials can come in rather forcefully and it has left a lot of dollars out there to be absorbed  Well, $10 billion is small relative to the total of $120 billion Still, it's money that somebody out there has--   [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, certainly the complaints about market conditions have been much, much worse And there's no doubt that the day-to-day volatility in the past two or three months has been far greater than in earlier periods We've been hearing for a long time from the banks regarding their concern about the market's condition and we're beginning to hear more complaints from some of the corporate representatives at this point That's a new element in this  Generally speaking, most are making money on the exchange market, if you look at their quarterly reports With some notable exceptions, they continue to make money  Less so It does vary; it moves up and down But at least at the banks in New York that we keep an eye on, the number of quarters in which they had large losses was very few and that was only at a very few institutions  I think the banks are withdrawing more and more from the market, so they are protecting themselves by being much more unwilling to be market-makers except in limited conditions than they were before  No, they're just not doing business  It is a matter of considerable concern The volatility did increase considerably, of course, after the operations in late February Now, that does not mean necessarily that people should be unhappy about the heavy intervention in late February But there is a question of whether there should be some follow up to that kind of arrangement to provide for a little more structure in the    5/21/85  market and a little more effort to try and deal with this kind of very short-term variability  What I've been talking about here was intra-day-- the amount during one 24-hour day--which, as I say, now averages about 2 percent whereas in earlier periods it was much less   [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, I don't think it has been a dramatic slide It has been on average about 17 percent or so, and against the European currencies it has been more than that So, it is certainly enough of a decline in the period of six months or less that it has attracted attention It seems that the dollar has made this rather substantial adjustment, but I don't think there is a lot of expectation that it is necessarily going to fall off the table Certainly, there is a generally bearish tone to the dollar and to the market's attitude toward it And to the extent that these things can be generalized, there seems to be an expectation of possible continuing softness unless our economy changes  Well, it is difficult to say very much because we really don't have enough information Before the last refunding, which of course was a substantial one, there had been concerns expressed that [foreign investors] might stay away from that particular operation and that it would be in difficulty as a result That didn't seem to happen It was more the case of a nonbarking dog  That is correct What we do know--or what we see and hear about--is that the Japanese, at least beginning in June, have tended to start doing more hedging They continue to have substantial long-term outflows into dollars and US securities, but they have tended, for I think the first time, to be doing more hedging Also, we hear at least anecdotally, but it is very difficult to know how much attention to pay to these things, that one of the factors that has tended to keep sterling somewhat strong has been the tendency of investors to diversify a little toward sterling, which has been paying    8/20/85  very high interest rates But these [reports] are anecdotal; you can't really get a very sound understanding of something as large and as complicated as this market on the basis of a relatively small number of conversations and what you hear  Well, I think the interesting thing about gold is that the price has risen somewhat as the dollar has weakened, as you suggested, but it hasn't risen all that much And in terms of the Swiss franc, it has been reasonably stable  One of the interesting things has been that the difficulties in South Africa do not seem to have caused a greater increase in the price of gold Now, there are all kinds of questions about that There is a feeling that substantial supplies are being withheld from the market by the main producers, the South Africans and the Russians in particular As the price moves up, then they tend to sell a little more and then it goes back down again That seems to have been the pattern One might have thought, with the concerns in South Africa and the possibility being talked about of mining strikes and other potential supply disruptions, that the price might have risen more than it has It's now about $336 today, and that's not up all that much from where it was before so much attention was being paid to this What has happened is that the price of platinum has gone up I gather that South Africa is more critical to the platinum market than to the gold market, and platinum has moved up much more rapidly But gold in a sense has shown relatively less buoyancy, in light of all these factors, than one might have expected  It's very unrealistic, isn't it, to think that we could really have a soft landing that people talk about? Gradually moving the dollar down and having this not generate all kinds of responses that would accelerate it and make it happen in 10 minutes--  Well, if you are really talking about a soft landing, a continuing steady decline, it seems to me that all the people who are sitting there holding dollars are going to be influenced by what they see going on And I think they will either anticipate it continuing or take other steps, and it just won't go like that  It would happen overnight once they--  It is not going to happen that way  It is impossible  -38-    8/20/85  You would have to have it move [down] and go up a little and then sideways and then everybody would wonder [which way] it is going That is the only way you can get there   I imagine it would be falling a lot sharper if the market thought that   [Statement--see Appendix]  They will deposit them in banks  In German banks  I think the idea is that the Bundesbank  So I assume that most of this will get back into Germany  Well, I think it can be helpful at times For example, at times when the Japanese were intervening rather heavily in the yen we were intervening in the Far East, kind of following their action, to keep some action with respect to the mark It showed evidence of a somewhat coordinated approach And since we hadn't done that sort of thing very much, as you said, certainly in quite a while, that certainly can have an impact in the proper circumstances  It's certainly known We have tried different approaches in our own market and elsewhere, at times operating through agents, at times trying to operate as openly and as visibly as we could--dealing with a whole bunch of banks at once--in order to make clear to all the participants that we were there and that we were acting in a firm way But it depends on the particular circumstances and the time of day and things of that sort    11/4-5/85   Statement--see Appendix  Well, we invest them in a series of different kinds of investments aimed at getting a market rate of interest and keeping them very liquid We try to keep them liquid, if possible, so they will be usable We have some in  --a whole series of different instruments in different countries, depending on what is available  We have some in government securities  A modest amount  Well, not so modest We have $1-1/2 billion out of the total of $12 billion of Treasury and Federal Reserve holdings  A lot are in one form or another There are some in BIS deposits and some in  We have a lot in I am not sure I understand your--  Right  I would be happy to submit a memorandum showing where all of these assets are but, as Mr Truman said,  we do have them in short-term investments; the aim is to get a market rate and to keep them very liquid  I think at the present time the attitude is generally more that there has been a substantial decline in the dollar and that the central banks are reasonably satisfied with the range in which the dollar is now trading So, there is not the same kind of fear that it might tumble very, very rapidly as there was some weeks ago But obviously, it's still a possibility  Well, there are certainly some people who think that after a time the authorities will either lose interest or not continue this operation and that fundamentally the dollar has some strength to it So, there are some [views] on both sides Of the amount of investments that we have, $17 billion are in government securities    12/16-17/85  Well, I think what I said was that with the dollar declining at that time, there was quite naturally concern that that would continue or that [the pace] would increase and it would fall very, very rapidly Now, there is certainly some possibility of a further fall, depending on a whole lot of things But the fact that the dollar [has been trading in] these ranges for some period of time has given a little more breathing space--a little more feeling that maybe it has stabilized, since it has tended to be a little more stable around these levels  Well, I am not sure whether it was the last meeting or the one before that But certainly I don't think we had as big a test on the up side as we might have expected in those circumstances There was a test during that period around the middle part of October; and the response of the central banks was rather forceful but it was not a massive operation nor really major pressure We spent amounts that were certainly a lot larger than we had been spending, but it was not a massive operation Since September 22, all the G-10 countries together have spent around $13-$14 billion During the February-March operation intervention was around $10 billion or so But this is not all [dollar related] There have been some pressures within the EMS and a substantial amount of intervention relating to EMS pressures, particularly against the Italian lira and some of the other European currencies which might be expected to devalue  That certainly is possible It is also argued, at least by the Japanese, that there may be some heavier investment demand--that some are waiting to make sure that they get the bottom [price] for the dollar and are going to be coming back in to push it the other way So, there are the cross currents  You mean if they do not invest in the dollar?  Partly it is not a matter of switching away from dollar investments; it is whether one comes into the dollar investments with or without cover One can still be investing in these dollar investments and covering, and that would offset much of this  I think it is 10 percent of the [unintelligible]  It is certainly true that for now they have been convinced that the central banks are serious and they see some    12/16-17/85  resistance on the up side, whereas there are still statements in one form or another which can be read by the market as suggesting that maybe some further downward move is expected and desired by some So I would say--  That is profound and sums it up I think that concern about how long is the staying power is a longer-term consideration, but for now they're reasonably confident that there will be resistance on the up side but not on the down side   [Statement--see Appendix Secretary's note There were no transactions to be ratified]  Many people saw this just as part of some underlying weakness of the dollar There was some view at that juncture that there might be a move by the United States and others very short after the Japanese action Some people attributed some of the attitude to that expectation But as I said, during this period--and this is seen somewhat as a sign of the weakness in the currency--the fact has been that when events which in other circumstances might have been expected to cause the dollar to show some strengthening, it doesn't seem to have happened  The rates are down a little 237-1/2 was the last DM quote we saw and about 187 [yen]  Well, this question of the effect of oil prices is very, very complicated I guess anybody can come to his or her own view Certainly, I would think that over a long period of time a    2/11-12/86  declining price of oil is going to be of great value and importance to the United States and has to be helpful But I don't know when or how that comes about or in what kind of time period But right now, as I said, the [market's] concentration seems to be on the fact that it is of greater help to those who suffered most when the oil price went up and to those who had a greater reliance on imports--in particular the Japanese For the Japanese, it's an enormous part of their total imports and it has an enormous benefit   [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, Bergsten has been saying that for a long, long time If you look strictly at trade considerations and competitive considerations, that's what seems to be influencing his thinking But of course, the other side of the question is that there are a lot of other elements that enter into the balance of payments other than trade--particularly these capital movements That's why I mentioned the point about the continued narrowing of the interest rate differentials That's the other side of the problem in this  Well, no I would say that if you just look at the trade position and the competitive position you can come to one conclusion about where the dollar ought to be Obviously, we still have a very substantial trade deficit I think all the economists would agree that we haven't begun to see much of the benefits of the exchange rate changes that already have taken place And that would provide some considerable improvement to our trade position But we have an enormous trade deficit to deal with If you're looking at it strictly from that viewpoint, you could persuade yourself that a    4/1/86  [unintelligible] very substantial, and even the very large devaluations and depreciations that we've seen are not going to eliminate the trade deficit But you can also argue that you can't expect to eliminate all of this huge trade deficit purely by exchange rate moves There have to be other things in there, such as growth in the other countries And you also have to watch very carefully the effects of this on capital flows and whether the kind of exchange rate movements he's talking about may lead to great problems for us on the capital side  No, we haven't had any transactions   [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, that certainly is going to depend very much on how the economic data unfold But one thing that has been an important factor in the dollar having stopped its decline has been, if not a change in the comments and rhetoric and the statements made by a number of officials in a lot of countries, certainly a view in the market that the attitudes of the officials in those countries--here and in Japan and in Germany--are such that there tends not to be concern about the level of the dollar now Or, at least these countries are not pressing to see it go down further And in the view of the Europeans and the Japanese, there is the beginning of an expression of some concern should the dollar go down further So I think we've seen in the market during this period great attention paid to official attitudes; and there is a different perception in what those attitudes are There is a view that at least for the time being there is not felt to be any need to try to guide the dollar down further  Peter can comment on that, but as far as we can tell they're showing a considerable interest in the government    5/20/86 -2-  securities market Apparently, they picked up quite substantial amounts of the latest issues We did hear in the first part of April that the long-term capital outflows from Japan were declining, but the most recent information--and we talked to the Japanese a few days ago --was that the capital outflows from Japan through April and early May have continued to be very large Now, that doesn't mean it's all coming to dollars because there are some attractions in Australian and other currencies Also, it doesn't mean that they aren't covering some substantial parts possibly by hedging; we don't know But certainly, from what we can tell they are continuing to buy very substantial amounts of US government securities  Those currencies have tended to move with the dollar, so the yen has changed against them in the same way that it has changed against the dollar And that is a matter that is causing some concern for them because they see the diversion of what they've been selling to Korea, being sold by Korea, Taiwan, and elsewhere And we're seeing moves by the Japanese to shift to those currencies and to increase their ownership in output [facilities] from there  Every time they--  But they have changed the discount rate; they have lowered it 3 times and each time the yen has risen  I think there have been some occasions recently when--  --the market was very sensitive to such a thing and it could have had considerable influence  Yes  That could surely happen  There are too many possibilities and too many situations   [Statement--see Appendix]  I think there is that expectation, but the timing is difficult to say; certainly, looking over a period of some weeks I think there is [that expectation]  We have nothing  No, I don't have any inside story But I certainly know that a great deal of attention was paid to the fact that we moved unilaterally without the others the last time That made quite an impression in the market and I certainly think they are watching very closely There is a risk there, but it is hard to assess how big it would be  The Japanese fought it  No, Germany has not  I think those numbers you mentioned are what people are now focusing on 2 DM and 150 yen   [Statement--see Appendix]  I don't disagree with that  I would think that certainly it's a factor I wouldn't give it total weight but, obviously, much of the effect on the dollar is in the investment instrument and there's certainly a lot of attention paid to the long-term rates And it's well known by everybody in the market that those long-term rates have not been declining with our discount rate cut So, I think it is certainly a factor  Well, there's certainly an effort being made by the Treasury and others to talk to the Taiwanese and Koreans on some of these trade issues and other matters Of course, it cuts both ways The Taiwanese currency, for example, went up with the dollar and back down with the dollar So it hasn't affected the present exchange rate very much either way If you draw charts including more of these [other countries] you'd have a higher movement in the charts than we typically see when we focus on industrial countries But the pattern is quite similar  There's certainly a lot of discussion underway with them to try to do something  Taiwan has the biggest surplus of any of these  By a long shot And they also have very, very high reserves Korea is different  I'm not sure I would read all that into it They have not intervened on the low side They did intervene when the dollar rose to 210; it did jump up very suddenly and that occurred at a time when we were closed--at 500 or so in the morning here--and they undoubtedly felt that they were taking a helpful step at that point A lot of the pressure on the other side has come from the other Europeans who feel stress and strain resulting from the strong DM As the dollar is weakening against the DM, the DM is tending to strengthen against all currencies, particularly the EMS currencies And, as I said, they sold $4-1/2 billion worth of DM last week and that begins to hurt them So, they are the ones who have been pressing, I suspect, for these understandings on the joint intervention--that efforts should be made in order to prevent a further sliding of the dollar, not that we should let go At least that's the way I interpret it  These are basically coming out as marks that are in Euromark holdings They have not allowed the Europeans to build up marks within the Bundesbank  It has no [direct] effect  That's the only point I was trying to make  It doesn't affect the Bundesbank    9/23/86  Almost entirely There has been very little dollar intervention by the other Europeans There has been a little; the Spanish have been picking up a few dollars as they position themselves for entry to the EMS or one thing or another But basically it has been overwhelmingly DM intervention and not dollar intervention   [Statement--see Appendix] And I might say that this morning, following the elections, it had been expected that a Democratic victory would lead to some weakness in the dollar There was a very temporary decline in the Far East with the dollar moving down from 206 to 204 [against the mark] and comparably against the yen But that lasted only a few hours and in the evening before Tokyo was closing the dollar was beginning to move back up Subsequently, in European markets, it has moved back to about 206-3/4 So it is now at a higher level than it was yesterday   [Statement--see Appendix] Mr Chairman, I have no transactions [to be approved]  No, I think there have been other factors involved There is the feeling that the yen really had moved quite far in terms of the situation in Japan I think there is an expectation that further movement could lead to some developments within Japan that would cause more problems there I don't think it has been done just with smoke and mirrors I think there has been a difference in the actual impact of the exchange rate changes that have occurred in Japan vis-a-vis the effect of the exchange rate changes that have occurred between the United States and the Europeans  We are still seeing capital flows into the United States from Japan; we have seen them all along The one factor that has changed is the extent to which these inflows are offset, in effect, by measures in the exchange market to hedge against further exchange rate changes But we are still seeing the inflows  The hedging? Well, going back to when the dollar was considerably higher, there was a lot of hedging taking place We don't really have very good information on all of this, so what I am telling you is what we deduce and what the Japanese tell us Just after the middle of this year, when the exchange rate had changed a great deal--the dollar was, say, at 150 yen as compared to 260--there was a change in their attitude about hedging against this, and they were taking some of their profits Now it is a little uncertain as to whether they are still investing on a hedged basis or whether they are taking some risks    12/15-16/86  There are still some purchases of dollars by companies to kind of balance off their balance sheets at the end of the year That is one of the factors that seem to have caused the dollar to show some strength recently because, as I was saying, as these corporations buy dollars the banks don't really seem to want to change their positions very much So it goes right through the market and tends to have an impact on the rate and to send the dollar up a little That has been a factor tending to strengthen the dollar so far as we can tell in the last couple of weeks   [Statement--see Appendix] Thank you, Mr Chairman Also, we need approval of intervention of $50 million that we did on one day  The Japanese tell us that their total long-term capital outflows are continuing at the same level as last year We don't know, but there seems to be more diversification; to a greater extent there is Japanese investment in Australia and Canada and in sterling also There is also more diversification in the types of instruments, we think But we don't have very good information Another problem is that there is a tendency by Japanese investors to engage in hedging operations Even if they continue the long-term capital outflows, they may at the same time be hedging on the exchange rate side and that has effects on the exchange market There seemed to be a considerable amount of hedging during the period when the dollar/yen rate changed from the 158-159 level where it had stood for a while As it broke through that level, a number of Japanese investors seemed to engage in some hedging To summarize, the Japanese capital outflows seem to be more diversified, but there might be other things that are taking place which are offsetting some of the exchange market effects  Both kinds are going on There is diversification among countries in the sense that more Japanese investment is going into Canada, Australia and into sterling--we don't have very good information [unintelligible]--than before Secondly, there is diversification in the sense that Peter mentioned that instead of the very heavy concentration on Treasury bonds, there is a greater tendency to buy corporate bonds, equities, real estate, or other forms of investment So, we see both types  Well, I think so There has been a great deal of discussion of that possibility [here] and perhaps elsewhere, with the deal presumably being more intervention on our side and more moves by Germany and Japan and others to stimulate their economies There's some question about what the Germans could do at the present time, given the fact that they just got through their election and are still in the process of trying to put together a government The market has taken some encouragement from the fact that the party that had a greater belief in stimulating the economy seems to have done well But what that will lead to, if anything, is the point that--  That is another point; the German economy is clearly doing less well than it appeared to be a month ago  If it is just a nod in the direction of stimulation, then the chances of any meaningful success from intervention, I think, would be a good bit less than if it were something more stimulative  Well, it got reported The last time there were reports in Japan and also elsewhere  I don't think we would find it easy to get the others to start intervening on the other side at very low levels if this was to be cooperative   Well, Mr Chairman, I do wish to recommend that the Committee consider a change In the authorized balances, we have an informal limit and a formal limit The informal limit on marks is presently $6 billion worth of marks We are now at $58 billion worth of marks and the simple accrual of interest earnings, if nothing else happens over the rest of this year, would put us over that $6 billion The other--  That is an informal limit which does not appear in the published record However, the authorized balances which [unintelligible] was $10 billion, including informal balances of the DM at $6 billion, the yen at $3 billion, and other currencies at $1 billion The System's overall open position, which is $10 billion, is a matter of record My proposal to increase the allowance for mark balances from $6 billion to $7 billion would go along with a proposal to increase the total from $10 billion to $11 billion for the authorized balances of all currencies and the total System open position  I have no objection to increasing it beyond that  That's right  On yen balances, we have more room than we had because we have been spending yen recently The reason to change it, since it does get published and it does draw some attention, is that    3/31/87  now is the time to change it And I think the $1 billion increase would give us room for what we do not anticipate, assuming we follow the same practices that we have followed in the past  I would certainly be very pleased with that  I am proposing to raise the mark limit from $6 billion to $7 billion If we raised it further we could--  We have $3 billion on yen as the informal understanding The present $10 billion breaks down to $6 billion in marks, $3 billion in yen, and $1 billion for other currencies If we go to $12 billion, we could propose to divide that into $8 billion, $3 billion, and $1 billion [respectively]  [Statement--see Appendix] Thank you, Mr Chairman  Well, on a number of these occasions we have been operating in a way to make it quite open and quite obvious that we were there We have dealt with a lot of banks We have dealt with them directly and we have done it quite visibly It's very difficult to be absolutely precise about the amount of our intervention, but certainly market participants know that we have been in there in a very substantial way And I don't think these numbers would shock them Certainly, some people are expecting that these numbers are the amounts that we can go in They have seen a lot We have not made any statements and the Japanese have not made any statements about the precise amounts, but they know we have been in there very heavily  SPEAKER(?) Are we sharing this intervention with the Treasury on a 50/50 basis or has that changed?  We are sharing it with the Treasury on a 50/50 basis with one minor exception Generally, we are doing it on a 50/50 basis  SPEAKER(?) Where is the yen/dollar relationship this morning?  The yen is just over 146 The Japanese have had some interest in trying to hold it around the 146 level and so they closed yesterday at just over 146; we closed yesterday at just over 146, although it declined in the course of the day and it declined again in the course of the day in Tokyo last night They did another  or so of intervention, but it closed again at 146 The dollar against the mark is at 180-1/2 The dollar did weaken somewhat against the mark yesterday in the course of the trading day and got down to about 179-1/2, but then it moved back up and is now at about 180-1/2  SPEAKER(?) Do you attribute much significance to the Japanese fiscal year ending today?  Well, that remains to be seen It has been a factor; firms have had dollars to deal with because of their need to straighten out their books at the end of the fiscal year This has been a factor over the past several weeks  SPEAKER(?) Sam, what's the tone in the market? Is there some growing concern that we really could run into a significant [unintelligible] or is there some feeling that the intervention would prevent that from occurring?  Well, it's hard to say You pay your money and take a choice It's hard to be too certain I am sure there is a range of ideas involving a lot of people Obviously, given this massive amount of Japanese investments, much of it unhedged, there is concern that a real loss of confidence in the dollar could lead to    3/31/87  very [unintelligible] That's obviously hanging over the market But to what extent that view is held, it's pretty difficult to say We do know that a fair amount of the dollar sales that they assumed in Tokyo in the past week or ten days has been in the form of investment firms like insurance companies, pension funds, and so forth, doing a certain amount of hedging So that's certainly a big [unintelligible] supply and demand equation there  SPEAKER(?) When the Japanese sell dollar-denominated assets, where then do they go with those funds? In what currency?  I wasn't suggesting that they were selling on and off although what they have been doing recently is diversifying their purchases much more They have been buying a lot more Canadian securities, Australian securities, and European securities; and they have also broadened out from government-bond types of investments toward more diversification But there is also a certain amount of hedging, without selling the assets--hedging against these in order to protect oneself And that is fairly important to do  SPEAKER(?) What kinds of techniques are they using to hedge themselves?  I imagine they use [unintelligible]  They are certainly sterilized here I think, generally speaking, they are sterilized abroad  No, it wasn't that at all It was that once it had gone up and we intervened in a very light way--we didn't go in with guns blazing by any means--and once the market realized that we were in there intervening at those levels with all of the attention to the Paris understanding and talk about [unintelligible] and all, it didn't take too much to say, well, now that we have established this [unintelligible], it is likely to be resisted Now we can see where it is going to go on the other side So it reduced the expectations of the possibility of a continued rise in the dollar Fundamentally, I think the position was kind of bearish anyhow Everybody looking ahead not just a matter of days but a substantial period [knows] we still have the big deficits and the Japanese have their big surpluses That sort of gives you a fundamental position toward the dollar And once this had been hit on the up side they began to look toward the down side  No really, it has been relatively peaceful at times There has been [unintelligible] had the ability to destruct itself, as it were, after the last [unintelligible] and to get back some of the reflows that had gone out in anticipation of it Some of the interest rates have come down in some of the countries that had moved them up So there has been a little return to normalcy on the [unintelligible] side  SPEAKER(?) What kinds of actions other than exchange rate intervention might be helpful in this kind of a situation either here or abroad?  Are you addressing that to me?  SPEAKER(?) I asked a question  I think there is certainly going to be continued watching as to whether any of these policy commitments that were talked about in Paris are actually carried out via fiscal policy or monetary policy The German economy is very soft; they haven't really taken anything new They, of course, have been [unintelligible] at the time that they reconstitute their government But their economy has been very weak, and people have seen that they have done nothing on monetary policy and don't show much prospect of doing anything in fiscal policy except in a framework of next year and the year after next The Japanese economy is equally well below what it typically runs at, and nothing has been happening there The problem is that they have to get through this fiscal year and get their budget passed before they can start with a new budget, they say Nonetheless, nobody has seen anything  SPEAKER(?) They haven't taken the opportunity to leave some of this intervention unsterilized to give a boost to monetary policy?  I think they sterilized it They feel with their discount rate now at 2-1/2 percent that they have gone pretty far Also, people don't see anything on the US side We make comments about the budget deficit and one thing or another, and there is not much evidence there Still, the main issue that's in the newspapers is the dispute over trade matters and that raises in people's minds the possibility that the way to deal with the trade--if you really get into a trade war--is to pound down the currency in order to deal with the situation in that way That has been the main issue in the newspapers, so the trade disputes have been a very negative factor Also, in the present circumstances, a neutral statement by US officials seems to be taken by the market as a kind of a negative It's a lack of a positive firm commitment--I guess that's the way to put it  Absolutely I thought I had a sentence somewhere in there [in my statement] We haven't seen any compelling evidence We know that our exports are looking better, and so forth and so on; but looking at the trade deficits and things like that, all we get is    3/31/87  the very bad nominal trade deficits and surpluses with little, if any, evidence of any reversal  SPEAKER(?) But I presume, Sam, that the firm commitment implies, among other things, some unsterilized intervention or something else that would back up whatever statements are made  Well, I am not sure it would imply unsterilized intervention but I think that it's [unintelligible]  I don't really have any confidence in people's attempts to make estimates of that sort, because I am not sure there is a number out there I think it depends upon people's attitudes and those are changing all of the time I think we could have a confluence of circumstances that could lead them to sell But what might go into it to require that? I am not sure about a specific number, but I think we are obviously in a very dangerous area where problems of that sort could build up very quickly and cause great damage  SPEAKER(?) You could also have it go so low that investors think the bottom has been hit  Well, that's right--if one were convinced of that But, again, I don't think we live in the kind of world where there is a magic number that when you hit it, then everybody knows it, and says Okay, now we buy  I think it has been interpreted broadly enough to deal with all of the situations since then It's similar to the undertakings which the United States has with the IMF as to what its exchange rate policy will be So it's part of a broader--  Yes, we will look at it in light of what we are doing now and see if it looks like there is something we should change  That is one of those endless debates that goes on We haven't really [unintelligible] We pretty well had our hands full [unintelligible] spot I am not sure I am convinced [unintelligible] but it's something we have been watching  SPEAKER(?) How many more bullets do we have in our belt as far as--  Well, with the yen we have in our pocket about $700 million, but these are at a valuation that was set at the time they were acquired; they are now worth a third or so more than that The Treasury has substantially more They have $21 billion, again at the acquisition cost And then, of course, we have a swap arrangement with the Bank of Japan of $5 billion dollars  Yes, a little over $1 billion The Treasury has around $3 billion at present market value  SPEAKER(?) And we have spent how much, again, in the last week or ten days?    3/31/87  A little over $2 billion  We--the Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the Japanese--have spent over  SPEAKER(?) So we have spent about half of our holdings?  [Unintelligible]  We need the approval, I guess  I am glad we had the election before my report!  The yen is down to 145-1/2, which is down another 1/2 a yen in the course of today and below the levels where it has  -38-    3/31/87  been for the past couple of days in Tokyo and New York It is under pretty heavy speculative pressure right now  It may be there now   There has been more or less continuous-- Hello Do you hear me?  Okay If you hear me, I'll proceed There has been more or less continuous pressure in the exchange markets since your last meeting at the end of March At times the pressure has been quite heavy The reasons seem to be more of the same things that we've all heard and talked about, including discussions of what almost seems like a trade war between us and the Japanese--which gets a lot of attention in the markets and the newspapers; continuing bad figures on the trade deficit; and a lack of any very impressive policy move by the main players The [unintelligible] did break through some very important psychological numbers Whereas earlier the pressure had been very heavily between the yen and the dollar, toward the end of last week it began to be more generalized and there were also pressures against the mark There have been substantial amounts of intervention during this period totaling over during the month of April, of which the very heavy portion has been by the Japanese There is a recognition by the market that there have been such heavy amounts of intervention And there is some feeling by the market that this has not been enough to deal with the situation in any lasting way In addition to the heavy amounts of intervention, there have been substantial other purchases of dollars by the central banks For the ones that we're on the concertation arrangement with, and that we keep figures for, the total of the intervention and the other purchases has been more than $20 billion of purchases officially during the month of April That is quite a substantial amount, well above the rate that we were running in the first quarter The market has been calmer in the past few days, partly I think in recognition of--or a feeling that there has been--some modest change in the monetary policy approach Another factor is that Mr Nakasone is here, and although the market is quite cynical about what may come out of that, they're reluctant to be 100 percent cynical and to be certain that nothing will happen So there's a kind of wait-and-see attitude Also, the fact that we have a number of holidays both in Europe and in Japan over the next several days up until the middle of next week I    4/29/87 -4-  think has made the traders a little cautious They say they will come back and look at the situation after the Nakasone visit and in light of what appears to be monetary policy [unintelligible] That's all I have to say, Mr Chairman   [Statement--see Appendix]  He's looking at you  I think the interest rate differentials are probably having some impact, but it makes it more costly to recommend [the dollar] People think If the dollar is going to be lower next week than this week, then we're better off to wait They have a pretty short focus on how long they make these investments for these days If the dollar is going down, it's better to wait There are a lot of people who think it's going down further and there are certainly not very many who think it's going to go up So, there's not much danger of losing [by waiting]  The differential is partly because of what the markets have done The Japanese long-term rates have declined quite substantially, and much of this is because money is going back into Japan  Close to 2-1/2 percent, [the] number 89 [bond]  The Japanese are really quite worried about their situation because of all the liquidity and the vast [unintelligible] or growth in the stock market where some stocks are selling at 250 times earnings and so forth  I don't think we're going to see this kind of level of dollar purchases for a continuing period; there's no question about that The market certainly has that view So there are going to have to be some policy moves or we're going to have to begin to see some results from policy moves already taken We haven't seen any very good statistical numbers to show that the trajectories have shifted and that things are going in the right direction We haven't seen very much other than these monetary policy developments; we haven't seen developments on the policy front to show that something is being done that's going to do it It's certainly the attitude of the market that intervention isn't going to remain at these levels for a continuing period It's either going down or we're going to see some more adjustment   [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, I think it is still somewhat fragile As I said, I think the market paid a great deal of attention to, and was reassured considerably by, the willingness of the Federal Reserve to snug because of the dollar Looking ahead, it's not clear that the market would feel that there will be the same kind of maneuverability or ability to untighten I think, for the present, that we have quite a healthy sense of two-way risks in the market But there is some skepticism; there are these feelings out there that some action will be taken, either in intervention or another area, if the dollar moves up very far from its present level And as I said, if that should happen, I think what the trading community then would start to do with respect to [unintelligible] on the downside So, I think we have a period of stability now, or even firmness, and this may continue for a period Looking beyond that, there is still negative sentiment about the dollar because of the lack of any clear evidence of major adjustment in our current account position And I would characterize the present sense of two-way risks as still rather fragile    7/7/87  We have one month of trade figures  There's no question that people are talking very, very intently about what these trade figures will be on the 15th of July when they come out  Well, I think they recognize that in volume terms there has been some improvement But they also recognize that in nominal terms there has been very little improvement, if any And that, of course, is what you have to finance Sometimes market participants over-interpret these figures and sometimes they respond by kind of knee jerk [reactions] So, I think if we have bad trade figures next week--really bad trade figures--that could change the picture from what it is  On the 15th  The market is expecting [a deficit of] about $14 billion, I think    7/7/87  I'm not sure I understand  Well, no, in the sense that we are now comfortable with pressures not moving one way or the other At some of these earlier meetings we had been sitting here with very heavy downward pressure facing us and the intensification of that raised much more serious problems  You're right that there are probably ten thousand people out there in this market and nobody can synthesize the view--  Except that the market reflects the view  We do talk to large numbers of traders all day long We talk to central banks all around the world and get their assessment of what's going on in their markets and we talk to commercial bankers and others here And we try to keep up with what the economists are saying and absorb these various views to the extent we can Now, there are times when a view sort of gets moving and the markets seem to all act like turkeys and fly in the same direction  So one can profess a market view But I don't think anybody can profess to be very confident at any one moment about what all these many different players are thinking But we do the best we can by talking to many different kinds of operators We also talk to treasurers of corporations about what they're doing  They're certainly more important than they used to be The market has gotten a lot bigger and a lot more complex; and it involves a lot larger universe than it did some years ago  We can't really tell very much about it, but what we hear is that it's still fragile Even if one is buying a long-term bond, that's not a long-term investment There is not a lot of assurance that these present exchange rates are stable enough for one to be entering into a lot of long-term investments with assurances that there are not going to be further changes At least that is what a lot of people tell us  The Japanese, of course, are key because they are such big players In the early part of the year, they had long-term outflows of $10 billion in January and another $10 billion in February In March it fell down to about half that and in April it disappeared entirely In May it has come back up and the last reports were that in June it was even bigger than ever--$13 billion So the amounts seem to have come back up to very substantial levels But the question is how solid that is now  Right The Japanese long-term rates have gone up by about 1/2 point during this period and ours have come down some If you want to look at it in terms of differentials, at the beginning of the year the differential between US and Japanese long-term rates was about 2-1/4 percentage points It went up to as high as 6 percentage points and now it's down to about 4-1/2 points--maybe a little below that So, it's still a lot higher than it was in the    7/7/87  early part of this year, but it's well down from the peak that it reached in May  I think the exchange rate is the key part of the equation, yes  The stock market in Japan has declined somewhat It got up as high as about 26,000; it's now about 24,000 or so--down maybe 10 percent, which is substantial And the Japanese have been very worried about the liquidity in their whole economy, as reflected both in the stock market and the real estate market It is a very worrisome and dangerous thing That's one of the reasons why there are questions about what they should be doing in terms of their own longer-term ranges   [Statement--see Appendix]  It has been mentioned that oil prices have clearly softened This morning's price is almost half a dollar below what it was yesterday and it's almost a dollar below where it was a week or so ago This has been cited as another factor Most of the people that our traders have been talking to seem to think that today's decline in the dollar is perhaps related to that, in part, but after the initial impact of the decline, it seems to be more a reflection of rather sour trade figures Yesterday in New York, in the latter part of the afternoon, the dollar began to soften without anything very dramatic happening; it was just gradually declining And we are told that the Japanese are saying that when their markets opened, they began to think that maybe they should cut some of their positions, so there was some selling both in Japan and in Europe subsequently, which brought us down to current levels It's possible that oil prices are now a factor but more talk seems to be given to this general attitude resulting from the continuing serious problem with the trade deficit and the larger number announced on Friday  Really, we don't have enough evidence, other than what people are telling us When the Middle East tensions flared up here a couple of weeks ago, it was hard for us to see why that, in itself, should have caused the dollar to go up so rapidly We saw some increase in [the price of] gold, but it came back down We did not see evidence that it was lots of [unintelligible] flows It could be that there is a kind of writing down of the dollar in light of the somewhat less troublesome situation in the Middle East But we don't see much evidence of a lot of movement from this back and forth which would lead to that conclusion; it's possible that people's attitudes are influenced by it and, therefore, they are changing their views about what is the proper level for the dollar, to some extent It is pretty much a matter of guessing  Well, the dollar fell in terms of both the DM and the yen It's now trading at about 185-1/4 DM and 147-1/4 yen So it has declined about 3-1/2 percent, I guess, from the levels prevailing toward the end of last week before the trade figures were announced and whatever has happened that relates to them It's a substantial move  I don't have the sterling quote today But sterling has been under its own pressure because of the [unintelligible]  Well, sterling sometimes acts like a petro- currency and sometimes it doesn't You can't rely on it reflecting what happens in the Middle East Well, sterling is up to 160-165  But it should not move that way if you followed the hypothesis  In Japan, the short-term rates haven't changed; the long-term rates have gone up sharply It seems to be a little element of both of the factors that you talked about Certainly, the market forces led to a substantial increase in their longer-term rates and they have been quite concerned about the vulnerability of their financial situation given the stock market rise, the increase in real estate prices, and so forth They also have allowed changes in some of these rates, like the long-term prime; they tell us they are resisting this, but at the end of the day it is clear that the long- term rates have gone up substantially In Germany, I think there has been a little snugging, but again, it is hard to say how much, because there have been some other things going on  It's, on balance, unchanged; it has been up and down   [Statement--see Appendix]  Right now we have the feeling that corporations are not doing very much It varies a great deal, of course, but typically the total turnover in the market is many, many multiples of what the final users get It may be 10 times as much But right at the moment we don't get a sense of a lot of corporate activity taking place It may be that they are holding off, for the kind of reasons that I mentioned It may be that they are waiting to see if anything emerges out of these dealings around the time of the IMF meeting Or, from what I hear this morning, there is some expectation being talked about that the G-7 might do one thing or another that would give some greater strength to the dollar They may be holding off for these kinds of reasons  At times they do this They can be very big players in this game, too, and they can do a lot of churning themselves  This always seems to be a pretty important time for an assessment We have the sense that they come back after Labor Day and reassess their position; and they may be doing that right now Frequently, in recent years, we have seen trends begin shortly after the summer holidays and after Labor Day As I said, it may be that they are holding off to see if anything emerges from these meetings next week  That's total conjecture There was a rumor last week of exactly that--that the target range had moved down And then there was a rumor two days later that it had moved up The dollar went down a little when the first rumor occurred and moved back up a little when the second rumor occurred But these are all purely imaginative   That's a very good question and I wish I had a good answer for it We've been asking ourselves and others that, without any really very convincing response Certainly, there has been some liquidating of things abroad as people have brought funds back into the United States either for meeting their own liquidity needs or for other purposes Also, with all the world tending to be under the same, or at least a downward, pressure in fairly substantial    10/20/87  under the same, or at least a downward, pressure in fairly substantial amount, that may be having an influence Another factor in the past 24 hours is that the climate has looked much better for the cooperative activities among us, the Germans, and the Japanese That's reflected in the statements that followed Secretary Baker's meeting with Mr Soltenberg, and the Japanese comments this morning add to that Also, the statement of the Federal Reserve this morning was favorably noted I'm not sure that adds up to a very convincing answer  Yes Perhaps reflecting what Peter is talking about, in our bond market there has been some tendency to move into Treasury bonds as kind of an attractive place at this point, given the chaos in so many of the equity markets around the world But I think there certainly has been liquidation of overseas positions And we've heard reports, certainly from our colleagues in Canada and from one or two other places, that they have seen investment firms and others liquidating positions, for example in Canadian dollars, and bringing them back   [Statement--see Appendix]  I would read it the other way that it gets more precarious as we get into these new and heretofore unseen levels The possibility of people getting really frightened and responding in some way--  We don't get the impression that there is an opportunity to flip it and get a big run on the other side The corporations have been noticeable nonparticipants for some time, generally speaking; everybody tended to sit on their hands during all of this chaos that was occurring in the market So, the short answer is, I'm sure there are a lot of people shorting the dollar but we are not, so far as we can tell, in a technical position where we could flip that and get a runup  Yes  On the question of [unintelligible], the Federal Reserve does have the legal authority to intervene and the Treasury has the legal authority to intervene But there are a number of statements and letters and so forth to the Congress which indicate that from the point of view of the Federal Reserve, we will operate in cooperation and coordination with the Treasury on these matters, given the Secretary of the Treasury's role in international financial policy And it is important that we not act in direct violation of Treasury's stated views; or if we did, it would be such a major event that we would feel it necessary to tell the Congress So, basically, we have operated for many, many years on the basis of trying to work these matters out with the Treasury  I'm not disputing that  I have another comment, Mr Chairman We have been operating through this period more or less simply to resist the downward pressures and not in an aggressive way, as you can tell from the numbers We have done $500 million since last Monday; the Japanese have done about almost and the Germans have done almost And there have been very, very heavy purchases of dollars by the British, partly for reasons other than the dollar situation, but it adds up to total dollar purchases in the past    11/3/87  week or so of, I would say, over $5 billion So, we have done a relatively modest amount   They were hitting the target, but nothing else was happening right  Probably  [Statement--see Appendix]  We have far more marks than we have yen for the Federal Reserve and the Treasury combined We have about $116 billion worth of marks, but only about $16 billion worth of yen  We would have to get some more yen from someplace; $16 billion is not all that big The fact is, for example, that we did $16 billion in all currencies in the past six weeks  SPEAKER(?) Sam, if the official intervention dries up--I don't mean totally dries up, but if it shrinks--what dynamics does that set in motion? The market still has to clear Does it clear at a lower level by sucking in more private sources or--  I assume it tries to suck in some financing from some source But that raises the question of on what terms and whether the dollar would have to become more attractive both through stability and through interest rates to attract any funds, official or private We still have a pretty big deficit; we're predicting a $135 billion deficit for next year in the current account So, if you look ex ante and ask people how much they plan to increase their exposure to dollars next year, I doubt that it would come anywhere close to that number Ex post, undoubtedly, somehow or other our current account deficit will get financed It's a question of how  Well, I'm sure everybody has his own experience on all of this There are these factors obviously, people who have markets don't give them up very easily; also, a country like Japan has a big import component in a lot of its exports and, therefore, the exchange rate can affect both sides of the equation I agree with you that when a currency falls by 50 percent--and we're just about at 50 percent of the level of the mark and the yen--that can't be absorbed through lower profit margins The people we talked to on the export side seemed to be sounding a lot better Now, another problem is that some of the deficit is shifting, or is covered by countries such as Taiwan Taiwan has a surplus of $25 billion all by itself, and it's a tiny economy relative to that size surplus So some of this deficit is coming from countries that have not had anything like that kind of change in the exchange rate vis-a-vis the dollar  In what terms? Market pressures are down, and every time you pick up a newspaper, you have more economists talking about the need for x, y, z, including some who say it needs another 10 percent; while it was 12 and 15 percent they had been saying the same thing I think the market people are pretty agnostic about this sort of thing They look at these trade deficits, which are enormous; and they look at the government policies, which are ambiguous in this regard They see the pressures and the consequences are pretty clear  Well, the Treasury has been working on it I think the Treasury so far has used all of the above they've locked them in a room and they've tried everything There has been some movement  -40-    12/15-16/87  This will make it 20 percent in the past year  Zero But, if you look at it in terms of the surplus, Taiwan stands alone as having the largest imbalance And, in fact as everybody knows, they have a large reserve The three largest reserves are Germany, Japan, and Taiwan; and I think Taiwan's is higher--  No, not in that order Taiwan, I think, is number two  That is true, it did not go up as much as they claim; it didn't [unintelligible] Again, we are generalizing, but in terms of the Taiwanese dollar it did not appreciate as much when it was going up But the surpluses have grown really unbelievably large Meanwhile, there are these reports out there now that their dollar holdings have gotten to be so large that the governor of their central bank has been under enormous political pressure to get rid of these depreciating dollars and get some D-marks and so forth; and he seems to be doing that So, that's not a very encouraging sign at all  Twenty-two percent is the figure I have in mind, but it's--  Well, the Treasury is working on it  No, so far [this year]--11 months That doesn't include Taiwan which is another and a lot of other countries It includes only those that are on our concentration network, which is the G-10 plus some assorted European countries  What I was saying was that it's not going to be as easy, looking forward, as it has been in the past Everybody has substantially higher dollar balances; countries are under pressure; there are public commentaries For example, in London in the Financial Times, there's an article by Sam Britton asking why the British are holding all of these weak and depreciating dollars, and saying they should be moving into marks [unintelligible] in this story There undoubtedly are going to be pressures on a lot of countries to be a lot more reluctant than they have been to add to their dollar holdings  Well, it is one of the elements I don't know how widespread it is We hear reports of a few countries here and there  If they hadn't bought $100 billion worth of dollars then I would ask the question How would we have financed the deficit last year? There's a big hole there somewhere  If we had adjusted and eliminated the deficit, that would be a different story  It seems to have different kinds of effects There is the fact that Germany and other countries are more dependent on oil than we are, for example There is also the fact that oil is very heavily a dollar-financed phenomenon So there have been times when changes in the oil price seemed to affect the dollar one way and times when it affected it another way I would assume that the reluctance that we are seeing now might be, on balance, helpful  Well, sterling has been a little softer in the past few days One possibility is that it has been reflecting what has gone on in the oil market but there are some other things going on, too The British seem to have had this policy of trying to maintain the pound at 3 DM and they have held that pretty firmly and have undertaken an enormous amount of intervention [unintelligible] Some people think that maybe the message that they are going to hold it is beginning to be accepted and that part of the decline in sterling reflects that  Quite apart from what they did recently,  There was heavy upward pressure on the pound during much of that time And, there are questions about whether the British will, and should, reduce their interest rates    12/15-16/87   [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, they're talking about $13-1/2 billion They probably have very little basis for knowing, just like everybody else; but the fact remains that they tend to get these numbers in their minds, and if it comes out better or worse than their expectations, it has an effect That's the latest commentary, although it has varied from yesterday when we were hearing numbers anywhere from $11 billion to $14 billion or more Then Mr Yeutter made some comments yesterday, which seemed to have taken a little of the bloom off the rose, that it's on the low side And so, today, they seem to be talking about levels of around $13-1/2 billion  Yes Accordingly, we haven't been hearing as many high numbers as I would like to hear   [Statement--see Appendix]  There has been a great deal of concern that, particularly during March, the yen has been held down artificially and the dollar has been held up artificially because of concerns about the Japanese institutions who must complete their bookkeeping at the end of March Much of this has to do with the Japanese insurance companies who, according to the rules that they follow, have to adjust the value of their total holdings of foreign and dollar securities if the dollar falls by 15 percent, on average, during March from the level of a year ago This would mean a very substantial recalculation of the books of these insurance companies And there is a widespread view that that possibility, plus traditional Japanese window-dressing operations, which are very important, have caused the Japanese to take steps to avoid the pressure to cause the yen to rise--to hold the dollar up against the yen, in effect, until after this March 31st date So the question now is whether, after the end of March, there will be some tendency and intention, on behalf of the Japanese particularly, to shift out of dollars or to cease the operations which the market thinks are holding the dollar up, or to take other steps  It would have to go down pretty low at this point We recalculate this every day; we just don't have the latest update Yesterday it was something like 121 or 122 But one argument made in the market about some of the pressure recently is that this is less of a concern now that we've gotten close enough to the end of the fiscal year There is less of a reason for the yen to be held down  They have not been intervening in very heavy amounts, but they have been taking related steps There was a statement by the head of the Japanese insurance groups last night, saying that he didn't expect a lot of sell-off of dollar securities after the end of the fiscal year I assume that the Bank of Japan put him up to that There have been other steps that they have taken to contain some of these pressures  Yes, I think that--  That's right, but--  No, but the year-end is particularly important And this happens even when we don't face the kind of exchange market situations that we face now The Japanese are very conscious of these year-end figures, and toward the end of the fiscal year there are a lot of pressures back and forth, reflecting that concern So this is not a new phenomenon  Well, they've been telling us that they need some slight pressures--again, because of those fiscal year-end kinds of problems But we have not gotten from them evidence that they are tightening beyond that   Well, it's been an interesting period, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]  We have had consultations with the other central banks and we've talked with them quite frequently every day But we don't always have the same view of what's happening in the market or what should be done in response I mentioned in my report that the Germans specifically had been quite concerned about the decline in the exchange rate for the mark, which they feel has inflationary implications for them, particularly with what they see as excessive liquidity in their economy They think it is neither good for them, nor for the monetary system more broadly, for the mark to be declining as it has been declining under the circumstances The dollar/mark rate has changed from its low point in January by about 26 pfennigs, which is more than 15 percent And as a surplus country, they feel as though they should not be in a situation with the mark declining; they're a bit concerned about that  Our own activity has been aimed not at trying to drive the dollar down; no one wants to do that But equally, it seems to me, we do not have an interest in seeing the dollar move up to unsustainable levels and then see it fall again Our view is that a substantial amount of what is going on now is indeed a covering of shorts We hear a lot of talk about what's happening in the options market We hear a lot of talk about hedging operations by investors here and    6/29-30/88  elsewhere And we think that a lot of this is a covering of short positions which were built up over the past several months at the time when the market view was that the authorities would not let the dollar rise And therefore, [market participants] could pretty well have a one-way bet on which way to hedge Once this gets cleared out, we still have a huge deficit, and we still have all these other factors that have to be dealt with I don't think anybody thinks we're out of the woods at this point So our efforts in the intervention activities and the other activities we've undertaken have been partly to give ourselves some more currencies Those currencies could become very useful in future months when we could very well be needing them in order to help support the dollar [The intervention sales also were undertaken] to show some resistance to the rise in the dollar, so as not to let it get to levels which are simply going to be unsustainable--because service problems could well disrupt the market again That's how I would [unintelligible] We have operated, as I say, only in deutschemarks, not in yen where the movements have been much less  Well, there have been changes in monetary policy which were intended to support some moves that have taken place But certainly we hear a great deal to suggest that a large part of this is indeed short covering in one form or another--be it dehedging by investors All of last year Japanese investors bought a lot of US dollar-denominated assets, but they hedged a lot of dollar-denominated assets And some of those hedges have been eliminated  Also, we've been hearing for a long time that corporations have been holding off entering the market As the rate has moved up, there has been the need to buy some dollars in order to meet their needs and their requirements But certainly it's our view that a very large amount of this is of the nature, in one form or another, of covering options and other hedging The holders of those short dollar positions became worried at times when they saw that the dollar was moving up And when they detected that, they did decide to short [unintelligible] immediately to keep the dollar from rising  Well, because it has become costly  The dollar was under upward pressure, and also there was a view that the dollar could go up farther and that the authorities would not hold it I think it was, in part, a change in their perception about what the authorities' attitudes were going to be  If the dollar hadn't risen, then there wouldn't have been any need to short [unintelligible]  Sure    6/29-30/88  No, as I said at the beginning, there has been a firm undertone to the dollar because of some improvement in the trade figures embedded in the changes and a changing view of Federal Reserve policy There already was a firm undertone, but this view about what the authorities would do popped up last week  If you look at the change in short-term interest rate differentials, the differentials have gotten much narrower vis-a- vis the mark since the last meeting  That's right  I wasn't trying to suggest that nothing has happened in the dollar  We have a limit I think we're way below that  $12 billion  Set by this Committee, right It's an informal understanding set by this Committee, so it is formal [in that sense] But we are well below those numbers and we're not likely to--  Only just that they--the classes of [unintelligible] But they've got to have--  That's right, to offset the foreign currency counterpart But there are ways of doing it  There are innumerable ways to work out arrangements whereby both the Treasury's and the Federal Reserve's foreign currency balances could be increased  We have daily currency limits, intermeeting period limits, and all of those  We haven't reached any of those during this period  What I was saying was that, obviously, there have been a lot of changes that have occurred in the period, including what has happened to our trade [balance] and all the rest  I would indeed But all I was saying was that even with that improvement, we still have very, very large trade and    6/29-30/88  current account deficits that have got to be financed It has changed; there's no question about that It has shown some improvement  I don't know--I'm not sure how to answer your question Obviously, interest rates are a factor in determining the strength of the dollar And changes in differentials--certainly I wouldn't say they are not significant as well I think they are--  We've been trying to operate so as not to give an impression that we are capping the dollar, and we have been urging the Europeans to operate in a way which would not give an impression that we were putting caps on the dollar at a particular level We have been offering some resistance, but we've been trying to do it in a moderate way There's an old Scottish golfer's prayer, you know, "May God give me the strength to hit easy" It's an effort to try to resist, not to absolutely assure that we're trying to cap the exchange rate That's certainly not what we're trying to do  Yes But it's certainly true that during the period when the dollar has been stable, as Ted said, the investors have become very conscious of interest rate differentials and the attractiveness not only of the US dollar, but the Canadian dollar,    6/29-30/88  the Australian currency, and various other currencies where the nominal interest rates are quite attractive  Well, I think the Germans in particular are much more troubled about what they see as the problem of a depreciating mark They're very conscious of that And they think the inflationary implications of excessive liquidity at home, which they think [unintelligible] plus a depreciating currency are very bad They think it is bad from the point of view of international adjustment to have a big surplus country like Germany having a depreciation in its currency They're very conscious of that and they view the problem from that perspective We view it from a different perspective Inevitably, we're going to have those differences of view  Well, I don't think we're under any great illusions about the extent to which intervention can or cannot make fundamental changes Certainly, our effort has been to try to deal with instability rather than to add to it  Well, it depends on against what [the depreciation is measured]  [Secretary's note Several people spoke at once and their comments were unintelligible]   [Statement--see Appendix]  The average in terms of what?  The United States or worldwide?  We don't really know  We know what we do and they know what they do  On the part of the United States-- Sorry to give you numbers, but worldwide it's probably equal to at least $300 or $400 billion a day  Well, that we don't really know    8/16/88  When we are intervening we are trying to bring about a certain influence And certainly, the market is constantly and intensely out there watching to see what signs we--and by that I mean the central banks collectively--are giving They are very much concerned about whether there is evidence that the central banks are going to [intervene] The central banks can hurt them when they choose to come into the market And they certainly pay great attention to that in all cases And they can, on occasion, keep some of these movements from moving in one direction or another and kind of getting--  Most of our intervention has been done in a way which was designed to be noticed, because that was part of the purpose And I have been impressed with the extent to which the people who watch these things closely have a pretty good fix on the amounts being done, and they know the purposes  That's right  It gets in the balance sheets and we will announce it I give a quarterly report in September, and in that we will indicate that we have purchased these currencies We will not be specific about the source--the counterpart--but we will indicate publicly that we have picked up these currencies   [Statement--see Appendix]   [Statement--see Appendix]  I don't think the expectation in the market is that the economy is very weak I think that they had been expecting and thinking that it was growing a lot more robustly and that that was going to lead to higher interest rates and was yielding some upward pressure on the dollar That was the prevailing attitude in which the various statistical releases [came out] all suggesting that the growth is not so robust And so they are reassessing that  Different things prevail in these markets at different times, but that seems to be a very important factor  That's right, as much of this is based on what they had been expecting  Well, as you know, we've been trying to introduce some stability, and I think it's understandable in a period when the dollar is falling about 10 percent that we could be on both sides of [the market with] that sort of exchange rate movements It's not surprising in a number of European countries [to see intervention on] opposite sides of the exchange markets within a matter of [unintelligible] We attempt this, it seems to me, not to try to say with a great degree of precision what is the right exchange rate but to say that we are trying to introduce a greater measure of stability    11/1/88  I think if you look back over the period since the Louvre Accord, there has been somewhat more stability in these exchange rates And it is of some value, some importance, when you think of the problems that arise if, for example, the dollar should start to fall very rapidly against the yen and trigger responses by all of the present holders of the dollars to try to protect themselves We have to walk this narrow line between trying to encourage a certain degree of stability and to keep the financing for this deficit occurring until we can move further toward other financing It seems to me that's the basic policy  Well, not really I think I said earlier that as we moved up toward the election there has been a feeling on the part of a lot of people in the market that the authorities would be particularly careful not to let exchange rates change very wildly, and they succeeded in doing that  All I'm suggesting is that that is what is in the market  I'm a reporter  It certainly has been a factor in the foreign exchange market for some time  -14-    11/1/88  You know, a stronger economy or a weaker economy can lead to all kinds of other things which sometimes lead to strengthening and sometimes to weakness  Well, as the dollar has tended to slide against the yen, we've been hearing more reports of hedging As they get less confident they tend to hedge more; that's the form it takes, but it has the same exchange rate effect  We get reports on this And certainly during some periods this year when the exchange rates appeared to be relatively safe and stable, there was a tendency to shift into the high interest rate currencies by Japanese investors--into the Australian, Canadian, sterling currencies--  It's very hard to be very precise You hear what one person says; then you hear three other people But certainly there is this prevailing concern that as we look forward a few months there are those big problems, and we are going to have a new Adminis- tration That in itself brings a little uncertainty to the situation Are they going to be able to and will they take actions to deal with these problems? So as you look ahead a few months this is very much on their minds  I assume that they are acting on the basis of that concern But it's hard to have any precise numbers   Alan, you're fading in and out   [Statement--see Appendix]  I didn't say that I thought it was too weak  The mark has weakened some during the course of this year on a weighted-average basis At the same time, the German current account balance has been strengthening, their trade balance has been strengthening Now with us, our trade balance has been improving, Mr Chairman There is a European entry factor or element to this, and the Germans have been increasing their trade balance with a number of their European partners, both in the EMS and outside the EMS So, their concern has been that the mark not appear to be too weak during the period when they see the trade balance strengthening  Well, we have heard numbers anywhere from $8-1/2 to $12-1/2 billion Now, it gets a little confusing because there are two bases for calculating it these days, and we are not always sure people are talking in the same terms The general view seems to be that the trade deficit will be around $10 billion this time But there are some--  That's CIF, yes  Yes, CIF and seasonally adjusted    12/13-14/88  Well, I wouldn't jump to any big conclusions because we've had other occasions when the number came in very well and the dollar moved down I believe the market has seen that it's possible to get hurt by shorting the dollar too much And I think the trade figures are certainly hanging over the market in an important way So I think a lot of participants are not anxious to do too much until then It could be that a good trade figure would provide a little more support, but it's not a sure thing  That was not our intention and indeed when I got asked, at the press conference when we released this quarterly report, whether we were just trying to smooth the dollar, I said we weren't We are trying to do more than that  Well, for one thing, unless you're really going to intervene in very, very large amounts it's not always crystal clear just what the reaction is going to be to an expenditure of 'X' amount of dollars But also we have to work this out very closely with our colleagues in the Treasury who may or may not feel that it is a good idea to intervene very strongly at a particular time And, also, not in the precise amounts always, but we do try to coordinate our efforts with the other central banks so that we all give the same kind of message There were occasions in this period when a number of people in the market thought that our efforts were not big enough really to smack the exchange rate in a decisive way I do think that over a period of several weeks as we continued to do this that the cumulative effect of this became more noticeable and more important   [Statement--see Appendix]   Yes, Mr Chairman, I would I would like to raise one point with respect to the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations We are currently authorized to maintain [foreign currency] balances up to a total of $12 billion equivalent Our present holdings, at about $94 billion, are well within that limit But in addition to this formal authorization there are three informal limits which are not contained either in the Authorization, the Directive, or the Procedural Instructions These [informal understandings] call for us to limit our holdings of German marks to $8 billion equivalent, Japanese yen to $3 billion equivalent, and other currencies as a group to $1 billion equivalent All of our intervention in recent months has been in marks and we are now about $150 million or a little more above that informal limit for marks We notified the Committee of that situation by a telex that was sent out on March 15th But, Mr Chairman, I would like to propose that the Committee consider eliminating these informal sublimits for the particular currencies so that the $12 billion authorization for foreign currency balances could be used more flexibly I question whether the informal sublimits currently are a very useful management tool The particular currencies that we operate in are determined, of course, by market conditions and other factors And in any event, we    3/28/89  would continue to be under a number of limitations--qualitative as well as quantitative limitations--both with the [Foreign Currency] Subcommittee and the Committee These limits relate to the changes in each currency for a single day and for the intermeeting period as well as changes in the overall balances for a single day in the intermeeting period and so forth I believe these various limits provide for adequate monitoring and control by the Committee and the Subcommittee without the informal sublimits Accordingly, I would recommend that the Committee consider eliminating the three informal sublimits If the Committee did wish to retain those sublimits I would need to request a change in the overall Authorization in order to provide more headroom in the event we need to acquire more marks and yen So, I recommend the elimination of the three informal sublimits  Obviously, we will want over time to acquire various amounts in particular currencies But I don't think that this particular arrangement is the way in which we are best able to do that For example, our holdings of yen have been low and we've been undertaking such measures as we could to raise those holdings both for the System and the Treasury Indeed, we did acquire some yen during this recent period by buying them from a customer But I don't think that the informal sublimit is a very useful mechanism for doing this We have to make decisions and acquire those currencies more or less as conditions permit and as our policies aim us to do I don't think these limits help very much operationally  Well, if I went too far in saying what was the optimum that might raise a lot of questions But we certainly report regularly on the amounts of the individual currencies    3/28/89  Well, at the present time we have $94 billion and the limit is $12 billion Looking ahead, say, for the next year it's certainly conceivable that we would need to go above that I would assume that the Committee would not find it difficult to change the limit at the time, if the conditions arose Or, it could be changed right now when we are reviewing this at our annual review  [Yes] That is a formal authorization and that is public The present authorization is for $12 billion and has been at that level for a couple of years, I guess  Well, we have a $2-1/2 billion [leeway] And, of course, when we intervene we have typically done half of it and the Treasury has done half So that means a potential [increase in U S holdings] of $5 billion worth before we run into a problem I would assume that if conditions were such that we needed a change in the Authorization, it would not be difficult to propose that and to change it at the time  No I'd be happy to have any further headroom the Committee wishes to offer But I can't really make a strong case that it's likely to happen and would require a meeting  Above $600 million requires the Subcommittee's approval and above $1-1/2 billion requires the Committee's approval  That's in all currencies  [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, the Ministry of Finance in Japan thus far often has intervened itself to resist the decline in the yen And the US Treasury has not been prepared up to this point to [intervene unless] we have the agreement of the Japanese before anything is done And the Japanese have not felt that this situation yet warranted intervention Now, in the past day or two the pressures on the yen have become more substantial The Finance Minister did make a statement last night--at which point the yen had weakened to above the 133 level--saying something to the effect that they were watching [developments] very carefully at the 133 level, which was taken by the market as a signal that that might be a key point The rate then moved down a bit below 133 and that's where it is now I imagine there will be discussions of this--certainly this weekend when the G-7 gets together But up to this point the Minister of Finance has not wanted to see intervention or to be involved in intervention to resist the decline  I don't think there has been any very notable change The G-7, of course, met in February and they are going to meet again The general premises within which these activities have been taking place remain more or less the same  Well, I would hope that it wouldn't come to a point where we were operating at cross purposes with the Japanese It would be very difficult if we reached the stage where it was as overt as that These intervention operations obviously work much, much better if all parties are marching together We have seen many times, both with the Germans and the Japanese, that the market pays a lot more attention when they see that we are uniformly aiming in a certain direction, trying to bring about a certain purpose It's difficult to be operating in one direction if the central bank or the government on the other side doesn't agree or indeed is opposed to it So, it's much better to work it out  But even those [transactions] have not been easily arranged  With the Canadians or the others it required working it out with the Japanese But they are a little more amenable to that than if it's going to impact directly on their exchange rate  That's becoming increasingly apparent It is true that up until recently most of the pressures were not in the yen but were in the European currencies But it is moving more and more in that direction and it is becoming clear that we are getting to the point where there is a need to do something about the movement in the yen as well That is part of my own concern And as I say, the    3/28/89  pressures of the past few days have been led by the movements of the yen That's the first time during this recent period of activity where that has been the case; but it is now the case On the other hand, if you look back to the low points--which were at the beginning of last year--the 1988 low point for the mark was 156 and we're now at 188 and the low point for the yen was just over 120 So, it's getting closer but not quite as much  Well, I think there are various factors They are divided There are some in Germany who will say that they could be tightening domestically and not necessarily going through the exchange rate They are divided The mark has moved up against some currencies as well as having softened against the dollar If you look at the mark on a trade-weighted basis you don't get the same picture that you do if you look just at the dollar-mark relationship The Germans, I think, have a genuine problem with respect to the EMS Their concern at the moment is that the EMS is fully stretched--in other words, they are at the top of the band and, as it turns out, Denmark is now at the bottom of the band At those levels they have to intervene fully in order to keep the rates from moving beyond that There were very, very large amounts of intervention in the Danish currency last week, in fact They did on one day, which is a lot for a small country And they did almost the next day The Germans are concerned that--the mark being weak against the dollar and strong against the EMS--if they intervene on the dollar side it's just going to cause a lot more trouble and lead to serious pressures in flows and political problems and all the rest with the EMS  The Danish are down there but the pressures could move to the others, particularly if the question of whether to reform the EMS currency alignments and so forth arose It could lead to pressures The French not too long ago had been under some pressure; they are not at the moment But--  Since Italy is not really in the arrangement, they don't have the same obligation to intervene So they don't have the same problem on the intervention side  We talk to the Germans and we make these points, too But I think you do have to recognize that there are pressures from the EMS angle of it  Well, they have a stagnant economy and they don't want to raise their interest rates So they are having a lot of capital outflows  They are still concerned or have a fear that the dollar-yen relationship is going to move back in the other direction and that it's going to cause problems there At least that's what they say Now, I assume that there is an interest from the point of view of their whole economy and their exports and so forth for them to try not to get back into intervention if they can avoid it But it gets harder and harder to make that case as the rates move We are still at 133 And the last time we were intervening I think it was close to 137 So the yen is not within any new ranges in that sense  In terms of the dollar outlook? I think they are waiting and I think they are moving--  --with a short-term focus to see what's going to happen on this As I said, at the present time these markets are very fickle They watch one thing for a while and then they watch something else But right now they are watching very closely the inflation and monetary policy actions in all these countries because there has been so much attention on and concern about whether inflation is growing worldwide So, that's the main focus of    3/28/89  attention right now what's going to be done about it and what the various players are going to do   [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, it's not easy to give a generalized statement that covers all the situations The Germans have intervened more or less throughout the period, although not in very large amounts In part, the Germans tend to have a different attitude, tactically, about what is the best way to intervene and [believe] that the intervention is more effective if done in certain ways As for the Japanese, views differ because the institutions are divided over there The Bank of Japan has been much more interested in intervening to stop the decline of the yen than the Ministry of Finance And the Ministry of Finance calls the tune In the past several days the Japanese have begun to take a much more active role in the intervention and they have done against the dollar/yen in each of the past two days  No, we focus our intervention on what has been happening in the market and where the pressures have developed This is the first time we've intervened in yen in a long time But it is because the conditions were such that it seemed to us appropriate to intervene in yen Before then the yen had not fallen so much As I said earlier, the yen had risen substantially more than the other currencies If you look back at the direction in which it has moved, the yen has not been as weak as the other currencies--and still isn't in a sense, if you compare it with where it started off at the time of the Louvre agreement However, the yen did begin to slip more and we were concerned, looking at it from the other direction, about the rise in the dollar The Japanese have been concerned about it too So, we have been intervening as the yen began to slip more in the past three weeks  Yes We talk to them every day, repeatedly We talk about the activities that we're proposing and we work it out with them  Well, the dollar has been on this very strong upward [course] As I said earlier, certainly there's no evidence that we have turned the situation around As the dollar gets higher-- and it has gotten above the levels that have been seen before--there is some greater apprehension and nervousness within the market, partly about what the response of the central banks is going to be and whether the market is going to face a movement in the other direction But so far the pressures have continued to be on the upward side  Well, sometimes the Germans have a view that the way to get the market's attention is to and kick it in the teeth very strongly We get a little nervous about too much of that I don't want to overstate it because we usually are able to work these differences out and reach an agreement  Well, I think that's true To some extent the capital gains already have been a factor In my report I was talking about some of the factors that have been tending to put upward pressure on the dollar Recently, as statistical reports have come out that suggest that the economy may be a little less robust, you do hear people drawing the conclusion that that makes the long bond an opportunity for some capital gains But you're right presumably, if they feel that way they have been acting on that, and that may be a factor that is already discounted to some extent  Obviously, we talk about whatever factors are affecting the directions of the currencies Certainly, the Germans have been concerned at times about the fact that their money has been growing more rapidly than their targets That is certainly a factor affecting their situation  I think they're trying to; I think there are efforts to try to get their own situation under better--  Since the last meeting the short-term interest rate differential between the dollar and the mark has narrowed by 125 basis points and against the yen by 113 basis points There has been--  No, I don't think it has gone the other way Well, I'm not talking about ours, I'm talking about theirs I think theirs has so much--  Well, if I assume that this manifests itself to a large degree in the interest rates, the interest rate movements have certainly been in that direction 1-3/4 points is not an insignificant reduction in the margins for a 6-week period  Yes  I recommend, with respect to the recent activity, that the Committee approve our operations since the last meeting which are just under $14 billion equivalent worth of sales of dollars I would also like to raise with the Committee a point with respect to our foreign currency authorization limit, if I can present that at this time That limit, which is a public figure, provides that the System can hold foreign currency balances up to a total of $12 billion equivalent At present we have nearly $11 billion equivalent As I mentioned earlier, since the Plaza agreement in September of 1985 when we embarked on this practice of a more active intervention role we have bought about $14 billion and we have sold about $14 billion But the value of our foreign currency balances during that same period has doubled from about $5-1/2 billion to about $11 billion The reasons they have doubled are really three-fold One, we have made a profit in that we have sold the dollar when it was relatively high and we have bought the dollar when it was relatively low About 40 percent of that increase in the value of our foreign currency holdings represents those profits A second factor is that we have, along with the Treasury, bought yen--not through intervention operations but through some direct transactions between ourselves and the Japanese Ministry of Finance and other bodies That, too, has added about 40 percent to the increase in the value of these foreign currency balances The third factor is that we have our balances invested and    5/16/89  we continue to earn interest on them; and the remaining roughly 20 percent represents the earnings on our balances So, we now are getting up much closer to the authorized limit of $12 billion I would like to propose that the Committee raise the authorized limit from $12 billion to $15 billion in order to provide more headroom so that if circumstances are such that the value of our foreign currency balances increases we will have room to accommodate that within the authorized limit So my recommendation, Mr Chairman, is that the Committee raise the limit in the Foreign Currency Authorization from $12 billion to $15 billion  No, they are much more heavily in marks  We don't have very many yen at the present time  Well, I doubt that this is a very controversial or newsworthy issue; I don't know It is a matter we report and I don't believe it has gained much attention in the past I proposed a $3 billion increase on the grounds that that would provide some reasonable comfort and that if circumstances arose where something further were needed then we would have to reconsider the question If the Committee proposes a higher figure, that's fine with me  It only becomes effective on the one side of intervention when we're selling dollars, if we're selling any  Yes But I must say that there is some value in having some marbles to play with if we're going to be in this game And I think the level of reserves that we have, compared to almost anything, is really very modest But I think the $3 billion I    5/16/89  proposed would be adequate; if [the Committee preferred] $5 billion, I would be quite happy to see that  That includes it That's all we have in yen We used up our yen balances and have not acquired very much So, we only have that amount; and a large part of that came from outside purchases, not from intervention   Yes sir, Mr Chairman [Statement--not transcribed]   [Statement--see Appendix]  We review it every year It was reviewed in March of this year and reestablished without change, as has been done for many years--ever since I've been here  Yes  No  The devaluation of gold in 1933  The logic in a sense is not too different from what the Treasury and the Central Bank have Even when the gold flowed into the country then you were allowed to issue those certificates and receive dollars for them We no longer have the gold flows; we have foreign exchange flows And this, in a sense, is a similar allowance for the Treasury to monetize these assets and gain the dollars for them  It isn't the Fund What this does is to shift the assets in the Fund; it doesn't change the size of the Fund It allows them to transfer one asset to another asset  Yes The dollar has been declining now for several weeks and we're about 8 or 9 percent down from the highs We still have more than $2 billion availability under the open limit  Pardon me?  We value it on the basis at which we have actually made a transaction; so we don't change it when the exchange rates change That is the only way we can do it because, if we didn't handle it that way, we could inadvertently run out of leeway with nothing happening  Well, during this period we did most of it in what we call a discreet manner That is to say, we operated through a bank acting as an agent so that--although the word does get around in some way and people who are following these markets closely can often tell a lot of what's going on--we did not go in openly buying foreign currencies For the most part we had particular banks operating on our behalf in order not to show the extent to which the central banks were in there We had gotten to a point where operating visibly was not really working very effectively and we thought it would be better to operate this way Indeed, it has been much more successful Remember, the other central banks have done the same thing, following our doing it The Germans most recently, and the Japanese too, have been operating in a discreet manner  I think it was a lot more effective because we had reached a point where the market tended to feel that these rates were out of control--well, not out of control but beyond the ranges that the authorities wanted And when they saw the central bank coming in there they almost took that as a basis [for believing] that the dollar was by definition undervalued And they tended to hit it quickly Now, in operating more discreetly we have been able to kind    7/5-6/89  of encourage the dollar down without appearing to try to take on the market in a direct way Under certain conditions one technique is more appropriate and under other circumstances another way is We have felt during this period, given the market conditions that we faced, that this was the better way to operate And I think that has proved to be the case  Let me say a couple of things First, even when we're operating openly we may go to, say, 5 banks out of 100--whatever the number is So it's not as though we operate in the way the domestic Desk does and broadcast [our operations]; we never do that We operate with a certain--we go out to do the transaction Secondly, when we've operated discreetly we have done that with a bank on the understanding that they not reveal this information or talk to other parts of their institution and so forth Now, obviously the word--  Well, in a sense, a bank can do that any time we are in the market and are trading with a bank As I say, if we are operating quite openly we might go out and talk to 5 banks or 10 banks They might choose to join us, and this helps move the market in the direction [we want] if they're convinced that it's going that way We do move around from one institution to another; we don't use the same one, obviously Sometimes we might use several at once, but we do it in a way that they are not supposed to go tell all their customers and others that they are operating on behalf of the Fed  Anybody who is operating to suit our interest against their own interest is going to end up in the hardware business or something pretty soon I don't think any of them do that  We do buy at the best price  We were trying to influence the market; that doesn't mean we were trying to fool the market But I don't know that it would follow that we always have to tell everybody in the market every time we operate That seems to me to be a different matter  Well, we increased it by $10 billion; we had $20 billion and we now have $30 billion  Well, no I certainly don't recall any such time We have always had [some] and, indeed, even though $30 billion is higher than what we've had in the past I suspect the time may come when we will be pleased to have some currencies But--  Let's see  It's $90 billion if you use market price  It's not clear  Right  It might not make any difference; it would depend on what the Treasury's attitude was and what they were able to do about it in part And that creates all kinds of--  Well, or to make some other changes  It's 18815 in marks and 13830 in yen  That's certainly part of the explanation  They've been looking at purchasing managers' [reports] I think there has been a cessation of the things that were driving the dollar up--all these political factors, these portfolio things, that have happened They have tended to focus on other subjects They have seen some evidence that the economy appears to be easing, or is at least slowing down a little; and building on these expectations about what's happening to interest rates is certainly part of it, I think   [Statement--see Appendix]  No, if you're speaking of--  Well, of course, the exchange market is influenced by a vast number of factors in addition to interest rates But I would not differ from the statements in the Bluebook and all that has been presented, which suggest that higher interest rates would tend to add to the pressure on the dollar But there are many, many other factors involved It depends, of course, on all of the things going on in other countries During the last several months, we've seen some fairly substantial changes in the interest rate differentials between the United States and some of the other major countries And that has not taken away the structure--  That was certainly a factor during this period, and the pressures on the dollar did change at about the time when    8/22/89  there seemed to be a change in the market's perception of US monetary policy But I think what I said was that there are many, many other factors involved that are also going to affect the pressures I don't think it is simply a matter of the interest rates  All I'm saying is that over the past several months we have seen the narrowing of the interest differentials--it has been a couple hundred basis points--and there has continued to be pressure on the dollar despite that  Well, at the present time, the market is [unintelligible] and continues to be reasonably bullish on the dollar; [investors] see the dollar as a good place to be They compare the dollar with some of the [alternatives] and, as I say, there's relative stability here politically and economically as compared with Japan and elsewhere Throughout most of this year there has been a tendency for [investors] looking very long term to see the dollar as a good place to be And there has been some reassessment and shifting of portfolios with a tendency to have a greater share in dollar investments and less concern about hedging against it So, in that sense I think the market has been pretty bullish on the dollar and continues to be  Well, that's not quite what I was saying Given everything that's going on--and not just interest rates--I think there is a firmness and a strong support for the dollar  Legal  Certainly that number, when it was reported, was noted in the exchange market And at least during that day it was certainly a supporting factor They did pay some attention to that   I'm not even going to report today!  [Statement--see Appendix]  We are at just under $1-1/2 billion below the ceiling Whether it is going to prove necessary to request a further change in that depends very much on how things develop over the months ahead But we do have $1-1/2 billion which, if we share 50/50 with the Treasury, means that there could be a substantial amount of intervention--$3 billion worth--before we would come up against the ceiling  Well, the words in the Communique were exactly what you said and exactly what I read in my statement--that a further rise or an excessive decline could adversely affect the prospects I would say, though, that there is a very, very major difference between going in and hammering the dollar down in falling markets and resisting it when it is rising We didn't always resist it immediately when it showed any increase; we resisted when it was rising and let the market take it down some Obviously, the market knew that the G-7 was trying to guide the dollar down some But the point I was making was that we did recognize and try to take account of, as much as we could, the risks that could follow if we really did go in and hammer the dollar down while it was falling, which we didn't really do  So far as I'm aware, there is none  I am not aware of any target ranges that are in existence While there were some months and months ago, I don't think those have any relevance at the present time  Well, we were talking every day--  Our objective was to curb the dollar's rise and to have it decline some We did not want it to fall an enormous--  We discuss every day what to do for the following day It had fallen a little from time to time; it did not fall in massive amounts on any day We discussed with the others, based on the closing level in New York, say, on Tuesday, what might be a sensible target  There is an understanding that the rise that had occurred was not helpful And there is an effort to bring about greater stability and to reduce the dollar somewhat But no one knows that you need to move the dollar down to XYZ point in order to assure    10/3/89  that it meets with these longer-term [fundamentals] So the intention, as far as I'm concerned, was to try to take away some of this upward momentum and to let it ease off somewhat But, as I say, it hasn't fallen all that much and we haven't driven it down that much We're now at levels we saw in August--that's less than two months ago--and that we saw earlier in May I'm sure that if the dollar were to show a further significant rise this approach would change  We would have stopped  No  We entered in for almost all of that after the dollar had moved up from that 139    10/3/89  We knew of some points that were particularly sensitive in the market as the dollar got up close to 140 [yen] and we went in again in order to try to keep it from going through the 140 level We didn't do enough to keep it from going through  [They warehouse] foreign currencies with us, so they--  Ted's salary for the next 4,000 years--  Approve the transactions that I have already done  No, it's the matter of the money  That's a different issue in my opinion  My understanding is did I act within the authority authorized and provided for by the Committee even though I  -17-    10/3/89  recognized that certain people didn't agree or did not favor the way that was--   Mr Chairman, when we closed here in New York on Friday, the dollar was trading at about 142 yen and 187 mark Now, that was at 400 o'clock, and the dollar did slip a little further after that in fairly chaotic circumstances In Asia and in Europe overnight last night, the dollar slipped a bit from the rates that I mentioned, but all-in-all the performance, I think, has been    10/16/89  reasonably good The lowest that we saw last night and this morning was in Asia where the dollar hit 183 or so in the mark and 139, or around that level, in the yen These rates were hit pretty soon after markets began to open up in Asia last night During most of the evening and morning the rates were fairly steady and even drifted up somewhat So, at the present time, we have rates against the yen at about 1405 and against the mark at about 1845 Obviously, they are all very edgy and very nervous and are anxiously awaiting what happens to stocks But on the whole, the dollar has performed reasonably stably Thank you   Mr Chairman, after our meeting yesterday morning, the dollar did strengthen somewhat as the stock market recovered during the course of the day, although the exchange market continued to be rather nervous The dollar came up by a couple of pfennigs and 1-1/2 yen In the markets overnight in Asia and Europe, the currency was relatively stable as we saw the stock markets in those countries generally recovering some of the losses--in some cases about as much as 1/2 of the losses--in the stock market of the previous day But in the foreign exchange market, the players were somewhat restrained prior to the release of the trade figures; they were waiting to see what that was going to show when the other data came out this morning When the trade deficit was announced at $108 billion, that was well above the market's expectations, which had been in the $9 to $9-1/2 billion range The immediate reaction was for the dollar to slip by a couple of pfennigs and one yen It has continued now to trade around those levels or a little higher We're now looking at numbers of about 185 on the mark and 141 plus on the yen, which as I say is about 1-1/2 to 2 pfennigs and about a yen down from where they were immediately prior to the release of the trade figures We do hear some concern that the trade figures may lead to a resumption of declines in the stock market when it opens up; and the immediate reaction as our trade figures were announced was some slippage in the price of US securities in London as well as in London's own market So that's where we are at the moment, Mr Chairman Thank you   Well, Mr Chairman, the exchange market continues to be nervous and jumpy and continues to be influenced by what's happening or expected to happen to the general economy The markets are thin and many customers are standing on the sidelines [The direction of any] quick movement that we see seems to be determined more by the traders and the other big players than the customers Yesterday at this time I mentioned that right after the trade figures [were released] the dollar declined by about 1 percent, partly in anticipation of what they were expecting the stock markets to do In the late morning and early afternoon and after the recovery of the Dow from those early declines, the dollar also recovered and made up those earlier losses So, by the end of the day we were back to the levels prevailing before the trade deficit was announced The recovery was led by the dollar/yen; throughout yesterday's [trading session] there continued to be buying pressures from the Japanese in the yen Overnight--in Tokyo's afternoon--the dollar did ease back somewhat There was some profit-taking and also the question of the earthquake, which raised a lot of uncertainty and questions about what was going to happen to the stock market this morning, and also raised questions that Peter mentioned about the payments system and the ability to settle So, the dollar has eased back again in light of that and is now trading at about 140-1/2 and 184-1/2 The announcement of Mr Honecker's resignation has had no effect so far, and the housing starts [data] seem to have had no effect Thank you   [Statement--see Appendix]  No  Well, I was talking about for our account We did operate for the Bank of England in our market  With their funds, as an agent We do that quite often for any number of central banks  No, this was a Bank of England operation; all we did was to undertake it in New York  We haven't intervened in sterling for our own account for as long as I've been in the job  That was disbursed and reported at the previous meeting  In fact, there has been a modest repayment since then So that's [not] all fully outstanding  Well, they are not only narrow; the Desk was telling me this morning that German interest rates throughout the range beyond six months are now higher than ours And this is the first time, I suppose, in a decade--maybe [more]  SPEAKER(?) Maybe back in the '70s  I don't know how long, but certainly it has been many years  Well, I think people can come to different conclusions on this But certainly the reasons for investing in the dollar or in the mark are affected by a large number of things in addition to these interest rate changes The events in Germany in the past few days have been raising concerns about the stability of the political situation there And that can be a deterrent to investment in the mark, certainly under these circumstances, even though it's generally felt that over the longer pull--if there tends to be movement of more workers into West Germany--that this is very positive for the West German economy It tends to lead to still higher interest rates because it is going to lead to expansion and pressure on resources, which again may tend to--  It's interesting to me at least that, with the interest differentials having declined and in this medium to long-term range totally disappeared, the dollar is still as strong as it is    11/14/89  Short-term differentials vis-a-vis the mark have declined 363 basis points since April; and against the yen they have declined 400 basis points  As for the real impact, how much attention these investors pay to inflation-adjusted interest rates is a big question But it's by no means [clear] that if they think the exchange rate is going to be stable they don't pay too much attention to these differences in inflation rates If you take the inflation rates into account, Germany's inflation is probably almost a couple of percentage points below ours And in the real sense, the yield on their longer- term bonds is very high relative to ours It is a good question as to why they are--    11/14/89  They're now running around 3 percent, but they did have some one-time changes in taxes and all, which affected--  It's very possible over time, as investors begin to pay more attention to this, that they will tend to switch more But my little story was attempting to say that the interesting thing is the extent to which the investment still is moving into dollar assets in light of these circumstances  Yes  It depends on the Committee  We have been aiming at March in trying to prepare this work that we were going to submit to the Committee   [Statement--see Appendix]  I think the Treasury sees our limits as a reflection of the view of the FOMC toward the whole subject But if we are seeking to tell the Treasury that we don't want to intervene anymore, I think it has to be done in a direct way  As matters now stand, my own view is that there certainly doesn't seem to be any reason to need to sell dollars We are in the last two weeks of the year and the market tends more or less to close down at that point An awful lot of the banks stop making markets They all either have made their profits for the year and want to rest on them and pass out their bonuses or they have their losses that they can't do anything about The market tends to close down And for a number of years the dollar has tended to be a little weak toward the very last few weeks of the year When the markets reopen in January I have no reason to think that the attitude will be any different from what it has been, which would mean that there is certainly no need to intervene But, as we've seen many times before, these moods can change quickly Although the dollar has declined really quite significantly in terms of the mark and most of the other European currencies, in terms of the yen it has declined very little; it's still at about 144 yen and at the time of the G-7 meeting it was around 146 And despite rather substantial amounts of intervention and other changes, there has been an awful lot of demand for the dollar against the yen So, the short answer would be that I would see no occasion or need to be intervening during this period But it's very hard to be certain about it, and we do have this problem of the accumulation of interest, which is going to push us up against our limit So it seems to me, as a matter of prudence, that we do have to have some leeway to be able to operate   Well, I certainly agree with Ted I think what is happening in the market reflects the view that Gorbachev is in charge and things are likely to move ahead in a stable rather than an unstable way The market is reflecting the value of the mark in that sense Beyond that, the market is probably thinking that the Bundesbank and the Germans are not going to do something totally stupid in moving into this "markization," or whatever it is, of the other part of the German economy And I think they are further thinking that to the extent there may be genuine costs to the West Germans of making this move, which may mean higher interest rates and more borrowing by the Germans, that that may not be altogether bad from the point of view of the value of the D-mark--if the Bundesbank wins  Eleven papers so far   [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, there have been occasions when we didn't share for brief periods and in modest amounts For example, there was the time--not within the past 18 months or so, I guess--when the Federal Reserve had very few, if any, yen balances and we were intervening for Treasury And there have been some other occasions where for one reason or another there has been some modest activity by one or the other But basically, we have participated 50/50, roughly speaking, with the Treasury for a number of years It might have been [since] about 1980, at the time of the Carter bonds It has been pretty much that way with these minor deviations  Well, the Treasury is very interested in having us share; they regard that as very important We told them that we had reached a point where it would require a further expansion of our authorized limits in order for us to be able to intervene anymore As to taking that issue up at that point, particularly in the light of these doubts about the intervention with respect to the mark, we said we would wait and review the matter and look at the limits in the light of our discussion with the Committee since we already had set up this discussion and were planning to conduct a thorough review So, we told them that we would not operate [for System account] until we had an opportunity to have this more comprehensive discussion with the Committee  Yes    3/27/90  It's hard to say The rift went on for so long that by the time the 1 percentage point change was actually introduced it already had been totally discounted in the market and market rates didn't change So, rather than being seen as a sign of forcefully getting hold of the situation, it perhaps was taken by a lot of people as still a following of events--following the curve or trying to catch up and being dragged along belatedly when circumstances forced it So, it did not come out with a result that was strong and positive Whether these differences are going to be less in the future is a little--  Well, there's no question that our discussions with the Treasury at all levels are very much influential on their views both because they do want to have the Federal Reserve involved in there with them and also because we can bring to the discussions some [insights regarding] the point of view of the markets and the point of view of the issues that the Federal Reserve is interested in, which have an influence on them So, my assessment would be very similar to yours There are a lot of times, of course, when we start off agreeing anyhow But there are many, many occasions when we do influence their views I think this recent experience is a case in point But as in any arrangement of this sort, it's not going to happen every time Looking back over a longer period of time, I think we have been very influential and quite helpful in influencing them in the directions that we have  I think that's right We mentioned in [the Task Force report] that the Federal Reserve frequently seems to be somewhat of a balancing wheel; sometimes Administrations tend to go off a little in excess in one direction or another I think over the years that certainly has been the case  Well, certainly, the $20 billion we did last year is the largest we've done in one year But if you [compare it with] periods in the latter 1970s [relative to] the size of the foreign exchange markets at that time, for example, the $20 billion was not big If you look back at the size of the current account deficits in that period, there were periods of intervention when relative to those conditions the intervention figures were high, though they certainly did not approach the $20 billion total  Well, that's right I was trying to give a comparison of the [conditions] within which--  Yes  That's right  Neither one of us was involved [before 1962]  It's the Treasury's loss  Well, let me say one thing Obviously, we have had difficulties from time to time with the Treasury, which have been referred to, and we have been absolutely unable to reach agreement in a particular situation But in my view that has been an occasional thing and certainly not a continuous thing It would not be right for us to think that the Treasury is totally unreasonable in their approach to these matters In the circumstances that we were talking about here a few minutes ago, I don't think that they would have an interest in pouring billions into a yen operation when it was totally a Japanese domestic problem I don't think they have any reason to do it and I don't think they would argue it That's quite apart from all of the points that we would be making on it In fact, if you look back over these past several weeks, Japanese intervention as I mentioned earlier was about which is a very substantial amount for that period Our intervention was $1-1/2 billion, about half when we were involved and about half when the [Desk] had suspended [its participation for the Federal Reserve] But even with regard to the Treasury's own views it seems to me that they have become much more diffident in terms of the quickness with which they  -64-    3/27/90  want to jump in and participate in an intervention operation in the yen when they are beginning to wonder themselves about some of these questions that you've mentioned--and which are becoming more apparent as time goes by--that there is a big domestic element It's just a question about the political structure of the country and the problems that they're running into We've had in the past two or three weeks two meetings with the Japanese--one by the President with Mr Kaifu and one by Secretary Brady with Mr Hashimoto They didn't come back after those meetings and say "Let's go in and bash the market" Quite the contrary We did a modest amount after the Kaifu meetings, and I can understand the need to show some cooperation, given everything that had happened But it was certainly not a major push or anything After the Hashimoto meetings, we did none We did zero, absolute zero And so--  I don't think it was based on a feeling of our being in or out I don't think that he had an interest in doing it for some other reasons  Well, they know that we are having this meeting They know, obviously, that we suspended our participation as of March 2nd and they know that we are looking at these issues because of some of the concerns we have  Yes, they certainly don't think that there's any consideration being given to a drastic change in the--  And gold certificates  It's on our balance sheet as foreign currency  It's not a Treasury issue  Well, Mr Chairman, to go ahead with the unimportant parts of the resolution, I would recommend that the authorization for the System's [overall open position in foreign currency] balances be increased from the present level of $21 billion to $25 billion effective immediately, because we do have interest earnings that come in all the time on these balances  Similarly, Mr Chairman, I would request that the Committee express an agreement in principle to accept a further request from the Treasury for additional warehousing authority and to raise the present limit on that from $10 billion to $15 billion  -82-    3/27/90  Yes That's the upper limit, which would be raised from the present $10 billion, of which $9 billion has been drawn, to $15 billion  Four of them; you didn't read page 2   Yes, Mr Chairman I might just give a very brief comment on the mark Actually, the rates have been not much different from the ranges that they were trading in for a couple of weeks or so before the G-7 meeting If so, they are at about 158 yen or a little below and 167-1/2 mark The market did quickly come to the conclusion that the G-7 did not give the Japanese much, but it seems to think that maybe the Japanese did get a little something, having seen this intervention On two of the past three days there has been intervention and it has been a total of a little over $700 million for the whole period [Unintelligible] a fairly substantial number of central banks The market feels that this is mainly symbolic and has perceived that it is financed almost entirely by the Bank of Japan Actually, of the $730 million that has been done since the G-7 meeting, I think about has been financed by someone other than the Bank of Japan That included the amount we did which was a total of $50 million for our own account and for the Bank of Japan They had very thin markets during this period; it was a pre-holiday kind of period There is some nervousness in the market about the possibility of intervention Even though they think [they know] what happened, they still don't dismiss it entirely Also, the markets have been complicated a little by some continuing rumors and nervousness about the possibility of some US institutions being in trouble But generally speaking there hasn't been a lot of rate movement They have been noticing this They think they understand that it is largely a symbolic move And since we're in a kind of pre-holiday period, the jury is still out We may need to wait until sometime after the holidays next week before we get a better idea of whether the pressures are going to reemerge in a very substantial way There is some continued talk as to whether the    4/11/90  Japanese might raise their discount rate during the holiday weekend People remember that the last time it was raised was on Christmas Day and they wonder if something like that is in the wind So the market is generally a bit nervous and probably is going to wait a while until after the holiday period and then reassess and decide where it will go Thank you, Mr Chairman  Yes, I don't want to make too much of this, but during the course of yesterday and this morning there were rumors moving around in the market that some US bank is having problems, and one or two of the big banks were mentioned It did seem to tend to make the dollar somewhat lower at the time when the pressures had previously been moving up a little But I wouldn't exaggerate this This market is filled with rumors all the time Essentially the dollar, as the Chairman said, has been trading pretty much within a very narrow range, given the circumstances, and more or less irrespective of what has been happening in terms of these various pieces of intervention that have taken place, which may have affected it modestly There are various reports that people sift through after a G-7 meeting and they try to read the tea leaves and come to an interpretation about what it means for the future So, basically the market has been very stable But there were some rumors yesterday and this morning   [Statement--see Appendix]   [Statement--see Appendix]  I'm sorry, it was Honduras rather than Costa Rica in the ESF arrangement   [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, I think the Treasury is interested, as we are, in not having these [warehousing] amounts continue indefinitely and be too big So, when the conditions were such that it was possible to make some arrangements in order to bring those holdings down, they were not reluctant or hesitant to do this It's not envisaged as a continuous or perpetual facility  Our mark holdings?  We don't have any plans at the present time  Well, I don't think we had any intervention transactions in the last period  I'd have to look it up, but there hasn't been any exchange market intervention for some months  We'll check the date   [Unintelligible] Since the last FOMC meeting the dollar has slipped about 6 to 7 percent against [the yen] The market continues to focus on the weak fundamentals of the economy and the implications of that are lower US interest rates and easier monetary policy Of course, the United States already has the lowest short-term rates, I think, of anyone in the G-10; and the market is concentrating on the fact that, if anything, rates are likely to go lower here and they may be going in the other direction in some of the other countries During the Kuwait crisis the dollar hasn't seen as much of an upward movement from the kind of safe haven consideration that might have been expected from earlier situations In fact, [those in the trading] rooms around town tell us that since August 2 their older traders who have been through these situations before haven't done as well as the younger traders who haven't had that experience So, the safe haven consideration has not given as much upward momentum as the old hands would have expected But there is still some effect For example, last Friday, when it looked as if there was going to be real shooting with real bullets and on similar occasions when the situation has become that serious, the dollar has shown some upward movement So far, though, I think the effect has been mainly in helping to keep the dollar from sliding more And it does give people pause about going too short against the dollar There has been an awful lot of attention on the yen, given that Japanese interest rates have risen significantly since our last Committee meeting, and there are expectations of, if anything, possible further increases--in contrast to the situation here And as the dollar/yen rate has declined, we think there has been some increase in hedging by some of the Japanese investors through currency options and [unintelligible] So far we haven't heard of a major strategic decision for massive kinds of hedging or currency shifting But there is the danger that if the dollar continues to slip we could get a lot more of that at some point So, Mr Chairman, we sit here in a rather precarious position in which the dollar in trade weighted terms is at about the low point that we hit around the end of 1987 The decline thus far has not been disorderly or frightening, but it could move in that direction very suddenly That completes my report, Mr Chairman  We have not gotten any serious indications They have, of course, become more attentive to the situation as the dollar has continued to slip But there has not been evidence of that desire at this point   Yes, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, it's very hard to be sure It may be that over time as other currencies tend to be more widely used and as other markets tend to be further developed one might expect some lessening of the uniqueness of the dollar Also, we now have a situation in Europe where for the first time the political differences and uncertainties that existed before aren't there, which may have meant that on this occasion there was more willingness to use some of these other currencies because they don't see the same kinds of political East/West problems as before It could be for any number of reasons But it's certainly true that the traders we talk to tell us that the old timers who work for them were all taking positions that assumed there would be a lot more movement into the dollar than happened As I say, it could be having a significant effect in the kind of cautionary attitudes [unintelligible] We also detect that a lot of people are very hesitant to be very short of the dollar in these circumstances because they think if there is overt military hostility the likelihood is very high that the dollar would pop up So, quite often recently on Fridays we see evidence that there's a lot of settling of the books--that people don't like to go home for the weekend very short of dollars because they fear that if some really serious hostilities were to break out they could find themselves suffering very, very large costs  Well, that's true I certainly should have mentioned that factor There is hesitation about US institutions    10/2/90  What we also have heard a lot is that instead of movement from one currency to another currency there has been a surge of movement to liquidity in many places So this tends to be a greater shift to liquidity than to a currency  One can think of any number of possibilities Certainly, one concern is the fact that the Japanese industries are holding something on the order of $250 billion or so that would be largely unhedged And because of what may happen here that could cause them to get frightened and to start running for cover fast Or, as I was indicating in my comments, there are factors in Japan that could lead to a desire to shift a lot more funds [to yen] for their own reasons One could envisage all kinds of scenarios that could cause the dollar to start moving down very, very, rapidly, with a lot of investors all around trying to get out  It's a real danger  No, there is no need for any action  Certainly, you'd likely get a reaction if there were the larger move On the more moderate one, I think the markets are expecting it but there might still be a reaction, even though they are expecting it and have built it into their thinking, on the grounds that it would sort of confirm it Basically, I think the general attitude toward the dollar is negative and that kind of easing would tend to confirm that the Committee may be going in that direction So, you could get a reaction even on the smaller move  There certainly is that possibility And if it happens this quickly and spreads through all the other markets and has all these effects on interest rates and the stock market and everything else, then we have a real mess on our hands It's impossible to assess how big the possibility of that is But the market's view toward the dollar is generally negative So, there is some susceptibility--some fertile ground to see something starting as a movement down, which could then lead to a lot of efforts to get out and protect the dollar That is a serious possibility  Well, the dollar has been stable for the past few weeks, basically, except for the strange things going on with the yen  Well, as I say, if you cut away from all of these things, as far as we can tell the general sentiment toward the dollar is negative Markets are talking about moving further toward 150 on    10/2/90  the mark and toward 130+ on the yen So, that is the sort of framework we are dealing with After having heard the statements of the Chairman and various other things that have gone on, the markets certainly would not be surprised to see the middle option move tied in with action on the budget That is probably the general expectation of most people out there   [Statement--see Appendix]  We now have $4-1/2 billion warehoused  The limit is $10 billion  Well, there is an occasion to reexamine these limits, which comes up in February I'm sure we can look at it at that time  But we do, of course, have very close ties with the Mexicans for many, many reasons And we've had the swap line outstanding with them for decades At times it has been regarded as useful for the Federal Reserve to be in a position to provide some financing during a period when Mexico was working to try to get its situation under control We have participated with the Treasury and it has been very helpful to be in a position to be able to provide in effect a measure of confidence about what Mexico was trying to do, which we were very much supporting But never did we do anything that caused really great exposure for us    11/13/90  I would think that most market participants expect that there will be some change in the federal funds rate looking ahead over the next few days or so; at least there seems to be a general expectation of a very modest change and a [possibility] for another one The latter is a much smaller expectation but some people in the market are thinking about a further step maybe by the end of the year Even though they are expecting such a move to take place, that doesn't mean it would not have any impact in the exchange market; I think much will depend on how and when [a move is made] and the circumstances and so forth, and whether the market gets the idea-- looking further into the future--that we're on a particular path in a particular direction So, even though most people in the market expect that there will be a modest change in the federal funds rate, I don't think one can conclude that that wouldn't have any effect It might not have any immediate effect, but it certainly goes into their thinking about what they're looking for over a longer period My own feeling would be that a discount rate move would be regarded as a more significant step and one that I don't think they really are anticipating at this point  I got the impression from the Japanese that they took about 2/3rds as much this time as they had in some earlier periods  Based on forward rates and so forth we think that most people are expecting it As I was indicating earlier, that doesn't mean that it might not continue to have an effect--maybe not immediately, but it influences people's views about the next x weeks   Mr Chairman, for several weeks, up until the past couple of days, the dollar was finding pretty good support in the market, seemingly based on the continued Middle East tensions, the expressions of concern about a weak dollar from the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, talk of a G-7 meeting, some year-end activity, some of the uncertainties in Japan, some feeling that the dollar has fallen to a level where it is at a minimum very competitive, and also a view that the Fed's monetary moves have been quite measured Yesterday and today the dollar eased off about 3 yen and 3 [pfennigs], reflecting unwinding of some of the [unintelligible]--not entirely, but a considerable amount--and a more negative view of the economy following    12/7/90  the release of this morning's statistics and the implications of that for interest rates Today, the dollar has not eased all that much; it may be that the dollar's decline has been kept in check partly by a spate of rumors this morning that the United States was intervening in the foreign exchange markets to support the dollar or perhaps a reluctance to take on new positions on a Friday afternoon But we hear comments--including comments from our [unintelligible] committee, which happened to meet today--that a significant reassessment is now going on in the market and that many [market participants] feel that the downside potential for the dollar has increased That's my report, Mr Chairman  Mr Chairman, Sam Cross May I just make clear what I was saying about this whole question? As I said earlier, I think one of the factors that has given the dollar some strength over recent weeks has been a perception that the monetary moves have been measured and understandable in light of the way the markets have moved and in light of the way the economy has moved I think the [exchange] market is now going through a very searching kind of reassessment and they find themselves in new circumstances because of the Middle East situation and because of the worse-than-expected economic situation Anything that conveyed any sense of panic on the part of the Fed would have the possibility of a very serious impact on the exchange market Certainly, some of the people in that market are expecting a possible discount rate move at some point But I wouldn't say that this is a    12/7/90  move that could be made without any expectation of an impact on the exchange market  Well, not anything very formal or official or anything other than what the market is expecting The situation with respect to the Japanese seems to have changed recently Whereas earlier the general market view was that the Japanese would be tightening, that perception has turned around With respect to the Germans, there is still an expectation of a possible--or some are even saying a probable--tightening perhaps as soon as next week when they have their meeting on Thursday the 13th, which is just prior to some EC meetings Some people are saying that the Germans would want to move before then in order to position themselves for the EC So, there's still a very substantial expectation that the Bundesbank may tighten further soon   Mr Chairman, this is the warehousing agreement proposal?  Mr Truman circulated a memorandum on this matter to the Committee and I concurred in the memorandum The Committee will recall that at its meeting last March it agreed to a proposal to increase the warehousing maximum by $5 billion, from $10 billion to $15 billion This was made subject to a Treasury request In the event, the additional amount of $5 billion was not needed during the year and was not used; there was no Treasury request to use it Indeed, the Treasury has taken an initiative, with our aid and encouragement, to reduce the amount outstanding under the present warehousing agreement As you know, the amount outstanding has been reduced in the past months from $9 billion, which is where it stood when the Committee approved the increase, to $4-1/2 billion The Treasury in reversing these amounts and reducing the outstandings to $4-1/2 billion has always urged that a cushion of unused capacity be retained in case there is a requirement for it, even though [the need] has been going the other way We have made the point that we don't think the warehousing facility should be in continuous use and we have been helping and encouraging them in bringing the amount down from $9 billion to $4-1/2 billion Our view is that the correct approach at this point would be to drop the additional $5 billion that was added last year and to seek the renewal of the facility at the present time with the pre-existing maximum of $10 billion And I so recommend, Mr Chairman  Well, there have been warehousing arrangements with the Treasury going back to the early 1960s I would have to seek legal guidance on what would happen if at the time when there were outstandings the Committee did not authorize their continuance  I assume so, yes The next ones that fall due are in May and June Well, I don't know what the legal position would be If there were no warehouse facility, I don't know whether that would mean that the whole $4-1/2 billion would have to be ended at this moment or--  There are terms on them  It means that the FOMC endorses the continuance of this facility up to a maximum of $10 billion, yes  Well, as I say, the Treasury has taken the initiative and has acted to bring down the amount outstanding quite substantially in this past period They have always made the point very clearly that in doing so they urge and would expect that there would be a continuation of this [facility] so that if conditions should change--and they can change--it would be available to them quite promptly in order to continue further warehousing At this point conditions are such that it certainly does not look like that's the way it's going; it's going the other way We're in the process of reducing our foreign currency holdings  If we authorize the $10 billion, then typically we act on their request in providing the warehousing Now, obviously, this is not an adversarial relationship, as far as I'm concerned It's something that we talk to them about, work with them on, and deal with them on a daily basis It has always worked satisfactorily on that basis    2/5-6/91  Any action to change this does get reported If we leave it at $10 billion, that's outstanding until we choose to act otherwise or we look at it again next year  We've made clear to the Treasury many, many times that we don't visualize this as a facility that should be in continuous use It's there when conditions are such that it's required and it should be drawn down, or reversed, at times when conditions warrant That's the basis we've been working on and the basis on which it has been reduced to $4-1/2 billion in recent months  [Statement--See Appendix]  I think it happens automatically, but I defer--  Well, it's very hard to predict because one never knows when something is likely to set off concerns about confidence in the [exchange] rate of the dollar, which could lead to a precipitous fall and spread to other markets and all the problems that that entails, since we obviously still have a large deficit that we still have to finance and have to attract the funds to do it There has been downward pressure on the dollar and, as I say, it's at an all time low in terms of the mark As to the prospects over the more medium term, there are some facts that tend to provide more encouragement about it For example, the dollar at these very low levels is considered by many people to be quite competitive; and if this present period can be managed, then maybe that [sentiment] will begin to be reflected more in the exchange markets  It is an ongoing saga Every time we have a refunding the question arises Will it this time be a party to which no one comes--a Stella Dallas party? But thus far, [unintelligible] There continues to be foreign participation; it changes and at times has declined quite noticeably, but funds continue to come in Peter, do you want [to comment]?  Also, a lot of the activities in the foreign exchange markets reflects changes in hedge ratios That [means that if] Japanese investors and these categories of large investors decide that they think the dollar's prospects are not good, they will change the hedge ratio without necessarily getting rid of the securities or anything like that So, you can't detect this just by what is going on in the securities markets There's an awful lot of hedging and dehedging and that is a very important factor  They pay us in marks and yen and we feed them out in a manner that is like our normal customer business In other words, we just try to make clear that this is not an action by us [so as not] to appear to be influencing the rate  As far as we can tell, it has worked out quite well so far  We have used the BIS for some portion of these sales of foreign currencies, so that we're not seen in the market to appear to be selling Thus far, it seems to have worked out satisfactorily  That's close  Are you [using] DM or dollars?   [Statement--see Appendix]  No, I think it's more just an indication of the events of this period Certain parts of the Treasury had at times shown a keen interest in trying to get some G-7 interest in something approaching [that], but I wouldn't say target zones But there has been a considerable reluctance on the part of the other G-7 members to do this I think the intervention that we saw in this period was really not so much a concern about the specific level that the dollar had reached as it was the fact that the dollar had moved up very, very rapidly--by about 16 percent in a few weeks At times the markets were really quite disorderly Last Thursday there was a movement of six pfennigs in one day And the markets were very unsettled at times also in response to the proposals, specifically by the Germans, to participate in some coordinated intervention because of their concerns about the threats on the mark  Well, Mr Chairman, to move to another subject Questions have been raised about the level of US foreign exchange balances and whether it would be appropriate to take some moves to reduce those balances I would like a few minutes to discuss this matter with the Committee, if I might The US authorities combined --that is, the Federal Reserve and the ESF--now hold marks with a market value of about $30 billion and yen with a market value of about $18 billion  Let me mention some of the pros and cons of having these balances First, on the positive side, looking at it from the perspective of where I sit, there certainly are some distinct advantages of our owning for the first time ever substantial currency reserves Without having to belabor the obvious, not having to depend on the Bundesbank and other foreign central banks for all our financing at times of need gives us a great deal of independence as well as more of what I would call policy flexibility to deal with any exchange market flare-up, without necessarily having to change some of our policies at a time when that might not be wise or appropriate Also, I would say that's one reason we got through the heavy downward pressures on the dollar that we faced in February that I just described--and got through it really with relatively little pain and anxiety compared with previous problems of that sort A lot of that had to do with the fact that we have more credibility and more market confidence because we do hold substantial balances The market is aware that we hold them and that we are able to take action if we want to I think that did help to keep the dollar's decline from getting out of hand at a time when our currency was at all time lows Also, I should say that our currency balances, which are certainly far higher than ever before, if compared to international standards in other countries don't really show as a high currency reserve currently  On the negative side, our reserve holdings do entail exposure to the exchange rate risk At present the ESF and the Federal Reserve combined have a cumulative net profit--that's the difference between the present market value of our currency holdings and the acquisition value--on our currency balances of around $4 to $4-1/2 billion of which the Federal Reserve share of the profit amounts to about $32 billion Of course, we regularly mark-to-market on these balances, and these translation gains have already been reflected in our balance sheet This means that the Federal Reserve's share of the profits have been used when they were accumulated to increase the level of Federal Reserve profits that we hand over to the Treasury Accordingly, if the exchange rate moves up from this point, the level of those cumulative profits declines Only if the dollar goes down does this [backtrack] the other way And if the dollar goes up, that reduces the Federal Reserve profits going to the Treasury There's a concern that this exchange rate exposure and the possibility of these translation losses could lead to public and Congressional criticism There is no real loss in terms of the interest these days Our interest rates are presently below those of both Germany and Japan; [so that goes] the other way  If there were a need to cut back on our currency balances, it seems to me it's important that we have a clear and well understood    3/26/91  rationale for the action Of course, we could reduce them by more active intervention operations and that's perfectly understandable But if we simply adopted a conscious policy of getting rid of a substantial part of our reserves, it seems to me that that could be seen by the market and by foreign officials and by the general public as a move by the United States toward withdrawal of its role in international responsibilities and its role in helping to maintain the stability and smooth functioning of the [international financial] system One possible rationale for selling reserves other than through our intervention operations is to unwind some more of the warehousing Last year we did succeed in selling off a substantial amount of foreign currency balances as part of the unwinding of the warehousing arrangements with the Treasury We sold some both off- market and on-market and we explained it publicly after the fact That did not cause problems and was accepted as a reasonable and understandable action to reduce the warehousing; it is generally agreed that drawings under the warehousing are not to supposed to be permanently outstanding  Another possibility would be to adopt an approach of selling the earnings on our reserve holdings from time to time as we have the opportunity and putting those out into the market or elsewhere as conditions permit Other nations sometimes follow approaches not too different from that For example, the Germans accumulate their troop dollars in this manner and then feed them off; they may keep them for a considerable period and then feed them off into the market even when it seems desirable to do so or when conditions are favorable for absorbing them without market disruption Similarly, we might look for opportunities to make sales to other central banks whose reserve needs might be complementary to our own So, an approach of some sales along these lines for reducing the warehousing or for disposing of some of the earnings would provide some considerable scope for flexibility in disposing of some of the balances However, at the moment, I should say that the prospects for such sales are not very encouraging With the dollar strengthening very sharply, neither the Germans nor the Japanese would like to see us putting more mark or yen balances into the market under present conditions Also, the Bundesbank has just paid a substantial amount of its dollar reserves to us for its Desert Shield contribution and that, as well as the intervention, reduced their dollar reserves And the Bank of Japan has just paid us a little under $6 billion in dollars as we converted the yen that they have contributed for the Desert Shield operation In light of these circumstances, I would suspect that neither of those central banks is likely to be interested in either further off-market exchanges right away or market [sales] But over time we could think of ways to utilize some of these currencies along these lines and ways to provide us some more flexibility if that is the Committee's wish Thank you  The Treasury's present warehousing is $4-1/2 billion I think they would not be happy to reduce it totally, but we    3/26/91  did reduce it by a considerable amount last year, and I think some further reduction would certainly be possible  Well, it's very difficult to be at all precise in this  Even in interest it's hard to say how much--  Well, I really do think it's difficult to set a specific target level It seems to me that the reserves that we have accumulated as a consequence of what we've done and not done-- One of the problems is that it's very difficult to say we don't need $48 billion, we need $42 billion or $55 billion It's very hard to justify that kind of decision, it seems to me  $50 billion  Well, as I say it's very difficult to know the kind of reserve needs we may have because we don't know what circumstances we're going to face The fact that we have them in a sense makes it less necessary to use them So, to impress the market and to impress the rest of the world, it seems to me we need a substantial level--along the lines of what we have Our reserves are not high relative to, say, those of Germany or Japan or even Taiwan, which of course has the highest in the world By most international standards we do not have a level of reserves that shows us to be excessively endowed by these kinds of comparisons You can argue how much the United States should have, given its position, whether that's more or less But it seems to me that the United States should be up with the big players, as it were, and that we should have amounts that don't look quite small relative to what other major countries have  That's right  You also need the cooperation in order to borrow, and that's what we obtained the last time But it takes time and so forth and so on Obviously, the ability to borrow in the open market is one potential source  Well, we intervened in the amount of $14 billion during the February period; that's the only intervention  Well, I don't have the precise--  Well,--  $15 billion Do you mean the amount of the warehousing?  Probably $53 billion; I don't have the precise number, but I would say around $53 billion  Well, I don't see that $53 billion particularly as a ceiling or anything else I don't see any need for us to continue to accumulate [foreign currency] reserves, if that's your question  Well, you've asked a rhetorical question But it seems to me the question is whether you agree with the approach on the intervention, not the question of what is the level of reserves  -12-    3/26/91  If we always intervened when the dollar rose and never intervened when the dollar fell, our reserves would accumulate  You're not getting any assumption from me What I was talking about was the possibility, if the Committee has the desire, of looking for occasions to feed out some of these currencies as we did last year We could look for opportunities to put them out in ways that don't have an exchange rate effect--just sell off a few and announce that the only [reason] that we are [selling] is to help bring down the warehousing or that we have an approach of disposing of some of the earnings from time to time That was the concept I was--  Well, I do think that's more a question of the approach to intervention than of reserve determination  Are you asking in the legal sense or the policy sense?  Legally, it is set by the Committee We have a limit of $25 billion in exposure, which is the maximum that we can--  No, the Treasury's holdings are part of the ESF and subject to the determination of the Secretary of the Treasury  Well, we and the Treasury have a different amount of [foreign currency] reserves at the present time We have a higher level of reserves partly because of the warehousing But even excluding the warehousing we have--do you have the number, Charlie?  We have about $26 billion and they have about $22 billion So, there are some differences But, as you know, the policy has been for a long time to try to pursue these things together and to work jointly And almost all of our intervention has been financed that way Certainly, the Treasury is very happy with that arrangement and would be very concerned if there were a proposal to go off on a different track  On the intervention the Treasury has a stronger hand  The Committee has the legal authority to set the maximum holdings that we have  Well, it would be inconceivable that we would do any such action without working with the Treasury But also we would not just be selling off other countries' currencies without working it out with them When we did the $2 billion last year we did work it out with the German authorities so that it could be done in a way that didn't cause problems for them and their markets But we're now in a different market situation  I'm not sure I understand We could obviously-- and we have done so--enter into exchanges with the Germans and others to give them back a portion of their currency and receive back a portion of our currency The kind of facility you're talking about, if I understand it, sounds like what the swap was originally intended to do  It sounds like a forward exchange transaction I'll be happy to try to think and see if there--  Right  We'll try to think that one through  Well, I think the Treasury is sympathetic to some reduction but they are not talking about getting rid of the whole warehousing amount or anything like that This hasn't gone through all their [decisionmaking] processes but the discussions that have taken place so far indicate some willingness, certainly, to consider some decline in the warehousing; but they're not talking about the whole amount  Well, I'm not sure I understand We could--  Yes, by the Treasury  It was a Treasury participation in a European BIS swap It was outstanding for about a week   Yes, I'm on the call  Yes We have had some discussion with the Germans about mechanisms and we have been looking at ways in which we might find some opportunity to get rid of [these deutschemark holdings] as conditions permit us to do so There are a number of technical and other questions to work out quite apart from the question of the willingness of the Germans and possibly others to do it And we also are trying to talk to the Treasury to make sure that this is something that they are interested in too So, we're working on it but I can't say that we have answers to it at this point  Well, that is certainly one of the things that could greatly affect this We have been thinking of various possibilities, both on-market and off-market, and we've been canvassing other central banks We are trying to make sure we have canvassed everyone and are trying to proceed to see if we can work something out on this side But, certainly, that's true If exchange rates move the other way, we can be a little more quick to try to dispose of some [of our foreign currency holdings]   Well, Mr Chairman, the dollar has been firming pretty steadily over the past couple of weeks against the mark, the yen, and the general range of currencies That firming seems to be a reflection of the changing prospects for our economy and the feeling that the end of the recession may not be so far ahead The implications of that are that we are not likely to be seeking further reductions in interest rates and that output and profits are more likely to be a little higher But at the same time nothing has happened elsewhere, for example in Germany, to improve the political or economic prospects there So, though the dollar has been somewhat stronger, it's still generally trading within the same ranges that it has been for some weeks Against the mark, for example, the dollar had traded in a range of 158 to 178 since mid-April, before the G-7 meeting We're now operating at very near the top of that range; it's just under 177  Though the dollar has strengthened, particularly in the past two or three days, both Germany and Japan have been concerned about the other side of that coin--the decided weakening in their own currencies Both Germany and Japan did intervene in the market today; in the case of Germany, their intervention was followed by most of the other European countries at least in modest amounts Both showed an interest in having us join them in the intervention--not in any expectations of reversing the dollar's movement or pushing it down-- but more to give a signal of some resistance to blunt the dollar's drive The case for joining any such operations would have been to do a modest operation in a cooperative move And we've seen not too long ago, of course, how important the cooperation of others was to us in some of these matters The current [mood] in the Treasury was not sympathetic to any operations, and in the end we did not do any operations So, that is where we stand at this point, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman As you say, this matter of reducing the foreign exposure resulting from these currency balances is one that the Committee members have been expressing some interest about for some time We have been working with the Treasury and the Bundesbank to try to come to a satisfactory solution The plan that we've worked out with them is to exchange over a period of time a total of 10 billion deutschemarks that the Treasury and Federal Reserve are holding for equal value of the Bundesbank's dollar holdings We would make these exchanges at market rates but in off- market transactions The first exchange, which will be for 4 billion deutschemarks against an equal value of dollars, is scheduled to be made tomorrow for settlement on Thursday The overall understanding that we worked out also calls for six subsequent exchanges of 1 billion DM each on a particular agreed date, one in each month over the second half of this year These six exchanges are to be    6/24/91  transacted at forward rates for those particular dates as those rates are calculated tomorrow We will calculate them on the basis of tomorrow's [exchange] rate and the interest [differentials] Now, this arrangement was agreed to in principle with the Bundesbank and the Treasury last Friday It essentially will mean that we will be exceeding the daily and intermeeting limits The transaction was cleared with the Chairman and the Foreign Currency Subcommittee in accordance with the Committee's Procedural Instructions We also have agreed with the Treasury that 60 percent of the mark balances to be exchanged will come from the Federal Reserve balances and 40 percent from the Treasury's ESF It should be noted in this connection that the Federal Reserve balances are currently substantially larger than Treasury's So, the particular allocation will tend to make them somewhat more equal But I should also emphasize that the entire arrangement must be kept completely confidential at the present time The Bundesbank is profoundly concerned about possible adverse market perceptions from any kind of premature disclosure or from discussion or misunderstandings in the market about the purposes and implications of this exchange So, at the present time it's very important that there not be any comment about this arrangement That completes my comments, Mr Chairman  I believe it comes out Friday, Mr Chairman  Yes, we give a report in September, which probably will cover the entire transaction, even though some of the transfers will not have been made  Well, on the first, the only implications for profits or loss are that we hold a smaller amount of marks than we held otherwise and, therefore, we are less subject to either gains or losses resulting from changes in the mark/dollar exchange rate in one direction or another  And we realize a profit For the Treasury, there's a loss on some of the [deutschemark] transactions that we are undertaking On the Federal Reserve side we will realize some gain because we will in effect be selling these marks at rates that are more favorable than the rates at which we bought them  You may be right; my numbers are slightly different, but they may not be up-to-date  In that case they will make a profit as well  On the second [question], in any conversations that I have had with them we were reassured that there is not any quid pro quo in terms of a policy move--that this particular transaction is a cooperative move by both of us and it does result in improving [unintelligible] There was not, as far as I was concerned, any quid pro quo in that  Our losses earlier this year have already been reflected   [Statement--see Appendix]  We hold $209 billion against a limit of $25 billion  The market has not become aware of exactly what has taken place The market did notice, as I mentioned in my comments, that the Bundesbank was selling Treasury securities, which they needed to do in order to position themselves for this And the market has seen the Treasury's balance sheet, released yesterday, which shows the change in certain of the accounts But unless something has happened in the course of the day, they are still a little uncertain as to exactly what that means There are some who are interpreting these moves as positioning for large-scale intervention either by the Federal Reserve or the Treasury or in the sale of the Treasury securities by the Bundesbank So, they've seen some of the data and I think they will get a clearer view of this when the Bundesbank announces its balance sheet figures, which are supposed to come out Thursday but may come out on Friday  It may be Wednesday or Friday They're now talking close of business Wednesday So, there will be a statement, which will not mention the United States, but will talk about an exchange of these reserve assets for dollars I imagine people will be able to put two and two together at that point  Well, I think when they see everything that has happened, they will begin to understand just what it was Up until now they've been wondering whether it was a gathering war chest for [intervention]  We've given the Treasury a statement    7/2-3/91  So, by Friday when the Federal Reserve balance sheets come out, they will have all the information  That comes out--  It shows both  Well, we do, of course, look at these limits every year We can certainly examine it to see whether the present limits are appropriate The fact that it has come down from $24 to $21 billion is certainly a decline, but we do have to leave room in these limits because we are earning interest regularly on our holdings and we always have to consider what kind of [leeway] we need in order to allow for the interest accruals as well as for the possibility of being able to operate in the market when it's appropriate to do so   [Statement--see Appendix]   [Statement--see Appendix]  Mr Chairman, I also might take a moment to mention that we circulated a memorandum to the Committee on questions related to the investment of our German marks As the memorandum points out, almost all of our marks are in a three-month double-forward facility with the Bundesbank This causes a problem for the Bundesbank in terms of some mismatch between that facility and the two-month repo position that the Bundesbank uses these funds for They are concerned and have been seeking to get some change in that facility, and we're looking into the possibility of some modification We need to work this out, of course, with the Bundesbank and the Treasury and there are many technical questions that we have to look into  The memorandum also suggests that we might look at some possible change in our approach more broadly I mentioned the possibility of a three-point approach for dealing with these DM and yen balances The first element would be that we would work out an arrangement whereby either regularly or from time to time as seems appropriate we would put the earnings we receive on these various reserve holdings back into the market or sell them in other ways The second element would be that we would continue to look for further opportunities for off-market exchanges such as those that we carried out and are still in the process of carrying out with both the Bank of Japan and the Bundesbank and thereby reduce some of our reserve holdings in that manner if it seemed appropriate Then, thirdly, I suggested that we might also consider some modest diversification of our facilities so that they might be less heavily focused on these very short-term, three-month facilities which are available on a two- day notice--less heavily focused in this Bundesbank facility and other similar facilities We might think about putting a somewhat greater portion, for example, in the BIS or in some other arrangement of that sort We'd try to work out this matter with the Bundesbank; it is causing them concern because it does put them in a position whereby they have to explain to their GAO and auditors why they have a facility with us that can cause them to make losses out of profits    10/1/91  And as part of this general examination we could also consider some diversification so that we might move a small portion of the balances into somewhat longer German government paper beyond the 12-month limit that we've been held to up to this point There's very little of this very short-term paper available in Germany, and for reasons of diversification it might be appropriate to consider a somewhat more flexible approach Thank you, Mr Chairman  Well, we're about halfway through the process that we worked out with the Bundesbank to cover the months from July through December After that, I do not think the Bundesbank would be unwilling to consider some further possible exchanges next year I mentioned as a part of the approach that we would continue to look for such opportunities I assume there is a possibility that both we and the Bundesbank might find it in our mutual interest and therefore advisable
