14,1987-08-18," [Statement--see Appendix]   It has been mentioned that oil prices have clearly softened This morning's price is almost half a dollar below what it was yesterday and it's almost a dollar below where it was a week or so ago This has been cited as another factor Most of the people that our traders have been talking to seem to think that today's decline in the dollar is perhaps related to that, in part, but after the initial impact of the decline, it seems to be more a reflection of rather sour trade figures Yesterday in New York, in the latter part of the afternoon, the dollar began to soften without anything very dramatic happening; it was just gradually declining And we are told that the Japanese are saying that when their markets opened, they began to think that maybe they should cut some of their positions, so there was some selling both in Japan and in Europe subsequently, which brought us down to current levels It's possible that oil prices are now a factor but more talk seems to be given to this general attitude resulting from the continuing serious problem with the trade deficit and the larger number announced on Friday   Really, we don't have enough evidence, other than what people are telling us When the Middle East tensions flared up here a couple of weeks ago, it was hard for us to see why that, in itself, should have caused the dollar to go up so rapidly We saw some increase in [the price of] gold, but it came back down We did not see evidence that it was lots of [unintelligible] flows It could be that there is a kind of writing down of the dollar in light of the somewhat less troublesome situation in the Middle East But we don't see much evidence of a lot of movement from this back and forth which would lead to that conclusion; it's possible that people's attitudes are influenced by it and, therefore, they are changing their views about what is the proper level for the dollar, to some extent It is pretty much a matter of guessing   Well, the dollar fell in terms of both the DM and the yen It's now trading at about 185-1/4 DM and 147-1/4 yen So it has declined about 3-1/2 percent, I guess, from the levels prevailing toward the end of last week before the trade figures were announced and whatever has happened that relates to them It's a substantial move   I don't have the sterling quote today But sterling has been under its own pressure because of the [unintelligible]   Well, sterling sometimes acts like a petro- currency and sometimes it doesn't You can't rely on it reflecting what happens in the Middle East Well, sterling is up to 160-165   But it should not move that way if you followed the hypothesis   In Japan, the short-term rates haven't changed; the long-term rates have gone up sharply It seems to be a little element of both of the factors that you talked about Certainly, the market forces led to a substantial increase in their longer-term rates and they have been quite concerned about the vulnerability of their financial situation given the stock market rise, the increase in real estate prices, and so forth They also have allowed changes in some of these rates, like the long-term prime; they tell us they are resisting this, but at the end of the day it is clear that the long- term rates have gone up substantially In Germany, I think there has been a little snugging, but again, it is hard to say how much, because there have been some other things going on "
15,1987-08-18," It's, on balance, unchanged; it has been up and down "
67,1987-09-22," [Statement--see Appendix]   Right now we have the feeling that corporations are not doing very much It varies a great deal, of course, but typically the total turnover in the market is many, many multiples of what the final users get It may be 10 times as much But right at the moment we don't get a sense of a lot of corporate activity taking place It may be that they are holding off, for the kind of reasons that I mentioned It may be that they are waiting to see if anything emerges out of these dealings around the time of the IMF meeting Or, from what I hear this morning, there is some expectation being talked about that the G-7 might do one thing or another that would give some greater strength to the dollar They may be holding off for these kinds of reasons   At times they do this They can be very big players in this game, too, and they can do a lot of churning themselves   This always seems to be a pretty important time for an assessment We have the sense that they come back after Labor Day and reassess their position; and they may be doing that right now Frequently, in recent years, we have seen trends begin shortly after the summer holidays and after Labor Day As I said, it may be that they are holding off to see if anything emerges from these meetings next week   That's total conjecture There was a rumor last week of exactly that--that the target range had moved down And then there was a rumor two days later that it had moved up The dollar went down a little when the first rumor occurred and moved back up a little when the second rumor occurred But these are all purely imaginative "
126,1987-11-03," [Statement--see Appendix]   I would read it the other way that it gets more precarious as we get into these new and heretofore unseen levels The possibility of people getting really frightened and responding in some way--   We don't get the impression that there is an opportunity to flip it and get a big run on the other side The corporations have been noticeable nonparticipants for some time, generally speaking; everybody tended to sit on their hands during all of this chaos that was occurring in the market So, the short answer is, I'm sure there are a lot of people shorting the dollar but we are not, so far as we can tell, in a technical position where we could flip that and get a runup   Yes   On the question of [unintelligible], the Federal Reserve does have the legal authority to intervene and the Treasury has the legal authority to intervene But there are a number of statements and letters and so forth to the Congress which indicate that from the point of view of the Federal Reserve, we will operate in cooperation and coordination with the Treasury on these matters, given the Secretary of the Treasury's role in international financial policy And it is important that we not act in direct violation of Treasury's stated views; or if we did, it would be such a major event that we would feel it necessary to tell the Congress So, basically, we have operated for many, many years on the basis of trying to work these matters out with the Treasury   I'm not disputing that   I have another comment, Mr Chairman We have been operating through this period more or less simply to resist the downward pressures and not in an aggressive way, as you can tell from the numbers We have done $500 million since last Monday; the Japanese have done about almost and the Germans have done almost And there have been very, very heavy purchases of dollars by the British, partly for reasons other than the dollar situation, but it adds up to total dollar purchases in the past    11/3/87  week or so of, I would say, over $5 billion So, we have done a relatively modest amount "
183,1987-12-15," They were hitting the target, but nothing else was happening right   Probably   [Statement--see Appendix]   We have far more marks than we have yen for the Federal Reserve and the Treasury combined We have about $116 billion worth of marks, but only about $16 billion worth of yen   We would have to get some more yen from someplace; $16 billion is not all that big The fact is, for example, that we did $16 billion in all currencies in the past six weeks  SPEAKER(?) Sam, if the official intervention dries up--I don't mean totally dries up, but if it shrinks--what dynamics does that set in motion? The market still has to clear Does it clear at a lower level by sucking in more private sources or--   I assume it tries to suck in some financing from some source But that raises the question of on what terms and whether the dollar would have to become more attractive both through stability and through interest rates to attract any funds, official or private We still have a pretty big deficit; we're predicting a $135 billion deficit for next year in the current account So, if you look ex ante and ask people how much they plan to increase their exposure to dollars next year, I doubt that it would come anywhere close to that number Ex post, undoubtedly, somehow or other our current account deficit will get financed It's a question of how   Well, I'm sure everybody has his own experience on all of this There are these factors obviously, people who have markets don't give them up very easily; also, a country like Japan has a big import component in a lot of its exports and, therefore, the exchange rate can affect both sides of the equation I agree with you that when a currency falls by 50 percent--and we're just about at 50 percent of the level of the mark and the yen--that can't be absorbed through lower profit margins The people we talked to on the export side seemed to be sounding a lot better Now, another problem is that some of the deficit is shifting, or is covered by countries such as Taiwan Taiwan has a surplus of $25 billion all by itself, and it's a tiny economy relative to that size surplus So some of this deficit is coming from countries that have not had anything like that kind of change in the exchange rate vis-a-vis the dollar   In what terms? Market pressures are down, and every time you pick up a newspaper, you have more economists talking about the need for x, y, z, including some who say it needs another 10 percent; while it was 12 and 15 percent they had been saying the same thing I think the market people are pretty agnostic about this sort of thing They look at these trade deficits, which are enormous; and they look at the government policies, which are ambiguous in this regard They see the pressures and the consequences are pretty clear   Well, the Treasury has been working on it I think the Treasury so far has used all of the above they've locked them in a room and they've tried everything There has been some movement  -40-    12/15-16/87   This will make it 20 percent in the past year   Zero But, if you look at it in terms of the surplus, Taiwan stands alone as having the largest imbalance And, in fact as everybody knows, they have a large reserve The three largest reserves are Germany, Japan, and Taiwan; and I think Taiwan's is higher--   No, not in that order Taiwan, I think, is number two   That is true, it did not go up as much as they claim; it didn't [unintelligible] Again, we are generalizing, but in terms of the Taiwanese dollar it did not appreciate as much when it was going up But the surpluses have grown really unbelievably large Meanwhile, there are these reports out there now that their dollar holdings have gotten to be so large that the governor of their central bank has been under enormous political pressure to get rid of these depreciating dollars and get some D-marks and so forth; and he seems to be doing that So, that's not a very encouraging sign at all   Twenty-two percent is the figure I have in mind, but it's--   Well, the Treasury is working on it   No, so far [this year]--11 months That doesn't include Taiwan which is another and a lot of other countries It includes only those that are on our concentration network, which is the G-10 plus some assorted European countries   What I was saying was that it's not going to be as easy, looking forward, as it has been in the past Everybody has substantially higher dollar balances; countries are under pressure; there are public commentaries For example, in London in the Financial Times, there's an article by Sam Britton asking why the British are holding all of these weak and depreciating dollars, and saying they should be moving into marks [unintelligible] in this story There undoubtedly are going to be pressures on a lot of countries to be a lot more reluctant than they have been to add to their dollar holdings   Well, it is one of the elements I don't know how widespread it is We hear reports of a few countries here and there   If they hadn't bought $100 billion worth of dollars then I would ask the question How would we have financed the deficit last year? There's a big hole there somewhere   If we had adjusted and eliminated the deficit, that would be a different story   It seems to have different kinds of effects There is the fact that Germany and other countries are more dependent on oil than we are, for example There is also the fact that oil is very heavily a dollar-financed phenomenon So there have been times when changes in the oil price seemed to affect the dollar one way and times when it affected it another way I would assume that the reluctance that we are seeing now might be, on balance, helpful   Well, sterling has been a little softer in the past few days One possibility is that it has been reflecting what has gone on in the oil market but there are some other things going on, too The British seem to have had this policy of trying to maintain the pound at 3 DM and they have held that pretty firmly and have undertaken an enormous amount of intervention [unintelligible] Some people think that maybe the message that they are going to hold it is beginning to be accepted and that part of the decline in sterling reflects that   Quite apart from what they did recently,  There was heavy upward pressure on the pound during much of that time And, there are questions about whether the British will, and should, reduce their interest rates    12/15-16/87 "
247,1988-02-09," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, they're talking about $13-1/2 billion They probably have very little basis for knowing, just like everybody else; but the fact remains that they tend to get these numbers in their minds, and if it comes out better or worse than their expectations, it has an effect That's the latest commentary, although it has varied from yesterday when we were hearing numbers anywhere from $11 billion to $14 billion or more Then Mr Yeutter made some comments yesterday, which seemed to have taken a little of the bloom off the rose, that it's on the low side And so, today, they seem to be talking about levels of around $13-1/2 billion   Yes Accordingly, we haven't been hearing as many high numbers as I would like to hear "
307,1988-03-29," [Statement--see Appendix]   There has been a great deal of concern that, particularly during March, the yen has been held down artificially and the dollar has been held up artificially because of concerns about the Japanese institutions who must complete their bookkeeping at the end of March Much of this has to do with the Japanese insurance companies who, according to the rules that they follow, have to adjust the value of their total holdings of foreign and dollar securities if the dollar falls by 15 percent, on average, during March from the level of a year ago This would mean a very substantial recalculation of the books of these insurance companies And there is a widespread view that that possibility, plus traditional Japanese window-dressing operations, which are very important, have caused the Japanese to take steps to avoid the pressure to cause the yen to rise--to hold the dollar up against the yen, in effect, until after this March 31st date So the question now is whether, after the end of March, there will be some tendency and intention, on behalf of the Japanese particularly, to shift out of dollars or to cease the operations which the market thinks are holding the dollar up, or to take other steps   It would have to go down pretty low at this point We recalculate this every day; we just don't have the latest update Yesterday it was something like 121 or 122 But one argument made in the market about some of the pressure recently is that this is less of a concern now that we've gotten close enough to the end of the fiscal year There is less of a reason for the yen to be held down   They have not been intervening in very heavy amounts, but they have been taking related steps There was a statement by the head of the Japanese insurance groups last night, saying that he didn't expect a lot of sell-off of dollar securities after the end of the fiscal year I assume that the Bank of Japan put him up to that There have been other steps that they have taken to contain some of these pressures   Yes, I think that--   That's right, but--   No, but the year-end is particularly important And this happens even when we don't face the kind of exchange market situations that we face now The Japanese are very conscious of these year-end figures, and toward the end of the fiscal year there are a lot of pressures back and forth, reflecting that concern So this is not a new phenomenon   Well, they've been telling us that they need some slight pressures--again, because of those fiscal year-end kinds of problems But we have not gotten from them evidence that they are tightening beyond that "
385,1988-06-29," Well, it's been an interesting period, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   We have had consultations with the other central banks and we've talked with them quite frequently every day But we don't always have the same view of what's happening in the market or what should be done in response I mentioned in my report that the Germans specifically had been quite concerned about the decline in the exchange rate for the mark, which they feel has inflationary implications for them, particularly with what they see as excessive liquidity in their economy They think it is neither good for them, nor for the monetary system more broadly, for the mark to be declining as it has been declining under the circumstances The dollar/mark rate has changed from its low point in January by about 26 pfennigs, which is more than 15 percent And as a surplus country, they feel as though they should not be in a situation with the mark declining; they're a bit concerned about that  Our own activity has been aimed not at trying to drive the dollar down; no one wants to do that But equally, it seems to me, we do not have an interest in seeing the dollar move up to unsustainable levels and then see it fall again Our view is that a substantial amount of what is going on now is indeed a covering of shorts We hear a lot of talk about what's happening in the options market We hear a lot of talk about hedging operations by investors here and    6/29-30/88  elsewhere And we think that a lot of this is a covering of short positions which were built up over the past several months at the time when the market view was that the authorities would not let the dollar rise And therefore, [market participants] could pretty well have a one-way bet on which way to hedge Once this gets cleared out, we still have a huge deficit, and we still have all these other factors that have to be dealt with I don't think anybody thinks we're out of the woods at this point So our efforts in the intervention activities and the other activities we've undertaken have been partly to give ourselves some more currencies Those currencies could become very useful in future months when we could very well be needing them in order to help support the dollar [The intervention sales also were undertaken] to show some resistance to the rise in the dollar, so as not to let it get to levels which are simply going to be unsustainable--because service problems could well disrupt the market again That's how I would [unintelligible] We have operated, as I say, only in deutschemarks, not in yen where the movements have been much less   Well, there have been changes in monetary policy which were intended to support some moves that have taken place But certainly we hear a great deal to suggest that a large part of this is indeed short covering in one form or another--be it dehedging by investors All of last year Japanese investors bought a lot of US dollar-denominated assets, but they hedged a lot of dollar-denominated assets And some of those hedges have been eliminated  Also, we've been hearing for a long time that corporations have been holding off entering the market As the rate has moved up, there has been the need to buy some dollars in order to meet their needs and their requirements But certainly it's our view that a very large amount of this is of the nature, in one form or another, of covering options and other hedging The holders of those short dollar positions became worried at times when they saw that the dollar was moving up And when they detected that, they did decide to short [unintelligible] immediately to keep the dollar from rising   Well, because it has become costly   The dollar was under upward pressure, and also there was a view that the dollar could go up farther and that the authorities would not hold it I think it was, in part, a change in their perception about what the authorities' attitudes were going to be   If the dollar hadn't risen, then there wouldn't have been any need to short [unintelligible]   Sure    6/29-30/88   No, as I said at the beginning, there has been a firm undertone to the dollar because of some improvement in the trade figures embedded in the changes and a changing view of Federal Reserve policy There already was a firm undertone, but this view about what the authorities would do popped up last week   If you look at the change in short-term interest rate differentials, the differentials have gotten much narrower vis-a- vis the mark since the last meeting   That's right   I wasn't trying to suggest that nothing has happened in the dollar   We have a limit I think we're way below that   $12 billion   Set by this Committee, right It's an informal understanding set by this Committee, so it is formal [in that sense] But we are well below those numbers and we're not likely to--   Only just that they--the classes of [unintelligible] But they've got to have--   That's right, to offset the foreign currency counterpart But there are ways of doing it   There are innumerable ways to work out arrangements whereby both the Treasury's and the Federal Reserve's foreign currency balances could be increased   We have daily currency limits, intermeeting period limits, and all of those   We haven't reached any of those during this period   What I was saying was that, obviously, there have been a lot of changes that have occurred in the period, including what has happened to our trade [balance] and all the rest   I would indeed But all I was saying was that even with that improvement, we still have very, very large trade and    6/29-30/88  current account deficits that have got to be financed It has changed; there's no question about that It has shown some improvement   I don't know--I'm not sure how to answer your question Obviously, interest rates are a factor in determining the strength of the dollar And changes in differentials--certainly I wouldn't say they are not significant as well I think they are--   We've been trying to operate so as not to give an impression that we are capping the dollar, and we have been urging the Europeans to operate in a way which would not give an impression that we were putting caps on the dollar at a particular level We have been offering some resistance, but we've been trying to do it in a moderate way There's an old Scottish golfer's prayer, you know, ""May God give me the strength to hit easy"" It's an effort to try to resist, not to absolutely assure that we're trying to cap the exchange rate That's certainly not what we're trying to do   Yes But it's certainly true that during the period when the dollar has been stable, as Ted said, the investors have become very conscious of interest rate differentials and the attractiveness not only of the US dollar, but the Canadian dollar,    6/29-30/88  the Australian currency, and various other currencies where the nominal interest rates are quite attractive   Well, I think the Germans in particular are much more troubled about what they see as the problem of a depreciating mark They're very conscious of that And they think the inflationary implications of excessive liquidity at home, which they think [unintelligible] plus a depreciating currency are very bad They think it is bad from the point of view of international adjustment to have a big surplus country like Germany having a depreciation in its currency They're very conscious of that and they view the problem from that perspective We view it from a different perspective Inevitably, we're going to have those differences of view   Well, I don't think we're under any great illusions about the extent to which intervention can or cannot make fundamental changes Certainly, our effort has been to try to deal with instability rather than to add to it "
386,1988-06-29," Well, it depends on against what [the depreciation is measured]  [Secretary's note Several people spoke at once and their comments were unintelligible] "
445,1988-08-16," [Statement--see Appendix]   The average in terms of what?   The United States or worldwide?   We don't really know   We know what we do and they know what they do   On the part of the United States-- Sorry to give you numbers, but worldwide it's probably equal to at least $300 or $400 billion a day   Well, that we don't really know    8/16/88   When we are intervening we are trying to bring about a certain influence And certainly, the market is constantly and intensely out there watching to see what signs we--and by that I mean the central banks collectively--are giving They are very much concerned about whether there is evidence that the central banks are going to [intervene] The central banks can hurt them when they choose to come into the market And they certainly pay great attention to that in all cases And they can, on occasion, keep some of these movements from moving in one direction or another and kind of getting--   Most of our intervention has been done in a way which was designed to be noticed, because that was part of the purpose And I have been impressed with the extent to which the people who watch these things closely have a pretty good fix on the amounts being done, and they know the purposes   That's right   It gets in the balance sheets and we will announce it I give a quarterly report in September, and in that we will indicate that we have purchased these currencies We will not be specific about the source--the counterpart--but we will indicate publicly that we have picked up these currencies "
495,1988-09-20, [Statement--see Appendix] 
551,1988-11-01," [Statement--see Appendix]   I don't think the expectation in the market is that the economy is very weak I think that they had been expecting and thinking that it was growing a lot more robustly and that that was going to lead to higher interest rates and was yielding some upward pressure on the dollar That was the prevailing attitude in which the various statistical releases [came out] all suggesting that the growth is not so robust And so they are reassessing that   Different things prevail in these markets at different times, but that seems to be a very important factor   That's right, as much of this is based on what they had been expecting   Well, as you know, we've been trying to introduce some stability, and I think it's understandable in a period when the dollar is falling about 10 percent that we could be on both sides of [the market with] that sort of exchange rate movements It's not surprising in a number of European countries [to see intervention on] opposite sides of the exchange markets within a matter of [unintelligible] We attempt this, it seems to me, not to try to say with a great degree of precision what is the right exchange rate but to say that we are trying to introduce a greater measure of stability    11/1/88  I think if you look back over the period since the Louvre Accord, there has been somewhat more stability in these exchange rates And it is of some value, some importance, when you think of the problems that arise if, for example, the dollar should start to fall very rapidly against the yen and trigger responses by all of the present holders of the dollars to try to protect themselves We have to walk this narrow line between trying to encourage a certain degree of stability and to keep the financing for this deficit occurring until we can move further toward other financing It seems to me that's the basic policy   Well, not really I think I said earlier that as we moved up toward the election there has been a feeling on the part of a lot of people in the market that the authorities would be particularly careful not to let exchange rates change very wildly, and they succeeded in doing that   All I'm suggesting is that that is what is in the market   I'm a reporter   It certainly has been a factor in the foreign exchange market for some time  -14-    11/1/88   You know, a stronger economy or a weaker economy can lead to all kinds of other things which sometimes lead to strengthening and sometimes to weakness   Well, as the dollar has tended to slide against the yen, we've been hearing more reports of hedging As they get less confident they tend to hedge more; that's the form it takes, but it has the same exchange rate effect   We get reports on this And certainly during some periods this year when the exchange rates appeared to be relatively safe and stable, there was a tendency to shift into the high interest rate currencies by Japanese investors--into the Australian, Canadian, sterling currencies--   It's very hard to be very precise You hear what one person says; then you hear three other people But certainly there is this prevailing concern that as we look forward a few months there are those big problems, and we are going to have a new Adminis- tration That in itself brings a little uncertainty to the situation Are they going to be able to and will they take actions to deal with these problems? So as you look ahead a few months this is very much on their minds   I assume that they are acting on the basis of that concern But it's hard to have any precise numbers "
615,1988-12-13," [Statement--see Appendix]   I didn't say that I thought it was too weak   The mark has weakened some during the course of this year on a weighted-average basis At the same time, the German current account balance has been strengthening, their trade balance has been strengthening Now with us, our trade balance has been improving, Mr Chairman There is a European entry factor or element to this, and the Germans have been increasing their trade balance with a number of their European partners, both in the EMS and outside the EMS So, their concern has been that the mark not appear to be too weak during the period when they see the trade balance strengthening   Well, we have heard numbers anywhere from $8-1/2 to $12-1/2 billion Now, it gets a little confusing because there are two bases for calculating it these days, and we are not always sure people are talking in the same terms The general view seems to be that the trade deficit will be around $10 billion this time But there are some--   That's CIF, yes   Yes, CIF and seasonally adjusted    12/13-14/88   Well, I wouldn't jump to any big conclusions because we've had other occasions when the number came in very well and the dollar moved down I believe the market has seen that it's possible to get hurt by shorting the dollar too much And I think the trade figures are certainly hanging over the market in an important way So I think a lot of participants are not anxious to do too much until then It could be that a good trade figure would provide a little more support, but it's not a sure thing   That was not our intention and indeed when I got asked, at the press conference when we released this quarterly report, whether we were just trying to smooth the dollar, I said we weren't We are trying to do more than that   Well, for one thing, unless you're really going to intervene in very, very large amounts it's not always crystal clear just what the reaction is going to be to an expenditure of 'X' amount of dollars But also we have to work this out very closely with our colleagues in the Treasury who may or may not feel that it is a good idea to intervene very strongly at a particular time And, also, not in the precise amounts always, but we do try to coordinate our efforts with the other central banks so that we all give the same kind of message There were occasions in this period when a number of people in the market thought that our efforts were not big enough really to smack the exchange rate in a decisive way I do think that over a period of several weeks as we continued to do this that the cumulative effect of this became more noticeable and more important "
679,1989-02-07, [Statement--see Appendix] 
745,1989-03-28," Yes, Mr Chairman, I would I would like to raise one point with respect to the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations We are currently authorized to maintain [foreign currency] balances up to a total of $12 billion equivalent Our present holdings, at about $94 billion, are well within that limit But in addition to this formal authorization there are three informal limits which are not contained either in the Authorization, the Directive, or the Procedural Instructions These [informal understandings] call for us to limit our holdings of German marks to $8 billion equivalent, Japanese yen to $3 billion equivalent, and other currencies as a group to $1 billion equivalent All of our intervention in recent months has been in marks and we are now about $150 million or a little more above that informal limit for marks We notified the Committee of that situation by a telex that was sent out on March 15th But, Mr Chairman, I would like to propose that the Committee consider eliminating these informal sublimits for the particular currencies so that the $12 billion authorization for foreign currency balances could be used more flexibly I question whether the informal sublimits currently are a very useful management tool The particular currencies that we operate in are determined, of course, by market conditions and other factors And in any event, we    3/28/89  would continue to be under a number of limitations--qualitative as well as quantitative limitations--both with the [Foreign Currency] Subcommittee and the Committee These limits relate to the changes in each currency for a single day and for the intermeeting period as well as changes in the overall balances for a single day in the intermeeting period and so forth I believe these various limits provide for adequate monitoring and control by the Committee and the Subcommittee without the informal sublimits Accordingly, I would recommend that the Committee consider eliminating the three informal sublimits If the Committee did wish to retain those sublimits I would need to request a change in the overall Authorization in order to provide more headroom in the event we need to acquire more marks and yen So, I recommend the elimination of the three informal sublimits   Obviously, we will want over time to acquire various amounts in particular currencies But I don't think that this particular arrangement is the way in which we are best able to do that For example, our holdings of yen have been low and we've been undertaking such measures as we could to raise those holdings both for the System and the Treasury Indeed, we did acquire some yen during this recent period by buying them from a customer But I don't think that the informal sublimit is a very useful mechanism for doing this We have to make decisions and acquire those currencies more or less as conditions permit and as our policies aim us to do I don't think these limits help very much operationally   Well, if I went too far in saying what was the optimum that might raise a lot of questions But we certainly report regularly on the amounts of the individual currencies    3/28/89   Well, at the present time we have $94 billion and the limit is $12 billion Looking ahead, say, for the next year it's certainly conceivable that we would need to go above that I would assume that the Committee would not find it difficult to change the limit at the time, if the conditions arose Or, it could be changed right now when we are reviewing this at our annual review   [Yes] That is a formal authorization and that is public The present authorization is for $12 billion and has been at that level for a couple of years, I guess   Well, we have a $2-1/2 billion [leeway] And, of course, when we intervene we have typically done half of it and the Treasury has done half So that means a potential [increase in U S holdings] of $5 billion worth before we run into a problem I would assume that if conditions were such that we needed a change in the Authorization, it would not be difficult to propose that and to change it at the time   No I'd be happy to have any further headroom the Committee wishes to offer But I can't really make a strong case that it's likely to happen and would require a meeting   Above $600 million requires the Subcommittee's approval and above $1-1/2 billion requires the Committee's approval   That's in all currencies   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, the Ministry of Finance in Japan thus far often has intervened itself to resist the decline in the yen And the US Treasury has not been prepared up to this point to [intervene unless] we have the agreement of the Japanese before anything is done And the Japanese have not felt that this situation yet warranted intervention Now, in the past day or two the pressures on the yen have become more substantial The Finance Minister did make a statement last night--at which point the yen had weakened to above the 133 level--saying something to the effect that they were watching [developments] very carefully at the 133 level, which was taken by the market as a signal that that might be a key point The rate then moved down a bit below 133 and that's where it is now I imagine there will be discussions of this--certainly this weekend when the G-7 gets together But up to this point the Minister of Finance has not wanted to see intervention or to be involved in intervention to resist the decline   I don't think there has been any very notable change The G-7, of course, met in February and they are going to meet again The general premises within which these activities have been taking place remain more or less the same   Well, I would hope that it wouldn't come to a point where we were operating at cross purposes with the Japanese It would be very difficult if we reached the stage where it was as overt as that These intervention operations obviously work much, much better if all parties are marching together We have seen many times, both with the Germans and the Japanese, that the market pays a lot more attention when they see that we are uniformly aiming in a certain direction, trying to bring about a certain purpose It's difficult to be operating in one direction if the central bank or the government on the other side doesn't agree or indeed is opposed to it So, it's much better to work it out   But even those [transactions] have not been easily arranged   With the Canadians or the others it required working it out with the Japanese But they are a little more amenable to that than if it's going to impact directly on their exchange rate   That's becoming increasingly apparent It is true that up until recently most of the pressures were not in the yen but were in the European currencies But it is moving more and more in that direction and it is becoming clear that we are getting to the point where there is a need to do something about the movement in the yen as well That is part of my own concern And as I say, the    3/28/89  pressures of the past few days have been led by the movements of the yen That's the first time during this recent period of activity where that has been the case; but it is now the case On the other hand, if you look back to the low points--which were at the beginning of last year--the 1988 low point for the mark was 156 and we're now at 188 and the low point for the yen was just over 120 So, it's getting closer but not quite as much   Well, I think there are various factors They are divided There are some in Germany who will say that they could be tightening domestically and not necessarily going through the exchange rate They are divided The mark has moved up against some currencies as well as having softened against the dollar If you look at the mark on a trade-weighted basis you don't get the same picture that you do if you look just at the dollar-mark relationship The Germans, I think, have a genuine problem with respect to the EMS Their concern at the moment is that the EMS is fully stretched--in other words, they are at the top of the band and, as it turns out, Denmark is now at the bottom of the band At those levels they have to intervene fully in order to keep the rates from moving beyond that There were very, very large amounts of intervention in the Danish currency last week, in fact They did on one day, which is a lot for a small country And they did almost the next day The Germans are concerned that--the mark being weak against the dollar and strong against the EMS--if they intervene on the dollar side it's just going to cause a lot more trouble and lead to serious pressures in flows and political problems and all the rest with the EMS   The Danish are down there but the pressures could move to the others, particularly if the question of whether to reform the EMS currency alignments and so forth arose It could lead to pressures The French not too long ago had been under some pressure; they are not at the moment But--   Since Italy is not really in the arrangement, they don't have the same obligation to intervene So they don't have the same problem on the intervention side   We talk to the Germans and we make these points, too But I think you do have to recognize that there are pressures from the EMS angle of it   Well, they have a stagnant economy and they don't want to raise their interest rates So they are having a lot of capital outflows   They are still concerned or have a fear that the dollar-yen relationship is going to move back in the other direction and that it's going to cause problems there At least that's what they say Now, I assume that there is an interest from the point of view of their whole economy and their exports and so forth for them to try not to get back into intervention if they can avoid it But it gets harder and harder to make that case as the rates move We are still at 133 And the last time we were intervening I think it was close to 137 So the yen is not within any new ranges in that sense   In terms of the dollar outlook? I think they are waiting and I think they are moving--   --with a short-term focus to see what's going to happen on this As I said, at the present time these markets are very fickle They watch one thing for a while and then they watch something else But right now they are watching very closely the inflation and monetary policy actions in all these countries because there has been so much attention on and concern about whether inflation is growing worldwide So, that's the main focus of    3/28/89  attention right now what's going to be done about it and what the various players are going to do "
810,1989-05-16," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, it's not easy to give a generalized statement that covers all the situations The Germans have intervened more or less throughout the period, although not in very large amounts In part, the Germans tend to have a different attitude, tactically, about what is the best way to intervene and [believe] that the intervention is more effective if done in certain ways As for the Japanese, views differ because the institutions are divided over there The Bank of Japan has been much more interested in intervening to stop the decline of the yen than the Ministry of Finance And the Ministry of Finance calls the tune In the past several days the Japanese have begun to take a much more active role in the intervention and they have done against the dollar/yen in each of the past two days   No, we focus our intervention on what has been happening in the market and where the pressures have developed This is the first time we've intervened in yen in a long time But it is because the conditions were such that it seemed to us appropriate to intervene in yen Before then the yen had not fallen so much As I said earlier, the yen had risen substantially more than the other currencies If you look back at the direction in which it has moved, the yen has not been as weak as the other currencies--and still isn't in a sense, if you compare it with where it started off at the time of the Louvre agreement However, the yen did begin to slip more and we were concerned, looking at it from the other direction, about the rise in the dollar The Japanese have been concerned about it too So, we have been intervening as the yen began to slip more in the past three weeks   Yes We talk to them every day, repeatedly We talk about the activities that we're proposing and we work it out with them   Well, the dollar has been on this very strong upward [course] As I said earlier, certainly there's no evidence that we have turned the situation around As the dollar gets higher-- and it has gotten above the levels that have been seen before--there is some greater apprehension and nervousness within the market, partly about what the response of the central banks is going to be and whether the market is going to face a movement in the other direction But so far the pressures have continued to be on the upward side   Well, sometimes the Germans have a view that the way to get the market's attention is to and kick it in the teeth very strongly We get a little nervous about too much of that I don't want to overstate it because we usually are able to work these differences out and reach an agreement   Well, I think that's true To some extent the capital gains already have been a factor In my report I was talking about some of the factors that have been tending to put upward pressure on the dollar Recently, as statistical reports have come out that suggest that the economy may be a little less robust, you do hear people drawing the conclusion that that makes the long bond an opportunity for some capital gains But you're right presumably, if they feel that way they have been acting on that, and that may be a factor that is already discounted to some extent   Obviously, we talk about whatever factors are affecting the directions of the currencies Certainly, the Germans have been concerned at times about the fact that their money has been growing more rapidly than their targets That is certainly a factor affecting their situation   I think they're trying to; I think there are efforts to try to get their own situation under better--   Since the last meeting the short-term interest rate differential between the dollar and the mark has narrowed by 125 basis points and against the yen by 113 basis points There has been--   No, I don't think it has gone the other way Well, I'm not talking about ours, I'm talking about theirs I think theirs has so much--   Well, if I assume that this manifests itself to a large degree in the interest rates, the interest rate movements have certainly been in that direction 1-3/4 points is not an insignificant reduction in the margins for a 6-week period   Yes   I recommend, with respect to the recent activity, that the Committee approve our operations since the last meeting which are just under $14 billion equivalent worth of sales of dollars I would also like to raise with the Committee a point with respect to our foreign currency authorization limit, if I can present that at this time That limit, which is a public figure, provides that the System can hold foreign currency balances up to a total of $12 billion equivalent At present we have nearly $11 billion equivalent As I mentioned earlier, since the Plaza agreement in September of 1985 when we embarked on this practice of a more active intervention role we have bought about $14 billion and we have sold about $14 billion But the value of our foreign currency balances during that same period has doubled from about $5-1/2 billion to about $11 billion The reasons they have doubled are really three-fold One, we have made a profit in that we have sold the dollar when it was relatively high and we have bought the dollar when it was relatively low About 40 percent of that increase in the value of our foreign currency holdings represents those profits A second factor is that we have, along with the Treasury, bought yen--not through intervention operations but through some direct transactions between ourselves and the Japanese Ministry of Finance and other bodies That, too, has added about 40 percent to the increase in the value of these foreign currency balances The third factor is that we have our balances invested and    5/16/89  we continue to earn interest on them; and the remaining roughly 20 percent represents the earnings on our balances So, we now are getting up much closer to the authorized limit of $12 billion I would like to propose that the Committee raise the authorized limit from $12 billion to $15 billion in order to provide more headroom so that if circumstances are such that the value of our foreign currency balances increases we will have room to accommodate that within the authorized limit So my recommendation, Mr Chairman, is that the Committee raise the limit in the Foreign Currency Authorization from $12 billion to $15 billion   No, they are much more heavily in marks   We don't have very many yen at the present time   Yes sir   Well, I doubt that this is a very controversial or newsworthy issue; I don't know It is a matter we report and I don't believe it has gained much attention in the past I proposed a $3 billion increase on the grounds that that would provide some reasonable comfort and that if circumstances arose where something further were needed then we would have to reconsider the question If the Committee proposes a higher figure, that's fine with me   It only becomes effective on the one side of intervention when we're selling dollars, if we're selling any   Yes But I must say that there is some value in having some marbles to play with if we're going to be in this game And I think the level of reserves that we have, compared to almost anything, is really very modest But I think the $3 billion I    5/16/89  proposed would be adequate; if [the Committee preferred] $5 billion, I would be quite happy to see that   That includes it That's all we have in yen We used up our yen balances and have not acquired very much So, we only have that amount; and a large part of that came from outside purchases, not from intervention "
873,1989-07-05," [Statement--see Appendix]   We review it every year It was reviewed in March of this year and reestablished without change, as has been done for many years--ever since I've been here   Yes   No   The devaluation of gold in 1933   The logic in a sense is not too different from what the Treasury and the Central Bank have Even when the gold flowed into the country then you were allowed to issue those certificates and receive dollars for them We no longer have the gold flows; we have foreign exchange flows And this, in a sense, is a similar allowance for the Treasury to monetize these assets and gain the dollars for them   It isn't the Fund What this does is to shift the assets in the Fund; it doesn't change the size of the Fund It allows them to transfer one asset to another asset   Yes The dollar has been declining now for several weeks and we're about 8 or 9 percent down from the highs We still have more than $2 billion availability under the open limit   Pardon me?   We value it on the basis at which we have actually made a transaction; so we don't change it when the exchange rates change That is the only way we can do it because, if we didn't handle it that way, we could inadvertently run out of leeway with nothing happening   Well, during this period we did most of it in what we call a discreet manner That is to say, we operated through a bank acting as an agent so that--although the word does get around in some way and people who are following these markets closely can often tell a lot of what's going on--we did not go in openly buying foreign currencies For the most part we had particular banks operating on our behalf in order not to show the extent to which the central banks were in there We had gotten to a point where operating visibly was not really working very effectively and we thought it would be better to operate this way Indeed, it has been much more successful Remember, the other central banks have done the same thing, following our doing it The Germans most recently, and the Japanese too, have been operating in a discreet manner   I think it was a lot more effective because we had reached a point where the market tended to feel that these rates were out of control--well, not out of control but beyond the ranges that the authorities wanted And when they saw the central bank coming in there they almost took that as a basis [for believing] that the dollar was by definition undervalued And they tended to hit it quickly Now, in operating more discreetly we have been able to kind    7/5-6/89  of encourage the dollar down without appearing to try to take on the market in a direct way Under certain conditions one technique is more appropriate and under other circumstances another way is We have felt during this period, given the market conditions that we faced, that this was the better way to operate And I think that has proved to be the case   Let me say a couple of things First, even when we're operating openly we may go to, say, 5 banks out of 100--whatever the number is So it's not as though we operate in the way the domestic Desk does and broadcast [our operations]; we never do that We operate with a certain--we go out to do the transaction Secondly, when we've operated discreetly we have done that with a bank on the understanding that they not reveal this information or talk to other parts of their institution and so forth Now, obviously the word--   Well, in a sense, a bank can do that any time we are in the market and are trading with a bank As I say, if we are operating quite openly we might go out and talk to 5 banks or 10 banks They might choose to join us, and this helps move the market in the direction [we want] if they're convinced that it's going that way We do move around from one institution to another; we don't use the same one, obviously Sometimes we might use several at once, but we do it in a way that they are not supposed to go tell all their customers and others that they are operating on behalf of the Fed   Anybody who is operating to suit our interest against their own interest is going to end up in the hardware business or something pretty soon I don't think any of them do that   We do buy at the best price   We were trying to influence the market; that doesn't mean we were trying to fool the market But I don't know that it would follow that we always have to tell everybody in the market every time we operate That seems to me to be a different matter   Well, we increased it by $10 billion; we had $20 billion and we now have $30 billion   Well, no I certainly don't recall any such time We have always had [some] and, indeed, even though $30 billion is higher than what we've had in the past I suspect the time may come when we will be pleased to have some currencies But--   Let's see   It's $90 billion if you use market price   It's not clear   Right   It might not make any difference; it would depend on what the Treasury's attitude was and what they were able to do about it in part And that creates all kinds of--   Well, or to make some other changes "
874,1989-07-05," It's 18815 in marks and 13830 in yen   That's certainly part of the explanation   They've been looking at purchasing managers' [reports] I think there has been a cessation of the things that were driving the dollar up--all these political factors, these portfolio things, that have happened They have tended to focus on other subjects They have seen some evidence that the economy appears to be easing, or is at least slowing down a little; and building on these expectations about what's happening to interest rates is certainly part of it, I think "
935,1989-08-22," [Statement--see Appendix]   No, if you're speaking of--   Well, of course, the exchange market is influenced by a vast number of factors in addition to interest rates But I would not differ from the statements in the Bluebook and all that has been presented, which suggest that higher interest rates would tend to add to the pressure on the dollar But there are many, many other factors involved It depends, of course, on all of the things going on in other countries During the last several months, we've seen some fairly substantial changes in the interest rate differentials between the United States and some of the other major countries And that has not taken away the structure--   That was certainly a factor during this period, and the pressures on the dollar did change at about the time when    8/22/89  there seemed to be a change in the market's perception of US monetary policy But I think what I said was that there are many, many other factors involved that are also going to affect the pressures I don't think it is simply a matter of the interest rates   All I'm saying is that over the past several months we have seen the narrowing of the interest differentials--it has been a couple hundred basis points--and there has continued to be pressure on the dollar despite that   Well, at the present time, the market is [unintelligible] and continues to be reasonably bullish on the dollar; [investors] see the dollar as a good place to be They compare the dollar with some of the [alternatives] and, as I say, there's relative stability here politically and economically as compared with Japan and elsewhere Throughout most of this year there has been a tendency for [investors] looking very long term to see the dollar as a good place to be And there has been some reassessment and shifting of portfolios with a tendency to have a greater share in dollar investments and less concern about hedging against it So, in that sense I think the market has been pretty bullish on the dollar and continues to be   Well, that's not quite what I was saying Given everything that's going on--and not just interest rates--I think there is a firmness and a strong support for the dollar   Legal "
936,1989-08-22," Certainly that number, when it was reported, was noted in the exchange market And at least during that day it was certainly a supporting factor They did pay some attention to that "
999,1989-10-03," I'm not even going to report today!   [Statement--see Appendix]   We are at just under $1-1/2 billion below the ceiling Whether it is going to prove necessary to request a further change in that depends very much on how things develop over the months ahead But we do have $1-1/2 billion which, if we share 50/50 with the Treasury, means that there could be a substantial amount of intervention--$3 billion worth--before we would come up against the ceiling   Well, the words in the Communique were exactly what you said and exactly what I read in my statement--that a further rise or an excessive decline could adversely affect the prospects I would say, though, that there is a very, very major difference between going in and hammering the dollar down in falling markets and resisting it when it is rising We didn't always resist it immediately when it showed any increase; we resisted when it was rising and let the market take it down some Obviously, the market knew that the G-7 was trying to guide the dollar down some But the point I was making was that we did recognize and try to take account of, as much as we could, the risks that could follow if we really did go in and hammer the dollar down while it was falling, which we didn't really do   So far as I'm aware, there is none   I am not aware of any target ranges that are in existence While there were some months and months ago, I don't think those have any relevance at the present time   Well, we were talking every day--   Our objective was to curb the dollar's rise and to have it decline some We did not want it to fall an enormous--   We discuss every day what to do for the following day It had fallen a little from time to time; it did not fall in massive amounts on any day We discussed with the others, based on the closing level in New York, say, on Tuesday, what might be a sensible target   There is an understanding that the rise that had occurred was not helpful And there is an effort to bring about greater stability and to reduce the dollar somewhat But no one knows that you need to move the dollar down to XYZ point in order to assure    10/3/89  that it meets with these longer-term [fundamentals] So the intention, as far as I'm concerned, was to try to take away some of this upward momentum and to let it ease off somewhat But, as I say, it hasn't fallen all that much and we haven't driven it down that much We're now at levels we saw in August--that's less than two months ago--and that we saw earlier in May I'm sure that if the dollar were to show a further significant rise this approach would change   We would have stopped   No   We entered in for almost all of that after the dollar had moved up from that 139    10/3/89   We knew of some points that were particularly sensitive in the market as the dollar got up close to 140 [yen] and we went in again in order to try to keep it from going through the 140 level We didn't do enough to keep it from going through   [They warehouse] foreign currencies with us, so they--   Ted's salary for the next 4,000 years--   Approve the transactions that I have already done   No, it's the matter of the money   That's a different issue in my opinion   My understanding is did I act within the authority authorized and provided for by the Committee even though I  -17-    10/3/89  recognized that certain people didn't agree or did not favor the way that was-- "
1059,1989-11-14," [Statement--see Appendix]   No   Well, I was talking about for our account We did operate for the Bank of England in our market   With their funds, as an agent We do that quite often for any number of central banks   No, this was a Bank of England operation; all we did was to undertake it in New York   We haven't intervened in sterling for our own account for as long as I've been in the job   That was disbursed and reported at the previous meeting   In fact, there has been a modest repayment since then So that's [not] all fully outstanding   Well, they are not only narrow; the Desk was telling me this morning that German interest rates throughout the range beyond six months are now higher than ours And this is the first time, I suppose, in a decade--maybe [more]  SPEAKER(?) Maybe back in the '70s   I don't know how long, but certainly it has been many years   Well, I think people can come to different conclusions on this But certainly the reasons for investing in the dollar or in the mark are affected by a large number of things in addition to these interest rate changes The events in Germany in the past few days have been raising concerns about the stability of the political situation there And that can be a deterrent to investment in the mark, certainly under these circumstances, even though it's generally felt that over the longer pull--if there tends to be movement of more workers into West Germany--that this is very positive for the West German economy It tends to lead to still higher interest rates because it is going to lead to expansion and pressure on resources, which again may tend to--   It's interesting to me at least that, with the interest differentials having declined and in this medium to long-term range totally disappeared, the dollar is still as strong as it is    11/14/89   Short-term differentials vis-a-vis the mark have declined 363 basis points since April; and against the yen they have declined 400 basis points   As for the real impact, how much attention these investors pay to inflation-adjusted interest rates is a big question But it's by no means [clear] that if they think the exchange rate is going to be stable they don't pay too much attention to these differences in inflation rates If you take the inflation rates into account, Germany's inflation is probably almost a couple of percentage points below ours And in the real sense, the yield on their longer- term bonds is very high relative to ours It is a good question as to why they are--    11/14/89   They're now running around 3 percent, but they did have some one-time changes in taxes and all, which affected--   It's very possible over time, as investors begin to pay more attention to this, that they will tend to switch more But my little story was attempting to say that the interesting thing is the extent to which the investment still is moving into dollar assets in light of these circumstances   Yes   It depends on the Committee   We have been aiming at March in trying to prepare this work that we were going to submit to the Committee "
1117,1989-12-18," [Statement--see Appendix]   I think the Treasury sees our limits as a reflection of the view of the FOMC toward the whole subject But if we are seeking to tell the Treasury that we don't want to intervene anymore, I think it has to be done in a direct way   As matters now stand, my own view is that there certainly doesn't seem to be any reason to need to sell dollars We are in the last two weeks of the year and the market tends more or less to close down at that point An awful lot of the banks stop making markets They all either have made their profits for the year and want to rest on them and pass out their bonuses or they have their losses that they can't do anything about The market tends to close down And for a number of years the dollar has tended to be a little weak toward the very last few weeks of the year When the markets reopen in January I have no reason to think that the attitude will be any different from what it has been, which would mean that there is certainly no need to intervene But, as we've seen many times before, these moods can change quickly Although the dollar has declined really quite significantly in terms of the mark and most of the other European currencies, in terms of the yen it has declined very little; it's still at about 144 yen and at the time of the G-7 meeting it was around 146 And despite rather substantial amounts of intervention and other changes, there has been an awful lot of demand for the dollar against the yen So, the short answer would be that I would see no occasion or need to be intervening during this period But it's very hard to be certain about it, and we do have this problem of the accumulation of interest, which is going to push us up against our limit So it seems to me, as a matter of prudence, that we do have to have some leeway to be able to operate "
1186,1990-02-06, Eleven papers so far 
1187,1990-02-06," Well, I certainly agree with Ted I think what is happening in the market reflects the view that Gorbachev is in charge and things are likely to move ahead in a stable rather than an unstable way The market is reflecting the value of the mark in that sense Beyond that, the market is probably thinking that the Bundesbank and the Germans are not going to do something totally stupid in moving into this ""markization,"" or whatever it is, of the other part of the German economy And I think they are further thinking that to the extent there may be genuine costs to the West Germans of making this move, which may mean higher interest rates and more borrowing by the Germans, that that may not be altogether bad from the point of view of the value of the D-mark--if the Bundesbank wins "
1254,1990-03-27," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, there have been occasions when we didn't share for brief periods and in modest amounts For example, there was the time--not within the past 18 months or so, I guess--when the Federal Reserve had very few, if any, yen balances and we were intervening for Treasury And there have been some other occasions where for one reason or another there has been some modest activity by one or the other But basically, we have participated 50/50, roughly speaking, with the Treasury for a number of years It might have been [since] about 1980, at the time of the Carter bonds It has been pretty much that way with these minor deviations   Well, the Treasury is very interested in having us share; they regard that as very important We told them that we had reached a point where it would require a further expansion of our authorized limits in order for us to be able to intervene anymore As to taking that issue up at that point, particularly in the light of these doubts about the intervention with respect to the mark, we said we would wait and review the matter and look at the limits in the light of our discussion with the Committee since we already had set up this discussion and were planning to conduct a thorough review So, we told them that we would not operate [for System account] until we had an opportunity to have this more comprehensive discussion with the Committee   Yes    3/27/90   It's hard to say The rift went on for so long that by the time the 1 percentage point change was actually introduced it already had been totally discounted in the market and market rates didn't change So, rather than being seen as a sign of forcefully getting hold of the situation, it perhaps was taken by a lot of people as still a following of events--following the curve or trying to catch up and being dragged along belatedly when circumstances forced it So, it did not come out with a result that was strong and positive Whether these differences are going to be less in the future is a little--   Well, there's no question that our discussions with the Treasury at all levels are very much influential on their views both because they do want to have the Federal Reserve involved in there with them and also because we can bring to the discussions some [insights regarding] the point of view of the markets and the point of view of the issues that the Federal Reserve is interested in, which have an influence on them So, my assessment would be very similar to yours There are a lot of times, of course, when we start off agreeing anyhow But there are many, many occasions when we do influence their views I think this recent experience is a case in point But as in any arrangement of this sort, it's not going to happen every time Looking back over a longer period of time, I think we have been very influential and quite helpful in influencing them in the directions that we have   I think that's right We mentioned in [the Task Force report] that the Federal Reserve frequently seems to be somewhat of a balancing wheel; sometimes Administrations tend to go off a little in excess in one direction or another I think over the years that certainly has been the case   Well, certainly, the $20 billion we did last year is the largest we've done in one year But if you [compare it with] periods in the latter 1970s [relative to] the size of the foreign exchange markets at that time, for example, the $20 billion was not big If you look back at the size of the current account deficits in that period, there were periods of intervention when relative to those conditions the intervention figures were high, though they certainly did not approach the $20 billion total   Well, that's right I was trying to give a comparison of the [conditions] within which--   Yes   That's right   Neither one of us was involved [before 1962]   It's the Treasury's loss   Well, let me say one thing Obviously, we have had difficulties from time to time with the Treasury, which have been referred to, and we have been absolutely unable to reach agreement in a particular situation But in my view that has been an occasional thing and certainly not a continuous thing It would not be right for us to think that the Treasury is totally unreasonable in their approach to these matters In the circumstances that we were talking about here a few minutes ago, I don't think that they would have an interest in pouring billions into a yen operation when it was totally a Japanese domestic problem I don't think they have any reason to do it and I don't think they would argue it That's quite apart from all of the points that we would be making on it In fact, if you look back over these past several weeks, Japanese intervention as I mentioned earlier was about which is a very substantial amount for that period Our intervention was $1-1/2 billion, about half when we were involved and about half when the [Desk] had suspended [its participation for the Federal Reserve] But even with regard to the Treasury's own views it seems to me that they have become much more diffident in terms of the quickness with which they  -64-    3/27/90  want to jump in and participate in an intervention operation in the yen when they are beginning to wonder themselves about some of these questions that you've mentioned--and which are becoming more apparent as time goes by--that there is a big domestic element It's just a question about the political structure of the country and the problems that they're running into We've had in the past two or three weeks two meetings with the Japanese--one by the President with Mr Kaifu and one by Secretary Brady with Mr Hashimoto They didn't come back after those meetings and say ""Let's go in and bash the market"" Quite the contrary We did a modest amount after the Kaifu meetings, and I can understand the need to show some cooperation, given everything that had happened But it was certainly not a major push or anything After the Hashimoto meetings, we did none We did zero, absolute zero And so--   I don't think it was based on a feeling of our being in or out I don't think that he had an interest in doing it for some other reasons   Well, they know that we are having this meeting They know, obviously, that we suspended our participation as of March 2nd and they know that we are looking at these issues because of some of the concerns we have   Yes, they certainly don't think that there's any consideration being given to a drastic change in the--   And gold certificates   It's on our balance sheet as foreign currency   It's not a Treasury issue   Well, Mr Chairman, to go ahead with the unimportant parts of the resolution, I would recommend that the authorization for the System's [overall open position in foreign currency] balances be increased from the present level of $21 billion to $25 billion effective immediately, because we do have interest earnings that come in all the time on these balances   Similarly, Mr Chairman, I would request that the Committee express an agreement in principle to accept a further request from the Treasury for additional warehousing authority and to raise the present limit on that from $10 billion to $15 billion  -82-    3/27/90   Yes That's the upper limit, which would be raised from the present $10 billion, of which $9 billion has been drawn, to $15 billion   Four of them;

1428,1990-08-21," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, I think the Treasury is interested, as we are, in not having these [warehousing] amounts continue indefinitely and be too big So, when the conditions were such that it was possible to make some arrangements in order to bring those holdings down, they were not reluctant or hesitant to do this It's not envisaged as a continuous or perpetual facility   Our mark holdings?   We don't have any plans at the present time   Well, I don't think we had any intervention transactions in the last period   I'd have to look it up, but there hasn't been any exchange market intervention for some months   We'll check the date "
1485,1990-10-02," Yes, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, it's very hard to be sure It may be that over time as other currencies tend to be more widely used and as other markets tend to be further developed one might expect some lessening of the uniqueness of the dollar Also, we now have a situation in Europe where for the first time the political differences and uncertainties that existed before aren't there, which may have meant that on this occasion there was more willingness to use some of these other currencies because they don't see the same kinds of political East/West problems as before It could be for any number of reasons But it's certainly true that the traders we talk to tell us that the old timers who work for them were all taking positions that assumed there would be a lot more movement into the dollar than happened As I say, it could be having a significant effect in the kind of cautionary attitudes [unintelligible] We also detect that a lot of people are very hesitant to be very short of the dollar in these circumstances because they think if there is overt military hostility the likelihood is very high that the dollar would pop up So, quite often recently on Fridays we see evidence that there's a lot of settling of the books--that people don't like to go home for the weekend very short of dollars because they fear that if some really serious hostilities were to break out they could find themselves suffering very, very large costs   Well, that's true I certainly should have mentioned that factor There is hesitation about US institutions    10/2/90   What we also have heard a lot is that instead of movement from one currency to another currency there has been a surge of movement to liquidity in many places So this tends to be a greater shift to liquidity than to a currency   One can think of any number of possibilities Certainly, one concern is the fact that the Japanese industries are holding something on the order of $250 billion or so that would be largely unhedged And because of what may happen here that could cause them to get frightened and to start running for cover fast Or, as I was indicating in my comments, there are factors in Japan that could lead to a desire to shift a lot more funds [to yen] for their own reasons One could envisage all kinds of scenarios that could cause the dollar to start moving down very, very, rapidly, with a lot of investors all around trying to get out   It's a real danger   No, there is no need for any action "
1486,1990-10-02," Certainly, you'd likely get a reaction if there were the larger move On the more moderate one, I think the markets are expecting it but there might still be a reaction, even though they are expecting it and have built it into their thinking, on the grounds that it would sort of confirm it Basically, I think the general attitude toward the dollar is negative and that kind of easing would tend to confirm that the Committee may be going in that direction So, you could get a reaction even on the smaller move   There certainly is that possibility And if it happens this quickly and spreads through all the other markets and has all these effects on interest rates and the stock market and everything else, then we have a real mess on our hands It's impossible to assess how big the possibility of that is But the market's view toward the dollar is generally negative So, there is some susceptibility--some fertile ground to see something starting as a movement down, which could then lead to a lot of efforts to get out and protect the dollar That is a serious possibility   Well, the dollar has been stable for the past few weeks, basically, except for the strange things going on with the yen   Well, as I say, if you cut away from all of these things, as far as we can tell the general sentiment toward the dollar is negative Markets are talking about moving further toward 150 on    10/2/90  the mark and toward 130+ on the yen So, that is the sort of framework we are dealing with After having heard the statements of the Chairman and various other things that have gone on, the markets certainly would not be surprised to see the middle option move tied in with action on the budget That is probably the general expectation of most people out there "
1546,1990-11-13," [Statement--see Appendix]   We now have $4-1/2 billion warehoused   The limit is $10 billion   Well, there is an occasion to reexamine these limits, which comes up in February I'm sure we can look at it at that time   But we do, of course, have very close ties with the Mexicans for many, many reasons And we've had the swap line outstanding with them for decades At times it has been regarded as useful for the Federal Reserve to be in a position to provide some financing during a period when Mexico was working to try to get its situation under control We have participated with the Treasury and it has been very helpful to be in a position to be able to provide in effect a measure of confidence about what Mexico was trying to do, which we were very much supporting But never did we do anything that caused really great exposure for us    11/13/90   I would think that most market participants expect that there will be some change in the federal funds rate looking ahead over the next few days or so; at least there seems to be a general expectation of a very modest change and a [possibility] for another one The latter is a much smaller expectation but some people in the market are thinking about a further step maybe by the end of the year Even though they are expecting such a move to take place, that doesn't mean it would not have any impact in the exchange market; I think much will depend on how and when [a move is made] and the circumstances and so forth, and whether the market gets the idea-- looking further into the future--that we're on a particular path in a particular direction So, even though most people in the market expect that there will be a modest change in the federal funds rate, I don't think one can conclude that that wouldn't have any effect It might not have any immediate effect, but it certainly goes into their thinking about what they're looking for over a longer period My own feeling would be that a discount rate move would be regarded as a more significant step and one that I don't think they really are anticipating at this point   I got the impression from the Japanese that they took about 2/3rds as much this time as they had in some earlier periods "
1547,1990-11-13," Based on forward rates and so forth we think that most people are expecting it As I was indicating earlier, that doesn't mean that it might not continue to have an effect--maybe not immediately, but it influences people's views about the next x weeks "
1666,1991-02-05," Mr Chairman, this is the warehousing agreement proposal?   Mr Truman circulated a memorandum on this matter to the Committee and I concurred in the memorandum The Committee will recall that at its meeting last March it agreed to a proposal to increase the warehousing maximum by $5 billion, from $10 billion to $15 billion This was made subject to a Treasury request In the event, the additional amount of $5 billion was not needed during the year and was not used; there was no Treasury request to use it Indeed, the Treasury has taken an initiative, with our aid and encouragement, to reduce the amount outstanding under the present warehousing agreement As you know, the amount outstanding has been reduced in the past months from $9 billion, which is where it stood when the Committee approved the increase, to $4-1/2 billion The Treasury in reversing these amounts and reducing the outstandings to $4-1/2 billion has always urged that a cushion of unused capacity be retained in case there is a requirement for it, even though [the need] has been going the other way We have made the point that we don't think the warehousing facility should be in continuous use and we have been helping and encouraging them in bringing the amount down from $9 billion to $4-1/2 billion Our view is that the correct approach at this point would be to drop the additional $5 billion that was added last year and to seek the renewal of the facility at the present time with the pre-existing maximum of $10 billion And I so recommend, Mr Chairman   Well, there have been warehousing arrangements with the Treasury going back to the early 1960s I would have to seek legal guidance on what would happen if at the time when there were outstandings the Committee did not authorize their continuance   I assume so, yes The next ones that fall due are in May and June Well, I don't know what the legal position would be If there were no warehouse facility, I don't know whether that would mean that the whole $4-1/2 billion would have to be ended at this moment or--   There are terms on them   It means that the FOMC endorses the continuance of this facility up to a maximum of $10 billion, yes   Well, as I say, the Treasury has taken the initiative and has acted to bring down the amount outstanding quite substantially in this past period They have always made the point very clearly that in doing so they urge and would expect that there would be a continuation of this [facility] so that if conditions should change--and they can change--it would be available to them quite promptly in order to continue further warehousing At this point conditions are such that it certainly does not look like that's the way it's going; it's going the other way We're in the process of reducing our foreign currency holdings   If we authorize the $10 billion, then typically we act on their request in providing the warehousing Now, obviously, this is not an adversarial relationship, as far as I'm concerned It's something that we talk to them about, work with them on, and deal with them on a daily basis It has always worked satisfactorily on that basis    2/5-6/91   Any action to change this does get reported If we leave it at $10 billion, that's outstanding until we choose to act otherwise or we look at it again next year   We've made clear to the Treasury many, many times that we don't visualize this as a facility that should be in continuous use It's there when conditions are such that it's required and it should be drawn down, or reversed, at times when conditions warrant That's the basis we've been working on and the basis on which it has been reduced to $4-1/2 billion in recent months   [Statement--See Appendix]   I think it happens automatically, but I defer--   Well, it's very hard to predict because one never knows when something is likely to set off concerns about confidence in the [exchange] rate of the dollar, which could lead to a precipitous fall and spread to other markets and all the problems that that entails, since we obviously still have a large deficit that we still have to finance and have to attract the funds to do it There has been downward pressure on the dollar and, as I say, it's at an all time low in terms of the mark As to the prospects over the more medium term, there are some facts that tend to provide more encouragement about it For example, the dollar at these very low levels is considered by many people to be quite competitive; and if this present period can be managed, then maybe that [sentiment] will begin to be reflected more in the exchange markets   It is an ongoing saga Every time we have a refunding the question arises Will it this time be a party to which no one comes--a Stella Dallas party? But thus far, [unintelligible] There continues to be foreign participation; it changes and at times has declined quite noticeably, but funds continue to come in Peter, do you want [to comment]?   Also, a lot of the activities in the foreign exchange markets reflects changes in hedge ratios That [means that if] Japanese investors and these categories of large investors decide that they think the dollar's prospects are not good, they will change the hedge ratio without necessarily getting rid of the securities or anything like that So, you can't detect this just by what is going on in the securities markets There's an awful lot of hedging and dehedging and that is a very important factor   They pay us in marks and yen and we feed them out in a manner that is like our normal customer business In other words, we just try to make clear that this is not an action by us [so as not] to appear to be influencing the rate   As far as we can tell, it has worked out quite well so far   We have used the BIS for some portion of these sales of foreign currencies, so that we're not seen in the market to appear to be selling Thus far, it seems to have worked out satisfactorily "
1667,1991-02-05, That's close   Are you [using] DM or dollars? 
1735,1991-03-26," [Statement--see Appendix]   No, I think it's more just an indication of the events of this period Certain parts of the Treasury had at times shown a keen interest in trying to get some G-7 interest in something approaching [that], but I wouldn't say target zones But there has been a considerable reluctance on the part of the other G-7 members to do this I think the intervention that we saw in this period was really not so much a concern about the specific level that the dollar had reached as it was the fact that the dollar had moved up very, very rapidly--by about 16 percent in a few weeks At times the markets were really quite disorderly Last Thursday there was a movement of six pfennigs in one day And the markets were very unsettled at times also in response to the proposals, specifically by the Germans, to participate in some coordinated intervention because of their concerns about the threats on the mark   Well, Mr Chairman, to move to another subject Questions have been raised about the level of US foreign exchange balances and whether it would be appropriate to take some moves to reduce those balances I would like a few minutes to discuss this matter with the Committee, if I might The US authorities combined --that is, the Federal Reserve and the ESF--now hold marks with a market value of about $30 billion and yen with a market value of about $18 billion  Let me mention some of the pros and cons of having these balances First, on the positive side, looking at it from the perspective of where I sit, there certainly are some distinct advantages of our owning for the first time ever substantial currency reserves Without having to belabor the obvious, not having to depend on the Bundesbank and other foreign central banks for all our financing at times of need gives us a great deal of independence as well as more of what I would call policy flexibility to deal with any exchange market flare-up, without necessarily having to change some of our policies at a time when that might not be wise or appropriate Also, I would say that's one reason we got through the heavy downward pressures on the dollar that we faced in February that I just described--and got through it really with relatively little pain and anxiety compared with previous problems of that sort A lot of that had to do with the fact that we have more credibility and more market confidence because we do hold substantial balances The market is aware that we hold them and that we are able to take action if we want to I think that did help to keep the dollar's decline from getting out of hand at a time when our currency was at all time lows Also, I should say that our currency balances, which are certainly far higher than ever before, if compared to international standards in other countries don't really show as a high currency reserve currently  On the negative side, our reserve holdings do entail exposure to the exchange rate risk At present the ESF and the Federal Reserve combined have a cumulative net profit--that's the difference between the present market value of our currency holdings and the acquisition value--on our currency balances of around $4 to $4-1/2 billion of which the Federal Reserve share of the profit amounts to about $32 billion Of course, we regularly mark-to-market on these balances, and these translation gains have already been reflected in our balance sheet This means that the Federal Reserve's share of the profits have been used when they were accumulated to increase the level of Federal Reserve profits that we hand over to the Treasury Accordingly, if the exchange rate moves up from this point, the level of those cumulative profits declines Only if the dollar goes down does this [backtrack] the other way And if the dollar goes up, that reduces the Federal Reserve profits going to the Treasury There's a concern that this exchange rate exposure and the possibility of these translation losses could lead to public and Congressional criticism There is no real loss in terms of the interest these days Our interest rates are presently below those of both Germany and Japan; [so that goes] the other way  If there were a need to cut back on our currency balances, it seems to me it's important that we have a clear and well understood    3/26/91  rationale for the action Of course, we could reduce them by more active intervention operations and that's perfectly understandable But if we simply adopted a conscious policy of getting rid of a substantial part of our reserves, it seems to me that that could be seen by the market and by foreign officials and by the general public as a move by the United States toward withdrawal of its role in international responsibilities and its role in helping to maintain the stability and smooth functioning of the [international financial] system One possible rationale for selling reserves other than through our intervention operations is to unwind some more of the warehousing Last year we did succeed in selling off a substantial amount of foreign currency balances as part of the unwinding of the warehousing arrangements with the Treasury We sold some both off- market and on-market and we explained it publicly after the fact That did not cause problems and was accepted as a reasonable and understandable action to reduce the warehousing; it is generally agreed that drawings under the warehousing are not to supposed to be permanently outstanding  Another possibility would be to adopt an approach of selling the earnings on our reserve holdings from time to time as we have the opportunity and putting those out into the market or elsewhere as conditions permit Other nations sometimes follow approaches not too different from that For example, the Germans accumulate their troop dollars in this manner and then feed them off; they may keep them for a considerable period and then feed them off into the market even when it seems desirable to do so or when conditions are favorable for absorbing them without market disruption Similarly, we might look for opportunities to make sales to other central banks whose reserve needs might be complementary to our own So, an approach of some sales along these lines for reducing the warehousing or for disposing of some of the earnings would provide some considerable scope for flexibility in disposing of some of the balances However, at the moment, I should say that the prospects for such sales are not very encouraging With the dollar strengthening very sharply, neither the Germans nor the Japanese would like to see us putting more mark or yen balances into the market under present conditions Also, the Bundesbank has just paid a substantial amount of its dollar reserves to us for its Desert Shield contribution and that, as well as the intervention, reduced their dollar reserves And the Bank of Japan has just paid us a little under $6 billion in dollars as we converted the yen that they have contributed for the Desert Shield operation In light of these circumstances, I would suspect that neither of those central banks is likely to be interested in either further off-market exchanges right away or market [sales] But over time we could think of ways to utilize some of these currencies along these lines and ways to provide us some more flexibility if that is the Committee's wish Thank you   The Treasury's present warehousing is $4-1/2 billion I think they would not be happy to reduce it totally, but we    3/26/91  did reduce it by a considerable amount last year, and I think some further reduction would certainly be possible   Well, it's very difficult to be at all precise in this   Even in interest it's hard to say how much--   Well, I really do think it's difficult to set a specific target level It seems to me that the reserves that we have accumulated as a consequence of what we've done and not done-- One of the problems is that it's very difficult to say we don't need $48 billion, we need $42 billion or $55 billion It's very hard to justify that kind of decision, it seems to me   $50 billion   Well, as I say it's very difficult to know the kind of reserve needs we may have because we don't know what circumstances we're going to face The fact that we have them in a sense makes it less necessary to use them So, to impress the market and to impress the rest of the world, it seems to me we need a substantial level--along the lines of what we have Our reserves are not high relative to, say, those of Germany or Japan or even Taiwan, which of course has the highest in the world By most international standards we do not have a level of reserves that shows us to be excessively endowed by these kinds of comparisons You can argue how much the United States should have, given its position, whether that's more or less But it seems to me that the United States should be up with the big players, as it were, and that we should have amounts that don't look quite small relative to what other major countries have   That's right   You also need the cooperation in order to borrow, and that's what we obtained the last time But it takes time and so forth and so on Obviously, the ability to borrow in the open market is one potential source   Well, we intervened in the amount of $14 billion during the February period; that's the only intervention   Well, I don't have the precise--   Well,--   $15 billion Do you mean the amount of the warehousing?   Probably $53 billion; I don't have the precise number, but I would say around $53 billion   Well, I don't see that $53 billion particularly as a ceiling or anything else I don't see any need for us to continue to accumulate [foreign currency] reserves, if that's your question   Well, you've asked a rhetorical question But it seems to me the question is whether you agree with the approach on the intervention, not the question of what is the level of reserves  -12-    3/26/91   If we always intervened when the dollar rose and never intervened when the dollar fell, our reserves would accumulate   You're not getting any assumption from me What I was talking about was the possibility, if the Committee has the desire, of looking for occasions to feed out some of these currencies as we did last year We could look for opportunities to put them out in ways that don't have an exchange rate effect--just sell off a few and announce that the only [reason] that we are [selling] is to help bring down the warehousing or that we have an approach of disposing of some of the earnings from time to time That was the concept I was--   Well, I do think that's more a question of the approach to intervention than of reserve determination   Are you asking in the legal sense or the policy sense?   Legally, it is set by the Committee We have a limit of $25 billion in exposure, which is the maximum that we can--   No, the Treasury's holdings are part of the ESF and subject to the determination of the Secretary of the Treasury   Well, we and the Treasury have a different amount of [foreign currency] reserves at the present time We have a higher level of reserves partly because of the warehousing But even excluding the warehousing we have--do you have the number, Charlie?   We have about $26 billion and they have about $22 billion So, there are some differences But, as you know, the policy has been for a long time to try to pursue these things together and to work jointly And almost all of our intervention has been financed that way Certainly, the Treasury is very happy with that arrangement and would be very concerned if there were a proposal to go off on a different track   On the intervention the Treasury has a stronger hand   The Committee has the legal authority to set the maximum holdings that we have   Well, it would be inconceivable that we would do any such action without working with the Treasury But also we would not just be selling off other countries' currencies without working it out with them When we did the $2 billion last year we did work it out with the German authorities so that it could be done in a way that didn't cause problems for them and their markets But we're now in a different market situation   I'm not sure I understand We could obviously-- and we have done so--enter into exchanges with the Germans and others to give them back a portion of their currency and receive back a portion of our currency The kind of facility you're talking about, if I understand it, sounds like what the swap was originally intended to do   It sounds like a forward exchange transaction I'll be happy to try to think and see if there--   Right   We'll try to think that one through   Well, I think the Treasury is sympathetic to some reduction but they are not talking about getting rid of the whole warehousing amount or anything like that This hasn't gone through all their [decisionmaking] processes but the discussions that have taken place so far indicate some willingness, certainly, to consider some decline in the warehousing; but they're not talking about the whole amount   Well, I'm not sure I understand We could--   Yes, by the Treasury   It was a Treasury participation in a European BIS swap It was outstanding for about a week "
1837,1991-07-02," [Statement--see Appendix]   We hold $209 billion against a limit of $25 billion   The market has not become aware of exactly what has taken place The market did notice, as I mentioned in my comments, that the Bundesbank was selling Treasury securities, which they needed to do in order to position themselves for this And the market has seen the Treasury's balance sheet, released yesterday, which shows the change in certain of the accounts But unless something has happened in the course of the day, they are still a little uncertain as to exactly what that means There are some who are interpreting these moves as positioning for large-scale intervention either by the Federal Reserve or the Treasury or in the sale of the Treasury securities by the Bundesbank So, they've seen some of the data and I think they will get a clearer view of this when the Bundesbank announces its balance sheet figures, which are supposed to come out Thursday but may come out on Friday   It may be Wednesday or Friday They're now talking close of business Wednesday So, there will be a statement, which will not mention the United States, but will talk about an exchange of these reserve assets for dollars I imagine people will be able to put two and two together at that point   Well, I think when they see everything that has happened, they will begin to understand just what it was Up until now they've been wondering whether it was a gathering war chest for [intervention]   We've given the Treasury a statement    7/2-3/91   So, by Friday when the Federal Reserve balance sheets come out, they will have all the information   That comes out--   It shows both   Well, we do, of course, look at these limits every year We can certainly examine it to see whether the present limits are appropriate The fact that it has come down from $24 to $21 billion is certainly a decline, but we do have to leave room in these limits because we are earning interest regularly on our holdings and we always have to consider what kind of [leeway] we need in order to allow for the interest accruals as well as for the possibility of being able to operate in the market when it's appropriate to do so "

1952,1991-10-01," [Statement--see Appendix]  Mr Chairman, I also might take a moment to mention that we circulated a memorandum to the Committee on questions related to the investment of our German marks As the memorandum points out, almost all of our marks are in a three-month double-forward facility with the Bundesbank This causes a problem for the Bundesbank in terms of some mismatch between that facility and the two-month repo position that the Bundesbank uses these funds for They are concerned and have been seeking to get some change in that facility, and we're looking into the possibility of some modification We need to work this out, of course, with the Bundesbank and the Treasury and there are many technical questions that we have to look into  The memorandum also suggests that we might look at some possible change in our approach more broadly I mentioned the possibility of a three-point approach for dealing with these DM and yen balances The first element would be that we would work out an arrangement whereby either regularly or from time to time as seems appropriate we would put the earnings we receive on these various reserve holdings back into the market or sell them in other ways The second element would be that we would continue to look for further opportunities for off-market exchanges such as those that we carried out and are still in the process of carrying out with both the Bank of Japan and the Bundesbank and thereby reduce some of our reserve holdings in that manner if it seemed appropriate Then, thirdly, I suggested that we might also consider some modest diversification of our facilities so that they might be less heavily focused on these very short-term, three-month facilities which are available on a two- day notice--less heavily focused in this Bundesbank facility and other similar facilities We might think about putting a somewhat greater portion, for example, in the BIS or in some other arrangement of that sort We'd try to work out this matter with the Bundesbank; it is causing them concern because it does put them in a position whereby they have to explain to their GAO and auditors why they have a facility with us that can cause them to make losses out of profits    10/1/91  And as part of this general examination we could also consider some diversification so that we might move a small portion of the balances into somewhat longer German government paper beyond the 12-month limit that we've been held to up to this point There's very little of this very short-term paper available in Germany, and for reasons of diversification it might be appropriate to consider a somewhat more flexible approach Thank you, Mr Chairman   Well, we're about halfway through the process that we worked out with the Bundesbank to cover the months from July through December After that, I do not think the Bundesbank would be unwilling to consider some further possible exchanges next year I mentioned as a part of the approach that we would continue to look for such opportunities I assume there is a possibility that both we and the Bundesbank might find it in our mutual interest and therefore advisable "
