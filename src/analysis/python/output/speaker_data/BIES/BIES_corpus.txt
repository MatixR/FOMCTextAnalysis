 Thank you   Well, given my long tenure of a long weekend and a day to look at this   information, I won’t pretend to be as up-to-date on many of the series as the experts around the table   But I wanted to bring to the table some observations I’ve noted, which are more from an anecdotal   perspective of the business community and the banking community     First, my main concern regarding where we are in this business cycle is where we are on the   business investment side  The reason is that I believe what got us into the recession was the drastic   drop in investment in certain key technology sectors  I feel optimistic that inventory corrections are   well under way in that sector and that we may actually begin to see some stabilization in sales     The consumer has really kept the economy going in this cycle  We can see that both in   housing and in auto sales, even though I believe a lot of the recent auto sales represent a timing   difference due to the attractive financing programs  But the consumer has been using the refinancing   of homes as a way to increase disposable income every month, and we know that the pool of   mortgages that can be profitably refinanced by consumers is dwindling  In fact, I would argue that the   recent uptick in refinanced mortgages is what we normally see when long-term mortgage rates begin   to go up, as the astute refinancers jump in and lock in rates that they believe have hit their lows  So, I   don’t believe we’re going to see much more of an increase in spendable income coming from the   consumer  And obviously, as many others have said, the threat of terrorism may put a damper on the   consumer, as will unemployment worries   The other sector that concerns me--and I say this in light of recent personal experiences--is   state and local governments due to the financial stress currently being placed on them, particularly in   areas that depend a great deal on sales tax revenues and on revenues tied to the employment situation   Those entities are having to spend substantial sums to support responses to potential terrorism   activities     12/11/01 67    Finally, most corporate executives I talk with feel that they have very little ability to raise   prices at this time  In fact, they’re feeling more pressure to cut prices, as has already been discussed,   to deal with inventory accumulation and excess capacity  So I find very little pressure on inflation at   the moment   I support the recommendation, but I do also support the comments that other   people have made about beginning to signal that this may be one of our last easing actions    Many of the comments I had put together we’ve already focused on, but let   me summarize the issues I’ve been looking at  First, on the inflation front—after today’s   numbers particularly—I continue to be quite surprised by how little evidence there is of price   increases The fact that we actually had a fall in nominal GDP in the quarter is unusual, over a   period of a couple of decades anyway It leads me to be concerned about what is going to   happen to gross corporate earnings in the coming year  To get the PE ratios that the market is   pricing in—to get to those double-digit earnings increases—would imply huge increases in unit   sales in the context of a lack of pricing power  So, I share some of the concerns stated earlier   about the ability of companies to generate that quickly the earnings turnaround implied in current   PE ratios   This recession, as we’ve discussed, has been shallow in large part because consumers   continued to spend throughout the whole recessionary period  One can look at the events of   September 11 as a shock that produced something of a cocooning effect—people didn’t go   anywhere and didn’t buy anything for a few months  We’re now seeing consumer confidence   back to the level that prevailed before the September 11 events  And to the extent that   consumers can just hold the course for the next few months, I think we have a strong base and I   believe that we have turned the corner on economic activity     The rapid liquidation of inventories by businesses in the fourth quarter is another sign   that inventories are close to the levels companies will need to have, even though the small           January 29-30, 2002 Page 110 of 194  business survey, as I read the numbers, indicated that those firms still plan to cut inventories in   the first quarter Moreover, as Governor Ferguson noted, the good news is on the business   investment front as a whole, since that is what got us into this recession  The fact that new   orders for computers and peripheral equipment have grown for three months suggests that we   probably have hit the bottom on that  Even small businesses, while still intending to liquidate   inventories, now indicate that they actually are looking at plans to increase their capital   investment expenditures  Since I believe small businesses have been critical in creating job   growth in this country, I see that as the starting point for getting us back to a faster pace of   growth   Let me note two areas I am concerned about  One was mentioned quite a bit in the   various District reports, and that is the problems that state and local governments are facing    Many state and local governments are running out of their rainy day funds  Several are under   severe stress Many that had unemployment reserves are not going to have much left, barring   any additional assistance that comes from the federal government, and that is already showing up   in layoffs and reduced support for local services in a lot of areas These reserves were   accumulated for the purpose of helping the people who have probably lost their jobs  So I am   concerned about the effect and the potential drag on economic activity from the state and local   sector, whether it’s in construction or employment more generally   I also share the concerns that several have mentioned about confidence in the capital   markets due to the Enron scandal and other recent accounting restatements  I think the noise is   going to get even worse, given that some of the earnings boost this year is due to changes in   good will accounting Those changes effectively stop amortization and give a one-time uptick to   stated earnings  But it really isn’t earnings; it’s just another accounting change  I also worry that              January 29-30, 2002 Page 111 of 194  if companies are forced to bring joint ventures back into their consolidated statements, they may   be bringing them back on the books just at the point when the joint ventures are going from   losses to profits, and that may make the earnings picture cloudy  It will further reduce   confidence in the quality of the accounting standards in this country  On balance, I believe that   the economy has turned  I see neither risk of inflation nor risk of deflation  The forecast in the   Greenbook is close to what I would project, but I am more pessimistic about companies rehiring   workers I think that will occur much more slowly than is forecast in the Greenbook    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I, too, was struck by some of   Don Kohn’s comments on definitions of weakness  I hope there is some way that we can signal   that we’re talking about growth in the economy being significantly below what we consider to be   its potential I don’t want people to infer from the risk statement that we’re expecting a double-  dip recession to come along  So if there’s a way that we can make that clear in the wording of   our statement, I would be more comfortable with it   If the goal of this is to increase understanding and transparency, I’m a little   uncomfortable saying that we would have a press officer provide this information in response to   a question—even if that were to happen today—because that means that we don’t control the   release of the information  One of the things we might want to have our press people do—I’m   volunteering them for this—is to look at some of the practices corporations employed when they           January 29-30, 2002 Page 146 of 194  adopted fair disclosure regulations a year ago  That made a lot of companies look closely at how   disclosures were made, including how the Internet is used for information purposes  One of the   risks of having the wire services pick up information such as this versus putting it in a formal   document is that the spin on it is controlled by the wire services   Another thing a lot of companies do, even though a number of actions may be taken at   one board meeting, is to issue separate press releases  Perhaps we could look at doing something   along those lines On the day of our meeting we could release our policy statement—and we call   it that—and then at the appropriate time, as the Chairman was alluding to, we could have other   releases That may be another way to handle it  The message in the policy statement is what we   want to get out It gives people some knowledge about our decision; it represents our consensus   and our main conclusions  And then the other information is released at a later point—in a day   or within the next couple of days—and it’s called something else The people who want to see   that can see it, but it doesn’t have the strength nor get the attention that the policy statement does    At any rate, there might be some things we can learn from the way corporations handle   disclosures    I agree with what President Santomero said  I am very concerned, and my   biggest concern is creating liquidity in a foreign market instrument  From a public policy   perspective, when there are liquidity issues in US markets, I think we’d have a real problem   answering the question of why we chose to build liquidity in a market for foreign securities  I do   believe that the priority should be on the contingency planning, though  We pray that nothing   else like September 11 happens again  But with what is going on in the Middle East, I don’t     March 19, 2002 Page 23 of 117  think we can ignore the contingency planning  In my view that should be our immediate   concern, and I would feel strongly about putting that at the top of the list    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The information we’ve all seen since the last   meeting indicates that the recovery is here  In fact, I question whether the word “recovery” is   appropriate for the events we’ve been through and whether we really did have a recession  It   clearly has been shallow and not a “V” or a “U”  I think its shape has been a bit more like a   saucer I’ve been focusing on some of the manufacturing and trade inventory information, and   I’ve been surprised at how fast inventory liquidation has occurred  Importantly, as a couple of   people have already mentioned, the inventory-sales levels are back to where they were in the   early months of 2000, which was the beginning of this slowdown  That would imply that   business inventory positions are in good shape, and I think industrial production is already   picking up in response to that   In common with Governor Gramlich, the new fiscal stimulus package makes me wonder   exactly what the target is  This recession was unique in that it was caused by excess business   investment in selected areas  So to encourage more spending in the areas that already have   excess investment seems to me a peculiar type of recovery medicine  Based on anecdotal reports   from business people I’ve talked to as I’ve been traveling to some of your Banks and other   meetings I’ve attended, I wonder if a lot of the excess capacity that appears to be out there is   excess capacity that is permanently shut down and will never come back  If that’s the case, it              March 19, 2002 Page 76 of 117  will have implications also for investment going forward and—perhaps even more importantly—   for productivity, since the idle capacity is likely to involve the least productive resources   Consumer spending is continuing to grow, even adjusting for the unusual wave that was   created between the fourth quarter and the first quarter due to automobile sales promotions    Consumer disposable income looks good  Income tax refunds are running way above where they   were last year, reflecting I think both the tax cuts and over-withholding as consumers’ incomes   fell during 2001   The productivity improvement in the fourth quarter in many ways shows that businesses   were surprised by the level of final demand in that quarter  As we normally see during a   recovery, productivity has increased The pessimism about final demand that CEOs have shown   throughout this period is one of the reasons that productivity has been so strong  CEOs believed   that if they couldn’t control the top line, then the only way to meet their profit goals was to deal   with the expense line In fact, the more policymakers use words like “recovery,” the more I   think that will tend to make CEOs and business people even more pessimistic, since obviously   none of us around the table believes that the recovery from this period of slowdown will be   anything like the recovery from a typical recession  So any CEO who is expecting a bounceback   comparable to those experienced in past recessions is going to be sorely disappointed         Finally, in terms of employment, if the unemployment peak is supposed to signal when   we should start to change direction, then I would say that December was that peak  I find it   interesting that we now have discussions of a high unemployment rate at 5½ percent and a long-  term NAIRU at 5¼ percent  I would echo the comments of my esteemed colleague, the   President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, who suggested that in determining the                                                                        March 19, 2002 Page 77 of 117  appropriate policy stance as we move forward we should look again at the NAIRU of 5¼ percent   when our long-term inflation forecast is running well below 2 percent   I support your recommendations, and I particularly like the comment about   policy being accommodative   I support the recommendation, including the fact that I think the vote should   be in the announcement as opposed to just available separately  We get electronic information   nowadays, and it’s easier for everybody to see it at the same time and in the same document    At this meeting I continue to believe that the consumer is the mainstay of the   economy  And with disposable income back near pre-September 11 levels, I expect the   consumer to continue to be the mainstay even though, as we said earlier in the day, consumer   confidence could be very fragile given the news on the political front and on unemployment  For   real GDP growth, I agree with the forecast of much slower growth in the second quarter, as   inventory reductions appear to be ending and the recovering economy widens our trade deficit                May 7, 2002 58 of 81  Final sales growth will also slow somewhat in the second quarter, as increased federal   government spending remains at its higher level and state and local governments continue to   restrain spending to meet falling revenues  In the last half of the year, GDP will advance at a   faster pace, I expect, as continued growth in final sales requires businesses to meet demands   from production rather than inventory liquidation  And the fact that manufacturing production   has now risen for three months, for the first time since late in the year 2000, has me expecting to   see more production growth ahead     Given the level of excess capacity and the lack of pricing power by businesses, expense   controls will still be the driver of profit recovery  This will continue to keep productivity high,   and employment growth will lag until business confidence is restored  As a result, wage costs   should advance very slowly, and inflation should remain well under 2 percent for the rest of the   year So for the time being, I don’t feel that we need to make a change in our policy stance from   the past meeting   I do have a longer-term concern, though, that I’m becoming increasingly worried about    We have seen a lack of business investment for over eighteen months now  And much of the   productivity growth that we’re enjoying currently is due to the innovation-investment cycles   associated with the extremely high levels of investment in the late 1990s and at the beginning of   the year 2000 The lack of current investment is going to slow the innovation-investment cycle   and that, in turn, will harm sales growth that is related to product innovation and introduction  It   also will set the stage for a slowdown in productivity due to business process improvements    These types of investment cycles take many years to become effective  They go from planning   to investing, to implementing, and then to enjoying the full fruits of that investment  I am   pessimistic in that I believe the caution that CEOs are expressing about their profits will continue                  May 7, 2002 59 of 81  to limit their ability and willingness to make these long-term investments  In turn, that means   that several years from now we aren’t going to have the ability to harvest the productivity gains   because we will not have had growth in business investment for an extended period  At some   point the recent high levels of productivity growth, I fear, will drop substantially, closer to   historical trends Given how accommodative our monetary policy is at the moment, with real   funds rates at zero, I have a worry that at some point we are going to have to raise interest rates   because productivity will slow   I support your recommendation    I found the papers very interesting  I think a few of you know that I have   been trying to learn more about where the research stands on productivity and monetary policy    But as someone coming from the private sector there is one comment—an observation—I’d like   to make  When I look at exhibit 5 and the factors you show as having had effects on the natural   rate of unemployment, there’s only one item on the list that to me reflects what business actually   was doing in this period, and that’s what I would call help supply Also, I think there’s an area   on which companies have been working in the last decade that we may not be capturing here     Let me start by prefacing my remarks with this comment  CEOs and CFOs think in terms   of nominal earnings growth, not real earnings growth  So as inflation started coming down in the   1980s, they were challenged to retain the kind of growth in earnings they had been getting in   order to keep their stock prices up In the 1980s companies tended to resort—and this is a broad   statement—to financial leverage  There were a lot of leveraged buyouts and a lot of excesses   that created problems and led to the recession we had in the early 1990s As a result, business   executives had to go to the next type of leverage that a company can control to improve   profitability, and that’s operating leverage  So the decade of the 1990s became increasingly   complex as firms really began to focus on widening operating margins  As the decade moved   along, companies ran into a bottleneck in their efforts to become more efficient  They found   that, as unemployment dropped, they were hiring workers who were further down on the skills   ladder And because they were hiring people who had few skills, making that operating margin              June 25-26, 2002 44 of 179  wider from the cost side was becoming more difficult  So in part I think the increased   investment and greater focus on investment where productivity results could be achieved—as   opposed to firms taking a view of let’s just see if this works—has been driven by the scarcity of   labor skills As we go through a period where labor becomes more available, that scarcity may   not be as evident I would love to see the staff follow up on the suggestion of looking at the   experience of some other countries because anecdotally we hear reports that some of the   countries with shortages of labor have seen spurts of productivity too  So thinking about it from   the demand for labor side might be another area where this cross-country type of research might   be helpful   The discussion that we’ve been hearing today is consistent with the Beige   Book summary that characterizes economic growth as modest and uneven—or schizophrenic, as   we said earlier From late 2001 until the last FOMC meeting, most forecasters had been revising   growth estimates upward  Since the last meeting, we’re seeing more forecasts for the remainder   of 2002 being revised down Consumers have slowed their pace of spending  Business fixed   investment still does not show signs of sustained recovery  Employment and average weekly   hours worked have stabilized But I echo the concerns that have been expressed many times   already today that issues about the integrity of corporate earnings are continuing to overhang   markets and consumer expectations  On the positive side, I look at the increase in labor force   participation and the continued inventory liquidation and sustained final sales of businesses,   which have brought inventory-sales ratios to historic low levels  Production has grown for five   months but at a pace below that necessary to maintain even the low current level of inventories    Housing continues to be a bright spot in economic activity, and fiscal policy continues to be   stimulative     Inflation remains at extremely low levels, and CEOs continue to lament their limited   ability to increase prices The slow pace of employment activity and the pressure on profits   continue to drive productivity to strong levels  The sustained lower value of the dollar, however,   will increase inflation pressures to some degree  Thus, the modest pace of economic activity and   the low level of inflation warrant no change in economic policy today        June 25-26, 2002 99 of 179  I support it    I have a question Can you comment just a little on what you see happening   in the commercial paper markets at this time?   As many of us have already noted, the economy is continuing to expand but   at a slower pace than earlier in the year  As we have noted in our prior meetings, we have been   revising downward our forecast since spring  At this stage it is hard to identify major risks of   inflation over the intermediate term  Thus the focus now should be on the strength of economic   activity  While real GDP growth is now reported to have slowed from 5 percent in the first   quarter to 12 percent in the second, the Greenbook forecast is for growth to move toward its             August 13, 2002 57 of 92  long-term potential growth rate in 2003  The unusual growth of imports in the second quarter   significantly reduced real GDP growth while the conclusion of inventory liquidation should   provide the basis for continued expansion of industrial production as final sales advance   Survey measures of consumer confidence have fallen, with recent reports of corporate   fraud and the fall in equity values But real consumer activity, not the surveys, continues to be   resilient in this cycle Both housing and auto sales remain near record highs  This is due partly   to thirty-two-year lows on mortgage rates and incentives by auto manufacturers that make cars   more affordable today than they have been in thirty-four years  Consumers do not usually make   such major purchases if their outlook for the future is really dim Rather, the persistent growth   of real disposable income and slowing new claims for unemployment insurance serve to provide   a foundation for continued, though perhaps uneven, increases in consumer spending  And   today’s retail sales numbers support that view   To me the real focus should be on the pessimism of corporate CEOs  The drop in   business investment led this recession, and the lack of conviction about future revenue growth   has continued to slow the recovery of new investment commitments  We did see growth in   equipment and software sales in the last quarter for the first time in six quarters, and industrial   production has grown every month this year  But the July drop in the ISM index and the decline   in hours worked raise questions about the strength of the recovery  And because of my concern   about the pace of business investment, I am becoming more concerned about the overall outlook   for the pace of economic growth   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I think where my   perspective may differ from President Poole’s is that I don’t really want to tie our hands right   now I am concerned about weakness  I don’t believe we should respond to what is going on in   the market but rather to the implications that has in terms of consumer and business behavior    And if, with the new initiatives that the Congress has passed, we don’t very quickly get   aggressive actions against individuals who’ve committed some of these frauds, I am concerned   that this problem could linger on and on  Furthermore, if we don’t restore confidence in the   markets, I think there will be some longer-term impact on business financing and consumer   investing So I would prefer to shift the balance of risks to weakness now because we don’t   know how people are going to react in these very unusual times  And I’d like to signal that,   given the uncertainty, the risks we see in the outlook today are more to the downside    I’m just going to summarize my remarks since many of them echo the   comments we’ve heard around the table today  I believe the economic data that we’ve been   seeing recently continue to show very mixed signs about the strength of the recovery  I would   also echo the concerns expressed by others about the direction in which our forecasts are going    Since the beginning of the year, our staff forecasts for the fourth quarter of this year and for 2003   have continually been revised downward In the past two months production worker hours and   average weekly hours have declined We know that manufacturing has been the weakest sector   in this recession and recovery, but we’re seeing industrial production slowing, not expanding    And inflation in our forecast is also continually being revised downward to levels that give me   some concern, based on our discussion at the January meeting   On the positive side, however, inventory liquidation appears to be leveling off, and the   forecast has sales increasingly coming from new production by the fourth quarter  While   business fixed investment appears to be nearing the end of its seven-quarter decline, sustained   growth is not forecasted until the beginning of next year  Equipment and software investment   has already begun to grow, and hopefully that should support continued improvements in   productivity Nevertheless, I share the concern mentioned that we may be experiencing a capital   shallowing because of the length of time we’ve gone without an increase in investment   The risks to the forecast to me appear to be increasingly on the downside, though    Economic growth forecasts in the euro area have been revised downward, and problems in other   regions indicate weaker support for US expansion from abroad  And I, too, am struck when I              September 24, 2002 71 of 115  go to international meetings that other countries seem to be waiting for the United States to pull   them up, not the other way around   Retail sales, especially for big-ticket items and durables such as automobiles, still appear   to depend heavily on discounting Rising house prices have sustained the consumer’s wealth   position against falling equity markets, and any decline in house prices could have significant   impacts on consumer spending  However, since I still have a house in Memphis for sale, I’m   less inclined to believe that there’s a widespread bubble  [Laughter]   Oh yes   Overall, I believe that one other concern mentioned around the table is   increasingly coming to the forefront, and that is that the economy appears to be very fragile    That brings into question the ability of the economy to absorb any future shocks that may come   from the various sources that we’ve talked about today  We don’t have a robust recovery  In   summary, I believe the risks of a slower economic recovery and inflation hovering around 1   percent are moving us very close to the time when we must consider further rate cuts    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  But I guess I’m more   anxious than President Parry because I am getting very concerned about the lack of momentum   and robustness in the recovery despite the geopolitical situation  I do think we need to pay close   attention to what is happening as the data are released in the next few weeks          I agree with many of the comments and remarks that have already been made    The expansion appears to be losing momentum and slowing, but it is still moving ahead  During   the last couple of months, manufacturing activity, new orders, auto sales, and general retail sales   have slowed from their prior pace  And capital spending still shows no upward momentum, as   companies continue to cut costs to achieve earnings growth, especially in an atmosphere of   increased uncertainty about geopolitical and economic risks   On the plus side, housing continues at strong levels  As Governor Kohn just mentioned,   while the cost of capital to companies has been rising, it continues to set record lows for the   household sector And I think that’s the reason we’re seeing growth there  Business inventories   finally show signs of growth after six quarters of liquidation, and that’s a plus  Business fixed            November 6, 2002 64 of 122  investment, as we’ve discussed already, is showing mixed signals depending on which set of   numbers one looks at  I would say, based on talking to corporate executives, that the disconnect   is partly because executives think of expenses running through the P&L statement  With the   huge wave of capital spending in 1998 and 1999, which now is fully amortized off the books,   firms actually can increase outlays and still have declining expenses     Overall the tone of recent economic activity has been very disappointing  There is little   indication of strength in major economies elsewhere in the world, and it’s not evident that our   economy can get much of a boost from any outside source  Now, I know that monetary policy   operates with long lags, but it has been eleven months since our last change in the fed funds   target rate When I look at the staff forecast this time, I notice that in this quarter and the first   half of 2003 the output gap has been widened by ¾ point  That tells me not only that we have to   wait longer for a rebound but that the gap between actual and potential economic growth is   bigger At the last meeting I thought it was a very close call as to whether we had reached the   point where we needed to ease further The data that we’ve received since that meeting tell me   that the time is now right and we must move at this meeting   Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation to go down 50 basis points on   the funds rate I think we need to show that we are ahead at this point in the economy  I find it a   little harder on the balance of risks statement  One of the reasons—using some of the words that   Vincent put in his handout—is that we talk about the foreseeable future  As a group we have   come to the conclusion that the economy is at sort of an inflection point where we think there is   weakness in the very short term but going out further in our forecast period we see more   strength I can support the balanced risk statement, but I think it’s important to indicate that the   “foreseeable future” is beyond the next meeting because some people tend to look at the risk   statement as a signal about our likely policy stance at the next meeting  So if we can talk past   the short run in the press release, I think that would be helpful   Mr Chairman?   Vincent mentioned that when this study goes out to the public it would have   a cover memo or foreword  I think it would be helpful to note that we are changing the way a lot   of our facilities can work, requiring perhaps different types of facilities  We might note why this   would involve removing the stigma from borrowing  The banks would be posting collateral and   might be looking to manage that differently  I think we at least ought to acknowledge that the   Lombard facility is going to be introduced  I wasn’t around for the Committee discussion of   these papers, and I’m not sure if the Lombard facility was anticipated  But just a few comments   in the cover memo about how that study relates to where we’re moving on the Lombard might be   helpful in order to make that current    I’m going to borrow a term that President Minehan used earlier  I, too, had   in the introductory sentence of my notes that I think we’re in a “bumpy” period right now  The   news since our last meeting has been mixed  As many of you have indicated, we have seen   evidence of the good news and the bad news scenario  Productivity has been very strong, and as   a result, unit labor costs are falling; holiday sales started off well; and initial unemployment   claims continue to move down  But on the negative side, private payrolls and industrial   production have declined in the last few months The election has us all thinking about changes   in fiscal policy We really don’t know exactly when those changes are likely to happen or how   large the tax cuts may be  In general, I’d assess the situation today as one where we are still   stuck in our soft spot; but, Mr Stockton, I don’t think we’re in the La Brea tar pits yet      I wanted to comment a little about my perspective on the productivity data  We’ve been   talking a lot about that in the last few months  Recently I had occasion to meet with a group of   senior corporate financial executives to discuss what they are doing to get these productivity   numbers  They made me promise not to use the term “multifactor productivity,” and they would                     December 10, 2002 64 of 87  continue to talk with me  [Laughter] I quickly went back to my CFO jargon, and we got along   fine again   What they said is that they are obviously in a profit squeeze  They really can’t raise   prices, and demand in terms of volume growth is modest  Consequently, they are focusing   particularly on expense reductions  Many felt that their companies had quite a bit of potential to   cut expenses, for several reasons  One is that in the late 1990s many of these companies made a   lot of acquisitions, aggressively getting into new product lines and opening new stores and   plants They were all so focused on the external side of supporting sales that very little was done   internally in terms of rationalizing their business processes But that is what they are doing now,   basically going through a business process redesign   I was amazed as we went around the table at the number who talked about eliminating   steps in almost all of their business processes, from billing to procurement, which has radically   reduced their infrastructure costs And because a lot of these changes don’t require much capital   investment, either in the form of software or equipment, they are getting very big paybacks on   these types of adjustments in their internal processes  They are also redesigning manufacturing   lines And they are getting very hard-nosed about finally eliminating the less efficient plants or   stores that aren’t meeting revenue expectations  Moreover, the general sense is that this cost   cutting can go on for quite a while They all felt that they weren’t running out of steam yet and   could continue to push this type of restructuring to improve the bottom line   And in their view this was really good news in terms of enhancing longer-term   productivity growth  With their cost structures rationalized, two things will happen when they   get to the point where demand is getting stronger  First, it will throw more money to the bottom   line and boost profits  More important, it will generate more free cash flow, which will allow         December 10, 2002 65 of 87  them to fund bigger investments or acquisitions when the time is right  So as financial officers   they were feeling very positive; they viewed the current period as a break of sorts that has   allowed them to look internally at ways to improve the productivity picture  And I didn’t get a   sense from any of them that they thought they were running out of ideas  In fact, they thought   these endeavors had energized everybody in their companies, and they were very positive about   the outlook for productivity for the next few quarters   I agree with you, Mr Chairman And following up on other comments,   maybe you didn’t bank your minutes, but we don’t know if you have rollover minutes for the   next time     Let me make a couple of different comments  Also because of the time, I am   not going to repeat some of the comments others have made  One of the things I found   interesting in reading these papers was Glenn’s chart on page 2, which looked at the different   rules and the actual fed funds rate  What strikes me is that the largest variances among the   different fed funds rates really occur mostly when either there is a turn or there is noise in the   data  I was in the private sector when many of these events were occurring, and I will tell you   how I read the situation—and this picks up from what Bill Poole just said  When the FOMC has   January 28-29, 2003 59 of 195    a great track record of being persistent—when we know that we’re trying to get out of a   recessionary period or we’re really fighting inflation, or whatever our direction is—the market   expects us to persevere  So we keep along those paths through both communication of the rate   changes and other public comments that we make  But just as our views sometimes differ   around the fringes in getting to a consensus on when turns happen, the views on the Street differ   as well  To the extent that that’s noise, I think that’s a different issue than the persistence of a   policy course through the cycle     The other comment that I have relates to reacting and overreacting  The market tends to   overact  I was chairman of an early asset liability management committee (ALCO), and in that   group we called the fed funds rate the administered rate because we saw it as always lagging   behind whatever else was going in the markets  With the advent of derivatives and other   hedging instruments, the one thing that most bank ALCO managers did not do was to hedge   anything to the fed funds rate  That’s because its correlation was so low compared with that of   free-moving rates like Libor or Treasury yields or other market indexes that moved more   quickly  In the periods we’re talking about—for example, in 1998—some of us can remember   that traditional hedges actually reversed on us; and instead of being negatively correlated, they   were positively correlated  The fact that the Fed was there signaling that it knew something   unusual was happening that caused the movements helped in my view to damp the overreaction   of the marketplace  So another element of our not wanting to overreact and to reverse ourselves   is that I fear it would build on the market’s own tendency to overreact and reverse on itself  So I   think it’s important for us to be persistent, to signal when unusual events are happening, and to   communicate that well  To me those are the lessons that we can take away from these papers   January 28-29, 2003 60 of 195     I have a question on page 3 also, on the bottom chart showing a decline in   US corporate debt issuance  Do those figures also include obligations involving funds raised by   corporations through securitization, or is that just straight corporate debt?      Well, that’s what I was wondering  Back to your risk aversion—to the extent   that corporate debt has gotten very expensive to issue, some companies are substituting   commercial mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, and those types of things   in lieu of straight corporate debt     January 28-29, 2003 68 of 195     Right  That was another question I had  To the extent that corporate cash   flows have gotten a little better, I wondered whether that has had an effect too    Okay    The factors underlying the momentum in the economy continue to be split, as   we’ve been saying around the table  Households continue to show optimism, and businesses   continue to find ways not to expand  Consumers bought cars for Christmas and housing starts   reached sixteen-year highs  Mortgage refinancings supplied additional cash flow for spending   and to help pay down consumer debt, which declined for the first time in years  Core consumer   price inflation is running well below 2 percent, and people are shopping for bargains  While jobs   are declining, personal income continues to grow at a modest pace  Yet business activity   continues to show signs of weakness  Industrial production has fallen in four of the last five   months; employment and production hours worked are below August levels; and inventories   have fallen in the last couple of months after expanding in the summer and early fall  There are   also long-term structural problems that are becoming more prominent given the slow expansion   January 28-29, 2003 142 of 195    that we’re going though—namely that several key industries in this economy are struggling with   excess capacity  As we look at companies’ announcements of restructuring plans, we know that   the weakness in these sectors is going to continue for quite a long time into the future   The concerns about imminent war and the unknown repercussions, such as terrorism, are   affecting financial markets, and those concerns provide another excuse for businesses not to   expand  On the other side, as others have mentioned, we know there are potential tax reductions    But even if the Congress acts, that probably won’t happen for several months, and the impact   won’t be felt until late in the year  The staff forecast is for very modest expansion in final sales   even with the expected stimulus from tax reforms  That leaves the output gap very wide  We   know when the economy is soft that it’s more vulnerable to outside shocks  Because of that I   think we need to be more vigilant in the coming weeks regarding what the uncertainties about   war could do to the economy so that we will be able and willing to respond appropriately as   events transpire    I support your recommendation     I also wanted to talk a little about the financial sector, including banks, and   contrast that with what we see happening in the real sector  The Bluebook pointed out that   commercial banks in the United States had record earnings in 2002  And they had record   March 18, 2003 64 of 101    earnings in 2001  We had back-to-back years of record earnings in the commercial banking   system during a recession period and a relatively slow recovery—a period when interest rates   have hit forty-year lows and one characterized by unusual liquidity circumstances as funds came   back into the banking system  I think one of the things we’re finding is that, while it is difficult   to operate in an environment of uncertainty, banks really have learned to manage risks well  The   asset–liability management processes that banks initiated in the 1980s and fine-tuned in the   1990s clearly show that they can go through a major interest rate cycle and as a whole improve   their earnings  Net interest margins in fact actually widened last year     On the credit side, we also saw banks managing credit very well  If we look at the 2002   numbers, the loan-loss provision as a percentage of the return on assets was basically flat   compared with the previous year  So again, banks are doing a much better job at managing   credit risks   What is also remarkable about these bank earnings is that they were achieved   through a record return on assets  It wasn’t done through financial leverage  Banks in fact   deleveraged last year, so it wasn’t a record year for return on equity  Banks achieved record   earnings through stronger fundamentals as well as better risk management     If we look at the broader financial markets, especially since our last meeting, we see that   some of the volatility and excessive credit spreads we’ve observed in the last year or so have   continued to improve  As was mentioned earlier, while debt spreads are wider than historically,   the spreads have moved in  Much like what we’re hearing from bank credit officers, the credit   market folks are also saying that to some extent the uncertainty part of the debt spreads has been   removed  What upset everybody at the end of 2001 and 2002 was that prime credits were going   immediately to bankruptcy and that was happening because of what I love to call “operational   risks”  Credit was not the real issue  These bankruptcies were due to accounting scandals and   March 18, 2003 65 of 101    management fraud  Companies that deteriorated over time, like K-Mart, were handled in the   traditional way  But it was the uncertainty about what was going on with regard to these other   factors that contributed to the widening of debt spreads in the investment-grade market  That   seems to be coming down now, since we haven’t had any material events of that type in the last   several months   Companies are restructuring  We know they’ve lengthened from commercial paper to   longer-term debt  Their corporate cash flow has also been improving, unfortunately in part   because they are not making capital investments  Consumers continue to refinance and   restructure their debt  The staff has shown us that household debt service is actually down from   where it was a couple of years ago  So household finances are in good shape  If the banking   sector, corporate balance sheets, household finances, and debt markets are stronger—and equity   markets we know at least have shifted to neutral—what really is happening?  Again we get a   “disconnect” between the improvement of the financial sector and the weakness in the real   sector    After our FOMC meeting in January I was optimistic, as the news continued to be very,   very strong  Then as the February data came out, as many of you have remarked already,   suddenly we began to question what was happening  Was it the snowstorms?  After all, even an   old Southerner like myself actually had to go out and buy a pair of boots!  I thought that would   have helped the retail sales in February, but it didn’t!  High heating oil and natural gas costs also   took a toll on people’s spending  But as we’ve talked about, the uncertainty regarding what is   going on in Iraq and maybe other countries appears to be preying both on consumers and   businesses  Because it is very hard to evaluate risks and to make decisions in a period of high   uncertainty, the decisionmaking that affects real economic activity and creates jobs and growth   March 18, 2003 66 of 101    in our resources has slowed to almost a halt  So until we really know more about the situation in   Iraq, I’m not sure what we can do to deal with the uncertainty through monetary policy  The   concerns involve not only the war but also, as many of you have mentioned already, the   aftermath of the war  Unlike the situation in Kuwait, we are not going to be reinstalling the   government; we have to help create a successor government  Therefore, I think the uncertainty   is going to continue for some time  Because of the nature of the uncertainty, I’m uncomfortable   making any change right now in the direction of policy  Thank you    I support your recommendation     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have just a couple of comments  We’re at the   beginning of the earnings season, and so far it looks as if corporate earnings are coming in at the   expected levels, even though they are lower than what was expected at the beginning of the   quarter  I had a conversation with a consultant who helps companies develop business in China,   April 16, 2003 24 of 47    and she said that when the news of SARS came out, several of her clients actually went into   crisis-management mode  They started contacting the CDC and other health services to   determine if the virus could be transmitted in the containers used for exports out of China into   the United States  These companies were concerned that they would be selling contaminated   products  At this point the CDC is saying that SARS can’t be transmitted in a dry environment;   it needs moisture  But that issue was a concern for several days and it did affect some   companies They are continuing to monitor the situation as the medical community looks at how   the disease can be transmitted  She also commented that, if SARS is a short-run problem, it   shouldn’t have material effects but that we may see some effects if the problem goes on for   several months  That’s because the development of new investments really requires face-to-face   contact in China and many firms are deferring trips that they would need to make to get new   products or projects initiated  So SARS is something that her clients are very concerned about,   and they won’t know to what extent it will affect their business until they fully understand the   risks going forward     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In preparing for this meeting I started out looking   at previous forecasts, as President Minehan and Governor Ferguson did  I noted that we’ve had,   for the past three years now, a forecast that the economy will get better in the second half of the   year  We missed it the first time in 2001 because of a terrorist attack and the second time in   2002 because of corporate governance scandals  I don’t know if I’m optimistic or pessimistic   about it happening a third time, but I could hope that the new chairman of the Public Company   Accounting Oversight Board might have some effect on the risk of that    Yes, the brilliant new chairman!  I am concerned, though, that we’re starting   out this year in a soft spot, unlike the last two years when we had stronger growth in the first half   of the year  Hours worked are continuing to decline in this soft period, employment is falling,   and production in the manufacturing sector in particular is showing significant weakness  The   main impetus for the recession was the weakness in business fixed investment, and the forecast   for BFI has again been revised downward in the Greenbook for this meeting     I agree with some of the comments that have already been made around the table that,   while corporations are cautious, they haven’t been inactive  We’ve seen significant   improvements in inventory control, advances in productivity, and increased liquidity as firms   have moved to longer-term funding and as cash flows have risen because of improving profit   margins  But as I look at this picture, I’m still relatively pessimistic as to what is going to   happen to spark business confidence again  So I tend to believe that the risks are biased toward   weakness, especially given that I accept the forecast that economic growth will be below   potential even beyond the 2004 forecast horizon     May 6, 2003 67 of 115    What about the outlook on the inflation front?  As several people have already remarked,   the Greenbook assessment that the probability of deflation by the end of next year is 35 percent   clearly is a statement that catches one’s attention  Further, I know that the staff has been doing   work on the confidence intervals for various measures of inflation and the measurement bias    That work shows all three major inflation measures at the top of the confidence band of about   1 percent by the end of next year  This concerns me  We don’t need to see deflation because   disinflation—getting the inflation rate down to 1 percent—is a significant enough issue   There has been a lot of talk that businesses don’t have the confidence to invest because of   concerns raised by governance issues  I think the lack of confidence relates to the continuing   outlook for very weak pricing power  Business management tries to commit to the marketplace   that their company will show earnings growth  They commit to that by expecting some type of   top line revenue growth  But we’re sitting here expecting economic growth over the forecast   period to be below potential, with inflation at 1 percent  That means that if a corporation makes   a serious commitment to growth, they have a very small margin of error  When cash flow from   top line growth provides a robust level of new incoming revenue, companies are more able to   take the risk of investing in new business lines and new plant openings  But with an outlook for   continued sluggish economic growth and overall inflation at 1 percent or less, in effect we   confront a disinflation risk world that at some point cumulatively slows growth going forward    Therefore, I support the comments that President Santomero made about the importance of   averting a disinflation psychology in the period ahead   So I’m concerned that we have risks on both fronts right now—the risk of real growth   below potential for quite a long time and also a risk of further disinflation that is considerably   stronger now than we would like  I don’t think I can identify a bias or say that the risks are   May 6, 2003 68 of 115    balanced or unbalanced  In my view we don’t have a Phillips curve situation  I think we have   two negatives facing us    I can support the statement  I like the fact that we’ve broken out the two   risks explicitly in this  I could have voted for a reduction in the funds rate target today because   I’m looking at how much the market has moved the fed funds futures rates since our last   meeting  The market is pricing in a rate cut; it’s just a matter of when  So having been on the   other side for a while, I’m inclined to believe that the market would not have been all that upset   by an easing action today  But I will go along with the recommendation that we wait to see how   future information develops  I look forward to the discussion at the next meeting  As I indicated   earlier, I’d like to see us think through what our strategy should be and what signals we want to   send as we move into this lower inflation world that we haven’t experienced for a long time  I   think it will help us to further improve our communication if we have considered carefully our   long-term plan to get through this low inflation period  Then we can do another plastic surgery   on this swan     I, too, am going to echo some of the comments of others, but I have a couple   of points I’d like to make  One is that, while I’m not so worried about the money market funds,   say, I am concerned—putting on my supervisory hat—that we’re telling everybody to make sure   they understand their credit exposures  At some point, interest rates could get so low that they   June 24-25, 2003 47 of 211    don’t cover credit risks  Anecdotally I know of some banks that already have put floors on   floating rate loans just to make sure that the rates on such loans don’t get too low  That does   raise issues about what will happen in a very low rate environment  I don’t know what the magic   number is for the funds rate—if it’s 75 basis points or 15 basis points—but at some point there   could be an impact on credit extensions  Lenders might be willing to continue lending for a short   time, but if they don’t see a takeout in the longer term where rates are coming back up, there   could be some reluctance to lend because of questions about covering credit risks That’s   especially the case if we encourage them, as we move forward, to do a better job at credit risk   management   For those reasons and others, I am also concerned that as we move lower on the funds   rate—again, I don’t know what the magic number is—we won’t really be able to operate on   interest rates because there won’t be that much further to go  So I would like to look more at   some of the quantitative options that are out there  I found interesting some of the alternatives in   these wonderful papers—I learned so much reading them—and partly just academically I want to   understand more about these issues  I’d like to know, for example, if there are limits on how   much of a particular maturity we should own  At what point does the size of our holdings affect   market liquidity?  Or do we want to own all issues of a given maturity so we really can peg the   rate?  What is the framework in which we want to make that decision?  I’d like to have an idea of   how much of different maturities we would have to own to have an effect if we wanted to ease   quantitatively  I have no idea on that   The other idea I found interesting is selling put options on Treasury securities  Cynically,   this could be the salvation for everybody who hedges mortgage securities with long Treasuries    We may be the counterparty of choice  I would like to understand that because the options   June 24-25, 2003 48 of 211    market is not very deep and I’d like to see how deep it is  If we went that way, how much room   would we really have to inject a quantity of liquidity?  Or is the scope relatively limited so that   we’d have to build a market?  So, I think it would be useful to explore further some of these   issues that deal with liquidity and the options we have if we want to go the quantitative route     I also agree that we can do a lot in terms of managing expectations just by what we put in   our releases and say in our public comments  That is something I think this institution has   always done, so clearly we can do that  But I am interested in understanding more about the   implications of easing by means of quantitative targeting    When I came into this meeting, I had feelings similar to those that President   Guynn expressed  In getting ready for today’s meeting, I looked back at my notes on the last   couple of meetings and found that we were always on the verge of a rebound in economic   activity  Obviously the war erupted and created another discontinuity in this expansion  I’ll use   President Guynn’s “Ground Hog Day” movie analogy to say that what is missing is obviously   business capital expenditures  I hope, like the hero in “Ground Hog Day,” that CEOs will begin   to get the message and start focusing externally instead of internally  If we can make that   happen, maybe we will have a happy ending as the movie did     I’ve been spending a lot of time looking at the data on the business sector  While I’m not   going to go through the points that Steve made earlier, I thought his analysis was excellent in   terms of describing the status of the business expansion  The new numbers on nondefense   durable goods orders this morning may be a sign that we are at the point where there’s a glimmer   of hope that we are past the discontinuity associated with the war  On the other hand, we’re not   really seeing evidence of a robust movement ahead, and that does concern me  The European   Central Bank has just lowered its forecast of growth in the euro area  And as Karen pointed out,   our staff has reduced its expectations for growth internationally over the rest of this year  This   suggests that we’re not going to get a lot of support from the foreign sector  I am starting to see   some glimmers of hope in the employment statistics  Employment is still very weak, but private   June 24-25, 2003 125 of 211    payrolls look as if they are beginning to stabilize  At least they’re not falling off as they were   earlier in the year     I’m not as optimistic as the staff regarding the outlook for 2004  My forecast is at the   bottom of the range of those that we on the FOMC submitted  It concerns me, when I look   further out on the forecast horizon, that the output gap is sustained to 2005  Given where we are   on inflation measures, I’m not so worried about deflation  I am concerned about persistent   disinflation because it’s still not clear to me how our banking sector and other sectors that have   moved more toward risk-based pricing of credits are going to work through this  So I’m worried   about being in a consistently low inflation environment and what that might do to our financial   sector  Remember, the last time we were in this type of situation we had Regulation Q, which   prohibited the payment of interest on a lot of the deposits in the banking sector  Because of the   persistent output gap and these other considerations, I don’t see much downside risk to trying to   encourage this expansion that may be getting under way and kick it up another notch  So, I’m   leaning toward the view that we ought to go ahead and take out a little insurance at this meeting    Maybe this is going to have to wait until your discussion of communication    One of the other things I struggled with as I read the Bluebook wording— and I see it again in   exhibit 5 in the bottom left box—is the part about inflation risks being on the downside  As   worried as I am about disinflation, which I see as a significant risk, I am not worried about   inflation down the road  If inflation were around 3 percent, we’d be worried about the risk of a   rise in inflation  Risk to me always implies something about what could be the worst outcome   rather than direction  Given where we are now with regard to inflation, I’m wondering if we   should imply concern about inflation’s moving in one direction only rather than the risk of its   going up or down  Getting back to Governor Bernanke’s comments, how we communicate our   views on inflation is important  Because we’re in such an unusual situation, I think directional   words might be better than the word “risk”    Mr Chairman, I can support your recommendation  Like several others, I   was torn between 25 and 50 basis points  But as you put it very well, we have a huge stimulus   coming with the tax package that’s about to take effect, and in accordance with traditional   economic theory, that should provide the impetus to get the economic growth that is projected in   the Greenbook  For that reason I’m more comfortable with a cut of 25 rather than 50 basis   points right now   I do support President Moskow’s direction of thinking regarding how we talk about   things  At this moment, in a world where CEOs and everybody else are worried about risks,   even to imply that the opportunity for growth of 4 or 5 percent is seen as a risk seems not to be   the best choice of words  We might want to find better words to convey our message in a way   that will encourage what we see as the growth necessary to get economic performance up to   potential and to use all of our excess capacity and human resources  I think it’s time that we look   at this and try to address some of the comments that Governor Bernanke made     Could you talk a little about the fails that have been happening?  How have   dealers been able to react when there has been a fail so that it hasn’t disrupted the liquidity in the   marketplace or added to the volatility?   August 12, 2003 9 of 110     No, fails always worry me when they reach that magnitude  I worry what   that does to the day-to-day functioning of the dealers    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m going to focus on a couple of issues that   Governor Bernanke just discussed and that many of you have mentioned, too—namely,   August 12, 2003 65 of 110    communicating our policy and our views about the issues facing us today  I want to talk about   this from the point of view of the two dictates in our mission statement, potential growth in the   economy and inflation  One of the things I find striking in my conversations with people who   participate in the bond markets is the difference in our perceptions regarding where we are in this   particular recovery  As several people mentioned earlier, the market tends to believe that, when   the recovery begins, the Fed is going to take away the punch bowl and start tightening interest   rates right away  Most of us have really been engaged in this profession—old as we are—only   when the Federal Reserve has been trying to fight inflation  That has been the System’s focus   since the ’70s  What is unusual here is that the economy has emerged from a long-term secular   problem of exceedingly high inflation, and now the rate of inflation is within or near the range   we might want to set for a long-term inflation target  As a result we’re not trying to achieve a   secular decline in inflation, we’re focusing more on the cyclical aspects of it  I don’t believe the   Street is really differentiating these two issues   A second issue—and one of the reasons that inflation is so low—is that productivity   growth is significantly above what any of us has seen  In fact, the productivity numbers that just   came out are high even for the early stages of a business recovery  If we believe that   productivity will stay somewhere above its long-term trend, the pickup in inflation that we   normally would see is not likely to occur  While we hope that inflation will go up from where it   is currently, in the Greenbook forecast inflation remains significantly below what many of us   find comfortable  I certainly am uncomfortable when I see inflation forecasts of less than   1 percent   The other issue I see, as I look at the risks to the forecast, is addressed in the alternative   scenario in the Greenbook that is called “prolonged subpar investment”  That is the root cause of   August 12, 2003 66 of 110    this recession to begin with  The slowdown in business fixed investment created the recession; it   was not consumer-driven  If business investment doesn’t pick up as we’re expecting, the output   gap will get wider, and inflation will continue to drift lower  While capital expenditures have   increased at some companies, we’re still not hearing very robust plans for capital expenditures as   companies have released their earnings reports  I think most people around the table today have   been hearing mixed reports about capital spending intentions    So I share the doubts expressed about how businesses are going to survive in a world   with continuing low inflation, which limits pricing power  I’m not sure how they can achieve the   earnings growth for the next five years that we still see in the S&P numbers and other earnings   forecasts  What’s going to give?  Well, they are going to have to resume capital expenditures in   order to achieve that growth and continue to get an extraordinarily high pace of growth in   productivity  Alternatively, without the capital deepening, we will continue to see what has been   going on over the last couple of years—more reorganizations, the shutting down of plants, and   the restructuring of product lines     So in summary, I’m concerned about the strength of capital expenditures relative to the   staff forecast, and I see that as one of the biggest risks going forward  In terms of our   communications, I would love to find some way—maybe we can talk about this in September—  to make people understand that we are now in a different mode for the long term with regard to   both inflation and productivity  As a result, the output gap will be large for a while even if   economic growth is high in the short run  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation, and I, too, look forward to   our September discussion on communications    Mr Chairman, I’m sort of split on the last sentence  I think the final sentence   in the second paragraph on pricing power is a really good addition, and I like that a lot  A part of   the last sentence that troubles me is the phrase “without ultimately stoking inflationary   pressures,” which we haven’t talked about  That phrase makes me uncomfortable  In light of   your admonition to be humble, to say that we can maintain an accommodative stance “for a   considerable period without ultimately   ” sounds like an extreme position  I would suggest   that we might want to end the sentence by putting the period after the word “period”     Let me make just a couple of comments  Some of these points have been   covered, but I want to highlight the ones that hit me rather hard as I thought about them  First,   when I think about what has happened with regard to our communications over the last couple of   months, I think part of the problem was that we were in uncharted waters  We hadn’t had   inflation rates so low  We hadn’t had wars or the possibility of war intervening with the   economic process for some time  So as we sat around this table, we had a lot of Knightian   uncertainty  But as we heard today, one can learn  As people learned about what the Fed was   likely to do, the market adapted  Whatever we come out with on communication policy, I think   we have to realize that in times like we’ve just been through we’re probably going to have to get   out of the box we’ve put ourselves into  Such times demand a different type of communication    When the market sees things that aren’t normal, we may need to use something other than our   standard type of communication    September 15, 2003 61 of 78    I have become very uncomfortable with moving in the direction of giving a forecast, a   point some of you have also made  I really think we need to talk about where we are at the   moment that we come to our decision—that’s the important point—without going any further   with any kind of commitment in any sense of the term  For that reason, I think we should move   up the publication of the minutes  The reason I come to that conclusion relates to what Cathy   talked about, that some of us go out and give speeches between meetings  What do market   observers do? They read the words of the people around this table who happen to give speeches   on the economy and from them try to divine what the Committee as a whole is thinking      So the market’s interpretation is based on words from a selected number of   those around the table who happen to have speaking engagements and talk about the economic   situation To me the minutes give a better representation of the diversity of views as well as the   consensus and lay out why those who had different views felt the way they did  I think that   before the minutes are released the market is not getting a full representation of how we got to   the consensus and how dominant that consensus may have been   So I would prefer moving up   the minutes  I also agree with some comments that were just made about the language  I would   like to see us move to standard wording  But I also would like us to think hard about putting it in   plain English  In other words, for economic growth, say, to indicate that we see it accelerating   but we still see a large gap in unused resources in the economy      Well, it’s what we see today  It reflects how we got to our conclusion   regarding policy  I’d prefer that, rather than to say that the risks are up or the risks are down—  which I think can be read in many different ways depending on where the economy happens to   September 15, 2003 62 of 78    be  It’s the first difference both in inflation and growth rates, and with inflation of 1 percent and   going up or inflation of 1 percent and going into disinflation, we’d get very different reactions    So as we think about standard words, we need to consider the different sides  If our wording   were more in plain English, that might take care of the last sentence because capacity issues and   other developments we see in the economy would be tied together  Maybe that would get us out   of that awkward final sentence  I still have trouble with that last sentence    Right    Well, it’s going to be very difficult  But the lesson I took from the last few   months is that using the standard risk-assessment language in times like this, when we’re going   through a turn in the direction of the economy, sends confusing signals    Well, that’s why I agreed with the suggestion that was made earlier about   trying to test any proposed language under different circumstances   Yes, I think we have to do that    Okay  Those are the main comments I had     But I rather like President Moskow’s approach that we should be reassessing   our communication policy as part of our normal procedures  That’s what I read in his suggested   wording  We talked about a wide range of possibilities last night, and we may not come out with   all the changes at once  I like that approach    I have a question about your comments on borrowing at the window during   the blackout and the one institution that didn’t want to come to the window  Do you have a   sense that we learned anything in terms of communicating to banks about the window?  Are you   comfortable that our system worked as planned?    Thank you  Let me start by adding to what Mr Stockton and several others   have said about the forecast in the Greenbook compared with the forecasts in the private sector    As I looked at the components of the forecasts, I focused again on productivity  I must say that   the more I talk to business people, the more I really believe that we are at a sea change in   productivity, so I’m very comfortable with the Greenbook forecast  Not to duplicate the   comments of others, I would like to talk in particular about one aspect of the current situation    My remarks may be similar to what Governor Ferguson mentioned earlier about inventory   management, but they may give a little different perspective based on what I’m hearing from   some of my business contacts  Obviously, the pessimism about earnings growth among CEOs   September 16, 2003 70 of 106    and business people generally stems from their concern about the inability to raise prices in order   to increase revenues  They still feel very constrained in that regard because of excess capacity   and the competitive environment that have caused them to really focus on costs  So   reengineering work processes and using resources more effectively than before are concepts that   continue to drive business decisions and, from what I’m hearing as businesses plan their budgets   and strategy for next year, that will continue in 2004     We’ve talked a bit about how much inventory–sales ratios have dropped  One of the   comments I heard from several folks I talk to in service industries relates to the way we measure   inventories  We look at the ratio of inventories to sales, which tends to involve the   manufacturing, wholesale, and retail parts of the distribution process  But we really don’t have   good data on the inventories that sit inside service companies, which is where the majority of the   workers are and where most of our production and income growth is generated in this country     Many service companies have just gotten around in the last couple of years to developing   the same kinds of procurement policies that the manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers have   been using since the ’90s  My contacts point out that, in the old days, individual departments all   had big supply cabinets or supply rooms, and each department ordered its own supplies and   tended to have on hand an excess supply of everything from fax machines to servers to paper and   everything else  What has happened—and according to my contacts it’s one of the reasons   businesses have been buying fewer supplies—is that, in their reengineering efforts, large   corporations have been centralizing procurement  Office Depot has become their supply cabinet,   and basically firms are making do with less  Another change, in terms of equipment, is that   many companies no longer have backup forklifts and other equipment sitting around; they wait   and get the equipment when they need it  There’s no way to measure this but companies say that                                                                                                                                                                 2 Chairman Greenspan briefly left the room, and Mr Ferguson was acting Chairman at this point   September 16, 2003 71 of 106    inventories within service businesses also have been decreasing and are still being worked down   as a way to improve efficiency  The fewer times they now have to handle items in inventory   creates big efficiencies in their cost structures, too   Let me shift to the second point I want to talk about, which is the employment picture    My comments may reflect my naturally optimistic viewpoint in trying to find something good in   these dismal employment numbers that we’re seeing  I’ve talked to some people in leadership   roles in the NFIB, the small business group, and one of the things they’re focused on is the   continuing dichotomy between the establishment data and the household data on employment    As we know, the two series have diverged for a long time  But as my contacts pointed out to me,   a lot more time, energy, and people are being employed in sole proprietorships than previously    In fact, as shown in a Greenbook chart, the latest monthly survey shows that hiring plans of   small businesses—bearing in mind that it’s a very recent time series—are back to the levels   recorded in the mid-1990s expansion  As these outside contacts like to remind me, most new   jobs are created by small businesses  So for the first time in several years they are optimistic that   small businesses are going to be the source of growth, while the structural kinds of layoffs we’re   seeing in big businesses will be a drag  In any event, they are seeing some signs that small   businesses are beginning to grow and to hire people other than family members—who work   extraordinarily long hours—and there is some optimism that real employment gains will be   occurring in that sector going forward    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation to keep the fed   funds target rate at 1 percent  At this time I still am quite concerned about the downside risk on   inflation, mainly because of the forecast in the Greenbook and my belief that the productivity   story is still being written  However, like others who have just commented, I would prefer to   leave the last sentence of the statement as it was last time  In that last sentence, I think we’re   trying to say why we want to remain accommodative  But the sentence before, which relates to   the balance of risks, says it already  It states that the predominant concern continues to be the   risk of inflation becoming undesirably low  So, I don’t think we need to say it again at the end of   the next sentence  Again, I’m just worried about changing too many words  I could accept this   language but since the sentence is rather awkward I’d really prefer to leave the wording as it was       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I wanted to make one comment on current   conditions and then talk a bit more about the longer-run part of the Greenbook forecast  I was   struck as I looked at the Greenbook forecast about where we are with regard to business   investment in this expansion and by some of the information on capital spending that we’re   getting from various business surveys, much of which is included in the Greenbook materials    We’ve already noted that corporate cash flow is very strong and that we’re beginning to see   some firming up of business investment  But the responses to the qualitative questions that are   asked in surveys clearly show that businesses are reluctant to expand  Nevertheless, I think there   is a tone that says we’re seeing a floor here; we’re beginning to get out of this slump in   investment  That slump was the root of this business slowdown and, as Governor Olson was just   mentioning, the words are starting to turn positive  But the vigor of corporate expansion has yet   to take hold  I think the recent information shows again that we clearly have a way to go    It worries me when I look at how much stop and go we’ve had in the economy in the last   two years  The Greenbook forecast is assuming that there are no real shocks coming  We’ve   had a number of shocks in the past few years  Last year business inventories grew, but then we   had the shock of a war in the spring  There have been so many starts and stops in this recovery   that it may take a little longer to prove that there is some stability out there and to get businesses   into an expansion mode versus just a replacement mode  Clearly their financial strength is   extraordinary  The corporate cash flow and earnings numbers coming out this quarter all look   very, very strong   October 28, 2003 69 of 126    In thinking about the longer-term forecast and where we are heading, I was struck, too,   by the wonderful optimism in the Greenbook forecast compared with some of the outside   forecasts  I just want to comment on two aspects of this that I’m still sorting through in my own   mind  One is that we’ve had an extraordinary run in productivity over the last few quarters  Yet   when we look forward, productivity growth for the last six quarters of the Greenbook forecast   falls below the recent numbers  I understand that a big part of the productivity performance is   cyclical  But the projected drop in productivity growth is coming right when the economy is   really picking up  So we have this tension in the forecast, I think, where we see employment   growing—extraordinary job growth—and productivity slowing  Yet we still have inflation   trending down until the tail end of the forecast period  In the Street, as market observers talk   about expectations—and it’s a factor in our communication policy—they say that once   employment starts expanding, inflation is going to pick up  That is going to be one of the   challenges we face if we believe in the Greenbook forecast  In fact, of all the alternative   scenarios, there’s only one that results in an inflation rate that’s within hailing distance of   2 percent  And that’s due only to the fact that people’s inflation expectations are higher than   actual inflation  Basically in this forecast, depending on the inflation measure, we will have had   four or five years of inflation numbers that start with a 1 or below, which would be an   extraordinary period of low inflation  That psychology is not what most observers have in their   mindset, nor is it part of the business recovery models that we see in the marketplace  So we   need to think about how we talk about these issues going forward    I support your recommendation     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our last meeting the news about economic   growth, as many people around the table have already said, is much stronger  One point I’d note   is that I’m very happy to see that growth is more balanced in terms of coming from more   sources  It is no longer relying totally on consumer spending; business capital investment has   resumed  We continue to be amazed that inventories are still falling, which leaves room for   further expansion as inventories get rebuilt to supply sales growth  Moreover, the international   economy is picking up and should support some modest expansion of exports  As business   spending continues to grow, more workers will also be added to payrolls  That will support   consumption and to some extent offset the lower impetus from tax cuts and mortgage refinancing   in the future     When I look at the risk with regard to economic growth—if the risk is assessed just on   the growth rate—I’d say the risk is on the upside  However, if we look at the economy’s   performance relative to the level of potential output, the gap is significant  As many people have   already mentioned, the estimate of the output gap is very hard to come by  In the Greenbook   forecast we see that unemployment continues to run relatively high, and we’re assuming   5 percent as full employment from a NAIRU perspective  However, as Dave Stockton already   mentioned, the standard deviation is 1 percentage point on this unemployment rate  Many of us   remember that in the late ’90s unemployment got well below 5 percent without any inflation   pressures     After talking to human resource executives at several corporations about the way they   manage people today, I also am optimistic that wage pressures will continue to be more muted   than they might have been in the past  Businesses today have much more flexibility in the way   December 9, 2003 82 of 133    they manage human resources  Management tends to compensate people more through the use   of incentive pay so that employees earn more money either as productivity targets are met or as   revenue comes in through sales commissions  Businesses accept the practice of outsourcing and   contract employment so that functions that are not core to the organization are now contracted   out to other organizations that have much more productivity and effectiveness in handling those   particular functions and can do the work at a much lower cost  Companies continually look   throughout the organization for such opportunities whether sales are up or down  Improvements   in technology now allow services and businesses to be supplied by accessing labor resources   internationally so that we’re no longer confined to US workers even for services  All these   mitigating factors lead me, looking forward, not to be so concerned about the impact of   compensation as a force to drive up inflation in the short run     The exceptionally large jump in productivity that we saw in the third quarter is not likely   to be sustained, especially as growing business confidence leads to new hiring  However,   because of the factors above, I think the pace of productivity growth may well continue to run   above historically high levels  Like Governor Ferguson, I believe that productivity growth may   not slow as much as in the Greenbook baseline forecast  Corporate profits in the third quarter   were significantly higher than they have been recently  In fact, the profits were back to levels   recorded in quarters of the boom years  Interestingly, the consensus forecast for corporate profits   for all of 2003 is running at twice the level that was expected at the beginning of this year   What about inflation?  Inflation does appear to be turning up, but it remains at very low   levels  The Greenbook continues to forecast that core inflation will be in the low 1 percent range   for the next two years  Nevertheless, as Dave commented in response to President Pianalto’s   question, the probability of inflation getting into that dangerous zone of under ½ percent is still   December 9, 2003 83 of 133    running at 1 in 4, which I consider to be a significant risk of unwelcome inflation with   substantial costs to the economy     The markets and private economists have different forecasts from the one in the   Greenbook  The outside forecasts tend to have much lower growth and much higher inflation    But it’s interesting to compare today’s Blue Chip forecast for 2004 with the Blue Chip consensus   at the beginning of the year  The projection for real GDP growth has moved up 80 basis points,   and the expectations for inflation have moved down 40 basis points—closer to what the   Greenbook is showing for 2004      Mr Chairman, while I’m still uncomfortable with a policy commitment in   the proposed wording, I feel much better with the introductory phrase “with inflation quite low   and resource use slack,” which makes it a conditional statement  I also like dropping the   language that wraps up our assessment of the balance of risks  I think doing that helps  So I’ll   support your recommendation    Let me make a couple of comments  I would hope, as we make the decision   on the statement, that we have the staff’s input on the issue of moving up the publication of the   minutes  I say that because I am very concerned about making the press statement the dominant   issue  When people read the minutes, they do have a chance to see the variety of viewpoints   expressed at that particular meeting  Just as we did today, we got around to a consensus  Some   December 9, 2003 111 of 133    of us are willing to bend or some get to the same answer from a different place, and I think the   minutes reflect that more clearly  I worry that this statement may get very, very long, and I like   the idea of keeping the press release cleaner and simpler  So I’m looking forward to seeing what   practically can be done from the minutes perspective   Second, I personally am very reluctant to go down the path of giving frequent forecasts or   making commitments  To my mind that presumes that we’re more omniscient about what is   going to occur in the future than I think we are  It also raises questions of what to do when   confronted with a situation such as we had in the spring with the Iraqi war, when we couldn’t   even assess the near-term much less the longer-term outlook  Presidential elections come up,   and a lot of other things happen  I’m very concerned about trying to give a forecast of the   outlook at each regular meeting  Now, we might want to think about how the Chairman   communicates to the Congress twice a year in his testimony on monetary policy; we can do that   separately  But to routinely try to do a forecast at every six-week interval I find very   problematic  I also want to say that I do like the stress-testing idea  One of the things that we   found out is that the relationship between falling inflation and economic growth—the Phillips   curve kind of tradeoff—got a bit out of whack this year  So I like the notion of stress testing   these various alternatives     Like several others, I found the efforts of the working group very helpful in   terms of laying out the issues we’ve been talking about at the last several meetings and putting   them all together in one place  I also thought that, if I went through all the formulas and the   various scenarios, one of them would really appeal to me  I did go through them, and I must say   that, while I like the levels B alternative in principle, I didn’t like the answer it came out with in   some of the scenarios  That led me to the view that a formula isn’t going to work for us  To my   mind, what we have to talk about in our statement is what we believe is the most important issue    In the little over two years that I’ve been on this Committee we’ve faced a lot of volatility in that   we’ve had to deal with a number of unforeseen events  So if nothing else we need flexibility   because financial stability is one of our objectives, though we usually don’t talk about that   explicitly  But we are seen as one of the forces that keeps the market stable in part because we   have a reputation for integrity, which I think is very important   January 27-28, 2004 34 of 238    Let me make just a couple of general comments  One, I like the idea of eliminating   words like “risk” that may have different connotations to the public  I say that as a former risk   manager  I also like the idea of a little ambiguity in some of the alternatives we’ve discussed   because around this table we all come at the policy decision from different points of view  And   we know that in economics there are alternative paths to achieving our objectives going forward    So I’m not troubled by some ambiguity in the statements that we issue  Also, while the idea of   setting benchmarks has been discussed, as we start to move toward defining those benchmarks, I   think we’ll find that our different points of view will become more of an issue  Some of the   alternative wording proposed I found very troubling because I don’t know if we can come to a   consensus on what the benchmarks are     As I thought through where we’ve had communication issues—particularly in the last   few months—one of the things that struck me is that we actually have described very well the   data that drove us to the decision we took at each meeting  As a few people have suggested with   regard to fitting in the conclusion of the risk statement, maybe we could do a better job by   adding an extra phrase or words about the incoming data  Maybe we could characterize   economic growth in terms of the output gap or better describe the risks of inflation rather than   adhere to a fixed formula that is so rigid that it doesn’t allow us the flexibility to respond to   unusual developments While I don’t want to see a statement that goes on page after page, I’d   almost prefer to drop the part of the risk assessment about the output gap and inflation and add a   few well chosen words to describe the incoming data that drove us to our action  I think that   actually would make the statement more concise and clear, and perhaps it would deal better with   the ambiguity that was pointed out in some of the scenarios under the various alternatives    Thank you, Governor Ferguson  I’m going to come out on the side of   supporting earlier release of the minutes  Let me tell you why  In response to the comment that   the early release of the minutes would be another news event and could move the market, I’d   point out that we are out giving speeches all the time  Our public statements all have the   potential to move markets on occasion, and in fact it has happened  To my mind we’re better off   releasing the minutes  At least then there’s a balanced approach, with the diversity of views   presented at one time rather than the views that get press attention being dependent on whose   speaking engagements come where on the calendar  So I think that the earlier publication of the   minutes would diminish the news events  It would help put into context when a Bank President   or Governor is speaking where their views are in the continuum of views expressed at the   meeting that had just occurred  I believe it actually would help lessen the “news” impact   compared with the reaction to our speeches  I also don’t want to extend the blackout period   because I think our public appearances are a critical way for us to communicate between   meetings  We can communicate when economic conditions have changed from those that led to   the decision we made at a meeting; new data may get us moving in a different way  So I would   hate to extend the blackout period   Let me comment on one of the alternatives regarding how to handle the approval of the   minutes—whether we should do that as a subcommittee or not  I strongly disagree with the   subcommittee approach  I think all of us need to be involved because these are our minutes and   January 27-28, 2004 57 of 238    they are very important  I would feel very uncomfortable having a subcommittee perform that   function  I also would like to see us go ahead and do the dry runs where all of us have to make   sure we schedule time to read and comment on the minutes  Given that we couldn’t pull back   from the release date—but we could always release them earlier—I would suggest that, if we do   go forward, we release the minutes with a relatively long window for the drafting and approval   process  If we get better and faster at it, we can move up the publication date, but we can’t go   the other way  So I would leave us some room and start with a longer period initially    Thank you, Governor Ferguson  I support the Chairman in the sense that I   really don’t want to do any more forecasting  In fact, I would rather make all of our twice-a-year   forecasts rolling ones and revise them for four quarters ahead only  I’d prefer not to go past a   one-year horizon because I tend not to have much wisdom about the outlook beyond that     But another point—and I’m going back to the idea of focusing on risk rather than the   forecast—is that the minutes issue is relevant here  I think releasing the minutes earlier is   important because it’s the one place that conveys the discussions we have around the table about   mitigating the risks of the different forecasts we have  Over the past year, for example, while we   didn’t forecast deflation, we certainly had quite a bit of discussion about the vulnerability of the   January 27-28, 2004 80 of 238    forecast in that regard  At least I personally was struck by the fact that it wasn’t out of the realm   of probability that we could be faced with such severe issues  And I think our views about those   risks come out more in the minutes than in any forecast we could put together  I feel that we do   a better job describing the outlook and our concerns in the minutes than in our forecasts  So I’d   emphasize the minutes rather than the projections for that reason    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My comments coming at the end of our go-  around are going to be repetitive of some of the views expressed earlier  So let me just   summarize my views  First, I agree with many of the comments around the table that this   recovery has moved into a new phase  We’ve moved from the stage of the business cycle where   the economy was driven mainly by the consumer to one where business is now doing its share in   fostering the expansion  Having more-balanced growth going forward gives me much more   confidence that this recovery has legs, and I want to focus my comments on the business side   today   We all know that this was a unique kind of cycle because it was driven more by the   business side than the consumer side  While consumer spending continued to grow through the   whole recession, business fixed investment and inventory investment both fell and were the   major engines for the slowdown that we saw  On the inventory side, we have now gone from a   period, including the first three quarters of 2003, of falling inventories to a period where we   expect inventories to have grown in the fourth quarter of last year and our forecast has strong   inventory growth going forward  We’re beginning to see in surveys that businesses are   becoming more comfortable with inventory levels  Now, I fully expect that inventory–sales   ratios will continue to push the envelope lower, as business firms continue to improve the   procurement and management of their resources  But I think businesses are beginning to express   some confidence that sales levels are sustainable and companies are at least beginning to increase   inventories to support the level of sales that they see coming   On the capital spending side, equipment and software expenditures also have turned   around in this last period  Again, in the early part of this recession, we saw consumer spending   outpacing equipment and software spending  But in the second half of 2003, we began to see a   January 27-28, 2004 165 of 238    pickup in the pace of the latter  There was some growth in that sector in the second half of 2002,   but it really wasn’t until after the Iraqi war that we saw some force in its expansion  And as the   survey that accompanied the Beige Book showed—and other surveys reinforce this—businesses   now are beginning to plan for increased equipment spending in the coming year    The other side of the business investment picture that is particularly strong is the business   debt picture  While households have not done a whole lot to mend their balance sheets and they   continue to run high debt levels, businesses clearly have made substantial progress  The flow of   funds data show with regard to the financing gap in the last two quarters that cash flow due to   strong profitability more than covers the capital expenditures that businesses have undertaken    This should provide further legs to support the business fixed investment that would keep this   recovery on more balanced ground  So again, I think financial conditions give us strong hope     As many other members have pointed out, the one part of this balanced recovery that is   stretching our ability to understand is the employment story because the data are giving mixed   signals  While the payroll numbers continue to show very disappointing results in light of how   fast and how durable spending has been, I believe that it’s due to productivity and that we are in   the early stages of improving business confidence that will bring people back to work  But I also   am looking a little more at other indications of improving employment conditions, namely some   of the data that come from other sources, particularly self-employed income  Over the last year,   the incomes of people who are self-employed have grown by 50 percent more than the growth in   overall personal income  It may not be so much a formal business expansion as this self-  employment income that is creating multiple legs for the recovery and showing up in the   household but not the establishment survey     January 27-28, 2004 166 of 238    The profitability of major businesses could be forcing up nonfarm proprietors’ income for   the same reasons, or it could be that more people—either out of necessity because they’ve been   laid off in corporate restructurings or because of lifestyle choices—are choosing to be self-  employed  So, we may have a different type of labor force going forward  I think we’ll have to   wait for more data to see what the end result is going to be  Either way, I think this shows that   small businesses tend to lead employment growth      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation on the rate, and I   am glad to see that the old language referring to a “considerable period” is going away  I can   support the recommended wording change to “patience,” but like President Moskow I would   prefer not to use the “patience” language because we’ll have to get rid of that also  I’d feel much   more comfortable going back to not including in the statement any kind of forward commitment   of that sort  The faster we can eliminate both the “considerable period” and the reference to   “patience” the better I will feel     Thank you, Mr Chairman I want to start by also acknowledging the range of   forecasts the staff has provided  I think it really will help us be more aware of how variable the   outlook can be  As someone who spends a lot of time worrying about Basel II and advising   bankers that they need to understand the variability of outcomes, I’m glad to see we’re walking   our talk and putting it in our own FOMC materials  So, thank you   Since the last meeting, as many of you have said, the data have been mixed  On net, our   forecast is a little weaker in terms of GDP and employment, with inflation about unchanged    Overall the pace of the recovery, while still strong, is slowing  In looking at this, I tried to focus   a bit on the different sectors of the economy, and I ended up spending most of my time looking   at the corporate sector  As we’ve been noticing since the second half of last year, corporate   profit levels are rising quickly, and corporate cash flow is very strong  In fact, internally   generated cash flow has been greater than capital expenditures for several quarters now  Why is   it then that businesses have increased their investment in equipment and software but still   haven’t picked up their spending in some other areas?  I think that this gap in spending on   different facets of their operations may come from a couple of interesting aspects of their   March 16, 2004 71 of 107    finances  Throughout this whole period, corporations have been paying down equity on net    Overall their balance sheets have strengthened in leverage, but they are generating more profits   than they can use and, therefore, are retiring stock   Another observation is that corporate net issuance of debt has been quite large until very   recently  In fact, the numbers in the last couple of quarters are amazing to me  While a lot of   debt has been issued, we’ve also seen, as Governor Olson noted, a paydown in bank loans and   commercial paper  So companies have been lengthening their liabilities—taking advantage of   the long period of low interest rates to help strengthen their financials  In the last two months’   data, however, we’re seeing some changes  We’re beginning to see for the first time in a while   commercial loan growth in the banking system and commercial paper growth in the financial   markets  There has actually been a net expansion of debt so far this quarter  Part of this may be   due to the start of inventory building, but again, this has been very, very modest  Corporations in   effect are trying to maintain their high profit margins  In fact, from the data in the Greenbook we   can see that the Street expects double-digit earnings growth for corporations out into the next   couple of years  To the extent that companies have very lean, top-line revenue growth—and   particularly with a limited ability to raise prices to get that revenue growth—they are struggling   to maintain the bottom line   One of the odd things in corporate finance is that the wider your profit margin, the harder   you have to work on keeping costs down in order to generate earnings growth  I think that’s in   part what is happening now  Firms are showing wide operating margins to the Street, the Street   is extrapolating them into earnings growth, and these firms find that they have to scramble harder   on the expense side  What really makes me uncomfortable is that, of the government sector, the   household sector, and the business sector, we have net saving today in only one sector, and that’s   March 16, 2004 72 of 107    the corporate sector  Until the corporate sector turns from a net saver to a net investor, I’m   pessimistic about getting very rapid growth going forward    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation, and I would prefer to keep   the slight bias emphasizing that there is a possibility of disinflation  One of the things that makes   March 16, 2004 86 of 107    me uncomfortable about making a change—going back to my comment that I like the fan   charts—is that inflation is “fanning” around 1 percent, and I personally think 1 percent is a low   number  Also, there are economic consequences of what is going on  How companies manage   their earnings statements and how financial institutions operate at extremely low interest rates   have implications for the economy  That, plus the fact that we haven’t seen in the data actual   evidence of a stabilization in inflation, leads me to prefer to retain the bias toward weakness     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will take the opportunity for the last time, I guess,   to say that I agree with President Broaddus  As I prepared for this meeting, I too found that the   changes since our last FOMC meeting were significant  As I looked at the different indicators I   track, I saw more change than I had for quite a long time  I want to talk about three aspects of the   data that I ended up focusing on  inventories, employment, and the various inflation indicators   May 4, 2004 67 of 112       Let me start with inventory growth  I think we all were surprised about how little   inventories grew in the last few months, below even the Greenbook estimates  If one looks at the   historical trend in both inventory–sales and inventory–consumption ratios, what is remarkable is   that the downward trend of these ratios that began in the ’90s has continued—except for a slight   flattening in wholesale manufacturing inventories during the recession  In fact, even the Greenbook   forecast of inventory accumulation this year, based on the recent changes in the GDP numbers,   suggests a level of inventories in 2004 that will be less than that held by companies in 2000, despite   double-digit sales growth in the intervening four years  So, what is happening with companies’   inventory management practices?   Recently I had an opportunity to be with some financial officers of several different types of   businesses, and one of the things I found was that the anecdotal commentary was mixed    Particularly among manufacturing industries, there is still a lot of caution out there  These tended to   be firms that had suffered a lot in industries where there is real pressure on profits  Perhaps like the   company President Pianalto talked about, they’ve been worried about building their book of sales   and have been trying to get their inventories down even further  On the other hand, folks in the   retail industry told me stories about how they continue to be on a path of substantially changing the   way they integrate information systems across their companies, going from the prospect books of   their sales forces to order books and to inventory management  While a lot has been accomplished   in that regard, many of these financial officers felt there were still significant ways that they could   continue to improve their management of inventories  Manufacturing firms also are doing this, but   again they started more on the cautious side than the retailers, who were talking more about   improving their inventory management processes   May 4, 2004 68 of 112       In terms of employment, I was glad to see that in March we had for the first time some   growth in payrolls  I’m still a little pessimistic because it has been so long since we’ve seen real job   growth  But it clearly is one of the indicators that I’m sure we all hope will be showing sustained   growth going forward  Payroll income has not moved a lot in the last couple of years, and I   personally am concerned that, after the tax refunds have played out this year and we see a slowing   in the pace of equity extractions from housing due to rising mortgage rates, we will need to have   significant payroll growth in order to sustain a strong level of final consumption   And finally on the inflation numbers, it was amazing that after our March meeting every   indicator of inflation that came out suddenly showed a reversal in the trend that we saw in 2003  In   2003, every month—and even on a twelve-month rollover measure—rates of inflation continued to   fall  But that has really changed, and the anecdotes that many of you mentioned at previous   meetings have come to bear  As I looked at the various pieces of the inflation picture, I focused on   the question that some of you have already asked  Is something fundamental happening, or is this   attributable to unusual events?  Clearly, we have issues with some commodities where we’re seeing   worldwide demand-driven price changes  But overall what is amazing is that prices on the goods   side generally have stopped their decline—a decline that obviously helped to lower the overall   inflation rate for the last couple of years  And this is true for everything from used cars to apparel;   it’s not just raw materials or commodities prices  The other side, though, is that the rate of inflation   for services—which had been relatively high in the last couple of years—has continued to come   down  If one takes out medical services in particular, it is clear that the rate of inflation for other   services is continuing to moderate  And since services are such a big part of our economy, if that   trend continues I believe it will help to offset some of the lack of price declines on the goods side as   we go forward   May 4, 2004 69 of 112                                                         2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   Putting all that together, my position is that I do believe that the inflation risks are finally   balanced  I would also echo the comments that were made earlier about changing our statement in   order to allow us as much flexibility as possible so we can respond to whatever the data show in the   next couple of months and can take the appropriate steps when needed    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, am still in the camp that would prefer not   have a commitment in the statement  But I like the idea that many of us have been expressing in   speeches—that the policy accommodation has to be removed  What I struggled with—and I was   interested in listening to what was said about it around the table—was the word “measured”  If I   were an outsider trying to read the message in that word, I’m not sure that I would know what it   means  Are we trying to signal a slower pace than in ’94—a gradual and moderate but not pre-  emptive pace?  I guess we’ve come up with a word that I don’t know the meaning of  If the idea is   May 4, 2004 96 of 112       that it says we’re going to determine the pace as the facts come in—and we’ll determine the level at   that time, too—then I think we have the perfect word  I don’t necessarily think it means that we   wouldn’t be as aggressive as we were, say, in ’94  I don’t know how it relates to the average   numbers that Vincent provided here because I don’t know what magnitude we’re talking about with   “measured”  My only concern is what we really want to signal  Are we just going to determine our   moves as the facts come in, or do we really want to signal a gradual pace?    I guess I’m asking, Why don’t we just say that the pace at which the policy   accommodation will be removed will be determined as economic events unfold?  I’d prefer to say   something like that rather than use a code word such as “measured”    Well, I’m hearing a lot of different interpretations of it, even around this table    Yes, there are     I have two questions  The first one is for Joe and Karen because I was   thinking about financial markets as they apply to the analysis that you did, especially in the first   paper that was distributed to us on June 16  When I look around the world, the United States has   really been very innovative compared with other countries in terms of the types of private   securities traded in our markets in part because of the depth and liquidity of our markets  We   have been innovative in securitizing duration and credit risk—and in every other way that one   can cut and slice risk—and in creating derivatives, too  My question is whether in your analysis   of the private securities flows you see something of a supply-side impact on those flows  If   someone is sitting in another country doing good portfolio analysis, and the depth, liquidity, and   variety of risk exposures they can acquire in US securities is more attractive than the   alternatives, is that in and of itself a tradable good that attracts them to the US markets?    My other question is for Linda and goes back again to exhibit 7 and is about   the pass-through  One of the changes that international corporations have made involves   replacing trade by going into customer markets—actually putting in facilities and manufacturing   in the resident country where the ultimate sale occurs  When I look at the data in exhibit 7, the   industry where the pass-through has come down the most is transport, which I guess is composed   primarily of autos and small trucks  Clearly, we’ve seen German and Japanese auto   manufacturers moving into the United States more of their production of vehicles destined for   this country  By putting more of their production in the resident country, does that in effect   reduce their inherent exposure to foreign exchange risk?  Is the amount that is still being   June 29-30, 2004 49 of 203          imported into this country small enough that they don’t need to push it through as they might   have done twenty years ago, when all of their US sales were being imported?     I have a question on chart 3 on the commercial real estate valuation  Having   lived through the 1986-91 period when the NOI(net operating income)–price ratio was down to the   levels it is today, I look at that period as abnormal because we had tax changes that were retroactive,   which basically put a lot of real estate projects and ownership under water  So we had a tremendous   upheaval in the real estate market, with people filing for bankruptcy and dumping properties  It   worries me that we’re back down in a sense to a situation that is comparable to that severe turn in   the real estate market  I really look at that as a good example of how retroactive taxes affect   people’s return targets when they enter into long-lived projects    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic growth is increasingly becoming broad-   based and, I believe, sustainable  Capital expenditures, whose curtailment was the cause of the last   recession, are strong  Employment growth in the last several months has really come back to life    And manufacturing is showing real strength for the first time, with rising capacity utilization and   employment growth for four consecutive months  Retail sales continue to grow solidly  And   inventories, while increasing, continue to be well managed by companies as inventory–sales ratios   drop to new lows every month, which should, in turn, support expansion going forward   Corporate profits are up over 31 percent in the last year, and forecasts are for continued   strong growth in 2004  Debt–equity ratios for nonfinancial corporations continue to improve from   their peaks set in the third quarter of 2002 and are now down to levels last seen in the 1970s  Our   recent flow of funds data for 2004Q1 show a fourth straight quarter of a surplus funding gap for   businesses  Thus, companies have the financial strength to fund continued expansion internally and   to access capital markets and financial institutions for funds on favorable terms   Earlier, the Chairman made a comment about the profit share of GDP versus GNP, and the   staff—Steve in particular—won’t be amazed that that is one of the numbers I tend to look at over   time  The profit share of the GDP number actually shows a more extreme peak in profit share  It   hit a seventy-five-year high of 8½ percent of GDP in the first quarter, and that’s about 2½ points   above the long-run average  Profit share does tend to revert to the mean over time  But what does   that imply right now?  We know that analysts looking at individual companies forecast that earnings   per share for 2005 will show a marked slowdown but still growth  And they are assuming that   companies will have to absorb more costs that are not passed through to customers into 2005   Historically, most profit margin reduction comes through relatively faster growth of labor   costs than prices, and that is reflected in part in the recent revisions we’ve seen in employee   June 29-30, 2004 134 of 203          compensation costs in the fourth quarter of ’03 and the first quarter of this year  Productivity   growth slows as the expansion progresses, and competition for workers intensifies as strong   employment growth continues  Those factors and increased compensation to retain the best   employees in more-competitive labor markets will all likely contribute to a larger share of income   going to labor  So I am less optimistic on labor costs than the staff forecast   The various inflation measures released since the last FOMC meeting showed surprising   strength  One of the few indicators to improve, the core crude component of the producers’ price   index, has now fallen for two months, but that’s after nine months of exceptional increases  The   core CPI eased a bit in May after three months of acceleration While one can point to unusual   jumps in prices for items such as used cars, apparel, or lodging, the list of these exceptions is getting   broad enough to ask whether pricing power has returned in a much wider sense  So I think this is a   time when we need to be especially attentive to the incoming inflation data and make sure we act   promptly to limit further acceleration     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Many of you have already talked about this soft   patch that we’re going through, and as I prepared my notes for today my main concern was how   long this soft patch is actually going to last  As President Guynn said earlier, the consumer really   has kept the economy moving through this overall business expansion, in terms of getting it back on   the right path  One of the questions today is what is happening to the consumer  I am concerned   about the soft retail sales we’ve seen in the last few months, though obviously the slowing is from   elevated levels  I’m hearing, too, that it’s not just energy prices that are a concern for consumers but   food prices as well  A couple of retailers mentioned to me that when the price of a gallon of milk   and a gallon of gas both go up, it raises questions about how much people have left for discretionary   spending  If those prices start to moderate and level off, then we may have reached the end of this   soft spot   Home sales, which probably are the most bullish indicator of real intentions, continue to be   very strong, though  While such sales have plateaued, they’ve done so at record levels The   purchase of a home is clearly a long-term commitment, and the housing market indicates a degree   of optimism that isn’t evident in the retail sales sector  So based on that, I feel more optimistic that   the economy will get through this soft patch in the next few months   August 10, 2004 62 of 103          One other comment that I heard from some retailers was a reminder to me to be careful   when I look at year-over-year comparisons of sales in the third quarter  Last year, consumers were   getting tax rebate checks, and they went out and spent those funds, especially on lower-end types of   retail sales  So we need to be mindful of that unusual boost to sales a year ago   The jobs numbers, as many of you have indicated already, clearly created a lot of confusion   when they came out on Friday  That made two very weak employment reports in a row, especially   with the revisions factored in  As we’ve always said, these data can be volatile  And if we look at   other indicators of jobs, we have different signals  As was discussed in our Board meeting   yesterday, initial claims are fairly stable, which suggests that it’s new jobs that are not being created    But the household survey points to more optimism on the part of households because it indicated   substantial growth in employment; and usually if the labor force is growing, that’s another signal of   consumer optimism  So, again, we have mixed information about what is happening in the   employment data   The inflation numbers, I find, also have moderated in the last couple of months from the   very rapid rates that we saw in the first half, whether we look at the total inflation or the core   inflation measures that we use  So both of these factors—the likely reasons for the soft patch and   the moderation of inflation—make me want to stay with the “measured pace” language that we have   in our latest statement  And given that the data since our last meeting have clearly provided some   surprises, I want to reemphasize that our commitment to removing policy accommodation at a   measured pace is dependent on the data as they evolve    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation, and I do like the wording in the   third revised version better than that in the previous drafts  I think the changes were positive    That’s all I have to say      I just want to add one other point  One of the reasons this is happening is   that we’re communicating so well and we have a lot of credibility  Every desk manager and   every banker knows pretty much when rates are going to move, and we give them the luxury of a   two-week period in which to meet their required reserves  So when a bank has two weeks to   meet that requirement and can save 25 basis points on the cost of their reserves, management is   going to pick the time to do it  They would do the same if they were expecting us to drop rates   in a given maintenance period  So part of the problem is the luxury of the time they have—the   two-week maintenance period—to meet their average for required reserves  It may be   worthwhile to look at the length of the maintenance period again as part of this review because   the whole process of reserve management has really changed  This is a profit center operation in   a bank They’re acting totally rationally, and I just don’t want to jeopardize the credibility that   we have in the market now    September 21, 2004 12 of 100          Another question is how much the quarterly funding of the Treasury entered into the   picture in the recent period  Its occurrence in the same maintenance period probably also created   some of this unusual noise  In any event, I think we finally have gotten a lot of credibility in the   market, and we need to be really careful what we do  It may be that we ought to go back and   look at the fact that, especially in this period, banks have much lower reserve levels than they’ve   ever carried—they avoid reserves  They have such a low level of reserves, and there’s a large   amount of movement that the reserve desk can do every day in a bank  That’s another issue,   because banks are doing whatever they can to avoid reserves    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic indicators, as others have said,   have been variable in the last few months  But on net they show continued expansion, though at   a slower pace than in the second half of last year and the beginning of this year  And as   Governor Ferguson just mentioned, recent surveys show that business attitudes, both at large   companies and small businesses, while still positive, are a little less optimistic than they were   last quarter    I’d like to use a couple of anecdotes to throw on the table a few more hypothetical   explanations for what may be happening here  One is that CEOs, even in meetings with stock   analysts, sometimes are mentioning that their management teams have shifted their focus since   June, when the final rules came out for Sarbanes–Oxley, to implementing audit adaptations and   internal controls by year-end in order to be compliant with that legislation  Those activities take   time that management normally would use to make decisions on business expansion  They don’t   know what to expect with regard to their ability to comply with Sarbanes–Oxley, and we’re   already beginning to see in some 10Q warnings by some companies that they may not be totally   compliant by year-end  The reputation risk here is very significant for these companies   September 21, 2004 75 of 100          Second, another interesting development—and I will cite the same Duke survey that   Governor Ferguson did—is that while CFOs of large companies are expecting GDP growth to   moderate to only 28 percent in the next twelve months, they still are anticipating earnings   growth at their own companies of 134 percent on average  This gets back to a comment I’ve   made in the past, which is that, in talking to CFOs, I realize that they still live in nominal worlds    And one of their reasons for caution in both spending and hiring is their concern about how they   can deliver double-digit earnings growth to the Street when they see modest sales and very   moderate inflation in the months ahead  The only way to get that bottom-line growth is to   control expenses    The other comment I’d like to make is that, overall, companies are stronger  One of the   indicators I look at is the pattern of changes in corporate debt ratings  Worldwide, this will be   the first year since 1998 that we’ve seen more debt ratings rise from below investment grade up   to investment grade than we’ve seen go down from investment grade to below it  It has taken six   years for that to happen, and it’s one of the reasons we’ve seen credit spreads come in    The latest inflation data continue to show that inflation is moderating from the rates   recorded in the spring—again with health care a notable exception  That moderating rate of   inflation is one of the things that make me feel that the expansion is likely to continue, though at   a modest pace  Therefore, I feel that the position we have taken—that policy accommodation   can likely be removed at a measured pace—is still the appropriate signal to send to the market    That signal, I think, has helped to extend the expansion because it has helped the long-term debt   market  As several of you have already noted, long-term debt rates have come down even   though we’ve been raising the funds rate  And I think our credibility, as we move along this   September 21, 2004 76 of 100                                2The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   path, will keep capital within easy access and affordable to companies when they do have the   confidence to make additional business investment     I support it      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Today, I wanted to focus my comments on   inventory levels and productivity, based on some conversations I’ve had recently with business   folks  For the last several years, I’ve watched the significant structural changes that have been   made in inventory management to lower inventories relative to sales  I’ve also seen the regular   small adjustments that firms make to keep inventory levels in line with changing sales rather than   incur a large unintended buildup in inventories  As a result of both of these factors, inventories   today are a much smaller source of volatility in the economy  In conversations with nonfinancial   business executives, I continue to be struck by comments that they expect to be able to reduce   inventory–sales ratios further  They are continuing to improve internal information flows  And if   they are a manufacturer, they have linked sales, procurement, work scheduling, and shipping so that   November 10, 2004 61 of 107    they can promptly make real-time adjustments anywhere along the business process  Thus, they   expect a much lower likelihood of an unanticipated buildup in inventories for all their various   product lines  They also feel that suppliers have improved their processes in order to respond more   quickly to changing sourcing orders and thereby enable firms to further reduce inventory needs    Comments by these contacts support the forecast in the Greenbook, which anticipates a further   downward trend in inventory–sales ratios  As a result, inventory buildups will continue to provide   a smaller share of real GDP growth in the future   The other area I wanted to comment on is the changing picture of productivity  The   Greenbook discusses productivity, including two alternative scenarios—one with higher   productivity and one with lower productivity  The baseline forecast for the second half of this year   shows productivity growth that is slower than the unusually high levels we’ve seen over the last   year  Recent anecdotal information from my business contacts shows a dichotomy going on with   regard to productivity  On the one hand, these business contacts indicated that they are continuing   to focus on improving productivity for competitive reasons and for quality reasons, too  I might   add that some of the requirements of Sarbanes–Oxley are causing businesses to focus on greater   internal controls  Most of the contacts I’ve talked with were able very quickly to tick off many   process improvements that they have under way, including initiatives that they plan to undertake   next year  They clearly indicated that this is a component of ongoing business planning; it is no   longer a one-off kind of thing to get costs down to meet current competition  It’s a fundamental   change in the way they do business and the way they approach business planning  The high fixed   costs of adding employees for moderate and low salary grades—due primarily to benefit costs—and   morale issues that firms have been working through with regard to employees retained after a   downsizing are continuing to put pressure on businesses to manage staff additions very carefully    So they are continuing to try to work with as lean a staff as possible  However, as the economy has   November 10, 2004 62 of 107    continued to expand at a healthy pace, I’m hearing more managers say that they recognize they are   reaching the limits of how much they can stretch their existing workforce in some business units    So some companies are beginning to add employees  This again is consistent with the Greenbook   notion that we may be at the stage of this economic expansion where new hiring will actually begin   to show up in slower short-run productivity numbers   Finally, let me just make some comments on Sarbanes–Oxley, which has been mentioned   by others  I am hearing a lot more focus on it from business contacts  A key trigger on this occurs   next week when all the third-quarter 10-Q reports have to be filed  Business executives realize that   the first assessments under auditing standard no 2 related to Sarbanes–Oxley are as of year-end,   and when they file their 10-Qs next week, they are within a month and a half of having to say   whether their internal control structures are in compliance with that legislation  So I think we will   begin to see more companies in their 10-Qs next week start to hint to the markets that some aspects   of their internal controls may still need attention, rather than store up the news until the new year    At this point they are far enough along that they already can anticipate whether they are likely to   have problems  They want to be clear and open about their internal controls  CEOs are very   worried about having to admit a major weakness only six weeks later and having to say, “I didn’t   know that we weren’t going to be ready”  That is a risk to them  So I think the 10-Qs next week   could be very interesting  Management at all levels is extremely focused on Sarbanes–Oxley as we   approach the year-end—I’m hearing a lot of comments about it—and I think we’re going to begin   to see some references to it in the 10-Qs this time    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation, including the   language, for this meeting, but I do share some of the concerns that several of my colleagues around   the table have expressed  I think some of the language may not be seen as particularly consistent   with our policy of improved communications  If the words are seen as boilerplate every time, in a   way it may take away from our flexibility going forward  So at the December meeting, I’d like us   November 10, 2004 89 of 107    to look at some alternatives  If the word “measured” continues to be part of our statement, I think,   as others have said, it will end up tying our hands   Another part of the statement is the second sentence, in which we’ve talked about this   “robust underlying growth in productivity”  We saw in the ’90s that we moved to a different level   of long-term productivity growth, but as I said in my comments, we may be in a part of this   business cycle or stage of the recovery when productivity growth is going to look weaker  We need   to think about how that is worded  I think that language could raise some questions about what   productivity we are focusing on—the long-term versus the cyclical—if productivity turns out to be   weakening, as the forecast in the Greenbook lays out  So as the recovery continues to move   forward, there are aspects of the statement that we have to be careful about in terms of leaving in   some of the language for such a long period of time  We need to think through and begin to   anticipate prior to a meeting how to make those kinds of changes in order to give us flexibility    Mr Chairman, I would just add one perspective on that, which relates to how   businesses reacted when the Fed really started to bring inflation down in ’79, ’80, and ’81  One of   the challenges that a lot of companies faced in that period was that they had gotten so accustomed to   being able to raise prices automatically—because the climate was such that everybody was raising   them—that the business processes around inflation anticipation were very different than what we   have today   So to answer the question of whether low inflation is a desirable goal, one would have to   look at it based on where we are today Today I think companies understand that a major challenge   in this very competitive environment is to find ways to enhance productivity  They realize that it’s a   very tough world to operate in compared to the period of easy price increases that they might have   experienced in the early ’80s I think companies have learned that  So in today’s environment, since   low inflation lowers the cost of capital and forces them to focus on service quality and their   processes and controls, overall I think businesses would agree that low inflation is a desirable           February 1-2, 2005 18 of 177  objective But I think we would have heard a different answer from them if we had asked that in   1980   Thank you, Mr Chairman  On this issue, while my tenure is much shorter than   yours and others around the table, I’m going to argue that I’m really in the “status quo   improvement” camp today  Some of my reasons are similar to those already mentioned, but I want   to throw a couple of other reasons on the table for coming to this perspective   First, when I looked overall at the question of being public about some kind of inflation   objective, I felt very strongly about a point that President Minehan mentioned, too, namely, that   when you announce a target, very often you are trying to change expectations So that   announcement effect, in and of itself, is most useful in the extremes—whether inflation is too low or   too high—because you want to disanchor expectations That’s what happened in the late ’70s The   anchored expectation was for building inflation, so it was important to come in with the shock effect,   as the Fed did in 1979, to say “Look, we’re going to wake you up We don’t want the status quo;   we want to change things” But we’re not in that position today We’re in a position where inflation   is in a range that most of us around the table are very comfortable with   When I think further about how we would use this approach, I get into the issue of how to   define the objective I would set and the issue of a point estimate versus a range  On the latter, I   come down to a point estimate, but from a different perspective from some others  First of all, as a   central bank we have to be careful about our credibility  If we set an objective, the market expects   us to meet that objective  And if we use a range, we’re sort of caught  If the range is too wide—and   I think 2 percentage points is too wide—we get into this issue of whether it is a range of           February 1-2, 2005 52 of 177  indifference I think 1 percent inflation and 3 percent inflation—which are the extremes I’ve   heard—would provoke a different response, depending on the economy at that point  On the other   hand, if we narrow that band, then there’s a much higher risk of falling outside of it, and that affects   our credibility So we’d have to amplify our announcements by various qualifying statements, and   that makes me uncomfortable   But the other reason I’m uncomfortable about setting a range for this objective—I’m putting   on my risk-management hat, based on some of the debates we’ve had as we look at risk management   at banks and Basel II and rating agencies—relates to the issue of whether this is the inflation   objective for today or through the cycle In other words, if we were sitting in a period like 2000­  2001, when the economy was slow and we’d just had a terrorist attack, I think my objective in terms   of inflation would be very different from—to use the example Michael gave—a period when   inflation was running 3 percent for three years in a row and unemployment was sitting at 4½   percent   That’s an important distinction, and it gets to our dual mandate and thinking about the   tradeoff between the two goals Quantifying one leg of this mandate and not the other creates   difficulties  To me, if we went to a point estimate, at least we could say, for example, that given the   slack in the economy, we are comfortable below that objective at this point in time  Or, if we were   worrying about pressures building up because of the scarcity of resources, we could say that we   would not be comfortable if inflation were above that objective  It gives us an ability to express our   opinion a little differently  So, I think that is something that we really need to discuss a little bit   I also am very troubled by a couple of suggestions  I thought the staff paper was great   because it got me thinking about these issues—about communicating too many objectives, too many   indexes, and too many time frames  I don’t have confidence that I can sit here today and say where   inflation is going to be three years out, or what the objective should be, for the reasons I’ve   mentioned  I don’t know what the tradeoffs will be at that point in time  So, if we’re going to do           February 1-2, 2005 53 of 177  something, an intermediate time frame of a couple years I think is sufficient; that’s how long   monetary policy is lagged  Going beyond that would make me very, very uncomfortable   The last point I would make is that when we look at the way the staff laid out the issues,   there are a lot of ways we can improve existing communications  Maybe we should be pursuing   these avenues while we flesh out some of these issues that many of you around the table have raised    At the end of the day, speaking in plain English about what’s going on today and letting the market   know where we’re going is what matters  It’s not just the price objective that the market is looking   for but information about what our actions are likely to be  I think they go hand in hand So I think   we need to consider this as part of a communication strategy and not in isolation     Thank you, Mr Chairman  To me, the forecasts presented in the Greenbook and   the consensus forecast of those from the private sector paint a sound economic picture for 2005—   one of solid economic growth and an unemployment rate continuing its slow downward trend  And                    February 1-2, 2005 118 of 177  I’m comfortable that the removal of policy accommodation at a measured pace that we’ve   announced and have been implementing is supportive of this growth going forward  As some of you   have mentioned, given such a good forecast, the question that arises is What should we be worrying   about in this picture?  I’d like to mention two concerns that I’ve been focusing on lately   The first is the risk around inflation This is not a huge risk, but when I look at the   Greenbook projection compared to various private-sector forecasts, the Greenbook’s inflation   forecast is at the lower end of the range of the Blue Chip forecasts Hopefully, the Greenbook will   be the right forecast on this, but the inflation numbers have shown a lot of volatility in the last two   years So in light of the recent volatility, even in the core measures of inflation, I think it’s important   that we look carefully at incoming data every month and keep on top of what is happening to try to   get a better understanding   The second concern has also been mentioned by a couple of you around the table, and that is   the mystery of why long-term interest rates aren’t any higher than they are  My personal forecast a   year ago would never have had long-term interest rates at the levels at which they’ve been sitting If   I look at various aspects of this, in trying to understand it, I can explain some things  For example,   we know that corporations have been seeing record profit margins and, as a result, have been   generating tremendous cash flow  That means that corporations have been able to fund a large part   of their investment in inventory buildup through internal funds, as opposed to going to banks or to   the markets     We also have seen fewer accounting scandals, which generated a lot of the uncertainty that   widened credit spreads in 2002 Those spreads have really come back down again as we’ve had   relatively fewer shocks to market confidence  We’ve also seen rating agencies worldwide reduce   the number of downgrades relative to upgrades; so that has turned around, which is another good   sign And as Governor Olson mentioned, the bankers are very positive about current credit quality   But I would say again that we should recognize that we are probably at the sweet spot in that credit   cycle                       February 1-2, 2005 119 of 177  On the other hand, consumers have been borrowing like crazy, and they’ve been borrowing   at the long end of the curve In large part, this is a reflection of the fact that interest rates are   historically low, and people are being very rational by locking in at long-term rates and borrowing   all that they can On net, though, we’ve seen that there’s been plenty of liquidity in the long market   So what could happen here if long rates do move up as we go forward?  I guess I worry primarily   about what that could do in terms of business investment  We know that there may be a narrowing   in profit margins  And cash flow has changed to some degree, in that companies are beginning to   look more to the outside for credit, especially as merger activity picks up, and that could affect the   relative demand for credit from corporations   On the household side, we’re seeing that consumers have used these low rates to support   consumption  They’ve done it through equity extractions as they refinance They’ve also had the   benefit of tremendously innovative mortgage products being offered by bankers and other lenders    For tax reasons, people want to borrow as much of their debt against their houses as they can, and   lenders have accommodated them by innovations in ARMs [adjustable-rate mortgages] where   borrowers can lock in a low rate for a period on the short end of the curve But lenders have also   offered interest-only loans and mortgages with very high loan-to-value ratios to provide more credit   that is eligible for tax deductions  If interest rates rise, will consumers begin to slow their use of   credit and, if so, what does that mean for consumption in the forecast?  This is the issue I really want   to focus on because, to me, consumers have been the mainstay of this whole economic cycle  To the   extent that there is a wealth effect of housing, this could be a concern if people begin to purchase   houses at a slower pace or even if housing construction stays at a high level but doesn’t grow    We’ve seen several private-sector forecasts of flat house prices next year  If suddenly the equity   buildup and the net worth of households were to slow, that could have an impact for consumers   When we look at why the saving rate is so low today, we also have to look at the fact that the   ratio of net worth to income is at record levels  Consumers have not had to save out of current   income in order to attain the net worth goals they have set, so they’ve been applying their current                       February 1-2, 2005 120 of 177  income almost entirely to current consumption  But if net worth begins to stabilize and consumers   are not able to increase cash flow through refinancings or home equity lines, that could slow the   pace of consumer spending and result in less GDP growth than in the Greenbook forecast  Thank   you   I support your recommendation    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic growth this quarter, as several of you   have noted, has been stronger than we earlier had anticipated Retail sales excluding autos have   grown at over a 9 percent annual rate in the first two months of the quarter  Business investment has   been strong and does not show a significant decline as a result of companies having moved   investments into the fourth quarter to take advantage of the last months of partial expensing for tax                                March 22, 2005 69 of 116  purposes Manufacturing output has also been growing soundly, and capacity usage is now close to   its average of the last decade at 785 percent And employment has been growing at a good pace   Over the last few months, we have seen core inflation move modestly higher  And we are   seeing data that indicate price pressures coming from both the sales and the cost sides of companies   The strong growth of recent months is making it easier to raise prices, and rising costs from both   commodities and labor are also adding to cost pressures  This economic expansion is reaching its   fourth anniversary, and sales levels now are giving businesses the confidence to be able to raise   prices The Beige Book and comments by several of the Presidents today indicate that businesses   are finding it easier to do so The NFIB survey shows more pricing power for small businesses, and   other business surveys are indicating the same  As Dave Stockton noted earlier, rising import prices   are also giving domestic companies more pricing power   On the cost side, the extraordinary pace of productivity growth has slowed in the past year   Productivity grew at a 56 percent pace in the year ending in the first quarter 2004, but fell to about   one-fourth that pace in the second half of last year While productivity is still very strong from an   historical perspective, it has slowed enough that the direction of unit labor costs has changed Unit   labor costs began rising in the second quarter of 2004, after falling for two years, and grew at 23   percent in the last quarter Thus, with the outlook for continued strong economic growth, I believe   that we cannot be as sanguine about the trend in prices in coming months  We need to be signaling   that we are more dependent on incoming data, and I think that requires a change from the “measured   pace” language to give us more flexibility in the months ahead  Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support both the 25 basis points and alternative B,   as amended                                March 22, 2005 95 of 116  In terms of the dialogue we’ve just had about how we communicate, while it’s very painful   every time we go through one of these exercises, I believe this is one of the things that we need to   think through because the transparency that we’re building is very important to the marketplace    When I look at the rationale statements, I think they are sending more messages as we do these press   releases   In the brief time that I’ve been on the Board of Governors and participated in the FOMC   meetings, we seem to be stressed when we get to the point where our direction of policy is changing   So part of this stress is over the transitional language The more we seem to be locked into formulas   and words, the more difficult we make these transitions  That is a factor in how we think about   communication; we really need to look at what seems right for one meeting and how we get out of   that as we move forward  Maybe having these draft statements a little earlier and being able to think   about them for more than a couple days ahead of the meeting will help  But I think longer term,   painful as it may be, we do need to have discussions about transitional language, because that’s   when the market is going to look for guidance  And words like “appropriate policy action” I don’t   think communicate a whole lot to the Street  They may get us through today’s meeting, but I think   we have to be more transparent as we make the transition we need to make    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I guess I’m going to repeat a lot of the things that   others have said, but I think I will end up in a somewhat different place than some of you around the   table in that I’m much more concerned about the risks of inflation than I am about those for the real   economy   If we look at the first-quarter data, and more particularly the information that has come out in   the last several weeks, we can really see that the quarter started out very strong and that the more   recent data showed some weakness  First-quarter GDP growth at 31 percent was much weaker than   most folks, myself included, expected  But if one looks at the components of the underlying data,   they show that the weakness in the first quarter was primarily in net exports—particularly due to the                                 May 3, 2005 67 of 116  surge in imports—and in government spending  In fact, private domestic final sales were really   quite good in the quarter, growing by my rough estimate at somewhere in the high 3 percent range     So how do we deal with that?  Well, to the extent that the weakness is imports and is coming   from strong consumer and business spending, that’s a good sign  So, while I want to get some more   data on what is happening in the real economy, I’m not as pessimistic as some of you  Monetary   policy is still accommodative, if one looks at the liquidity in the banking system  And while the   weaker economic data caused some reaction in financial markets, overall the conditions are very   supportive of business expansion and consumer borrowing  Corporate profits for the first quarter,   which are still coming in, seem to show continued strength, and first-quarter earnings growth now   looks as if it will be in double digits for the twelfth straight quarter   To me the other remarkable development in the markets is what has happened in reaction to   news about compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley  This is the first year-end reporting Most companies   are on a calendar year-end, and a record number of companies have announced that they cannot   report in the regular time frame and are doing late filings  Normally, one would expect this to create   a disruption in the market, but the market has been very discerning in the way it has taken the news    Many companies that have reported have had to disclose weaknesses in their internal controls   around financial reporting And based just on the anecdotal evidence, the market seems to be   behaving very prudently in that it is distinguishing between companies where the reported   weaknesses are isolated in one small area and those where the control weaknesses are more   pervasive So, it appears that the sunshine associated with these disclosures is being handled well in   the marketplace  We’ll see what happens as we go along and those firms that have still to disclose   their Sarbanes-Oxley reports do so I was a little concerned that we might see more volatility in the   market as a result of these reports, but that worry has been disappearing in the last few weeks                                 May 3, 2005 68 of 116  Let me turn now to the inflation issue, which does have me more concerned  If we look at   the lagging indicators, inflation numbers over the last 12 months are still in the mid-1 percent range,   depending on what measure we look at  But one of the things we need to realize is that in the first   part of last year inflation rates were very, very low   If I look instead at inflation measures in the first   quarter compared to the fourth quarter, I get very much concerned about the trend we’re seeing  If I   throw out all of the volatile energy and food components, the way we typically do, and look at core   measures, core CPI has risen by 13 percentage points to 33 percent in the last three months  Core   PCE is up a full point to 26 percent   As to where we see prices rising, the big turnaround, as some of you have indicated, has   been in the goods sector of the market  Prices for services continue to be rising by a bit above 2   percent, but goods prices have gone from declining at an almost 3 percent pace at the beginning of   last year to being about unchanged now That is affecting the aggregate numbers and is something   we need to watch The employment cost index in the first quarter did show a slight slowing to 07   percent from 08 percent in the fourth quarter  But as David remarked, this is due to the slowdown   in pension funding that occurred in the first quarter   A recent survey of corporate CFOs shows that their number one concern continues to be   health care costs And as they look to pay for the cost of labor going forward, many of them are   trying to hold down wage increases because of the significant rise they’re seeing in health care costs    Where this will lead in terms of future hiring is a concern  It may impact the real economy, because   if employment growth continues at the more subdued pace of the last month, it could affect   consumption and the real final sales that are giving me confidence in the real sector  As for the   balance of risks, I agree with the comments President Yellen made; I believe the risks of inflation are   now clearly on the upside                                    May 3, 2005 69 of 116  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support the recommendation to raise rates 25 basis   points, and I’ll support alternative B As the Governors know, I’ve been frustrated with the whole   “assessment of risk” piece of this, but yesterday, after thinking about it, I realized that it isn’t so   simple to craft the alternatives  One of the things that I’m struck by is that sentences 3 and 4 are   really the meat of the release each time  They tell how we’re looking at the real economy and at   inflation, which are our two major mandates  But if we didn’t have something tying them   together—to convey some conclusion about the risks—that would leave the markets hanging  To   me, that’s what would happen if we got rid of lines 5 and 6 entirely  So, I think we do need   something to anchor that  At first I was leaning toward alternative C, line 6, thinking that would do   it Then the more I read it, I thought These references to fostering the attainment of sustainable   economic growth and price stability are like motherhood and apple pie  Obviously, this is what the   Fed is supposed to do So, is it really saying anything?  We could have that sentence in there no   matter what—if the rate of inflation were 12 percent or if unemployment were down to 3½ percent    So the question is What do we need there?   I think we need something beyond just the rationale for   our decision today Right now, I think sentence 2 is important because it says that while we get   noise in the data, underlying all of this we are still accommodative  And that sets up the notion of a   longer-run horizon beyond the next meeting                                       May 3, 2005 101 of 116  So, as we look to replace this, it’s almost as if the longer-run horizon is the important point   Maybe, as President Yellen said, this gets back to the way we set our goals and targets overall But   we need a longer-run anchor, and then we need a short-run signal to the market  So I don’t think we   can just eliminate the risk assessment  We have to say something, especially at times such as this   where we have risks on both sides     May I say something here?  I don’t have any quantitative studies on this, but   based on talking to the folks who lived through it, I’d make a couple of observations  If we look at   the 1980s—the most recent housing bubble that was nationwide  We saw the bubble bursting   nationally as opposed to the pockets we’ve had with the California breakdown or the Boston   breakdown, which really related to the local economies and local employment developments  I   think the local economic employment situations were the drivers of delinquencies, and the   regulators generally missed that because they missed the local economic impact  And I think people   focus on the fact that those cycles were driven by local economic conditions   I think the period of the 1980s involved a broader failure on the part of supervisors  If we   compare the 1980s experience with what is happening now, in the earlier period a lot of financial   institutions were on an exam cycle that went five or six years  So, nobody on the supervisory side   was in there looking at what was going on  And that period was before the time when securitization   became a prevalent practice, so most of the risk was carried on the books of the banks  Also, many   of the banks that were hit very badly were following developers—going out of their footprint and   lending on properties that they didn’t know  And I think one of the risks we have today in our big                                   June 29-30, 2005 46 of 234  banks is that while we say they are diversified geographically, many of their loans are to investors   or purchasers of second-home resort properties  So, the lenders again are following their customers   out of the local area, and in the location of the new property the local lenders aren’t looking at it; the   customer’s lender is handling the transaction  So, we still may have that risk embedded within the   financial institutions  It’s one of the things we’re focusing on   What is new about it this time, though, is that a lot of these nonconforming products are   being securitized by the private sector  So the real question is Where does the market discipline   kick in?  And as supervisors, can we fault an institution for responding to a market need when it is   offloading the loans and the risk into these types of mortgage structures that Andreas has been   describing?  We clearly could if the financial institutions were buying the equity or mezzanine risk   tranches and the risks were back on the institutions’ books  But in many cases that clearly isn’t   what is happening  So, we have some different aspects this time around     Just to let everybody know, the OCC [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency] and the   Fed currently are putting together a horizontal review to look at the fringe kind of lending activities   where we do need to send some signals  We wrote the HELOC [home equity line of credit]   guidance that came out last month We’re working on this other one and hope to have it out in a   couple of months  We don’t want to turn off safe loans or the traditional types of lending activities,   but we need to figure out where to go on some of these practices that are on the fringes  But we   haven’t done a sterling job  I think that’s why we’re trying to send out some guidance  We sent out   the appraisal guidance a year or so ago  But some of the risky practices of the past are starting to be   repeated, and it may be that the generation of lenders now didn’t live through the problems before    I have an observation and a question about what has been happening to the mix   of mortgage products in the last 12 to 18 months  In 2003, we saw refinancings peak; and then in   2004, total originations went from $38 trillion down to $28 trillion  So they dropped and are   continuing to be soft this year  But what happened during that 12- to18-month period of time is that   the number of ARMs shot up to about half of the originations  And based on anecdotal evidence,   ARMs still seem to be running at least at that pace  Initially, with rates at record lows relative to   those prevailing in the last 40 plus years, it made sense that rational consumers were locking in their   mortgage rates and getting the houses they could afford   Now, we embarked a year ago today on a path of raising interest rates  We haven’t had a   comparable movement at the long end, so long-term rates are basically about the same as they were   Why are so many more ARMs being generated?  Is this an affordability issue?  Is this a mortgage   broker issue, where the brokers want to get a deal at any cost?  What is happening?  I’ve heard some   folks say, “Well, the ARM is a way to do the loan now, and then we’ll turn around and do the fixed   rate next year”    Well, that was going to be my next question  The other part of this is that we   have these older 3-, 5-, and 7-year ARMs, and 2005 is the initial wave of the 3-year ARMs having   their first bump-up in rates or being refinanced out of existence    And the numbers I’ve seen suggest that in the next three years 60 percent of   these ARMs are going to have the rate bumped up or be refinanced  So, as we look at the   cumulative impact of this—I’m going back to the affordability issue—what do we really see   happening going forward in these mortgages?    No matter how fast rates move up    The second question I have relates to the nature of the price decline risk  If   some of these ARMs can’t be refinanced and foreclosures actually start to occur—where financial   institutions take over the property—are there any studies out there that indicate how much   foreclosure volume could hit the market before it had a material impact on local house prices?    We’ll just have to see how they really are going to engineer those processes    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Steve, I want to ask some questions about your   exhibits 8 and 9, having to do with the high-yield debt market  If I put together the middle left panel   of exhibit 8 and the middle right panel of exhibit 9, I begin to get worried about whether the market   is pricing for risk appropriately  The upper left chart on exhibit 9 shows that defaults jumped in the   2001-2003 period  From your chart, it looks like those bonds were issued in 1997 and 1998, and it   appears that that was the last time spreads were so skinny  We’re back to skinny spreads now    We’ve got another bump-up in issuance  And I know banks are easing credit standards  Is the   market being too sanguine about the inherent risks in these?  If there’s something like a three-year   cycle, should we expect to see in 2006 another jump in high-yield defaults?    Thanks    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I thought I’d focus my remarks today on the topic   we discussed yesterday—the housing markets  And then I’d like to talk a little bit about some of the   liquidity issues in housing markets and relate that to monetary policy    Let me start by saying that overall I agree that there is not a major risk of significant   problems in the housing markets  But there is momentum building in the housing area that is   raising some issues about which I am not as sanguine as many of the staff who gave the   presentations yesterday  But I want to compliment the staff from both the Board and the Reserve   Banks  I thought they did a fantastic job in pulling all of the information together   While inflation overall is apparently well contained, I, too, am generally concerned about   the continued ratcheting up of our expectations  The one thing that stands out is how much housing   prices have jumped relative to overall price levels  We know that the average price for new homes   in May was up 8 percent from a year ago  Existing home prices were up 102 percent, as was said   yesterday  But inventories remain relatively lean, even though the supply has risen by about half a   month since the beginning of the year   When I look at the jump in housing prices, I’m trying to see if consumers are saying, “We   have good, strong income growth and we’re able to afford more”  Or are they seeing these price   increases and trying to jump in while they still can afford a house, before home prices get totally out   of their range?  Are they viewing real estate as an alternative for investment purposes, after being   stung in the stock market drop of a few years ago?  Really, all of these factors may be at the heart of   the strong demand for housing     But I also think that the financing markets are sending different signals in these areas  I   know Mark is going to talk about some of the specifics but I want to discuss some of the macro   aspects of this  When the refinancing boom got started about three years ago, mostly we saw             June 29-30, 2005 149 of 234  customers going to banks to refinance and take advantage of low, long-term fixed interest rates  So   most of the mortgage originations in the 2001-2002 period were predominantly fixed-rate loans or   they were ARMs that had fairly long fixed-rate periods before becoming adjustable  What is   striking is how this has been changing in the last 12 months  ARMs of all types have jumped from   about 16 percent of originations in 2001 to about one-fourth in 2002 and 2003, to over half of   mortgage originations last year  This is happening in a period when short rates are rising and long   rates are flat to down  If bankers are really working to the benefit of their customers, why aren’t   they locking in long rates in this environment?     It is also the case, when we look at the mix of products, that more of the mortgages are   subprime products  Subprime originations have climbed to over 18 percent of total originations  In   terms of where these mortgages are being parked—whether they are on the books of banks and   other financial institutions or are being securitized—about two-thirds of originations continue to be   securitized So the use of the markets is about the same  But the types of mortgages being   securitized are changing Again, these are predominantly ARMs, and more of them tend to be   option ARMs—the higher-risk kinds of structures     As we saw in the information presented about the real estate mortgage pools that are being   created, the risk profile in those pools is changing  Interest-only mortgages were basically   nonexistent in those pools two years ago; they are now running over 36 percent of them  Whereas   a lot of these IO mortgages had very conservative loan-to-value ratios—under 80 percent—more   and more of them now have loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80 percent  And about 9 percent of the   IOs in these pools are going to subprime borrowers—that is, the riskiest customers  Yet those loans   require interest-only payments, no amortization  Two weeks ago S&P required additional   guarantees on a few of these mortgage pools, which is another signal of concern                                    June 29-30, 2005 150 of 234  HELOCs are being used more for purchase money down payments  People no longer have   to save to make a down payment  And when we look at HELOCs in general, for the last three years   they’ve grown at a compound rate of over 30 percent a year  As would any supervisor, when I see a   product growing 30 percent a year for three years, I tend to get a little nervous about the   concentration risk Where is the liquidity coming from for these? Again, a big chunk of it is going   to the securitization markets I think one of the challenges we have as bank supervisors is that, to   the extent the banks are originating these loans with the intent to sell them to the market, they’re   looking to the market for the credit definitions     We know from our QIS-4 [Quantitative Impact Study 4] results, looking at the Basel II   exercise, that we had a huge disparity in the results on loss expectations on home equity loans and   other mortgage products  A lot of these are new types of products  The confidence intervals around   the expected defaults, I think, are a lot wider for them than for those that have traditional structures     We also know that there’s a lot of correlation risk that could happen here  If the housing   price bubble does break in a market where employment is dropping, people could be leaving an area   and we could have more defaults  In addition, we know that the dropping of home prices, in and of   itself, tends to create more defaults, especially with negligible equity in these properties  Also, to   the extent that people default and the banks have more properties to foreclose, there are   neighborhood effects, with losses getting bigger when the defaults do occur   So, what I am concerned about from a liquidity perspective, since these are being securitized   and moving into the markets—and there is plenty of appetite in the market to take these products—   is the lack of discipline relative to previous periods  In the ancient days, when mortgage loans   stayed on the books of financial institutions, liquidity limitations forced them to choose the higher   quality credits  This isn’t happening today  And it isn’t clear if the marketplace currently                      June 29-30, 2005 151 of 234  understands the structure of these loans any better than some of us do in terms of pricing the risk, as   evidenced by the S&P move two weeks ago   So, again, I’m not overly concerned  Especially with the record profits and capital in banks,   I think there’s a huge cushion  But the implications of this for housing wealth and for investors who   take the ultimate risk in these securities could create some problems in terms of the way economic   growth proceeds going forward  And it’s something that I think was appropriate to spend the time   talking about today    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation    I wanted to follow up on your comments about mortgage hedging  I’m   hearing concerns that there is increased hedging activity for servicing rights on the new option   ARMS To the extent that they are servicing rights, the risk is the prepayment risk, and   historically banks have found it very hard to come up with any kind of hedging model against   prepayments on ARMs  So this could be a hit to earnings of banks that are building up big   portfolios of this—and it involves the servicing rights, not carrying the loan in the portfolio  Are   you hearing of anybody trying to hedge that prepayment risk?   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to focus my comments today on some   macroeconomic perspectives and on what we’re learning in the supervisory reviews of mortgage   products that we and other regulators are undertaking now   On the positive side, when we look at the large volume of ARMs in existence, most of   them are of the traditional form  And currently those ARMs are at a point—whether they’re   adjusted annually or they started out as 3-year fixed-rate loans and then move to annual   adjustments—where they will be reset  For the ones that started out in 2002 with fixed rates for   three years, this is the year when they will go to annual resets  We know all of them, since   they’re indexed to short-term rates, are going to have a big increase whenever their anniversary   comes up in the second half of 2005 and into 2006                               August 9, 2005 70 of 110  To the extent that long mortgage rates or the reindexed rates are very close to those   available to most borrowers on refinancings, it looks as if most of these ARMs can be converted   into a fixed-rate product without a large amount of payment adjustment  There will be some, but   it seems likely to be manageable for many of these borrowers   On the other hand, we’re seeing a lot of subprime ARMs where this may not be true  As   you know, those ARM products that have been pushed into the subprime market are much more   problematic  So the affordability for that group of customers is questionable  They are going to   be hit not only by higher gas prices but higher monthly mortgage payments when their rates are   reset And that is going to be more of an issue as we go forward and as we continue to raise   short-term interest rates   Also, I’m a bit more pessimistic about what is happening with regard to some of these   option ARMs and the more esoteric ARMs that are being marketed and have been marketed   particularly in the last nine months  Bankers as a whole I think clearly are doing a good job at   underwriting these We have some lenders on the edges, though, that we’re working on   But these mortgage market developments have some significant macroeconomic   implications  Many of these loans started out with teaser rates that were below current market   rates So first of all, the rates have to catch up to the market level  Then also, the index to which   the rate is tied will have moved up by about 250 or more basis points, say, by the end of the year    So if they are interest-only loans, the rate could go from something that maybe started out with a   “1” and could get to something with a “4” in front of it  And all of a sudden the monthly   payments are going to go up fourfold  Even if defaults don’t increase, it certainly is going to pull   a lot of discretionary income out of spending and have some implications down the road                         August 9, 2005 71 of 110  Another issue is that apparently many of these loans have limits on how much the   payment can go up each year in order to try to make the annual adjustment easier  But that puts   borrowers in a predicament because it throws them into negative amortization  During the teaser   period, they’re in negative amortization; and the cap on the index used to reset the monthly   payment could put them further into negative amortization So if they do want to get out of the   ARM and switch to a fixed-rate loan, they have to cover the additional negative amortization    Many of these loans have prepayment penalties, so the lenders recoup that  That may be   problematic in moving more people into fixed-rate products as interest rates rise  And to the   extent borrowers go to fixed-rate mortgages, they’ll go to fully amortizing loans, which could be   a financial burden—even though we are beginning to see mortgages of 40 years and longer  The   leverage that we see in households on their borrowing I think is another indication that if they’re   stretching to be able to afford these houses, it will be more problematic for them to stay in the   houses as their monthly payments go up—perhaps even double or triple    So, when we talk about the wealth effect of housing price bubbles, I’m getting concerned   around the edges that we could see a major impact on cash flows of both subprime and prime   borrowers because these ARMS are indexed to short rates and those rates are moving up  Since   ARMs are a big chunk of the mortgage market today, we have to realize that we can’t just look at   long-term mortgage rates and the affordability of housing  We need to look at the short rates,   too, because they’re getting to be more and more important     As I look overall at the economy today—and I’m going to echo some of the comments   I’ve heard around the table—I’m very comfortable that we have gotten past the soft spot of the   spring I also am a little pessimistic regarding how this recent bounce will be sustained  But I   think we do have a strong foundation going forward, with growth somewhere in the mid-threes                             August 9, 2005 72 of 110  And in my view, that is a good pace of growth  I also believe, to echo the comments Governor   Kohn just made, that the market has reacted to the understanding that we may have to push rates   up even further There is a tremendous amount of liquidity in the market, and I think that’s what   the market is seeing  When we talk about accommodation, the market is looking at the liquidity   that can flow into deals for both commercial activity and for consumers  So I think we need to   continue to push the funds rate upward And personally, my number for the upper limit on the   funds rate is much higher today than it was three to four months ago   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendations  I really like paragraph four   the way it is for the same reason Governor Ferguson just mentioned  I want to leave people with   the message that inflation pressures are out there and are elevated, and I want to make sure that   that message gets through  So I rather like it the way it is, even though it may not be as smooth   grammatically    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As many of you have already remarked,   preparing for this meeting was a lot more challenging than preparing for other recent meetings    The economy was poised for strong growth in the third and fourth quarters before Hurricane   Katrina And the forecast that the staff has developed in the Greenbook I think is reasonable,   given what we know at this time  That forecast suggests that while we may see some short-run   softness, with growth below the rate we had anticipated, the rebuilding efforts clearly will add   stimulus over the next year  I am also comforted that the underlying economy was strong  So   while we are going to see a slight downtick due to the impact of the hurricane, the Greenbook   forecast of real GDP growth in the mid-3 percent range over the next year indicates that we have   sound economic expansion ahead  So while uncertainty about economic growth has increased, I   still believe there are much more serious clouds on the inflation horizon   The rapid rise in energy prices in the last couple of months has pushed the level of prices   high enough that more firms are likely to find that they cannot absorb the increased costs and   must raise prices to protect their profit margins  This will become more so the longer that energy   prices remain high   I am still hearing mixed expectations about the availability of natural gas this winter    While the impact of Katrina may not be as severe as first feared, the limited ability to expand   natural gas supply, as we saw in the last two years, on top of slower fill due to hurricane damage,   may create shortages this winter, especially if the economy remains as strong as we expect                      September 20, 2005 84 of 117  As the Greenbook notes, business spending on equipment and software has only modest   forward momentum  This is despite solid economic growth, healthy profits, and favorable   financial conditions So why is business investment so limited?  I’m going to answer this by   referring to the most recent quarterly survey of CFOs conducted by Duke University with CFO   Magazine And I would note that this survey was concluded on August 28, the day before   Katrina hit   I want to read to you the lead on their press release for this survey  It says “Corporate   Optimism Plummets in Response to Housing and Fuel Concerns”  For the first time in the four-  year history of this survey, more CFOs are pessimistic than optimistic about the US economy    Their number one concern is high fuel costs, ranking above health care costs for the first time    Interestingly, the survey also noted a jump in what they call their terrorism index, with one-third   of the firms responding that costs to improve security and business recovery response has   negatively impacted their bottom line  I think after Katrina there will be more firms looking at   their business recovery plans   As some executives have told me, with the rising costs of benefits, energy, and financing,   they are closely managing discretionary items, including capital spending  Over the next 12   months, the CFOs who participated in the survey are planning slower growth of investment; they   now expect to increase capital spending by only 47 percent  The survey indicates that CFOs are   also worried about the housing market  They believe the market is overheated and that a   necessary and expected decline in housing prices will negatively affect their firms  This echoes   comments I’ve heard from others that a reversal in the housing market might have negative   spillover effects due to consumers’ reactions to a fall in the value of their housing wealth  So I                         September 20, 2005 85 of 117  find the survey results consistent with other comments I’ve been hearing that the business   pessimism we’re seeing is due in large part to growing concerns about rising prices on several   fronts   While recent inflation numbers are very well behaved, the Greenbook does reflect a rise   in the core inflation forecast over the next year  The volatility we saw yesterday in the energy   futures market, clearly due to Rita and other concerns, indicates how much the market is   focusing on the unknown path for inflation that companies are facing  While the impact on   inflation may be unclear—and we know the damage to platforms out in the Gulf and the effects   on refinery capacity are still being assessed—the nervousness about costs is a factor that is   affecting business behavior, and it is something that we can’t ignore  The fiscal stimulus of   Katrina and the rebuilding that will result is only going to add to inflation—and that’s on top of a   transportation bill that has a lot of spending on infrastructure that some of us think should have   less priority than rebuilding around the Gulf Coast   The chart on page 21—and I also love these new charts—helps us keep things in   perspective, in terms of the historical trends in inflation as we’ve been tightening up from   meeting to meeting  And we have to keep that in mind as we look to the future  We know that   there is still ample liquidity in financial markets, so the risks of higher inflation to me right now   are much greater than the risks to economic growth   I think it’s important that at today’s meeting we give the market assurance that we will   continue to focus on and be diligent in dealing with inflation, because rising costs appear to be at   the heart of companies’ concerns  To me that’s very important, and I want to support an increase   in interest rates at this meeting                                                                                    September 20, 2005 86 of 117  Mr Chairman, I support the increase of ¼ point today  I remain mainly   concerned about the inflationary risk, and I think we need to continue on our path     Thank you, Mr Chairman  What I’d like to do today is to talk a little bit more   about some recent trends in consumer borrowing information, which a few people have already   mentioned, and then just make some general comments on the economy and on inflation   As a couple of you have already noted, the data on consumer borrowing have shown a lot of   noise, as I would call it, in the last couple months  Overall, we’re seeing a slowing in the rapid rate   of growth  It’s still growing in general, but the pace of growth is slowing  So it raises the question   of what is really happening here  Are consumers saying that they are nearing the point at which   they really can’t absorb any more debt?  Or are changes in underwriting under way that are slowing   the pace of growth?   As you know, the Senior Loan Officer Survey, covered in the supplement to the Greenbook,   reported only modest changes in demand for credit; it was modestly lower  And to the extent that   this could reflect consumer demand, we know that motor vehicles sales have slowed in the last                             November 1, 2005 72 of 114  couple of months, as the big incentives came off  Also, we’re beginning to see a moderation in the   pace of increase in median housing prices  So that could be consistent with a slowing in demand   On the other hand, if we look at the chart in the Greenbook on bankruptcy filings, there was a   huge spike in the week prior to October 17, just before the new bankruptcy law went into effect    And that could have front-loaded anywhere from three to four quarters of bankruptcy filings, as   everybody tried to get in before the law changed  We saw a tremendous increase at that point  It   doesn’t reflect what the banks are showing in the quality of their credit or in the securitized   transactions that are out there in the market where delinquency rates have basically been fairly   stable So this was a blip up ahead of what our normal leading indicators are showing   On home equity lines, I find the numbers really remarkable  Home equity lines grew 31   percent in 2003, 44 percent in 2004, slowed to 17 percent growth in the first half of this year, and   now, as Governor Kohn just mentioned, have shown declines in September and October  So the   question is What is happening with these home equity lines?  As you know, the banking agencies   collectively put out common guidance in May regarding home equity lines  There was really   nothing new in this guidance  It just pulled together what was out there to remind everybody what   safe and sound lending practices are  We know that the vast majority of banks follow these sound   procedures in almost all of their lending  So I felt comforted that in the Senior Loan Officer Survey   only a few banks said they had changed their underwriting standards because of the new guidance    That to me says that we did really focus on the outliers, which was our intention  So I don’t believe   that this reining in of home equity lines is due to underwriting changes  We know that home equity   lines have been used not only to extract equity for spending but also increasingly for downpayments   on purchases of homes—more so than in the past  So again, this could reflect something more that   is going on                                              November 1, 2005 73 of 114  As you know, the banking agencies later this quarter are going to issue some guidance on   mortgages and on loans for commercial real estate  Again, our intention is not to signal alarm that   overall credit quality and underwriting are poor, but to call attention to some lending practices at the   limit that are raising some concerns  So at the margin it could have some impact on the pace of   lending, but we think overall things are in pretty good shape   The other point I want to make is about credit card lending  More than a year ago now, both   the OCC [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency] and the Fed started to raise questions about   underwriting and credit advances for borrowers who go over their lines of credit and about   minimum payments expected on credit card balances  A growing number of customers were not   being required to cover late payment fees or fees for going over their credit line and actually were   into negative amortization when their outstanding balances exceeded their lines of credit   We’ve given the banks quite a bit of time to figure out how to get into compliance with these   guidelines  Some started doing so toward the end of last year and some will be doing it later this   year; so they are moving at their own pace  The change in practices will slow credit growth for   some clients—the ones who chronically are over their lines and who have paid only the minimum   monthly fee  Again, we don’t expect this to be widespread, but it could be a factor in some of these   bankruptcy filings People who have been at the fringe of being overextended are realizing that   they’re going to have to get their borrowings down   Now let me shift my focus to the overall economy  I find that the pace of the expansion has   been quite resilient, given everything that we’ve been through in the past year  Recently, despite   significant difficulties, whether it was hurricanes or the spike in oil prices, growth continued at a   sound pace in the mid-3 percent range  And the staff forecast shows more of that next year                                        November 1, 2005 74 of 114  Inflation has slowed in the last couple of months, but I’ve focused a bit on the nature of the   developments there  As you know, some of the slowdown has been in prices of services  And with   some of the trends we’re seeing in core elements of inflation, getting a number over 2 percent, as the   forecast has, begins to give me some concern  So I look at that and at the forecast for a continued   rise in labor compensation costs A potential slowdown in productivity also suggests that we need   to be much more attentive to what’s going on in terms of cost pressures on the labor front that could   affect workers’ expectations of compensation increases  So I think it’s even more important for us   to watch inflation in the next few months   I support raising the funds rate today  I also support the dialogue, as President Yellen   outlined, on the elements of our communication so that we have an orderly transition  We ought to   look carefully at every word in our statement  While it will be parsed when we make changes, at   least all of us will have had some time to think about the changes  And I would hope that we have   that dialogue at our next meeting    Mr Chairman, I support the 25 basis point increase and the language in   alternative B, and I look forward to seeing how Vincent will help get a consensus within this group    One thing I’ve learned is that whenever we try to tinker with this, we end up with a wide variety of   viewpoints around the table  So I wish him good patience with all of us as he tries to get our   comments in     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to echo Dave Stockton’s analogy of tidings of   great joy in this forecast  I think the upward revision in growth and the downward revision in   inflation are developments that we all welcome at this point in the economic expansion   As I tried to assess some of the information to see where I would want to come out on policy,   I tended to take an approach similar to the one President Yellen took, in saying Where do we stand at   this point in our effort to remove accommodation, and where are we going as we move forward?  In   the alternative scenarios laid out in this Greenbook, there is really only one where long-term inflation   expectations lose their anchor and which therefore gives me much concern  As I looked at where we   are on inflation, I was struck that there is some good news and some bad news and that there are   currently risks on both sides  Last year we saw inflation coming up from extraordinarily low levels—   moving up from 1 percent to over 2 percent  It rebounded quickly, and I was one who was quite   concerned by how quickly inflation had moved up  In the last six months, though, it has been 16   percent, which sounds like a fairly good area for it to be in  But the fact that it rebounded so fast   clearly indicates that we always have to be very alert to developments on that front, because prices   can move rapidly   The energy pass-through, I think, is a risk for higher inflation  I’d love to see the analysis that   San Francisco has done on that issue because, depending on what level of costs are passed through, I                                                   December 13, 2005 60 of 100  think we could see real concerns about disruptions and risks to the economy going forward—as a   consequence, for example, of believing that energy prices are going to stay in a high range for several   years or seeing the possibility of outright shortages in areas like natural gas    We’ve also seen that other central banks in the world are now expecting stronger growth and   higher inflation in their economies  The ECB [European Central Bank], as was mentioned earlier,   finally raised its policy rate, and even the Bank of Japan is coming out of a zero rate world  So some   of the cushion we’ve had worldwide may be moderating, and that could produce more risks on the   upside on inflation   On the other hand, when I look at what has been happening with jobs growth and labor   compensation, I continue to be struck by how moderate the growth in compensation has been  The   productivity story is clearly one reason for this  The numbers continue to amaze me at this point in   the cycle   It’s easy to achieve productivity gains in a company early on when you have excess   capacity But this many years into an expansion, it really takes a ton of attention and effort   Another thing that often comes up in my conversations with business executives is this  They   are sitting at very high levels of profit and cash flow generation; and when you ask them about their   main challenges, they still say their primary challenge is to maintain profit growth  If you start to dig   into that, you find that it’s beyond just managing wage costs and looking at capital  The lessons they   learned in the ’90s in terms of really changing the way business processes are run are continuing to   play a role in all of the decisions they’re making on issues like inventory management—not tying up   capital either in inventory stored or in warehouse capacity    As I looked at last month’s numbers, inventory-sales ratios hit record lows  So clearly,   businesses are continuing to learn more and more about how to keep inventory levels very, very   low—even though they’re trying to customize the delivery of products  And they are doing that                               December 13, 2005 61 of 100  through better information systems and better order management systems They also are focusing a   great deal on quality control, particularly in services and retail businesses, and in business services   where that is a key differentiator with the competition  But better quality also has major cost benefits   because it reduces errors and the need to redo work and it focuses on the timeliness of delivery  And   these are the kinds of values beyond prices that customers are rating as increasingly important  So   firms get both greater efficiency and value added for their customer base more than in the past   And finally, outsourcing—and I’m talking not internationally but simply outside of the core   enterprise—is a business practice that evolved in the ’90s and has proven to be very important  In the   old days when you ran a big corporation that was vertically integrated, there were cost centers   throughout the organization and it was very hard for CFOs to get a handle on controlling costs  Now   that the culture has become “if it isn’t a core function, you ought to try to outsource it,” the process of   renegotiating with the contractors annually or semi-annually or every three years and of going out for   other bids puts continual pressure on attaining productivity improvements and a favorable cost   payback But when the function was embedded in the bigger organization, the social politics   sometimes got in the way and made it difficult to wring out the costs  The fact is that firms now try   not to do everything, and to outsource functions unrelated to their core business  That this has   become an ingrained practice in many companies is another theme I’m hearing  So, in short, I’m   finding that changes in business practices are the focus of a lot of companies  And they believe that   despite higher costs, they are going to be able to improve the value with modest price increases going   forward   Pulling all of that together, I tend to think that we are very close to the end of the increases in   interest rates that we need to implement  There are risks on both sides, but it strikes me, based on the   Greenbook forecast, that we’re getting to full potential in a very orderly way  And as was mentioned                                                                                   December 13, 2005 62 of 100  a minute ago, according to the Bluebook, the real fed funds rate  that we would have with a 25 basis   point increase today is at the midpoint of the range of the staff’s estimates of equilibrium  Also, it’s   above the funds rate derived from the policy rules for all of  the alternatives  So we are close to where   I think we need to be, given the forecast  As a result, I think we really do need to talk about how to    make this transition and change our communication    Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, let me say that I support the 25 basis point   increase today  And I give my sympathy to Brian, who has heard our many different viewpoints in   the last week  I think he has done a good job of trying to get all our ideas out here in a reasonable   balance My initial feeling was that I really didn’t want to keep the word “measured” in the   statement; I wanted to drop it as part of this change  But for the reasons everybody has suggested, I   can accept the wording in alternative B as it is now   Mr Chairman, you talked about some of the risks to the long-term side of the market  I think   that is a serious concern because so much of the pricing these days seems not to involve looking at the   longer-term risks, and it’s so critical to what is currently driving investment and risk-taking  And for   that reason, I guess I’d like to leave the words as they are now  But the big change that I would like to   see is a move away from forward-looking language as we get to the point where there is more   uncertainty about future policy  It was easy for the last thirteen meetings to say, “We’re on a trend;   the funds rate is way too low and we have to get it back up”  So it was easy for us to signal ahead    But as we signaled ahead, the market looked at what we were saying we were going to do as opposed   to what the data were saying we would do  We, in effect, have taken the risk away from the market,   especially at the long end, because market participants think we’re going to signal ahead of time and   they will have time to get out of their long positions   In my view, we should go back to structuring section 4 to say basically where we think the   risk is Then I’d take the second part of that sentence and put it down in section 5, because it’s still a   tautology to me It still says we want to attain the right balance  Well, there’s no way any of us                                               December 13, 2005 83 of 100  around this table is going to say that we’re not going to follow the mission of the Fed  So if we’re   going to put in a tautology, I’d put it in part 5  And in part 4 I’d just indicate our assessment of the   risks—that we think the risks are balanced or that the risk to growth or for inflation is greater  That   would give the markets the message that they need to go back to looking at the data to figure out what   we’re going to do, rather than our laying out for them what our next policy moves are going to be  As   we get to the cusp, that risk perspective is really important  We saw when we turned from the bottom   and rates were heading back up again that it disrupted the markets  But we need the markets to be   ready to absorb that kind of risk because, as we sit around this table, we do not know exactly how   we’re going to engineer getting out of this pattern of moving 25 basis points at each meeting  And I   think the way to do it is to focus on where we see the risks and to stop giving any kind of signal on   what our likely moves are going forward  I would like to see that happen at the next meeting     Thank you, Mr Chairman  When I was preparing for this meeting early last   week, I was feeling very comfortable with the forecast of good growth in 2006, in the mid-3 percent   range near potential, and a modest uptick in core inflation above 2 percent  As many of you have   already remarked, the GDP numbers on Friday made me slightly more pessimistic, both on growth   and on inflation  The surprise drop in government spending, I have full confidence will turn around    Final sales fell, however, so that all the growth that occurred in the fourth quarter came from   inventory growth  Given that inventory–sales ratios continue to run at historically low levels,   though, inventories should continue to be a source of growth going forward  As many of you also   have noted, other indicators show much stronger performance  Initial unemployment claims, goods   orders, capacity utilization, and strong corporate balance sheets—all of them effectively say that we   January 31, 2006 64 of 106    have a strong foundation underneath this growth  The inflation numbers ticking up to 22 percent   gave me a bit of pause  We came through two good quarters, the second and third quarters, with   very low inflation; but again, the uptick shows how much variability we see around the inflation   numbers quarter to quarter and warrants attention   The one area—and I want to second Dave Stockton’s remark—of main concern is the   housing market  Let me talk about it a little differently from some previous comments today    When we look at the aggregate levels of debt that households have and relative prices, one of the   things as an old lender I worry about is the ability to service the debt and the discretionary spending   that households have  While 80 percent of mortgages are fixed rate, 20 percent are variable    Starting in 2002, we saw a jump in ARMs, taking advantage of the very steep yield curve at the   time  We now are in a period when not only the fancy option ARMs, the exotic products of the past   eighteen months, but also the 3/1 ARMs and the five-year ARMS that became very popular in 2002   and 2003 are repricing   If interest rates just hold where they are right now, we estimate that the monthly debt service   cost is going to go up by at least 50 percent on that 20 percent of mortgage portfolios  If you look at   the Greenbook, you’ll notice that the financial obligation ratio rose quite substantially in the past six   months  It is now back to the peaks of 2001 and 2002, and we have a lot of mortgages still to   reprice  We also know that some of these exotic mortgages don’t amortize, but they will kick in and   start amortization and that will also pull cash out of discretionary spending   In an overall look at consumers, with housing and the cost of heating this winter rising,   you’re beginning to see a little caution in the borrowing numbers  The drop in home equity lines of   credit that I mentioned a meeting or two ago now has been sustained through the whole quarter  So   we have actually seen that home equity lines outstanding that have been drawn on have dropped    January 31, 2006 65 of 106    Consumer credit as a whole dropped, excluding mortgage credit, and mortgage growth as a whole   slowed to just over 10 percent  So households are signaling that they’re pulling back on new   borrowing, not just in housing but in general  When you look at the ability of consumers to spend   discretionarily out of their monthly take-home pay, these are signals we need to look at  And the   rising fixed payments that they have is something, in looking at the tail of the distribution on   housing market risk, that I think is important for that segment of the population going forward   The other sad thing is that this is our last meeting with the Chairman, and I just personally   also want to echo some of the comments of my colleagues around the table to thank you for your   leadership  I’ve been very impressed with the kind of atmosphere that I found when I joined during   your tenure as leader of this institution  The integrity with which everything is done, your emphasis   on the quality of ideas, and your continuing to search for new ways to look at information—because   the economy is dynamic—remind us that we have to watch for new things always evolving  The   collegiality with which you have led this organization has made it enjoyable for all of us to be here    And finally, as an old risk manager, I was glad to feel right at home with your approach to monetary   policy  [Laughter]  So thank you for your leadership  It has been a pleasure to have served with   you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support both the 25 basis point increase and the   wording of “may,” and again, I think it would be good to defer the discussion about the implications   of the alternatives that Vince has laid out     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall, I agree with many of you around the table   and with the Greenbook  I see that you have solid growth going forward  I want first to talk about   the corporate sector and then to talk a bit about the household sector   I have talked with several corporate CFOs in the past couple of weeks, and I also just   received a copy of the Duke quarterly CFO survey  I found the comments from the CFOs and the   survey results to be similar, and so I thought I would just use the Duke survey to make my   comments here  The CFOs are expecting to be able to raise prices more over this coming year than   they did last year  On average, they are expecting an increase in prices of about 33 percent  A year   ago at this time, the quarterly survey showed a 2 percent increase  So the increase is slight  And   they are also expecting to raise wages and salaries faster, 42 percent this coming year  Their   biggest concerns continue to be global competition and health care costs—that has not changed at   all   What I find really amazing is how much these CFOs continue to be focused on cash levels    Right now, as you know, the liquid assets on the balance sheets of corporations are at the highest   level in at least forty-five years  Corporate profit margins relative to GDP are running at 11 percent,   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 72 of 167       and that is again a record level  If you look at the survey results, the CFOs are saying that they plan   to increase cash even more in 2006  How are they going to do that?   One of the things this group is forecasting this year is for earnings to grow 131 percent    Last March the survey said 114  So the projection for earnings growth is up about 2 points  They   are not expecting top line revenue growth of 13 percent—they are expecting to be able to widen   their operating margins  So the trends we have been seeing are what everybody is just building on    This inertia and this new focus on cost management seem to be central to what is going on in   corporate America  Partly, too, they are worried about top-line revenue growth, and I am hearing   more of them talking about using mergers to widen their operating margins  Grow market share   through acquisition, get immediate revenue pops, pull out the extra costs, and get the bottom line   growth at 13 percent that way  They also are planning to spend more on capital expenditures this   year, up 65 percent versus 47 percent, and also much more employment growth, 2 percent versus   06  So they are optimistic; but again, the focus on widening operating margins from already   historically wide levels and on building liquid assets shows that a real focus on the fundamentals in   corporate America is continuing   If you look at the survey of small businesses, you can read the same kinds of trends in the   responses  The optimism of small business remains at a very high level  So, in summary, I think   corporate America is going to continue to push earnings growth and production but is clearly   focused on cost containment  And while they may be looking at raising prices a bit, I think overall   prices will be contained   Now, a look at the household sector  What I have been noticing in the past few months is   that job growth, as many of you have mentioned, has clearly gotten a lot stronger and also that   wages are growing much faster—in the last three months, they have gone up at an annual rate of 48   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 73 of 167       percent, which is pretty strong  I think we have to go back about four or five years to get that kind   of increase   So the real question, as many of you have said, is what is really happening to productivity    The last time we had this kind of wage growth was in the late ’90s, and we saw the pop in   productivity  So unit labor costs were there and helped modify inflation  I heard from the CFOs   that this is exactly what they are trying to do—to find ways to improve productivity just so they can   handle the higher wage cost because they are finding that skills are short in some areas  But the   highly skilled people are probably also more productive, on average, than other folks who may be   looking for jobs, and hiring the more-productive workers could also help in that way   I think that the good job growth and the faster wage increases will also help put a floor on   housing sales  You know I have been concerned about where we are in terms of the mortgage   markets going forward in support of housing  We know that the fixed obligation ratio that our staff   constructs has been at record levels; last quarter it showed a tick down in the fourth quarter, but it   still is relatively high  Mortgage rates on the long end have not really moved very much in the last   couple of years  But to the extent that so many new mortgages were financed with adjustable-rate   mortgages in the last year and the ARM rate spread now has really moved up as we have moved   short rates up, there is less than a point difference now between one-year ARMs and the term rates    So affordability, I think, is going to continue to come under more pressure going forward   Housing inventories are increasing  Again, I talked to a CFO at a large builder  They   clearly are managing inventory much better than they did years ago, but even so, backouts on sales   and such things are increasing  The number of housing starts that they have in train and starts going   forward are going to be slowing down, and they are giving guidance to the Street that they’re not   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 74 of 167       going to get the sales that they had  But even if it slows down, housing is still going to be very   strong in relation to historical standards, but it will be off the peak that we have been seeing   Finally, to follow up on the comments that some of you made, I see that we still have a   tremendous amount of liquidity in the financial markets  Again, corporations are sitting on all this   liquidity  We do not hear anything from corporations about difficulty in financing big or small   business  We know the bankers clearly are looking for loan growth and trying to find it, and the   housing market is able to attract all the liquidity it needs  So in terms of how effective our rate   increases have been, I see that the lag effect is still there and that plenty of liquidity is still out there,   which keeps me focused on where core inflation will be    I would say that, until about six months ago, most of it was risk aversion    Corporations were not sure what their plans were going to be  They did not know how they were   going to get earnings growth, and so I think some was a precautionary kind of savings  They clearly   deploy most of it into restructuring their balance sheets, refinancing, and getting corporate leverage   down  A number of them use some of the cash, playing the accounting game of putting it into   pension funds and booking a higher yield on the pension than they could in short-term investments   in equipment and software  But I am beginning to hear that they are more likely to loosen the   strings and have more cash going forward   Another interesting thing I heard from one CFO, although somebody just mentioned the   danger of anecdotes, is that they are putting more of what they call “investments” in human resource   training and development than in equipment because they see that, if they cannot hire the people   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 75 of 167       with skills, they have to develop the skills of the good employees they have  We do not capture   that, but it may be one of the ways they are using the cash flow    We have a two-hander    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m in support of a 25 basis point increase today  I   am favoring alternative B, but I want to make some comments about the wording   One of the things I am struggling with, in addition to some of the points everybody has   made around the table, is the apparent presence of a tremendous amount of liquidity in the markets    I look at how much we have raised rates, but the fact that there is so much out there that the banks   are trying to lend and that other markets are trying to invest tells me that there is a lot of liquidity  I   think that the liquidity pressures are an inflationary risk, and that is something that will influence my   decision about whether or not we need to stop  Because of the amount of liquidity out there, I am   not comfortable saying we are there yet   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 133 of 167       The second thing I would like to point out is that I like President Guynn’s new beard,   [laughter] but I also support his recommendation to look more closely at alternative A, line 5  One   of the reasons I like A-5 or something along that line is the use of words like “evolution” and   “implied by incoming information”  Compared with what we now have in line 5, these words give   a different tone—that we are looking at a slow-moving set of data coming in, not one piece of data   and not one series of data  As in every meeting, I heard around the table today that, given the   monthly volatility in all the series we look at, all of us are taking all of these together  We are   smoothing through one-month blips, and words that are closer to “evolution” than to “change” give   us a better sense that we are looking at the whole tone of information coming in  I would like us to   move down that path going forward  I can stick with the wording today, but I think that that kind of   approach may make people less dependent on one series of data in one month in the release    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also liked the format of this meeting—we really   focused on the economics, and then we had more time to talk about policy—and I hope that we stay   with that format  But I also agree regarding the special topics issue  Talking about these topics   does a lot—especially it gives us background  What the staff led us through last summer regarding   housing has been very important as we think about how to deal with housing markets now  So I   think that we need to keep those topics because they are the critical elements of policy going   forward and talking about them gives us time to think about them way ahead of when we may need   to make a decision     So moved    My husband will attest to that  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In preparing for the meeting, one of the things I focused on   was the graph that I like that tracks the staff forecasts over time because I am really torn between where I   see growth going and where I see inflation expectations  In looking at the graph, one can clearly see, if you   look back through Greenbooks to September ’05, that staff forecasts of core PCE inflation have been   basically flat whereas real GDP growth forecasts for this year have increased quite a bit  The ’07 numbers   are stable at a lower inflation rate and a lower growth rate   But what troubles me so much, and somebody already mentioned it, is how much the various   indicators of core inflation have picked up over recent periods in the actual data  As President Lacker   May 10, 2006 62 of 120    mentioned, we have core PCE up 24 percent in the past couple of quarters  We have core CPI up 27   percent  If you look at core GDP prices over the whole of last year, you are running at just under 3 percent   over that period; and that is without what we cannot quite measure yet, which is how much energy prices   are passing through  The longer companies see that energy prices are going to remain high or go even   higher—instead of being just a one-shot hurricane effect—the more likely we are to see some of these   prices being passed through  So I am getting concerned about whether the lagged effects of the monetary   policy changes so far are going to be enough to moderate the inflation that we are now observing to reach   the goal of lower core inflation numbers in ’07   On the real side, one area that I think is critical is the housing market  As you all know, I have   continued to worry about what is going on in housing and mortgages and have wanted to give you another   perspective on what we are observing  Most of you are well aware that we put out some supervisory   guidance for comment awhile back on nontraditional mortgage loans, which include various forms of   interest-only, adjustable-rate, negative-amortization mortgages  If you look at the 2005 earnings reports of   the large mortgage banks and the large savings and loans that do mortgage lending, these institutions have a   really striking amount of interest rate risk embedded in their negative amortization loans  As you know,   most of the product is securitized and sold  So the relative share of these products originated in the last   couple of years that are on the banks’ books is small overall  But the numbers have gotten so bad that now   the setters of accounting standards want banks to disclose how much interest income they are recognizing   as income that they have not collected, through this negative amortization  In other words, they bill the   customer for this interest, but instead of making the customer give them the cash every month, they just add   the amount to the outstanding balance and it creates negative amortization  For some of these big   organizations, the amount represents 5 or 10 percent of net income from last year  So the number is   May 10, 2006 63 of 120    growing, and we are looking to make sure that banks are appropriately putting aside reserves for the portion   that may not be collectible   In the past few weeks, I have become aware that the rising interest rates are creating more problems   for customers in servicing debt  What President Hoenig has observed in Colorado in interest-only   adjustable-rate mortgages is just the beginning  The Greenbook showed how much the subprime sector is   going up; and we know, because ARMs are a big chunk of those mortgages, that it is starting to be felt  As   we go forward and more of these ARMs, especially those that have three-year lock-in periods, start to   reprice, we will be seeing more of it   Now, the mortgage industry, ever creative and ever worrying about the ability of homeowners to   pay amid rising rates, has now decided to create negative-amortization, fixed-rate mortgages  What these   mortgages do is say, “Just borrow for your house  You have a monthly payment, no amortization of   principal, and you do not even have to pay the full fixed rate  We will just continue to add to your   principal, and you pay what you can afford every month versus what you really owe us on the fixed rate   every month”  This process just continues, and one thing that bothers me for the long run is the extent to   which housing could slow this year and slow the economy  I just wonder about the consumer’s ability to   absorb shocks  The buildup of home equity and the ability to borrow against it have helped individual   homeowners when they have had layoffs, medical problems, divorces—all the things in life that create   month-to-month problems for cash flow  With the growth of negative amortization, home equity is not   being built up anymore  Negative amortization clearly helps consumer spending because consumers, in   effect, have a smaller amount of their take-home pay that has to go to the mortgage payment every month,   and so it is available to be spent elsewhere  It is probably a more pernicious type of home equity   withdrawal because you don’t take an action to withdraw it  Now it is planned that you will have negative   amortization  It clearly changes the way we look at the role of savings as a precautionary balance to get the   May 10, 2006 64 of 120    consumer through bad times, and it also has long-run implications regarding the importance of asset values   vis-à-vis default rates both for the banking sector and for the household sector   So the growing ingenuity in the mortgage sector is making me more nervous as we go forward in   this cycle, rather than comforted that we have learned a lesson  Some of the models the banks are using   clearly were built in times of falling interest rates and rising housing prices  It is not clear what may happen   when either of those trends turns around    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support a 25 basis point increase at this meeting, and I like   the changes that have been made to alternative B because I wanted to make sure that we came out of this   with a statement that left our options open at the next meeting   While the recent inflation trends—recent being the last six months or, in other words, from before   the hurricanes to where we are now—have give me a little more anxiety, I can visualize scenarios that will   make us want to pause or stop at the next meeting  That is why I, too, like the words “extent and timing” in   May 10, 2006 94 of 120    line 4 that Governor Olson just cited  That wording allows us to stop or keep going and to choose the   timing  I think the wording there is excellent   “Inflation expectations remain contained”  I have no suggestions about how to change that line, but   after listening to the dialogue around the table, I have to admit that it is the one line that gives me pause    The various measures of core inflation have been running in the upper 2 percent area in the past six months,   and that is above my personal comfort zone  If other folks are looking at those measures, then that is   perhaps partly why we’re getting some of these movements in long-term rates  The wording does leave me   uncomfortable  At least “well” is gone; inflation expectations are now just “contained”  [Laughter]  But   they are contained at a level above what I would be comfortable with  How we change the wording I do not   know, but I agree that that particular phrase in the statement does create some anxiety    Mr Chairman, in number 5, I always felt it was redundant when we had clearly   communicated we were on this long trajectory  But when we are near a turning point or a pausing point, it   is probably more important to remind the market that things can happen that we do not expect, that it is not   a precise forecast, and I find that this sentence is more useful at turns than it is when we are on a long-run   trajectory  So I just do not feel good about taking it out now when we have had it when it was really   redundant     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I continue in my concern, which I expressed at   the last meeting, about the recent pickup in inflation, especially given the news that we’ve had   since the last meeting  In the past three months, core CPI prices and core PCE prices have   grown, respectively, at 38 percent and 34 percent, twice their rate of growth in the previous   three months   It has been interesting to listen to and read the analyses that many folks are doing,   trying to parse the reasons for the jump in the inflation rates, no matter what index people are   following     June 28-29, 2006 78 of 177    The question, as several of you have mentioned, is really whether the reason is persistent   inflation or whether it’s one-off kinds of changes  We’ve already had several thoughts about   how to look at the relation of energy-price increases and their persistence to the rate of inflation    I won’t add any more to what has already been said, but I thought Mr Wilcox had a good   discussion of the owners’ equivalent rent problem  What are we really looking at here?  Some of   the possibilities I found amusing  One of them, for example, pointed out that the index used to   look at the cost of bank services was up significantly because the opportunity cost on demand   deposits had gone up  If that’s the problem, we can cure it by just stopping the raising of rates    [Laughter]  So I do think we need to really focus on where we are  Without being able to really   understand the underlying framework here, I am very concerned about the trend    When I looked at the dramatic drop in forecast growth, at first I became very pessimistic   about the outlook, as several of you have also commented  But the more I looked at the   numbers, the more I came to realize that the reduction is all coming from residential housing   construction  Everything else is basically a push from the last forecast for this year and next   year  When I look at the forecast with that perspective, I see things differently  I’ve been   concerned about the amount of speculation in housing construction throughout the country  To   the extent that what’s coming out of the housing sector is this excess speculation, that’s healthy   both for the long-run economy and for the stability of the financial system  One of our   challenges in looking at some of the recent indicators is to determine whether we will really have   a soft transition to more sustainable long-term growth of new housing or whether the transition   will be bumpier or perhaps more abrupt  A chart in the Greenbook that got my attention was   how rapidly the cancellation of sales orders for new housing had jumped within the past five   months, from its long-run trend of 22 percent since ’95 to a high rate of 30 percent  Some of   June 28-29, 2006 79 of 177    these sales data or permit data that we’re seeing today may mean more additions to excess   inventory, and so we may see more of a blip; that’s something I think we need to watch  I think   we can’t be complacent that a nice easing into long-term sustainable growth of housing is a sure   thing at this point    At the same time, because the drop in the forecast is all housing, the question is how to   look at the relative growth of the rest of the economy  Since on net it’s basically moving the way   it was, I said to myself that I was comfortable with that  But why am I uncomfortable going   forward?  I, too, hear anecdotes about companies’ optimism about what they can do in terms of   increasing revenues and profits    Regarding the capacity issue, we need to realize that a lot of the resources in housing   construction are not necessarily transferable to other sectors, except perhaps to commercial real   estate  That sector is forecast to pick up, and so some of the growth could happen there  But the   inability to transfer resources still raises issues, in terms of both fixed investments and people,   and I don’t believe that the apparent slowdown to below trend, since it is driven by housing   construction, is really going to create much excess capacity  So that situation makes me   concerned about inflation    Finally, I’d like to talk about how housing affects liquidity and monetary policy and our   accommodation  Several of you and the staff said earlier that we have seen a bit of adjustment in   debt spreads since the last meeting—and volatility is up—but we all agree that spreads are still   very narrow by historical standards  Focusing on the staff’s forecast of the flow of funds for the   next two years, I found an interesting thing if you look at what’s happening when housing drops   to the level forecasted in the Greenbook  Households, in borrowing for mortgages, basically   have been the major user of net borrowing in the past couple of years  The forecast is for   June 28-29, 2006 80 of 177    households’ need for funds, the net borrowing, to drop one-third between 2005 and 2007  The   amount by which net household borrowing drops is more than the borrowing by all other sectors   combined last year  So part of the issue is that, because households are such a powerful engine   in net borrowing, there will be plenty of funds available  Also, as to the extent that bank   borrowing and funds provision are forecast to drop, the bankers I talked with said that they aren’t   going to let the amount of loans that they extend drop as much as I think is in that forecast  So I   really believe that the drop in housing is actually on net going to make liquidity available for   other sectors rather than being a drain going forward and that will also get the growth rate more   positive than the current Greenbook forecasts     Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, I support the 25 basis point increase at this   meeting, and as several people have said, I think the real issue is what we signal going forward  Let   me refer to some comments already made and respond to some of my colleagues  President Poole,   I’m sort of right where you are  I’m thinking 50-50 going forward, and so I’m leaning toward the   neutral language that leaves our options open    However, I’m troubled, too, as Governor Kroszner just said, about talking about our position   as restraint at the moment  I see where we are as having removed the excess accommodation  I’m   concerned that if we call this restrictive and if we want to backtrack, it might signal that we’re   easing up again  I think we’re right in the sweet spot, and I don’t really want to characterize it one   way or another because, again, I think we’re where we need to be     The other comment I would make is that we’re still seeing banks loosening lending   standards  There’s plenty of liquidity out there  As Governor Warsh said yesterday, people are   leveraging  Pricing may be restraining, but there is liquidity  Credit spreads are still very, very   minimal  From that perspective, the market, given what they’re seeing day to day in deal-making,   may react by asking how we can call it restrictive   I like President Moskow’s comment about moving up the first sentence of row 4, the first   part about the moderation in growth, to the rationale  As we spoke around the table yesterday, we   June 28-29, 2006 125 of 177    were trying to decide what to do with these signals of inflation—how much of this inflation is   transitory and how much will be worked out as housing cools because, again, that is really where   the slowdown is coming  The slowdown is coming from housing, but that’s what we really wanted   to happen  By having the rates rise, we’ve pulled the hot sector down closer to where we want it to   be  If you look at section 3 of alternative B, we really are laying out why we think inflation is   headed in the right direction  Productivity gains are still good  Unit labor costs, therefore, have   been held down  Inflation expectations are contained  We could add to those points that the   moderation in aggregate demand will also help contain inflation  However, we still have other   pressures  I think the sentence in row 4 supports that rationale, so I like the suggestion that we   move it   I also agree with the suggestion that we take out the first word in the sentence, “readings on   core inflation” and just say “core inflation”  I am open to saying “unwelcome”—it serves as a   signal that we are anchoring expectations  Some numbers as high as 38 are very unwelcome to me,   so I would be glad to stick the word “unwelcome” in there   The only other thing I would say is that in number 4 I would just put a period after “outlook   for both inflation and economic growth”  To get everybody focusing on the outlook is what we’re   all talking about  When we say “data dependent,” we mean that we need the data to validate our   forecast or to modify it  I think the markets look at just the data, and I would just as soon put a   period after “growth”    I was just suggesting a change owing to comments from some of the folks   trying to interpret us  Whenever a piece of data comes out, the market reacts, and that reaction is   part of the volatility  To the extent that the data are anticipated, they are implicit in our forecast, and   we don’t want to imply that every piece of news changes that  I was just trying to respond to those   comments    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think our decision today is going to be a close   call because of the recent information we’ve gotten both on inflation and on the growth of the   economy  We know that, as President Poole and others have mentioned, wage and price   inflation has been accelerating and is fairly broadly based  The recent NIPA revisions also   concern me because of the faster growth in core PCE prices that those data show  The business   surveys, in fact, show that companies feel they have more pricing power than they have had in   the past We know that we are going to have some continuing feed-through of the higher prices   of oil After talking to some folks in the oil industry, I am concerned about the recent Alaska   situation It clearly shows that maintenance of equipment and the efficiency of the operations of   some of these companies may be under stress with the high volumes of capacity at which they   have been running We pray that it doesn’t extend much further in additional surprises   What also concerns me about the NIPA revisions are the changes in the productivity   numbers  The fact that with the NIPA revisions we are seeing lower productivity and faster-  rising labor costs has implications for our forward expectations on inflation  We also see that   August 8, 2006 62 of 158                business investment in equipment and software was much lower  That downward revision   worries me because it implies that less capital deepening has occurred, and that would have been   a strong base to support productivity going forward  Now we apparently cannot rely on it as a   base as much as we could before the revisions   In terms of the housing markets, the rapid escalation of home sale cancellations clearly   has been very surprising Again, the gross sales figures don’t show this, but the information   we’ve got on the cancellations indicates a much more pronounced slowdown than we might have   expected In looking through other housing cycles and in talking to bankers and lenders, one of   the good things I find is that the industry learned in the 1980s  Because those in the industry are   more sophisticated in the way they manage their land costs and their inventory, I think the length   of the cycle is unlikely to be as long  In the 1980s, bankers made plenty of funds available for   companies to continue to develop land and to put in infrastructure  When the housing bubble   burst, all of a sudden we had unsold housing units  They had to be sold before builders could   start building on the developments that had already been laid out, and it took us several years to   work through that This time we don’t have the unfinished inventory of developments that we   had in the ’80s  So I think that the cycle is likely to be much shorter than it was then and that it   will put some firmness in that market  At the same time, this is the sector, aside from energy and   commodities, that had a very rapid rise in prices, and it’s good that we’re seeing some correction   in those prices right now   The other good trend that I take comfort in is the one that Dino mentioned earlier—that   we’re seeing central banks around the world raising rates  When we started raising our rates a   couple of years ago, there weren’t too many moving at the same time we did  We know that   today monetary policy has global effects  Excessive accommodation in some countries clearly   August 8, 2006 63 of 158                                         can affect investments in other countries  So I think we now have support in what we’re doing to   remove accommodation  We’re seeing that support more broadly across the world; and in the   aggregate, then, it will help to moderate inflation in the period going forward  Finally, I’m   reminded that we do have long lags in monetary policy, and we still have to see the full impact of   what we have already put in train Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Well, I’m like everybody else around the table—   I have found the decision about which way to go to be a very tough call  I’m coming down on   the side of a pause right now, partly because I’m more pessimistic than the staff forecast on the   August 8, 2006 102 of 158                            second-order effects of the slowdown in housing  We’re hearing from some bankers that   subprime borrowers especially are having more difficulties and that delinquencies in that sector   are going up Although I don’t see a prolonged problem, as housing slows, the effects are going   to bleed into other sectors, and whether into home furnishings or other things, I think there will   be wider implications  I also think the optimism about the housing sector is so important to   people because it’s a big chunk of their net worth  So I’m just not as positive about the outlook   here   Another concern I have is what is really happening with the disruption of oil supply   around the world I think that situation is potentially more disruptive  We don’t put political   things in our forecasts A good friend in the oil industry is very concerned, aside from the   political risk, about the operating risk in the industry right now, as I mentioned awhile ago  So I   think there is enough uncertainty out there that I’m on the edge, and it’s that uncertainty that   leads me to say, “Let’s take time out and pause”   I like Governor Kohn’s suggestion for the change in alternative B  It’s important that we   signal resource utilization  It’s also important to signal that this is a pause and not a permanent   stop because, when you look at the futures curve, it’s as though the market figures that once we   stop we’re going to stop forever It’s also important that we signal that we are pausing to see   what the lagged effects will be   I would prefer to leave housing in because housing resources aren’t readily   substitutable for other parts of the economy  If we leave resource utilization in, we’re sort of   acknowledging that, although housing is soft, there are still resource pressures in other parts of   the economy  I think the picture is better balanced that way    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, support the broad goals that are laid out here    In thinking about communication, I see that one challenge we will have relates to some of the   dialogue we had today  We set some long-term goals  How do we link those to what we do in   individual meeting actions and decisions?  We already talked about how inflation has been above   our 2 percent top goal for two years, and it is likely to be so for two years more  How would we   explain that when we were trying to go forward?  This is the sort of problem that corporations have   every year, when they set goals for shareholder returns, but then the earnings jump around like   crazy quarter to quarter Well, we’re going to have the same kind of issue It raises the question of   whether we want to talk about how we’re going to get from one place to another  In other words, a   August 8, 2006 136 of 158                                        company can say that they took these big chargeoffs, but that will reduce the cost base, or that they   are making an acquisition  We need to have some real dialogue about what a set goal is going to   mean for our short-run communications after each meeting and for the policy path  It’s the   difference between setting the goal and implementing and executing it effectively  If we can’t   communicate how we intend to implement effectively, then we ought to have second thoughts about   the goals that we’re setting  Since I’ve been here we really haven’t talked a lot about how to tie   those two together   On the forward-looking information—it might have been appropriate back when we started   this 25 basis point step-up each meeting  I’m glad we’re now taking the position that we’re trying   to push the risk back to the market  The market has to make its own forecast of what’s likely to   happen  We need to be clear as to what the key drivers are and pick the few vital elements that we   really all can agree on  We need to communicate that well but make the market judge where those   variables are likely to go in the outlook  I don’t think we do a service to ourselves or to the market   if they feel they can sit back and let us make the call  The moral hazard and other issues there are   simply too great    Can you go back to the GSEs’ use of the early return?  You said they’re   using the term fed funds but not the overnight  So who is using the overnight early returns?   Well, I’m just glad you’re gathering the data     Thank you, Mr Chairman I want to start my remarks today by reflecting on   some results of the latest Duke University CFO survey  This survey is only about six or seven   years old, but the one that was just concluded on September 10 has CFOs’ optimism at the   lowest levels in five years, and so it’s continuing to show an erosion of their confidence  I found   September 20, 2006 73 of 132             the CFOs’ number 1 worry—weak consumer demand—interesting because it wasn’t there   before, and that uncertainty is part of what the CFOs are worrying about  Their second biggest   concern is rising labor costs, which they attribute primarily to the scarcity of labor  They are   anticipating that the scarcity is going to continue to drive labor costs higher  In terms of their   hiring plans, they are planning now to hire fewer people than they hired last quarter  They are   expecting to increase employment over the next twelve months 08 percent; last quarter’s survey   showed 13 percent, so that’s quite a slowdown  However, they’re going to increase outsourced   employment 43 percent  Thus what is showing up is the uncertainty—wanting to use an   adjustable labor force to get the flexibility because of the uncertainty  They are also trimming   their capital spending plans over the next twelve months to 51 percent, compared with 75   percent last quarter Thus the survey indicates that CFOs have growing concern; they are still   optimistic overall, but I think that caution is there   Now, in looking at the numbers myself, I’m perhaps not quite as pessimistic  Again, as   several of you have said—and Dave commented in his remarks—except for housing, the   economy really does look good  As you know, I’ve been worried about the mortgage market and   housing for quite a while In an endeavor to find something good to say, I have noticed that, in   the past couple of months, the Mortgage Bankers Association index of new loan applications for   purchase mortgages looks as though it’s starting to level off  Very often that could be a leading   indicator, so that could be a positive sign However, as some of you have remarked, there’s a lot   of speculation in the housing markets that has to unwind All the folks who bought housing for   investment have to do something as they see housing prices slowing and the financing costs to   carry their investments going up  How that unwinding will occur, given the substantial size of   September 20, 2006 74 of 132                     the speculative positions in some markets, is something that will need very close monitoring  I   know that our supervisory staff is focusing on that, too   People are focusing on the fact that delinquency rates in mortgages still look good    However, we’ve seen a very rapid increase in debt service ratios since 2004  I’m concerned,   again, with the amount of adjustable-rate mortgages out there that will reprice in the months   ahead If, as we think, some of these loans, particularly subprime loans, were made mainly on   the collateral value of the house and not on the affordability of the mortgage, we could see more   distress in the borrowers’ markets coming forward  If that’s the case, it could have spillover   effects on consumer spending more broadly   On the positive side, payroll growth has been good in the past three months—128,000  It   has picked up a bit, and it is significantly above the Greenbook forecast, and that gives me some   optimism  It’s putting more income in people’s pockets to spend, and the unemployment rate   has been stable Hourly earnings, however, are rising faster  While that acceleration can support   consumer spending, it contributes to my concern about where we’re going in the long run on   inflation   As I look at the Greenbook forecasts since May, we’ve been continuing to project more   and more inflation going forward  The private sector has basically been doing that in their   forecasts as well When I look at those forecasts, I’m concerned that for various reasons we have   reduced our estimates of the trend rate of growth  As we bring down the trend rate of growth—   and I realize that, as several have said, we’re at the lower end of the private-sector growth   forecasts—I worry about the disconnect  Are we seeing a slowdown in potential that others   aren’t? Or if we’re right that potential growth is lower and the private forecasters are right that   real growth is going to be faster, then we could have more inflation pressures going forward  For   September 20, 2006 75 of 132                        the first time, we are also looking at prices in 2008, and they continue to rise at over 2 percent    They’ve been over 2 percent for two years I worry, from the standpoint of our credibility, about   what having such a long period above 2 percent means  So I believe we will see moderation of   inflation, but I think it’s important to preserve our flexibility and be able to respond if these   worst-case scenarios that I laid out become more troubling to us going forward     Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, I support no change today  I do not believe   there has been enough information to change my mind from the last meeting  I support alternative   B because I am concerned that B+ is more of a commitment that we are going to do something, and   I am not ready to go that far  However, I agree with President Minehan’s comments that the   long-term inflation level above 2 percent, especially now that we have 2008 in the forecast, is   worrisome because of where we are with resource utilization and potential growth and the potential   September 20, 2006 110 of 132                                             conflict that I see there  I also remember that I was very nervous when inflation was dropping  It   was below 1 percent  Going between the short-run spikes down and short-run spikes up gets one   nervous So not only do we need to think about the range, but also we need to think about what we   mean by the medium term in which to gauge it  I look forward to this discussion because it may   help me put those thoughts together at the next meeting  But for today’s meeting, I favor alternative   B as it is and no change in rates     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Well, again, as some of you have said, in five   weeks we don’t have a whole lot of new information  But I’m coming back and starting with   housing again  As you know, that continues to be something I watch  Let me just make a few   comments and give you recent feedback from some exams and dialogues with brokers that I’d   like to share with you  Looking at both starts and permits, we all know that housing is   continuing to soften in terms of construction, and we have also identified the increasing number   of contract cancellations for new housing  Someone mentioned earlier the noise that we may be   having around housing data, and I get this through some of the anecdotal conversations that I’ve   had with folks  One topic was the inventory of existing housing for sale  I’m hearing from a   couple of real estate brokers that people who may have wanted to sell their homes or may have   put them up for sale are withdrawing them from the market  They don’t need to move, and it   isn’t worthwhile for them to move if they don’t get the price they want  I think the supply was   possibly bigger than what we’re really measuring, and so we’re seeing some understating of   October 24-25, 2006 60 of 203    what desired house sales would be in terms of inventory  That’s continuing; it is just beginning   at this stage, at least in a couple of regions, according to folks with whom I’ve talked   One of the challenges that we’re faced with here is that—again, I try to look for the good   news—in the housing purchase process, people file applications for mortgages very often before   they qualify to buy the house  When you look at the Mortgage Bankers Association data on   purchase mortgage applications, as I mentioned before, they dropped 20 percent from their peak   of last summer, but in the past few months they have been leveling off  So if applications are a   leading indicator, we may begin to see some moderation in housing purchases  However, the 20   percent drop in purchase mortgage applications means that mortgage brokers are earning a lot   less income  If they don’t close a transaction, most of them get no paycheck because three out of   four mortgages are originated not in financial institutions but by independent brokers  We’re   beginning to see increasing evidence of this in terms of the quality of mortgages that are out   there  We continue to track the mortgages that have vintages—in other words, that were   originated—in 2005, and we are continuing to see that, as these mortgages age, the early   delinquencies for these are greater than early delinquencies for similar-aged mortgages of earlier   vintages, which implies a loosening of underwriting standards and more stress on the borrowers   We are also seeing in a small way increased predatory activity with loans  Certain   practices have been described to me lately with new products, such as the 2-28 mortgage, which   is fixed for two years and then escalates and becomes an ARM tied to LIBOR in the third year    But don’t worry—you can refinance it with the broker and bring your payment down and do it   all over again  We’re seeing those kinds of things—mortgages for which people are being   qualified by brokers with no escrow account; all of a sudden taxes are due, and borrowers don’t   have the money for them  So predatory lending is rearing its head at the lower end of the scale,   October 24-25, 2006 61 of 203    and it’s something we have to continue to watch for  However, before I leave housing, let me   just say that the bottom line is that overall mortgage credit quality is still very, very strong    We’re seeing predatory lending only in pockets of the market   I continue to believe that the rest of the economy—except for autos, I should add—is still   very strong  Consumer spending is good, and business fixed investment is very sound  The   moderation in energy prices and the growth in consumer income will continue to add support to   the economy going forward  Jobless claims have been low and moving in a very narrow range   the past few months  As several of you have mentioned, I’m hearing more concern by corporate   executives about the inability to hire the talent they need to meet their business plans, and so I’m   seeing more indication of tightness in labor markets   Turning to inflation, as many of you have said, core inflation has moderated from the   pace in the third quarter  But going forward in the Greenbook forecast, it is still showing   significant persistence even though we think we will be growing, at least for a period, below   potential  That concerns me because that level is higher than I’m comfortable with in the long   run  We might have had some spillover effects from rising commodity and energy prices earlier   on, but I was hoping at this point that, with the reversing, we would see more-positive spillover   effects that would mitigate inflation  So I am very worried about inflation  At the same time, I   know that negative spillover effects on growth due to the rapid decline in housing construction   and the moderating house-price appreciation are risks, which we cannot dismiss, to growth; but   on net I am still much more concerned about the persistence of inflation  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, I support leaving the fed funds rate unchanged   at this meeting  I’ve puzzled over section 2, and I like what Governor Kohn has suggested because   one of the challenges I have had in this whole thing is what I heard around the table yesterday,   which in general supports the conclusion I’ve been coming to  We really are going from very rapid   October 24-25, 2006 111 of 203    growth to slowing, but if you parse out the pieces, what’s really changing is housing  The rapid   growth from 2003 to 2005 was due to unsustainable housing construction; it’s coming down, and   it’s a big chunk of that change  Now, other sectors have noise or are weak  Sectors like autos and   exports are jumping around, but it’s housing that has to adjust  I think it’s going to run below trend   as the Greenbook says  At the same time, as we all were mentioning yesterday, we have tightness   in the labor market, which again signals that in most sectors of the economy it’s hard to find people   who are available to work to sustain the economy  It’s almost as though we have a dichotomy right   now whereby housing is running below trend but the rest of the economy is running at or above   potential  So I think it’s important to leave in the comment about the housing sector—that is what   we’re focusing on  To me that is bringing the aggregate number below potential and is moderating   the growth rate  But in terms of the way to go on section 2, I can go either way  I do like the   change that Governor Kohn suggested in section 3  I think that is a good change  I believe that we   should not change section 4, the assessment of risk, at this meeting  It has been only five weeks    We’ve had a discussion about changing more frequently; again, I think we ought to leave that to the   communications subcommittee to think about  But I think we ought to leave it as it is because it   says what we really mean  The first sentence says that there are inflation risks, and that’s a sense   that we need to convey  Too much could be read into a change that may be unintended, and so I’d   rather just at this meeting leave it the way it was at the previous meeting  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As you know, since we’ve started talking about   this issue, I’ve been undecided—“open-minded” is perhaps another way to say it  Wearing my   supervisor’s hat, I see that we’ve been talking to players in the markets about how important   transparency is to the effective functioning of financial markets and to financial transactions  So   it’s hard for me to give a rationale for why the central bank is not more transparent  Being part   October 24-25, 2006 172 of 203    of a democracy means that for us as a central bank—especially since we weren’t directly elected   by the citizens—transparency is very important     However, the unintended consequences of what setting a goal would mean have always   held me back  That’s why I support the process that has been laid out here  We really do need to   take the time to think through all the consequences and, as best we can, identify some possible   unintended consequences  So the evolutionary approach—let’s look at it all together before we   decide—I very strongly endorse because, at the end of the day, our credibility is paramount—it   is something that we have to cherish as much as we possibly can   I also want to think a little more about the dual mandate issue as we go forward  I tend to   believe that having a more explicit target and continuing to achieve low and consistent inflation   will, in effect, support and encourage growth and full employment  So the issue may be one of   communicating that relationship  I really feel strongly about this  I have no empirical basis but   just fifteen years as a corporate CFO  One disconnect that you have as a CFO in the corporate   world is that you live in a world of nominal, not real, rates of growth  You worry about growth   of earnings per share, and you want to know what your top-line revenue is going to do, so you   think about prices and output  Having a nominal anchor for inflation would actually support   corporate decisionmaking, give people better discipline about pricing power versus riding the   wave of inflation, alert them when inflation is below target, and make them understand that this   could be a short-run downturn in top-line revenue growth  When I think back to the ’80s, a lot of   companies thought top-line growth was stupendous, and it took their eyes away from really   working and operating efficiently  So I think that having a nominal anchor would actually   enhance the real-world tie between our role as the central bank and corporation decision   processes   October 24-25, 2006 173 of 203    Again putting on my supervisory hat, I think that one of the critical things as we state this   objective is that we clearly say how financial stability fits in  We’ve been talking about central   banks moving more and more to inflation targeting, but they have also been focusing more and   more on financial stability and the role of the central bank in financial stability  That is one of   the implementation issues we need to think through  What is the framework in which we will   look at financial stability, and where might it conflict with our price objectives and inflation   objectives?   Regarding how we would choose an inflation objective, I am very leery of one of the   proposals in the staff memo to use longer-term forecasts  I agree with Governor Mishkin that we   can improve the Monetary Policy Report, but making longer forecasts is fraught with a lot of   risk, and I don’t really see there’s much benefit to it  After all, our objective is not to be the best   forecasters in the world  It’s to control inflation  So I don’t think it adds a whole lot of value    As President Yellen said, everybody will be asking, “What are the underlying assumptions?”  It   will get us sidetracked away from our overall objectives  I prefer the alternative in the staff   memo that the way forward is what we did years ago when we took the rates of growth and   money supply, and we just surveyed all of us  Maybe along the lines suggested a bit earlier, we   just say, “Here is the range of price objectives”  Just announcing a long-term forecast doesn’t   clearly say what the objective is  If we want to set an objective, let’s set an objective and not just   give a long-run forecast   Another part of setting an objective is spending a lot of time thinking about the time   frame over which we are going to achieve it  Saying that this is our long-run objective is one   thing  It’s very different to say how quickly we’re going to return to the goal when we move   away from that goal  In the discussion around the table yesterday, many of us said that inflation,   October 24-25, 2006 174 of 203    even in the forecast, is running a bit higher than our comfort zone  We know we’ve been above   it for a couple of years, but with this forecast we’ll be above our comfort zones for five years  In   effect, having an objective—and knowing what each other’s objectives are—would have   changed the discussion we had around the table  If we really believe that we’re above our   comfort zone, then how can we make the decisions we’re making?  What is the path?  That   would have implications for the staff  If we really want to hit an objective, strategy, as President   Plosser said, is the real issue  How do you execute?  We can all set great goals, but it’s   execution that matters  A nominal objective would force the staff to spend a lot more resources   in talking about the path of policy and the way we would respond to variations around that path    That perhaps could actually improve decisionmaking   Finally, getting back to the transparency issue, I think an explicit objective would put   good governance around us, particularly in the difficult times when we are varying from our   objectives, because we would have to talk about the tradeoffs we have with our dual mandates or   financial stability concerns or whatever is creating a long-run deviation from that path  So I   come back to my thought that the effort to look at this is worthwhile, but I really encourage us to   think about all the consequences as we go forward     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Dino, regarding the last graph you showed,   leveraged-loan growth, especially in the share held outside banks, has been happening even   though, as you show, high-yield bond issuance really has been running in a fairly normal range    What is making these loan deals so much more attractive to investors?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I thought I’d start today talking a bit about   housing markets and the condition of banks right now  As many of you have noticed, some of us   are optimistic that we may be approaching a bottom in the housing market  I think we’ll see that   bottom in housing sales long before we see it on the construction side because there’s a large   amount of inventory still to work through  But as we’ve noted, the applications for purchasing   mortgages have been level since midyear  The growth in mortgage credit has slowed   significantly from where it was in the past two years, dropping to only 10 percent growth this   past quarter, a growth rate that is significantly above the growth of personal income and that   most of us in the past would have considered to be alarming    Part of what’s amazing in all of this is that in 2004 and 2006, particularly toward the end   of that period, purchase money seconds, by which people borrowed the downpayments for   December 12, 2006 62 of 134         homes, were a big part of mortgage financing  Banks are still getting some of this business and   putting it on their balance sheets, and it is part of the growth of what you’re seeing the banks   funding  But it is at a pace that I think needs to be adjusted  I’m saying that, although the   number of applications may have bottomed out, the amount of leverage in each housing deal may   still need some correction going forward, and so we may see some slowdown in the volume of   dollars that are funded through mortgage lending    Delinquency rates are really, really low by historical standards  The one sector that has   had a jump in delinquencies is subprime ARMs, and clearly the jump is related to rates that have   already reset  We’ve got more to come  Even though these have jumped, they’re still not at   alarming levels  But it’s something that I think the banks are watching very, very carefully    One thing I’m hearing more from some folks who have been investing in mortgage-  backed securities and maybe in some CDOs (collateralized debt obligations), where they’ve been   tranched into riskier positions through economic leverage, is the realization that a lot of the   private mortgages that have been securitized during the past few years really do have much more   risk than the investors have been focusing on  I’m hearing this from folks who understand that   the quality of what goes into those pools varies tremendously when you don’t have the Fannie   Mae and Freddie Mac framework for the underwriting  When a mortgage is originated through a   bank, we do a lot through safety and soundness supervision to make sure, if a bank is buying   loans from brokers, that the loans are underwritten in a sound manner and are therefore   affordable to the borrower when they’re undertaken  We’re seeing that some of the private-label   mortgage-backed securities are having very high early default rates or delinquencies in the   mortgages, which usually means that the originator has to buy them back out of the pools  There   isn’t a whole lot of transparency in the disclosures around some of these bonds, and some of the   December 12, 2006 63 of 134         brokers are underwriting products that have very high early default rates, which is something that   investors are starting to focus on  As more products are generated outside the banking sector,   they get funneled to pools through broker-dealers as opposed to the banks  I think that we’re   missing a level of due diligence regarding brokers, who may not be doing a good job  As you all   know, the fraud rate on mortgages has tripled in the past two years  So I think we could see   noise in some of the mortgage-backed private deals and some of the riskier CDO economic   leverage positions    Bank earnings are really, really strong overall, especially by historical standards  Banks   are making a lot of layoffs connected with the mortgage business  They are taking steps to get   costs—whether related to originations, post-loan closings, or payoff administration—under   control  Net interest margins, however, continue to be under significant pressure  I’m hearing   more from banks that, since we’ve stopped raising rates, they’ve lost the nice little lag effect—  the ability to wait for us to move before lagging along  In other words, they have lost that   lagniappe in their liability cost that has helped them with their margin pressures  So those   pressures are going to be more of a challenge for them, especially with a flat or inverted yield   curve, depending on where they’re funding and lending  Loan-loss provision continues to be the   best in many, many years  No one really expects it to jump, but clearly it can’t get a whole lot   better than it is, and so that will also present challenges going forward    As for the economy as a whole, I, too, want to compliment President Yellen because I   think she did a fantastic job of helping us think about the different signals we’re getting  When I   looked again at the graph that I love in the Greenbook that shows where our forecast has been, I   was struck that we’ve seen the forecast of GDP growth continuing to moderate in the past several   months but our expectations of inflation are actually flat to up a bit  To me that raises questions   December 12, 2006 64 of 134         about the tradeoff that we really have when we are running below capacity and below potential   growth rates  The bit of softness that I’m hearing about from some of my contacts in sectors   outside housing and mortgages warns me that we need to be a little more vigilant than I had been   expecting about growth maybe softening in a broader sense  But the fact that inflation continues   to be above 2 percent in the forecast period is something that does concern me, and I think part   of my concern relates to the tremendous amount of liquidity that sits out there in the banking   sector, in the US financial markets, and clearly globally  The presence of this liquidity is   something that we really need to think about  It’s not back to where it was in my money supply   days, when I started my career at the St Louis Fed; but I do worry that liquidity is, as some of   you have said, causing a lot of transactions to occur that economically perhaps wouldn’t   otherwise occur  That is also something we need to watch very carefully     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support leaving the rate unchanged today because   I still believe that the risks are to the upside on inflation and so we need to persevere at this level for   a while  In terms of the wording, I want to offer another alternative  [Laughter]  I’m concerned that   in exhibit 5, alternative B, we’ve added “substantial” to housing and have noted weaker indicators    Yet the view around the table—and clearly my own view—is that the indicators have been mixed    A lot of strength is still showing  Consumer spending looks good  Employment looks good  If we   want to talk about indicators, I would prefer some words that deal with President Plosser’s   comments and say that “although recent economic indicators have been mixed, the economy seems   likely to expand at a moderate pace on balance over the coming quarters” because that’s what we’re   December 12, 2006 107 of 134         really saying  There’s some good news and there’s some bad news  By focusing just on the   negative, I think we are signaling that we’re more concerned about a slowdown  I at least think that   is inconsistent with a tilt of risk toward inflation  So I would do something along that line or go   back to exhibit 4, which basically just recognizes that in the aggregate the economy has slowed a   bit; but I’m uncomfortable with addressing only the weakness and not the strength     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like several of you, I’m going to focus on   housing and what we’re seeing in the banking sector and in mortgage performance  Since the   last meeting, I am feeling better about the housing market in the aggregate  It looks as though   home sales are stabilizing for the fourth quarter  On the whole, home sales actually did go up a   bit  The inventory of new homes for sale has now fallen for five months through December, and   mortgage applications for home purchases continue to move above the levels of last summer,   when they hit bottom  The National Association of Realtors is estimating that existing home   sales have already bottomed out, and homebuilder sentiment improved in three of the four past   months  But even if sales really have stabilized, the inventory of homes for sale still must be   worked down before construction and growth resume in this market  Given that some existing   homes have likely been pulled off the market in light of slower sales and moderating housing   prices, this inventory correction period will probably continue into 2008  I think this is   particularly true in markets such as Florida, as First Vice President Barron mentioned, where a   large amount of speculative investment occurred during the boom period—with three to five   years of excess construction from the investor side  So those homes still have to be worked   through    Asset quality in the consumer sector as a whole is very good  We have come through one   of the most benign periods  The exception, as Bill mentioned in his presentation earlier today, is   January 30-31, 2007 74 of 255    the subprime market  When you dissect it, you see that prime mortgage delinquencies are flat   and subprime mortgages at a fixed rate are flat  The whole problem is in subprime ARMs, which   are running into difficulties  The four federal regulatory agencies are looking harder at some of   these subprime products  We started reviewing 2/28 mortgages, and now we’re looking at and   testing some other products  We’re finding that the issues are getting more troublesome the   further we dig into these products  To put the situation in perspective, subprime ARMs are a   very small part of the whole mortgage market  As Vincent mentioned, subprime is about 13   percent, and the ARM piece of the subprime is about half to two-thirds, so we’re talking perhaps   around 8 percent of the aggregate mortgages outstanding  We’re seeing that the borrowers who   got into these during the teaser periods now are seeing tremendous payment shocks  For   example, 2/28s that are going from the fixed two-year period to the adjustment period basically   had their interest rates double, so they’re going from a 5 percent handle to a 10 percent handle,   and the borrowers don’t have the discretionary income to absorb that  This type of mortgage was   sold to a lot of subprime borrowers on the idea that they are lending vehicles to repair credit   scores  You will show that you are going to pay during the early period, and then you can   refinance and get a lower long-term rate, so you’ll never pay the jump  But we’re finding that   some of these mortgages have significant prepayment penalties, and so to refinance and get the   better terms, some borrowers are getting into difficulty  Because of the moderation in housing   prices, these borrowers haven’t built up enough equity to absorb the prepayment penalty  So the   problem stems from a combination of factors  There are a lot of spins on these products, but   we’re trying to take an approach based on principles in looking at what’s really happening    I also want to mention that, although the ownership of the mortgages is very diffuse and   so we’re not seeing any real concentrated risk, particularly in banking, we do need to pay more   January 30-31, 2007 75 of 255    attention to where the mortgage-servicing exposures are  The servicing of these mortgages that   are securitized is concentrated in certain institutions  Clearly, when you have such a high level   of delinquencies and potential defaults, all profitability in servicing is gone  So there could be   some charge-offs in these securitized mortgages  Also, I think all of you have noticed the   number of mortgage brokers that have closed up shop in the past six months because they   couldn’t get enough liquidity or capital to repurchase the early defaults of these recent pools    That is really shrinking the origination pocket  I should also say that, with the exception of the   subprime ARM mortgages, we feel very good about overall credit quality      When I look at the economy as a whole, I also see that except for housing construction   and autos, the rest of the economy is sound  The recent growth in employment and the strong   wage growth give me comfort that the income growth of consumers is there to mitigate some of   the wealth effects that we may have with moderating housing prices  But I also share the   concerns that some of you mentioned here, and that President Yellen spoke of in a speech, about   the issue regarding productivity trends and wage growth, and determining how fast the economy   is growing  Productivity is going to have to grow faster to absorb the higher wage growth,   particularly as employment growth continues strong, and I think the slack in the skilled labor   force is getting very, very limited    When I think, in aggregate, about the data since our last meeting, I feel a little better   about inflation because it appears to be moderating, but I’m not jumping for joy because we need   a few more months  However, the growth information has been, instead of mixed as at the last   meeting, generally stronger, and that does make me feel better  In net, then, based on the recent   information, I’m even a bit further along on the side that the risks have moved higher for   inflation than on the side of the risk of a slowdown in the economy  Thank you, Mr Chairman   January 30-31, 2007 76 of 255      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor keeping rates unchanged today, and I favor   the language in alternative B in all the sections  Trying to be cautious, looking at the numbers that   just came out, and reflecting back to yesterday’s discussion about the NAIRU, last night I looked   some more at the exhibit 5 that the staff presented yesterday  I looked at the bottom right panel,   which shows the labor force participation rate of those over 62  There are a lot of us baby boomers,   and we’re generally healthy folks, and it really is unclear what we’re going to do  The baby   boomers have changed participation in the labor force throughout our generation  We were the   generation that brought women into the labor force  We now are going to live twenty years after   age 65, and we’re not going to sit idle because we’re going to be healthier and we have a lot of   skills  The additional skill set that we have could actually mitigate the shortage of some skilled   workers  Folks probably want more flexibility  They don’t want to be on a payroll, but they may   want to take a job now and then or work on a contract  Whatever historical NAIRU patterns we   have, they are going to be tested by the changing labor force participation due to the baby boomers    That’s a big unknown, but it clearly affects potential growth, the output gap, and inflation pressures    So I really don’t want to signal anything  This will play out over a long period, but it is the reason,   when I look at the “Lower NAIRU” alternative scenario in the Greenbook, that I read it as “higher   January 30-31, 2007 116 of 255    participation rate,” and I want to be cautious  That’s why I can’t go to alternative C  I don’t want to   signal as much worry about inflation  I also want to be careful that we don’t go as strong as calling   something “rebounding” because I don’t want people to think we’re going to go back to mid-3   percent growth rates with housing still as soft as it is on a sustained basis  We do still need to watch   housing  The strong job market will put legs under the growth side of this, and I like the changes   that were made in section 2  I think firmer growth is exactly what we want to talk about, so I like   the tone that we’ve set in the changes in B    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me just make an introductory remark, and   then I’m going to go through these questions fairly quickly  First, I’ve heard different reasons   here for our looking at change  One issue is to improve the credibility of the Fed  The point   about credibility that I’d like to make is that it is a trust issue  You earn trust by demonstrating   that you can achieve the objectives of your organization  I think we have credibility  Whether or   not we put out a forecast, our credibility is precious  If we don’t demonstrate our ability to   control the inflationary pace, we’re going to lose that credibility whether or not we have a   forecast  Accountability, too, is important  We are a central bank in a democracy, and whatever   we can do to enhance transparency—to let folks understand how we come about our policy   choices—is important  I use the word “enhance”—President Lacker or someone else used it   earlier, but I like the word—because it says that things are going well  We always have ways in   which we can improve, and we should be looking at change on the margin, not major changes    I also agree with Government Mishkin and a few others that the strength of the way the   central bank is set up in this country is the diversity of viewpoints  We not only get different   regional inputs, we also have people from different backgrounds sitting around this table,   whether they are PhD economists and experts in monetary policy, experts in Reserve Bank   operations, or folks from the private sector  We all come at monetary policy from a different   perspective  For that reason, if we go forward in this vein, I support individual forecasts and   retaining that diversity of viewpoints  Therefore, I don’t support any common assumptions    Each of us should be free to choose the framework in which we produce our forecasts  I worry   that forcing common assumptions sort of forces convergence, and I would not be likely to   support that   January 30-31, 2007 188 of 255     I feel strongly that the most important part of issuing a forecast is the narrative  If we just   put numbers out, I don’t know what value added we have  The numbers in the Greenbook don’t   vary a whole lot in most of the scenarios, but the narratives give a different flavor  As you read   through the scenarios, you can say, “Well, I feel strongly this way,” but the model doesn’t   produce a whole lot of difference  So I think it’s essential that we talk more about it in a   narrative form  That qualitative aspect really adds value to a forecast, particularly with the   diversity of views that may occur from time to time  In terms of how we do the narrative, the   proposal that Vice Chairman Geithner circulated is a good framework that we could use to start    Again, if we do that before the meeting, it may help the timeliness of the communication  It   should come out at the same time as the numbers, whether it’s tied to the minutes or tied to the   Monetary Policy Report  It is part of the overall process    As for technical aspects of the forecast—again, based on the comments about staff work,   I agree that we need to keep things simple  Twice a year is sufficient, at least initially, partly   because we shouldn’t overcommunicate the ability of monetary policy to fine-tune short-term   variations in inflation and monetary policy  I think about my life as a corporate CFO and the   frustration of being held quarter to quarter to the results of a company when so much is going on   and you are managing the long term successfully  For that reason, and because the lags in   monetary policy are so long, I think we’re overcommitting—whether to the Congress, the   general public, or the markets—about our ability to implement and affect markets by doing too   short a forecast period or too frequent a forecast  However, going forward I would lean toward   what we have now in the forecast and not go out longer  I understand that people want to go out   further because they think that doing so signals what our long-run real objectives are  But if we   want to set an objective, let’s just set the objective rather than having a longer-term forecast   January 30-31, 2007 189 of 255    because out in the long run we’re more prone to volatility and because timing, too, will be more   of an issue  I also would favor just the three variables that are related to our mandate from the   Congress—inflation, real GDP, and the unemployment rate—varieties of which are to be   determined, but they should be tied to the mandate  Down the road we could add more, but for   now let’s keep it to those three    I think it’s important to communicate uncertainty surrounding the forecast, and I would   do that with regard to two dimensions  First, whatever the consensus, in the five years that I’ve   been here, there have been periods when we did not know how far policy was going to have to   go  One instance was when we started down the path of raising interest rates, we knew we were   going to go at a measured pace and we clearly signaled for a long period that this was where we   were going and that we felt confident that a 1 percent funds rate was too low  We were not sure   of the stopping point, but we knew we had a long way to go  Second, regarding the central   tendency, it is important to signal a rise in uncertainty around turning points—that our forecasts   about them depend a lot on incoming data  If in the Committee we have an outlier or really   different viewpoints, we need to spend a bit more time in a narrative explaining why we have a   difference of views    The only other comment I would make is that, in thinking about the alternatives and the   variability around them, it will be a challenge to communicate that effectively  So we should, as   some suggested, do a few dry runs  I’ve been spending a lot of time recently on Basel II, Pillar   III, disclosures regarding uncertainty and risk  Looking at what we really can control through   monetary policy and differentiating that from other things going on, the style that we choose in   talking about uncertainty and risk regarding the forecast will be very important  So I think it   would be good if we practice that communication a little first  Thank you, Mr Chairman   January 30-31, 2007 190 of 255
