4483,2001-12-11, Thank you  
4484,2001-12-11," Well, given my long tenure of a long weekend and a day to look at this   information, I won’t pretend to be as up-to-date on many of the series as the experts around the table   But I wanted to bring to the table some observations I’ve noted, which are more from an anecdotal   perspective of the business community and the banking community     First, my main concern regarding where we are in this business cycle is where we are on the   business investment side  The reason is that I believe what got us into the recession was the drastic   drop in investment in certain key technology sectors  I feel optimistic that inventory corrections are   well under way in that sector and that we may actually begin to see some stabilization in sales     The consumer has really kept the economy going in this cycle  We can see that both in   housing and in auto sales, even though I believe a lot of the recent auto sales represent a timing   difference due to the attractive financing programs  But the consumer has been using the refinancing   of homes as a way to increase disposable income every month, and we know that the pool of   mortgages that can be profitably refinanced by consumers is dwindling  In fact, I would argue that the   recent uptick in refinanced mortgages is what we normally see when long-term mortgage rates begin   to go up, as the astute refinancers jump in and lock in rates that they believe have hit their lows  So, I   don’t believe we’re going to see much more of an increase in spendable income coming from the   consumer  And obviously, as many others have said, the threat of terrorism may put a damper on the   consumer, as will unemployment worries   The other sector that concerns me--and I say this in light of recent personal experiences--is   state and local governments due to the financial stress currently being placed on them, particularly in   areas that depend a great deal on sales tax revenues and on revenues tied to the employment situation   Those entities are having to spend substantial sums to support responses to potential terrorism   activities     12/11/01 67    Finally, most corporate executives I talk with feel that they have very little ability to raise   prices at this time  In fact, they’re feeling more pressure to cut prices, as has already been discussed,   to deal with inventory accumulation and excess capacity  So I find very little pressure on inflation at   the moment  "
4485,2001-12-11," I support the recommendation, but I do also support the comments that other   people have made about beginning to signal that this may be one of our last easing actions  "
4534,2002-03-19," I agree with what President Santomero said  I am very concerned, and my   biggest concern is creating liquidity in a foreign market instrument  From a public policy   perspective, when there are liquidity issues in US markets, I think we’d have a real problem   answering the question of why we chose to build liquidity in a market for foreign securities  I do   believe that the priority should be on the contingency planning, though  We pray that nothing   else like September 11 happens again  But with what is going on in the Middle East, I don’t     March 19, 2002 Page 23 of 117  think we can ignore the contingency planning  In my view that should be our immediate   concern, and I would feel strongly about putting that at the top of the list     I support the recommendation, including the fact that I think the vote should   be in the announcement as opposed to just available separately  We get electronic information   nowadays, and it’s easier for everybody to see it at the same time and in the same document  "
4535,2002-03-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman  The information we’ve all seen since the last   meeting indicates that the recovery is here  In fact, I question whether the word “recovery” is   appropriate for the events we’ve been through and whether we really did have a recession  It   clearly has been shallow and not a “V” or a “U”  I think its shape has been a bit more like a   saucer I’ve been focusing on some of the manufacturing and trade inventory information, and   I’ve been surprised at how fast inventory liquidation has occurred  Importantly, as a couple of   people have already mentioned, the inventory-sales levels are back to where they were in the   early months of 2000, which was the beginning of this slowdown  That would imply that   business inventory positions are in good shape, and I think industrial production is already   picking up in response to that   In common with Governor Gramlich, the new fiscal stimulus package makes me wonder   exactly what the target is  This recession was unique in that it was caused by excess business   investment in selected areas  So to encourage more spending in the areas that already have   excess investment seems to me a peculiar type of recovery medicine  Based on anecdotal reports   from business people I’ve talked to as I’ve been traveling to some of your Banks and other   meetings I’ve attended, I wonder if a lot of the excess capacity that appears to be out there is   excess capacity that is permanently shut down and will never come back  If that’s the case, it              March 19, 2002 Page 76 of 117  will have implications also for investment going forward and—perhaps even more importantly—   for productivity, since the idle capacity is likely to involve the least productive resources   Consumer spending is continuing to grow, even adjusting for the unusual wave that was   created between the fourth quarter and the first quarter due to automobile sales promotions    Consumer disposable income looks good  Income tax refunds are running way above where they   were last year, reflecting I think both the tax cuts and over-withholding as consumers’ incomes   fell during 2001   The productivity improvement in the fourth quarter in many ways shows that businesses   were surprised by the level of final demand in that quarter  As we normally see during a   recovery, productivity has increased The pessimism about final demand that CEOs have shown   throughout this period is one of the reasons that productivity has been so strong  CEOs believed   that if they couldn’t control the top line, then the only way to meet their profit goals was to deal   with the expense line In fact, the more policymakers use words like “recovery,” the more I   think that will tend to make CEOs and business people even more pessimistic, since obviously   none of us around the table believes that the recovery from this period of slowdown will be   anything like the recovery from a typical recession  So any CEO who is expecting a bounceback   comparable to those experienced in past recessions is going to be sorely disappointed         Finally, in terms of employment, if the unemployment peak is supposed to signal when   we should start to change direction, then I would say that December was that peak  I find it   interesting that we now have discussions of a high unemployment rate at 5½ percent and a long-  term NAIRU at 5¼ percent  I would echo the comments of my esteemed colleague, the   President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, who suggested that in determining the                                                                        March 19, 2002 Page 77 of 117  appropriate policy stance as we move forward we should look again at the NAIRU of 5¼ percent   when our long-term inflation forecast is running well below 2 percent    I support your recommendations, and I particularly like the comment about   policy being accommodative  "
4594,2002-05-07," At this meeting I continue to believe that the consumer is the mainstay of the   economy  And with disposable income back near pre-September 11 levels, I expect the   consumer to continue to be the mainstay even though, as we said earlier in the day, consumer   confidence could be very fragile given the news on the political front and on unemployment  For   real GDP growth, I agree with the forecast of much slower growth in the second quarter, as   inventory reductions appear to be ending and the recovering economy widens our trade deficit                May 7, 2002 58 of 81  Final sales growth will also slow somewhat in the second quarter, as increased federal   government spending remains at its higher level and state and local governments continue to   restrain spending to meet falling revenues  In the last half of the year, GDP will advance at a   faster pace, I expect, as continued growth in final sales requires businesses to meet demands   from production rather than inventory liquidation  And the fact that manufacturing production   has now risen for three months, for the first time since late in the year 2000, has me expecting to   see more production growth ahead     Given the level of excess capacity and the lack of pricing power by businesses, expense   controls will still be the driver of profit recovery  This will continue to keep productivity high,   and employment growth will lag until business confidence is restored  As a result, wage costs   should advance very slowly, and inflation should remain well under 2 percent for the rest of the   year So for the time being, I don’t feel that we need to make a change in our policy stance from   the past meeting   I do have a longer-term concern, though, that I’m becoming increasingly worried about    We have seen a lack of business investment for over eighteen months now  And much of the   productivity growth that we’re enjoying currently is due to the innovation-investment cycles   associated with the extremely high levels of investment in the late 1990s and at the beginning of   the year 2000 The lack of current investment is going to slow the innovation-investment cycle   and that, in turn, will harm sales growth that is related to product innovation and introduction  It   also will set the stage for a slowdown in productivity due to business process improvements    These types of investment cycles take many years to become effective  They go from planning   to investing, to implementing, and then to enjoying the full fruits of that investment  I am   pessimistic in that I believe the caution that CEOs are expressing about their profits will continue                  May 7, 2002 59 of 81  to limit their ability and willingness to make these long-term investments  In turn, that means   that several years from now we aren’t going to have the ability to harvest the productivity gains   because we will not have had growth in business investment for an extended period  At some   point the recent high levels of productivity growth, I fear, will drop substantially, closer to   historical trends Given how accommodative our monetary policy is at the moment, with real   funds rates at zero, I have a worry that at some point we are going to have to raise interest rates   because productivity will slow  "
4595,2002-05-07, I support your recommendation  
4638,2002-08-13, I have a question Can you comment just a little on what you see happening   in the commercial paper markets at this time?  
4639,2002-08-13," As many of us have already noted, the economy is continuing to expand but   at a slower pace than earlier in the year  As we have noted in our prior meetings, we have been   revising downward our forecast since spring  At this stage it is hard to identify major risks of   inflation over the intermediate term  Thus the focus now should be on the strength of economic   activity  While real GDP growth is now reported to have slowed from 5 percent in the first   quarter to 12 percent in the second, the Greenbook forecast is for growth to move toward its             August 13, 2002 57 of 92  long-term potential growth rate in 2003  The unusual growth of imports in the second quarter   significantly reduced real GDP growth while the conclusion of inventory liquidation should   provide the basis for continued expansion of industrial production as final sales advance   Survey measures of consumer confidence have fallen, with recent reports of corporate   fraud and the fall in equity values But real consumer activity, not the surveys, continues to be   resilient in this cycle Both housing and auto sales remain near record highs  This is due partly   to thirty-two-year lows on mortgage rates and incentives by auto manufacturers that make cars   more affordable today than they have been in thirty-four years  Consumers do not usually make   such major purchases if their outlook for the future is really dim Rather, the persistent growth   of real disposable income and slowing new claims for unemployment insurance serve to provide   a foundation for continued, though perhaps uneven, increases in consumer spending  And   today’s retail sales numbers support that view   To me the real focus should be on the pessimism of corporate CEOs  The drop in   business investment led this recession, and the lack of conviction about future revenue growth   has continued to slow the recovery of new investment commitments  We did see growth in   equipment and software sales in the last quarter for the first time in six quarters, and industrial   production has grown every month this year  But the July drop in the ISM index and the decline   in hours worked raise questions about the strength of the recovery  And because of my concern   about the pace of business investment, I am becoming more concerned about the overall outlook   for the pace of economic growth  "
4640,2002-08-13," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I think where my   perspective may differ from President Poole’s is that I don’t really want to tie our hands right   now I am concerned about weakness  I don’t believe we should respond to what is going on in   the market but rather to the implications that has in terms of consumer and business behavior    And if, with the new initiatives that the Congress has passed, we don’t very quickly get   aggressive actions against individuals who’ve committed some of these frauds, I am concerned   that this problem could linger on and on  Furthermore, if we don’t restore confidence in the   markets, I think there will be some longer-term impact on business financing and consumer   investing So I would prefer to shift the balance of risks to weakness now because we don’t   know how people are going to react in these very unusual times  And I’d like to signal that,   given the uncertainty, the risks we see in the outlook today are more to the downside  "
4693,2002-09-24," I’m just going to summarize my remarks since many of them echo the   comments we’ve heard around the table today  I believe the economic data that we’ve been   seeing recently continue to show very mixed signs about the strength of the recovery  I would   also echo the concerns expressed by others about the direction in which our forecasts are going    Since the beginning of the year, our staff forecasts for the fourth quarter of this year and for 2003   have continually been revised downward In the past two months production worker hours and   average weekly hours have declined We know that manufacturing has been the weakest sector   in this recession and recovery, but we’re seeing industrial production slowing, not expanding    And inflation in our forecast is also continually being revised downward to levels that give me   some concern, based on our discussion at the January meeting   On the positive side, however, inventory liquidation appears to be leveling off, and the   forecast has sales increasingly coming from new production by the fourth quarter  While   business fixed investment appears to be nearing the end of its seven-quarter decline, sustained   growth is not forecasted until the beginning of next year  Equipment and software investment   has already begun to grow, and hopefully that should support continued improvements in   productivity Nevertheless, I share the concern mentioned that we may be experiencing a capital   shallowing because of the length of time we’ve gone without an increase in investment   The risks to the forecast to me appear to be increasingly on the downside, though    Economic growth forecasts in the euro area have been revised downward, and problems in other   regions indicate weaker support for US expansion from abroad  And I, too, am struck when I              September 24, 2002 71 of 115  go to international meetings that other countries seem to be waiting for the United States to pull   them up, not the other way around   Retail sales, especially for big-ticket items and durables such as automobiles, still appear   to depend heavily on discounting Rising house prices have sustained the consumer’s wealth   position against falling equity markets, and any decline in house prices could have significant   impacts on consumer spending  However, since I still have a house in Memphis for sale, I’m   less inclined to believe that there’s a widespread bubble  [Laughter]    Oh yes    Overall, I believe that one other concern mentioned around the table is   increasingly coming to the forefront, and that is that the economy appears to be very fragile    That brings into question the ability of the economy to absorb any future shocks that may come   from the various sources that we’ve talked about today  We don’t have a robust recovery  In   summary, I believe the risks of a slower economic recovery and inflation hovering around 1   percent are moving us very close to the time when we must consider further rate cuts   "
4694,2002-09-24," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  But I guess I’m more   anxious than President Parry because I am getting very concerned about the lack of momentum   and robustness in the recovery despite the geopolitical situation  I do think we need to pay close   attention to what is happening as the data are released in the next few weeks        "
4744,2002-11-06," Mr Chairman?    Vincent mentioned that when this study goes out to the public it would have   a cover memo or foreword  I think it would be helpful to note that we are changing the way a lot   of our facilities can work, requiring perhaps different types of facilities  We might note why this   would involve removing the stigma from borrowing  The banks would be posting collateral and   might be looking to manage that differently  I think we at least ought to acknowledge that the   Lombard facility is going to be introduced  I wasn’t around for the Committee discussion of   these papers, and I’m not sure if the Lombard facility was anticipated  But just a few comments   in the cover memo about how that study relates to where we’re moving on the Lombard might be   helpful in order to make that current  "
4745,2002-11-06," I agree with many of the comments and remarks that have already been made    The expansion appears to be losing momentum and slowing, but it is still moving ahead  During   the last couple of months, manufacturing activity, new orders, auto sales, and general retail sales   have slowed from their prior pace  And capital spending still shows no upward momentum, as   companies continue to cut costs to achieve earnings growth, especially in an atmosphere of   increased uncertainty about geopolitical and economic risks   On the plus side, housing continues at strong levels  As Governor Kohn just mentioned,   while the cost of capital to companies has been rising, it continues to set record lows for the   household sector And I think that’s the reason we’re seeing growth there  Business inventories   finally show signs of growth after six quarters of liquidation, and that’s a plus  Business fixed            November 6, 2002 64 of 122  investment, as we’ve discussed already, is showing mixed signals depending on which set of   numbers one looks at  I would say, based on talking to corporate executives, that the disconnect   is partly because executives think of expenses running through the P&L statement  With the   huge wave of capital spending in 1998 and 1999, which now is fully amortized off the books,   firms actually can increase outlays and still have declining expenses     Overall the tone of recent economic activity has been very disappointing  There is little   indication of strength in major economies elsewhere in the world, and it’s not evident that our   economy can get much of a boost from any outside source  Now, I know that monetary policy   operates with long lags, but it has been eleven months since our last change in the fed funds   target rate When I look at the staff forecast this time, I notice that in this quarter and the first   half of 2003 the output gap has been widened by ¾ point  That tells me not only that we have to   wait longer for a rebound but that the gap between actual and potential economic growth is   bigger At the last meeting I thought it was a very close call as to whether we had reached the   point where we needed to ease further The data that we’ve received since that meeting tell me   that the time is now right and we must move at this meeting  "
4746,2002-11-06," Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation to go down 50 basis points on   the funds rate I think we need to show that we are ahead at this point in the economy  I find it a   little harder on the balance of risks statement  One of the reasons—using some of the words that   Vincent put in his handout—is that we talk about the foreseeable future  As a group we have   come to the conclusion that the economy is at sort of an inflection point where we think there is   weakness in the very short term but going out further in our forecast period we see more   strength I can support the balanced risk statement, but I think it’s important to indicate that the   “foreseeable future” is beyond the next meeting because some people tend to look at the risk   statement as a signal about our likely policy stance at the next meeting  So if we can talk past   the short run in the press release, I think that would be helpful  "
4802,2002-12-10," I’m going to borrow a term that President Minehan used earlier  I, too, had   in the introductory sentence of my notes that I think we’re in a “bumpy” period right now  The   news since our last meeting has been mixed  As many of you have indicated, we have seen   evidence of the good news and the bad news scenario  Productivity has been very strong, and as   a result, unit labor costs are falling; holiday sales started off well; and initial unemployment   claims continue to move down  But on the negative side, private payrolls and industrial   production have declined in the last few months The election has us all thinking about changes   in fiscal policy We really don’t know exactly when those changes are likely to happen or how   large the tax cuts may be  In general, I’d assess the situation today as one where we are still   stuck in our soft spot; but, Mr Stockton, I don’t think we’re in the La Brea tar pits yet      I wanted to comment a little about my perspective on the productivity data  We’ve been   talking a lot about that in the last few months  Recently I had occasion to meet with a group of   senior corporate financial executives to discuss what they are doing to get these productivity   numbers  They made me promise not to use the term “multifactor productivity,” and they would                     December 10, 2002 64 of 87  continue to talk with me  [Laughter] I quickly went back to my CFO jargon, and we got along   fine again   What they said is that they are obviously in a profit squeeze  They really can’t raise   prices, and demand in terms of volume growth is modest  Consequently, they are focusing   particularly on expense reductions  Many felt that their companies had quite a bit of potential to   cut expenses, for several reasons  One is that in the late 1990s many of these companies made a   lot of acquisitions, aggressively getting into new product lines and opening new stores and   plants They were all so focused on the external side of supporting sales that very little was done   internally in terms of rationalizing their business processes But that is what they are doing now,   basically going through a business process redesign   I was amazed as we went around the table at the number who talked about eliminating   steps in almost all of their business processes, from billing to procurement, which has radically   reduced their infrastructure costs And because a lot of these changes don’t require much capital   investment, either in the form of software or equipment, they are getting very big paybacks on   these types of adjustments in their internal processes  They are also redesigning manufacturing   lines And they are getting very hard-nosed about finally eliminating the less efficient plants or   stores that aren’t meeting revenue expectations  Moreover, the general sense is that this cost   cutting can go on for quite a while They all felt that they weren’t running out of steam yet and   could continue to push this type of restructuring to improve the bottom line   And in their view this was really good news in terms of enhancing longer-term   productivity growth  With their cost structures rationalized, two things will happen when they   get to the point where demand is getting stronger  First, it will throw more money to the bottom   line and boost profits  More important, it will generate more free cash flow, which will allow         December 10, 2002 65 of 87  them to fund bigger investments or acquisitions when the time is right  So as financial officers   they were feeling very positive; they viewed the current period as a break of sorts that has   allowed them to look internally at ways to improve the productivity picture  And I didn’t get a   sense from any of them that they thought they were running out of ideas  In fact, they thought   these endeavors had energized everybody in their companies, and they were very positive about   the outlook for productivity for the next few quarters  "
4803,2002-12-10," I agree with you, Mr Chairman And following up on other comments,   maybe you didn’t bank your minutes, but we don’t know if you have rollover minutes for the   next time  "
4854,2003-03-18,"  I also wanted to talk a little about the financial sector, including banks, and   contrast that with what we see happening in the real sector  The Bluebook pointed out that   commercial banks in the United States had record earnings in 2002  And they had record   March 18, 2003 64 of 101    earnings in 2001  We had back-to-back years of record earnings in the commercial banking   system during a recession period and a relatively slow recovery—a period when interest rates   have hit forty-year lows and one characterized by unusual liquidity circumstances as funds came   back into the banking system  I think one of the things we’re finding is that, while it is difficult   to operate in an environment of uncertainty, banks really have learned to manage risks well  The   asset–liability management processes that banks initiated in the 1980s and fine-tuned in the   1990s clearly show that they can go through a major interest rate cycle and as a whole improve   their earnings  Net interest margins in fact actually widened last year     On the credit side, we also saw banks managing credit very well  If we look at the 2002   numbers, the loan-loss provision as a percentage of the return on assets was basically flat   compared with the previous year  So again, banks are doing a much better job at managing   credit risks   What is also remarkable about these bank earnings is that they were achieved   through a record return on assets  It wasn’t done through financial leverage  Banks in fact   deleveraged last year, so it wasn’t a record year for return on equity  Banks achieved record   earnings through stronger fundamentals as well as better risk management     If we look at the broader financial markets, especially since our last meeting, we see that   some of the volatility and excessive credit spreads we’ve observed in the last year or so have   continued to improve  As was mentioned earlier, while debt spreads are wider than historically,   the spreads have moved in  Much like what we’re hearing from bank credit officers, the credit   market folks are also saying that to some extent the uncertainty part of the debt spreads has been   removed  What upset everybody at the end of 2001 and 2002 was that prime credits were going   immediately to bankruptcy and that was happening because of what I love to call “operational   risks”  Credit was not the real issue  These bankruptcies were due to accounting scandals and   March 18, 2003 65 of 101    management fraud  Companies that deteriorated over time, like K-Mart, were handled in the   traditional way  But it was the uncertainty about what was going on with regard to these other   factors that contributed to the widening of debt spreads in the investment-grade market  That   seems to be coming down now, since we haven’t had any material events of that type in the last   several months   Companies are restructuring  We know they’ve lengthened from commercial paper to   longer-term debt  Their corporate cash flow has also been improving, unfortunately in part   because they are not making capital investments  Consumers continue to refinance and   restructure their debt  The staff has shown us that household debt service is actually down from   where it was a couple of years ago  So household finances are in good shape  If the banking   sector, corporate balance sheets, household finances, and debt markets are stronger—and equity   markets we know at least have shifted to neutral—what really is happening?  Again we get a   “disconnect” between the improvement of the financial sector and the weakness in the real   sector    After our FOMC meeting in January I was optimistic, as the news continued to be very,   very strong  Then as the February data came out, as many of you have remarked already,   suddenly we began to question what was happening  Was it the snowstorms?  After all, even an   old Southerner like myself actually had to go out and buy a pair of boots!  I thought that would   have helped the retail sales in February, but it didn’t!  High heating oil and natural gas costs also   took a toll on people’s spending  But as we’ve talked about, the uncertainty regarding what is   going on in Iraq and maybe other countries appears to be preying both on consumers and   businesses  Because it is very hard to evaluate risks and to make decisions in a period of high   uncertainty, the decisionmaking that affects real economic activity and creates jobs and growth   March 18, 2003 66 of 101    in our resources has slowed to almost a halt  So until we really know more about the situation in   Iraq, I’m not sure what we can do to deal with the uncertainty through monetary policy  The   concerns involve not only the war but also, as many of you have mentioned already, the   aftermath of the war  Unlike the situation in Kuwait, we are not going to be reinstalling the   government; we have to help create a successor government  Therefore, I think the uncertainty   is going to continue for some time  Because of the nature of the uncertainty, I’m uncomfortable   making any change right now in the direction of policy  Thank you  "
4855,2003-03-18,  I support your recommendation  
4904,2003-05-06,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  In preparing for this meeting I started out looking   at previous forecasts, as President Minehan and Governor Ferguson did  I noted that we’ve had,   for the past three years now, a forecast that the economy will get better in the second half of the   year  We missed it the first time in 2001 because of a terrorist attack and the second time in   2002 because of corporate governance scandals  I don’t know if I’m optimistic or pessimistic   about it happening a third time, but I could hope that the new chairman of the Public Company   Accounting Oversight Board might have some effect on the risk of that     Yes, the brilliant new chairman!  I am concerned, though, that we’re starting   out this year in a soft spot, unlike the last two years when we had stronger growth in the first half   of the year  Hours worked are continuing to decline in this soft period, employment is falling,   and production in the manufacturing sector in particular is showing significant weakness  The   main impetus for the recession was the weakness in business fixed investment, and the forecast   for BFI has again been revised downward in the Greenbook for this meeting     I agree with some of the comments that have already been made around the table that,   while corporations are cautious, they haven’t been inactive  We’ve seen significant   improvements in inventory control, advances in productivity, and increased liquidity as firms   have moved to longer-term funding and as cash flows have risen because of improving profit   margins  But as I look at this picture, I’m still relatively pessimistic as to what is going to   happen to spark business confidence again  So I tend to believe that the risks are biased toward   weakness, especially given that I accept the forecast that economic growth will be below   potential even beyond the 2004 forecast horizon     May 6, 2003 67 of 115    What about the outlook on the inflation front?  As several people have already remarked,   the Greenbook assessment that the probability of deflation by the end of next year is 35 percent   clearly is a statement that catches one’s attention  Further, I know that the staff has been doing   work on the confidence intervals for various measures of inflation and the measurement bias    That work shows all three major inflation measures at the top of the confidence band of about   1 percent by the end of next year  This concerns me  We don’t need to see deflation because   disinflation—getting the inflation rate down to 1 percent—is a significant enough issue   There has been a lot of talk that businesses don’t have the confidence to invest because of   concerns raised by governance issues  I think the lack of confidence relates to the continuing   outlook for very weak pricing power  Business management tries to commit to the marketplace   that their company will show earnings growth  They commit to that by expecting some type of   top line revenue growth  But we’re sitting here expecting economic growth over the forecast   period to be below potential, with inflation at 1 percent  That means that if a corporation makes   a serious commitment to growth, they have a very small margin of error  When cash flow from   top line growth provides a robust level of new incoming revenue, companies are more able to   take the risk of investing in new business lines and new plant openings  But with an outlook for   continued sluggish economic growth and overall inflation at 1 percent or less, in effect we   confront a disinflation risk world that at some point cumulatively slows growth going forward    Therefore, I support the comments that President Santomero made about the importance of   averting a disinflation psychology in the period ahead   So I’m concerned that we have risks on both fronts right now—the risk of real growth   below potential for quite a long time and also a risk of further disinflation that is considerably   stronger now than we would like  I don’t think I can identify a bias or say that the risks are   May 6, 2003 68 of 115    balanced or unbalanced  In my view we don’t have a Phillips curve situation  I think we have   two negatives facing us  "
4905,2003-05-06,"  I can support the statement  I like the fact that we’ve broken out the two   risks explicitly in this  I could have voted for a reduction in the funds rate target today because   I’m looking at how much the market has moved the fed funds futures rates since our last   meeting  The market is pricing in a rate cut; it’s just a matter of when  So having been on the   other side for a while, I’m inclined to believe that the market would not have been all that upset   by an easing action today  But I will go along with the recommendation that we wait to see how   future information develops  I look forward to the discussion at the next meeting  As I indicated   earlier, I’d like to see us think through what our strategy should be and what signals we want to   send as we move into this lower inflation world that we haven’t experienced for a long time  I   think it will help us to further improve our communication if we have considered carefully our   long-term plan to get through this low inflation period  Then we can do another plastic surgery   on this swan  "
4954,2003-08-12,"  Could you talk a little about the fails that have been happening?  How have   dealers been able to react when there has been a fail so that it hasn’t disrupted the liquidity in the   marketplace or added to the volatility?   August 12, 2003 9 of 110      No, fails always worry me when they reach that magnitude  I worry what   that does to the day-to-day functioning of the dealers  "
4955,2003-08-12,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m going to focus on a couple of issues that   Governor Bernanke just discussed and that many of you have mentioned, too—namely,   August 12, 2003 65 of 110    communicating our policy and our views about the issues facing us today  I want to talk about   this from the point of view of the two dictates in our mission statement, potential growth in the   economy and inflation  One of the things I find striking in my conversations with people who   participate in the bond markets is the difference in our perceptions regarding where we are in this   particular recovery  As several people mentioned earlier, the market tends to believe that, when   the recovery begins, the Fed is going to take away the punch bowl and start tightening interest   rates right away  Most of us have really been engaged in this profession—old as we are—only   when the Federal Reserve has been trying to fight inflation  That has been the System’s focus   since the ’70s  What is unusual here is that the economy has emerged from a long-term secular   problem of exceedingly high inflation, and now the rate of inflation is within or near the range   we might want to set for a long-term inflation target  As a result we’re not trying to achieve a   secular decline in inflation, we’re focusing more on the cyclical aspects of it  I don’t believe the   Street is really differentiating these two issues   A second issue—and one of the reasons that inflation is so low—is that productivity   growth is significantly above what any of us has seen  In fact, the productivity numbers that just   came out are high even for the early stages of a business recovery  If we believe that   productivity will stay somewhere above its long-term trend, the pickup in inflation that we   normally would see is not likely to occur  While we hope that inflation will go up from where it   is currently, in the Greenbook forecast inflation remains significantly below what many of us   find comfortable  I certainly am uncomfortable when I see inflation forecasts of less than   1 percent   The other issue I see, as I look at the risks to the forecast, is addressed in the alternative   scenario in the Greenbook that is called “prolonged subpar investment”  That is the root cause of   August 12, 2003 66 of 110    this recession to begin with  The slowdown in business fixed investment created the recession; it   was not consumer-driven  If business investment doesn’t pick up as we’re expecting, the output   gap will get wider, and inflation will continue to drift lower  While capital expenditures have   increased at some companies, we’re still not hearing very robust plans for capital expenditures as   companies have released their earnings reports  I think most people around the table today have   been hearing mixed reports about capital spending intentions    So I share the doubts expressed about how businesses are going to survive in a world   with continuing low inflation, which limits pricing power  I’m not sure how they can achieve the   earnings growth for the next five years that we still see in the S&P numbers and other earnings   forecasts  What’s going to give?  Well, they are going to have to resume capital expenditures in   order to achieve that growth and continue to get an extraordinarily high pace of growth in   productivity  Alternatively, without the capital deepening, we will continue to see what has been   going on over the last couple of years—more reorganizations, the shutting down of plants, and   the restructuring of product lines     So in summary, I’m concerned about the strength of capital expenditures relative to the   staff forecast, and I see that as one of the biggest risks going forward  In terms of our   communications, I would love to find some way—maybe we can talk about this in September—  to make people understand that we are now in a different mode for the long term with regard to   both inflation and productivity  As a result, the output gap will be large for a while even if   economic growth is high in the short run  Thank you  "
4956,2003-08-12,"  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation, and I, too, look forward to   our September discussion on communications     Mr Chairman, I’m sort of split on the last sentence  I think the final sentence   in the second paragraph on pricing power is a really good addition, and I like that a lot  A part of   the last sentence that troubles me is the phrase “without ultimately stoking inflationary   pressures,” which we haven’t talked about  That phrase makes me uncomfortable  In light of   your admonition to be humble, to say that we can maintain an accommodative stance “for a   considerable period without ultimately   ” sounds like an extreme position  I would suggest   that we might want to end the sentence by putting the period after the word “period”  "
5009,2003-09-15,"  Let me make just a couple of comments  Some of these points have been   covered, but I want to highlight the ones that hit me rather hard as I thought about them  First,   when I think about what has happened with regard to our communications over the last couple of   months, I think part of the problem was that we were in uncharted waters  We hadn’t had   inflation rates so low  We hadn’t had wars or the possibility of war intervening with the   economic process for some time  So as we sat around this table, we had a lot of Knightian   uncertainty  But as we heard today, one can learn  As people learned about what the Fed was   likely to do, the market adapted  Whatever we come out with on communication policy, I think   we have to realize that in times like we’ve just been through we’re probably going to have to get   out of the box we’ve put ourselves into  Such times demand a different type of communication    When the market sees things that aren’t normal, we may need to use something other than our   standard type of communication    September 15, 2003 61 of 78    I have become very uncomfortable with moving in the direction of giving a forecast, a   point some of you have also made  I really think we need to talk about where we are at the   moment that we come to our decision—that’s the important point—without going any further   with any kind of commitment in any sense of the term  For that reason, I think we should move   up the publication of the minutes  The reason I come to that conclusion relates to what Cathy   talked about, that some of us go out and give speeches between meetings  What do market   observers do? They read the words of the people around this table who happen to give speeches   on the economy and from them try to divine what the Committee as a whole is thinking       So the market’s interpretation is based on words from a selected number of   those around the table who happen to have speaking engagements and talk about the economic   situation To me the minutes give a better representation of the diversity of views as well as the   consensus and lay out why those who had different views felt the way they did  I think that   before the minutes are released the market is not getting a full representation of how we got to   the consensus and how dominant that consensus may have been   So I would prefer moving up   the minutes  I also agree with some comments that were just made about the language  I would   like to see us move to standard wording  But I also would like us to think hard about putting it in   plain English  In other words, for economic growth, say, to indicate that we see it accelerating   but we still see a large gap in unused resources in the economy       Well, it’s what we see today  It reflects how we got to our conclusion   regarding policy  I’d prefer that, rather than to say that the risks are up or the risks are down—  which I think can be read in many different ways depending on where the economy happens to   September 15, 2003 62 of 78    be  It’s the first difference both in inflation and growth rates, and with inflation of 1 percent and   going up or inflation of 1 percent and going into disinflation, we’d get very different reactions    So as we think about standard words, we need to consider the different sides  If our wording   were more in plain English, that might take care of the last sentence because capacity issues and   other developments we see in the economy would be tied together  Maybe that would get us out   of that awkward final sentence  I still have trouble with that last sentence     Right     Well, it’s going to be very difficult  But the lesson I took from the last few   months is that using the standard risk-assessment language in times like this, when we’re going   through a turn in the direction of the economy, sends confusing signals     Well, that’s why I agreed with the suggestion that was made earlier about   trying to test any proposed language under different circumstances    Yes, I think we have to do that     Okay  Those are the main comments I had  "
5032,2003-09-16,"  But I rather like President Moskow’s approach that we should be reassessing   our communication policy as part of our normal procedures  That’s what I read in his suggested   wording  We talked about a wide range of possibilities last night, and we may not come out with   all the changes at once  I like that approach     I have a question about your comments on borrowing at the window during   the blackout and the one institution that didn’t want to come to the window  Do you have a   sense that we learned anything in terms of communicating to banks about the window?  Are you   comfortable that our system worked as planned?  "
5033,2003-09-16,"  Thank you  Let me start by adding to what Mr Stockton and several others   have said about the forecast in the Greenbook compared with the forecasts in the private sector    As I looked at the components of the forecasts, I focused again on productivity  I must say that   the more I talk to business people, the more I really believe that we are at a sea change in   productivity, so I’m very comfortable with the Greenbook forecast  Not to duplicate the   comments of others, I would like to talk in particular about one aspect of the current situation    My remarks may be similar to what Governor Ferguson mentioned earlier about inventory   management, but they may give a little different perspective based on what I’m hearing from   some of my business contacts  Obviously, the pessimism about earnings growth among CEOs   September 16, 2003 70 of 106    and business people generally stems from their concern about the inability to raise prices in order   to increase revenues  They still feel very constrained in that regard because of excess capacity   and the competitive environment that have caused them to really focus on costs  So   reengineering work processes and using resources more effectively than before are concepts that   continue to drive business decisions and, from what I’m hearing as businesses plan their budgets   and strategy for next year, that will continue in 2004     We’ve talked a bit about how much inventory–sales ratios have dropped  One of the   comments I heard from several folks I talk to in service industries relates to the way we measure   inventories  We look at the ratio of inventories to sales, which tends to involve the   manufacturing, wholesale, and retail parts of the distribution process  But we really don’t have   good data on the inventories that sit inside service companies, which is where the majority of the   workers are and where most of our production and income growth is generated in this country     Many service companies have just gotten around in the last couple of years to developing   the same kinds of procurement policies that the manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers have   been using since the ’90s  My contacts point out that, in the old days, individual departments all   had big supply cabinets or supply rooms, and each department ordered its own supplies and   tended to have on hand an excess supply of everything from fax machines to servers to paper and   everything else  What has happened—and according to my contacts it’s one of the reasons   businesses have been buying fewer supplies—is that, in their reengineering efforts, large   corporations have been centralizing procurement  Office Depot has become their supply cabinet,   and basically firms are making do with less  Another change, in terms of equipment, is that   many companies no longer have backup forklifts and other equipment sitting around; they wait   and get the equipment when they need it  There’s no way to measure this but companies say that                                                                                                                                                                 2 Chairman Greenspan briefly left the room, and Mr Ferguson was acting Chairman at this point   September 16, 2003 71 of 106    inventories within service businesses also have been decreasing and are still being worked down   as a way to improve efficiency  The fewer times they now have to handle items in inventory   creates big efficiencies in their cost structures, too   Let me shift to the second point I want to talk about, which is the employment picture    My comments may reflect my naturally optimistic viewpoint in trying to find something good in   these dismal employment numbers that we’re seeing  I’ve talked to some people in leadership   roles in the NFIB, the small business group, and one of the things they’re focused on is the   continuing dichotomy between the establishment data and the household data on employment    As we know, the two series have diverged for a long time  But as my contacts pointed out to me,   a lot more time, energy, and people are being employed in sole proprietorships than previously    In fact, as shown in a Greenbook chart, the latest monthly survey shows that hiring plans of   small businesses—bearing in mind that it’s a very recent time series—are back to the levels   recorded in the mid-1990s expansion  As these outside contacts like to remind me, most new   jobs are created by small businesses  So for the first time in several years they are optimistic that   small businesses are going to be the source of growth, while the structural kinds of layoffs we’re   seeing in big businesses will be a drag  In any event, they are seeing some signs that small   businesses are beginning to grow and to hire people other than family members—who work   extraordinarily long hours—and there is some optimism that real employment gains will be   occurring in that sector going forward  "
5034,2003-09-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation to keep the fed   funds target rate at 1 percent  At this time I still am quite concerned about the downside risk on   inflation, mainly because of the forecast in the Greenbook and my belief that the productivity   story is still being written  However, like others who have just commented, I would prefer to   leave the last sentence of the statement as it was last time  In that last sentence, I think we’re   trying to say why we want to remain accommodative  But the sentence before, which relates to   the balance of risks, says it already  It states that the predominant concern continues to be the   risk of inflation becoming undesirably low  So, I don’t think we need to say it again at the end of   the next sentence  Again, I’m just worried about changing too many words  I could accept this   language but since the sentence is rather awkward I’d really prefer to leave the wording as it was    "
5088,2003-10-28,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I wanted to make one comment on current   conditions and then talk a bit more about the longer-run part of the Greenbook forecast  I was   struck as I looked at the Greenbook forecast about where we are with regard to business   investment in this expansion and by some of the information on capital spending that we’re   getting from various business surveys, much of which is included in the Greenbook materials    We’ve already noted that corporate cash flow is very strong and that we’re beginning to see   some firming up of business investment  But the responses to the qualitative questions that are   asked in surveys clearly show that businesses are reluctant to expand  Nevertheless, I think there   is a tone that says we’re seeing a floor here; we’re beginning to get out of this slump in   investment  That slump was the root of this business slowdown and, as Governor Olson was just   mentioning, the words are starting to turn positive  But the vigor of corporate expansion has yet   to take hold  I think the recent information shows again that we clearly have a way to go    It worries me when I look at how much stop and go we’ve had in the economy in the last   two years  The Greenbook forecast is assuming that there are no real shocks coming  We’ve   had a number of shocks in the past few years  Last year business inventories grew, but then we   had the shock of a war in the spring  There have been so many starts and stops in this recovery   that it may take a little longer to prove that there is some stability out there and to get businesses   into an expansion mode versus just a replacement mode  Clearly their financial strength is   extraordinary  The corporate cash flow and earnings numbers coming out this quarter all look   very, very strong   October 28, 2003 69 of 126    In thinking about the longer-term forecast and where we are heading, I was struck, too,   by the wonderful optimism in the Greenbook forecast compared with some of the outside   forecasts  I just want to comment on two aspects of this that I’m still sorting through in my own   mind  One is that we’ve had an extraordinary run in productivity over the last few quarters  Yet   when we look forward, productivity growth for the last six quarters of the Greenbook forecast   falls below the recent numbers  I understand that a big part of the productivity performance is   cyclical  But the projected drop in productivity growth is coming right when the economy is   really picking up  So we have this tension in the forecast, I think, where we see employment   growing—extraordinary job growth—and productivity slowing  Yet we still have inflation   trending down until the tail end of the forecast period  In the Street, as market observers talk   about expectations—and it’s a factor in our communication policy—they say that once   employment starts expanding, inflation is going to pick up  That is going to be one of the   challenges we face if we believe in the Greenbook forecast  In fact, of all the alternative   scenarios, there’s only one that results in an inflation rate that’s within hailing distance of   2 percent  And that’s due only to the fact that people’s inflation expectations are higher than   actual inflation  Basically in this forecast, depending on the inflation measure, we will have had   four or five years of inflation numbers that start with a 1 or below, which would be an   extraordinary period of low inflation  That psychology is not what most observers have in their   mindset, nor is it part of the business recovery models that we see in the marketplace  So we   need to think about how we talk about these issues going forward  "
5089,2003-10-28,  I support your recommendation  
5150,2003-12-09,"  Let me make a couple of comments  I would hope, as we make the decision   on the statement, that we have the staff’s input on the issue of moving up the publication of the   minutes  I say that because I am very concerned about making the press statement the dominant   issue  When people read the minutes, they do have a chance to see the variety of viewpoints   expressed at that particular meeting  Just as we did today, we got around to a consensus  Some   December 9, 2003 111 of 133    of us are willing to bend or some get to the same answer from a different place, and I think the   minutes reflect that more clearly  I worry that this statement may get very, very long, and I like   the idea of keeping the press release cleaner and simpler  So I’m looking forward to seeing what   practically can be done from the minutes perspective   Second, I personally am very reluctant to go down the path of giving frequent forecasts or   making commitments  To my mind that presumes that we’re more omniscient about what is   going to occur in the future than I think we are  It also raises questions of what to do when   confronted with a situation such as we had in the spring with the Iraqi war, when we couldn’t   even assess the near-term much less the longer-term outlook  Presidential elections come up,   and a lot of other things happen  I’m very concerned about trying to give a forecast of the   outlook at each regular meeting  Now, we might want to think about how the Chairman   communicates to the Congress twice a year in his testimony on monetary policy; we can do that   separately  But to routinely try to do a forecast at every six-week interval I find very   problematic  I also want to say that I do like the stress-testing idea  One of the things that we   found out is that the relationship between falling inflation and economic growth—the Phillips   curve kind of tradeoff—got a bit out of whack this year  So I like the notion of stress testing   these various alternatives  "
5151,2003-12-09,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our last meeting the news about economic   growth, as many people around the table have already said, is much stronger  One point I’d note   is that I’m very happy to see that growth is more balanced in terms of coming from more   sources  It is no longer relying totally on consumer spending; business capital investment has   resumed  We continue to be amazed that inventories are still falling, which leaves room for   further expansion as inventories get rebuilt to supply sales growth  Moreover, the international   economy is picking up and should support some modest expansion of exports  As business   spending continues to grow, more workers will also be added to payrolls  That will support   consumption and to some extent offset the lower impetus from tax cuts and mortgage refinancing   in the future     When I look at the risk with regard to economic growth—if the risk is assessed just on   the growth rate—I’d say the risk is on the upside  However, if we look at the economy’s   performance relative to the level of potential output, the gap is significant  As many people have   already mentioned, the estimate of the output gap is very hard to come by  In the Greenbook   forecast we see that unemployment continues to run relatively high, and we’re assuming   5 percent as full employment from a NAIRU perspective  However, as Dave Stockton already   mentioned, the standard deviation is 1 percentage point on this unemployment rate  Many of us   remember that in the late ’90s unemployment got well below 5 percent without any inflation   pressures     After talking to human resource executives at several corporations about the way they   manage people today, I also am optimistic that wage pressures will continue to be more muted   than they might have been in the past  Businesses today have much more flexibility in the way   December 9, 2003 82 of 133    they manage human resources  Management tends to compensate people more through the use   of incentive pay so that employees earn more money either as productivity targets are met or as   revenue comes in through sales commissions  Businesses accept the practice of outsourcing and   contract employment so that functions that are not core to the organization are now contracted   out to other organizations that have much more productivity and effectiveness in handling those   particular functions and can do the work at a much lower cost  Companies continually look   throughout the organization for such opportunities whether sales are up or down  Improvements   in technology now allow services and businesses to be supplied by accessing labor resources   internationally so that we’re no longer confined to US workers even for services  All these   mitigating factors lead me, looking forward, not to be so concerned about the impact of   compensation as a force to drive up inflation in the short run     The exceptionally large jump in productivity that we saw in the third quarter is not likely   to be sustained, especially as growing business confidence leads to new hiring  However,   because of the factors above, I think the pace of productivity growth may well continue to run   above historically high levels  Like Governor Ferguson, I believe that productivity growth may   not slow as much as in the Greenbook baseline forecast  Corporate profits in the third quarter   were significantly higher than they have been recently  In fact, the profits were back to levels   recorded in quarters of the boom years  Interestingly, the consensus forecast for corporate profits   for all of 2003 is running at twice the level that was expected at the beginning of this year   What about inflation?  Inflation does appear to be turning up, but it remains at very low   levels  The Greenbook continues to forecast that core inflation will be in the low 1 percent range   for the next two years  Nevertheless, as Dave commented in response to President Pianalto’s   question, the probability of inflation getting into that dangerous zone of under ½ percent is still   December 9, 2003 83 of 133    running at 1 in 4, which I consider to be a significant risk of unwelcome inflation with   substantial costs to the economy     The markets and private economists have different forecasts from the one in the   Greenbook  The outside forecasts tend to have much lower growth and much higher inflation    But it’s interesting to compare today’s Blue Chip forecast for 2004 with the Blue Chip consensus   at the beginning of the year  The projection for real GDP growth has moved up 80 basis points,   and the expectations for inflation have moved down 40 basis points—closer to what the   Greenbook is showing for 2004       Mr Chairman, while I’m still uncomfortable with a policy commitment in   the proposed wording, I feel much better with the introductory phrase “with inflation quite low   and resource use slack,” which makes it a conditional statement  I also like dropping the   language that wraps up our assessment of the balance of risks  I think doing that helps  So I’ll   support your recommendation  "
5208,2004-03-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman I want to start by also acknowledging the range of   forecasts the staff has provided  I think it really will help us be more aware of how variable the   outlook can be  As someone who spends a lot of time worrying about Basel II and advising   bankers that they need to understand the variability of outcomes, I’m glad to see we’re walking   our talk and putting it in our own FOMC materials  So, thank you   Since the last meeting, as many of you have said, the data have been mixed  On net, our   forecast is a little weaker in terms of GDP and employment, with inflation about unchanged    Overall the pace of the recovery, while still strong, is slowing  In looking at this, I tried to focus   a bit on the different sectors of the economy, and I ended up spending most of my time looking   at the corporate sector  As we’ve been noticing since the second half of last year, corporate   profit levels are rising quickly, and corporate cash flow is very strong  In fact, internally   generated cash flow has been greater than capital expenditures for several quarters now  Why is   it then that businesses have increased their investment in equipment and software but still   haven’t picked up their spending in some other areas?  I think that this gap in spending on   different facets of their operations may come from a couple of interesting aspects of their   March 16, 2004 71 of 107    finances  Throughout this whole period, corporations have been paying down equity on net    Overall their balance sheets have strengthened in leverage, but they are generating more profits   than they can use and, therefore, are retiring stock   Another observation is that corporate net issuance of debt has been quite large until very   recently  In fact, the numbers in the last couple of quarters are amazing to me  While a lot of   debt has been issued, we’ve also seen, as Governor Olson noted, a paydown in bank loans and   commercial paper  So companies have been lengthening their liabilities—taking advantage of   the long period of low interest rates to help strengthen their financials  In the last two months’   data, however, we’re seeing some changes  We’re beginning to see for the first time in a while   commercial loan growth in the banking system and commercial paper growth in the financial   markets  There has actually been a net expansion of debt so far this quarter  Part of this may be   due to the start of inventory building, but again, this has been very, very modest  Corporations in   effect are trying to maintain their high profit margins  In fact, from the data in the Greenbook we   can see that the Street expects double-digit earnings growth for corporations out into the next   couple of years  To the extent that companies have very lean, top-line revenue growth—and   particularly with a limited ability to raise prices to get that revenue growth—they are struggling   to maintain the bottom line   One of the odd things in corporate finance is that the wider your profit margin, the harder   you have to work on keeping costs down in order to generate earnings growth  I think that’s in   part what is happening now  Firms are showing wide operating margins to the Street, the Street   is extrapolating them into earnings growth, and these firms find that they have to scramble harder   on the expense side  What really makes me uncomfortable is that, of the government sector, the   household sector, and the business sector, we have net saving today in only one sector, and that’s   March 16, 2004 72 of 107    the corporate sector  Until the corporate sector turns from a net saver to a net investor, I’m   pessimistic about getting very rapid growth going forward  "
5209,2004-03-16,"  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation, and I would prefer to keep   the slight bias emphasizing that there is a possibility of disinflation  One of the things that makes   March 16, 2004 86 of 107    me uncomfortable about making a change—going back to my comment that I like the fan   charts—is that inflation is “fanning” around 1 percent, and I personally think 1 percent is a low   number  Also, there are economic consequences of what is going on  How companies manage   their earnings statements and how financial institutions operate at extremely low interest rates   have implications for the economy  That, plus the fact that we haven’t seen in the data actual   evidence of a stabilization in inflation, leads me to prefer to retain the bias toward weakness  "
5258,2004-05-04,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will take the opportunity for the last time, I guess,   to say that I agree with President Broaddus  As I prepared for this meeting, I too found that the   changes since our last FOMC meeting were significant  As I looked at the different indicators I   track, I saw more change than I had for quite a long time  I want to talk about three aspects of the   data that I ended up focusing on  inventories, employment, and the various inflation indicators   May 4, 2004 67 of 112       Let me start with inventory growth  I think we all were surprised about how little   inventories grew in the last few months, below even the Greenbook estimates  If one looks at the   historical trend in both inventory–sales and inventory–consumption ratios, what is remarkable is   that the downward trend of these ratios that began in the ’90s has continued—except for a slight   flattening in wholesale manufacturing inventories during the recession  In fact, even the Greenbook   forecast of inventory accumulation this year, based on the recent changes in the GDP numbers,   suggests a level of inventories in 2004 that will be less than that held by companies in 2000, despite   double-digit sales growth in the intervening four years  So, what is happening with companies’   inventory management practices?   Recently I had an opportunity to be with some financial officers of several different types of   businesses, and one of the things I found was that the anecdotal commentary was mixed    Particularly among manufacturing industries, there is still a lot of caution out there  These tended to   be firms that had suffered a lot in industries where there is real pressure on profits  Perhaps like the   company President Pianalto talked about, they’ve been worried about building their book of sales   and have been trying to get their inventories down even further  On the other hand, folks in the   retail industry told me stories about how they continue to be on a path of substantially changing the   way they integrate information systems across their companies, going from the prospect books of   their sales forces to order books and to inventory management  While a lot has been accomplished   in that regard, many of these financial officers felt there were still significant ways that they could   continue to improve their management of inventories  Manufacturing firms also are doing this, but   again they started more on the cautious side than the retailers, who were talking more about   improving their inventory management processes   May 4, 2004 68 of 112       In terms of employment, I was glad to see that in March we had for the first time some   growth in payrolls  I’m still a little pessimistic because it has been so long since we’ve seen real job   growth  But it clearly is one of the indicators that I’m sure we all hope will be showing sustained   growth going forward  Payroll income has not moved a lot in the last couple of years, and I   personally am concerned that, after the tax refunds have played out this year and we see a slowing   in the pace of equity extractions from housing due to rising mortgage rates, we will need to have   significant payroll growth in order to sustain a strong level of final consumption   And finally on the inflation numbers, it was amazing that after our March meeting every   indicator of inflation that came out suddenly showed a reversal in the trend that we saw in 2003  In   2003, every month—and even on a twelve-month rollover measure—rates of inflation continued to   fall  But that has really changed, and the anecdotes that many of you mentioned at previous   meetings have come to bear  As I looked at the various pieces of the inflation picture, I focused on   the question that some of you have already asked  Is something fundamental happening, or is this   attributable to unusual events?  Clearly, we have issues with some commodities where we’re seeing   worldwide demand-driven price changes  But overall what is amazing is that prices on the goods   side generally have stopped their decline—a decline that obviously helped to lower the overall   inflation rate for the last couple of years  And this is true for everything from used cars to apparel;   it’s not just raw materials or commodities prices  The other side, though, is that the rate of inflation   for services—which had been relatively high in the last couple of years—has continued to come   down  If one takes out medical services in particular, it is clear that the rate of inflation for other   services is continuing to moderate  And since services are such a big part of our economy, if that   trend continues I believe it will help to offset some of the lack of price declines on the goods side as   we go forward   May 4, 2004 69 of 112                                                         2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   Putting all that together, my position is that I do believe that the inflation risks are finally   balanced  I would also echo the comments that were made earlier about changing our statement in   order to allow us as much flexibility as possible so we can respond to whatever the data show in the   next couple of months and can take the appropriate steps when needed  "
5259,2004-05-04,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, am still in the camp that would prefer not   have a commitment in the statement  But I like the idea that many of us have been expressing in   speeches—that the policy accommodation has to be removed  What I struggled with—and I was   interested in listening to what was said about it around the table—was the word “measured”  If I   were an outsider trying to read the message in that word, I’m not sure that I would know what it   means  Are we trying to signal a slower pace than in ’94—a gradual and moderate but not pre-  emptive pace?  I guess we’ve come up with a word that I don’t know the meaning of  If the idea is   May 4, 2004 96 of 112       that it says we’re going to determine the pace as the facts come in—and we’ll determine the level at   that time, too—then I think we have the perfect word  I don’t necessarily think it means that we   wouldn’t be as aggressive as we were, say, in ’94  I don’t know how it relates to the average   numbers that Vincent provided here because I don’t know what magnitude we’re talking about with   “measured”  My only concern is what we really want to signal  Are we just going to determine our   moves as the facts come in, or do we really want to signal a gradual pace?     I guess I’m asking, Why don’t we just say that the pace at which the policy   accommodation will be removed will be determined as economic events unfold?  I’d prefer to say   something like that rather than use a code word such as “measured”     Well, I’m hearing a lot of different interpretations of it, even around this table     Yes, there are  "
5310,2004-08-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Many of you have already talked about this soft   patch that we’re going through, and as I prepared my notes for today my main concern was how   long this soft patch is actually going to last  As President Guynn said earlier, the consumer really   has kept the economy moving through this overall business expansion, in terms of getting it back on   the right path  One of the questions today is what is happening to the consumer  I am concerned   about the soft retail sales we’ve seen in the last few months, though obviously the slowing is from   elevated levels  I’m hearing, too, that it’s not just energy prices that are a concern for consumers but   food prices as well  A couple of retailers mentioned to me that when the price of a gallon of milk   and a gallon of gas both go up, it raises questions about how much people have left for discretionary   spending  If those prices start to moderate and level off, then we may have reached the end of this   soft spot   Home sales, which probably are the most bullish indicator of real intentions, continue to be   very strong, though  While such sales have plateaued, they’ve done so at record levels The   purchase of a home is clearly a long-term commitment, and the housing market indicates a degree   of optimism that isn’t evident in the retail sales sector  So based on that, I feel more optimistic that   the economy will get through this soft patch in the next few months   August 10, 2004 62 of 103          One other comment that I heard from some retailers was a reminder to me to be careful   when I look at year-over-year comparisons of sales in the third quarter  Last year, consumers were   getting tax rebate checks, and they went out and spent those funds, especially on lower-end types of   retail sales  So we need to be mindful of that unusual boost to sales a year ago   The jobs numbers, as many of you have indicated already, clearly created a lot of confusion   when they came out on Friday  That made two very weak employment reports in a row, especially   with the revisions factored in  As we’ve always said, these data can be volatile  And if we look at   other indicators of jobs, we have different signals  As was discussed in our Board meeting   yesterday, initial claims are fairly stable, which suggests that it’s new jobs that are not being created    But the household survey points to more optimism on the part of households because it indicated   substantial growth in employment; and usually if the labor force is growing, that’s another signal of   consumer optimism  So, again, we have mixed information about what is happening in the   employment data   The inflation numbers, I find, also have moderated in the last couple of months from the   very rapid rates that we saw in the first half, whether we look at the total inflation or the core   inflation measures that we use  So both of these factors—the likely reasons for the soft patch and   the moderation of inflation—make me want to stay with the “measured pace” language that we have   in our latest statement  And given that the data since our last meeting have clearly provided some   surprises, I want to reemphasize that our commitment to removing policy accommodation at a   measured pace is dependent on the data as they evolve  "
5311,2004-08-10,"  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation, and I do like the wording in the   third revised version better than that in the previous drafts  I think the changes were positive    That’s all I have to say   "
5360,2004-09-21,"  I just want to add one other point  One of the reasons this is happening is   that we’re communicating so well and we have a lot of credibility  Every desk manager and   every banker knows pretty much when rates are going to move, and we give them the luxury of a   two-week period in which to meet their required reserves  So when a bank has two weeks to   meet that requirement and can save 25 basis points on the cost of their reserves, management is   going to pick the time to do it  They would do the same if they were expecting us to drop rates   in a given maintenance period  So part of the problem is the luxury of the time they have—the   two-week maintenance period—to meet their average for required reserves  It may be   worthwhile to look at the length of the maintenance period again as part of this review because   the whole process of reserve management has really changed  This is a profit center operation in   a bank They’re acting totally rationally, and I just don’t want to jeopardize the credibility that   we have in the market now    September 21, 2004 12 of 100          Another question is how much the quarterly funding of the Treasury entered into the   picture in the recent period  Its occurrence in the same maintenance period probably also created   some of this unusual noise  In any event, I think we finally have gotten a lot of credibility in the   market, and we need to be really careful what we do  It may be that we ought to go back and   look at the fact that, especially in this period, banks have much lower reserve levels than they’ve   ever carried—they avoid reserves  They have such a low level of reserves, and there’s a large   amount of movement that the reserve desk can do every day in a bank  That’s another issue,   because banks are doing whatever they can to avoid reserves  "
5361,2004-09-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic indicators, as others have said,   have been variable in the last few months  But on net they show continued expansion, though at   a slower pace than in the second half of last year and the beginning of this year  And as   Governor Ferguson just mentioned, recent surveys show that business attitudes, both at large   companies and small businesses, while still positive, are a little less optimistic than they were   last quarter    I’d like to use a couple of anecdotes to throw on the table a few more hypothetical   explanations for what may be happening here  One is that CEOs, even in meetings with stock   analysts, sometimes are mentioning that their management teams have shifted their focus since   June, when the final rules came out for Sarbanes–Oxley, to implementing audit adaptations and   internal controls by year-end in order to be compliant with that legislation  Those activities take   time that management normally would use to make decisions on business expansion  They don’t   know what to expect with regard to their ability to comply with Sarbanes–Oxley, and we’re   already beginning to see in some 10Q warnings by some companies that they may not be totally   compliant by year-end  The reputation risk here is very significant for these companies   September 21, 2004 75 of 100          Second, another interesting development—and I will cite the same Duke survey that   Governor Ferguson did—is that while CFOs of large companies are expecting GDP growth to   moderate to only 28 percent in the next twelve months, they still are anticipating earnings   growth at their own companies of 134 percent on average  This gets back to a comment I’ve   made in the past, which is that, in talking to CFOs, I realize that they still live in nominal worlds    And one of their reasons for caution in both spending and hiring is their concern about how they   can deliver double-digit earnings growth to the Street when they see modest sales and very   moderate inflation in the months ahead  The only way to get that bottom-line growth is to   control expenses    The other comment I’d like to make is that, overall, companies are stronger  One of the   indicators I look at is the pattern of changes in corporate debt ratings  Worldwide, this will be   the first year since 1998 that we’ve seen more debt ratings rise from below investment grade up   to investment grade than we’ve seen go down from investment grade to below it  It has taken six   years for that to happen, and it’s one of the reasons we’ve seen credit spreads come in    The latest inflation data continue to show that inflation is moderating from the rates   recorded in the spring—again with health care a notable exception  That moderating rate of   inflation is one of the things that make me feel that the expansion is likely to continue, though at   a modest pace  Therefore, I feel that the position we have taken—that policy accommodation   can likely be removed at a measured pace—is still the appropriate signal to send to the market    That signal, I think, has helped to extend the expansion because it has helped the long-term debt   market  As several of you have already noted, long-term debt rates have come down even   though we’ve been raising the funds rate  And I think our credibility, as we move along this   September 21, 2004 76 of 100                                2The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   path, will keep capital within easy access and affordable to companies when they do have the   confidence to make additional business investment      I support it   "
5412,2004-11-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Today, I wanted to focus my comments on   inventory levels and productivity, based on some conversations I’ve had recently with business   folks  For the last several years, I’ve watched the significant structural changes that have been   made in inventory management to lower inventories relative to sales  I’ve also seen the regular   small adjustments that firms make to keep inventory levels in line with changing sales rather than   incur a large unintended buildup in inventories  As a result of both of these factors, inventories   today are a much smaller source of volatility in the economy  In conversations with nonfinancial   business executives, I continue to be struck by comments that they expect to be able to reduce   inventory–sales ratios further  They are continuing to improve internal information flows  And if   they are a manufacturer, they have linked sales, procurement, work scheduling, and shipping so that   November 10, 2004 61 of 107    they can promptly make real-time adjustments anywhere along the business process  Thus, they   expect a much lower likelihood of an unanticipated buildup in inventories for all their various   product lines  They also feel that suppliers have improved their processes in order to respond more   quickly to changing sourcing orders and thereby enable firms to further reduce inventory needs    Comments by these contacts support the forecast in the Greenbook, which anticipates a further   downward trend in inventory–sales ratios  As a result, inventory buildups will continue to provide   a smaller share of real GDP growth in the future   The other area I wanted to comment on is the changing picture of productivity  The   Greenbook discusses productivity, including two alternative scenarios—one with higher   productivity and one with lower productivity  The baseline forecast for the second half of this year   shows productivity growth that is slower than the unusually high levels we’ve seen over the last   year  Recent anecdotal information from my business contacts shows a dichotomy going on with   regard to productivity  On the one hand, these business contacts indicated that they are continuing   to focus on improving productivity for competitive reasons and for quality reasons, too  I might   add that some of the requirements of Sarbanes–Oxley are causing businesses to focus on greater   internal controls  Most of the contacts I’ve talked with were able very quickly to tick off many   process improvements that they have under way, including initiatives that they plan to undertake   next year  They clearly indicated that this is a component of ongoing business planning; it is no   longer a one-off kind of thing to get costs down to meet current competition  It’s a fundamental   change in the way they do business and the way they approach business planning  The high fixed   costs of adding employees for moderate and low salary grades—due primarily to benefit costs—and   morale issues that firms have been working through with regard to employees retained after a   downsizing are continuing to put pressure on businesses to manage staff additions very carefully    So they are continuing to try to work with as lean a staff as possible  However, as the economy has   November 10, 2004 62 of 107    continued to expand at a healthy pace, I’m hearing more managers say that they recognize they are   reaching the limits of how much they can stretch their existing workforce in some business units    So some companies are beginning to add employees  This again is consistent with the Greenbook   notion that we may be at the stage of this economic expansion where new hiring will actually begin   to show up in slower short-run productivity numbers   Finally, let me just make some comments on Sarbanes–Oxley, which has been mentioned   by others  I am hearing a lot more focus on it from business contacts  A key trigger on this occurs   next week when all the third-quarter 10-Q reports have to be filed  Business executives realize that   the first assessments under auditing standard no 2 related to Sarbanes–Oxley are as of year-end,   and when they file their 10-Qs next week, they are within a month and a half of having to say   whether their internal control structures are in compliance with that legislation  So I think we will   begin to see more companies in their 10-Qs next week start to hint to the markets that some aspects   of their internal controls may still need attention, rather than store up the news until the new year    At this point they are far enough along that they already can anticipate whether they are likely to   have problems  They want to be clear and open about their internal controls  CEOs are very   worried about having to admit a major weakness only six weeks later and having to say, “I didn’t   know that we weren’t going to be ready”  That is a risk to them  So I think the 10-Qs next week   could be very interesting  Management at all levels is extremely focused on Sarbanes–Oxley as we   approach the year-end—I’m hearing a lot of comments about it—and I think we’re going to begin   to see some references to it in the 10-Qs this time  "
5413,2004-11-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation, including the   language, for this meeting, but I do share some of the concerns that several of my colleagues around   the table have expressed  I think some of the language may not be seen as particularly consistent   with our policy of improved communications  If the words are seen as boilerplate every time, in a   way it may take away from our flexibility going forward  So at the December meeting, I’d like us   November 10, 2004 89 of 107    to look at some alternatives  If the word “measured” continues to be part of our statement, I think,   as others have said, it will end up tying our hands   Another part of the statement is the second sentence, in which we’ve talked about this   “robust underlying growth in productivity”  We saw in the ’90s that we moved to a different level   of long-term productivity growth, but as I said in my comments, we may be in a part of this   business cycle or stage of the recovery when productivity growth is going to look weaker  We need   to think about how that is worded  I think that language could raise some questions about what   productivity we are focusing on—the long-term versus the cyclical—if productivity turns out to be   weakening, as the forecast in the Greenbook lays out  So as the recovery continues to move   forward, there are aspects of the statement that we have to be careful about in terms of leaving in   some of the language for such a long period of time  We need to think through and begin to   anticipate prior to a meeting how to make those kinds of changes in order to give us flexibility  "
5466,2004-12-14," Danker)  The aspect of the economy that I want to focus on is   the improving outlook for consumer spending  After a significant slowing in the second quarter,   real consumer spending grew by a healthy 51 percent annual rate in the third quarter and advanced   strongly in the last two months  While early indicators of holiday spending imply not as bright a   time as retailers have anticipated, particularly for lower-price retailers, inventories appear to be   closely managed  The expectation for a strong year in 2005 for retail sales seems more firmly   grounded than earlier this fall  Since the last FOMC meeting, oil prices have fallen significantly,   December 14, 2004 58 of 118           2 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                                                        which should put more discretionary spending power in the wallets of consumers and help the cash   flow of businesses that are heavy users of petroleum products     Over the past three months, payroll employment gains have exceeded their average pace of   the past twelve months  The stronger pace of employment gains will expand the income base to   support continued consumption growth  While consumers should increase saving out of current   income for their long-term financial health, there are few signs that they are willing to build their   assets and defer spending at the current time  Long-term interest rates are still low by historical   standards and have not provided enough incentive to encourage significant growth in longer-term   bank deposits  Strongly rising housing prices have increased assets, and the resumption in growth   of equity prices in the stock market will provide another leg to support increased net worth  If   recent behavior patterns continue, therefore, consumers will be able to increase spending and show   growth of assets, without significant increases in the short-term saving rate  Thus, I have greater   confidence in the pace of economic growth in the next few quarters, and I believe that we should   continue to remove accommodation by raising the fed funds rate by 25 basis points today    "
5529,2005-03-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic growth this quarter, as several of you   have noted, has been stronger than we earlier had anticipated Retail sales excluding autos have   grown at over a 9 percent annual rate in the first two months of the quarter  Business investment has   been strong and does not show a significant decline as a result of companies having moved   investments into the fourth quarter to take advantage of the last months of partial expensing for tax                                March 22, 2005 69 of 116  purposes Manufacturing output has also been growing soundly, and capacity usage is now close to   its average of the last decade at 785 percent And employment has been growing at a good pace   Over the last few months, we have seen core inflation move modestly higher  And we are   seeing data that indicate price pressures coming from both the sales and the cost sides of companies   The strong growth of recent months is making it easier to raise prices, and rising costs from both   commodities and labor are also adding to cost pressures  This economic expansion is reaching its   fourth anniversary, and sales levels now are giving businesses the confidence to be able to raise   prices The Beige Book and comments by several of the Presidents today indicate that businesses   are finding it easier to do so The NFIB survey shows more pricing power for small businesses, and   other business surveys are indicating the same  As Dave Stockton noted earlier, rising import prices   are also giving domestic companies more pricing power   On the cost side, the extraordinary pace of productivity growth has slowed in the past year   Productivity grew at a 56 percent pace in the year ending in the first quarter 2004, but fell to about   one-fourth that pace in the second half of last year While productivity is still very strong from an   historical perspective, it has slowed enough that the direction of unit labor costs has changed Unit   labor costs began rising in the second quarter of 2004, after falling for two years, and grew at 23   percent in the last quarter Thus, with the outlook for continued strong economic growth, I believe   that we cannot be as sanguine about the trend in prices in coming months  We need to be signaling   that we are more dependent on incoming data, and I think that requires a change from the “measured   pace” language to give us more flexibility in the months ahead  Thank you  "
5530,2005-03-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support both the 25 basis points and alternative B,   as amended                                March 22, 2005 95 of 116  In terms of the dialogue we’ve just had about how we communicate, while it’s very painful   every time we go through one of these exercises, I believe this is one of the things that we need to   think through because the transparency that we’re building is very important to the marketplace    When I look at the rationale statements, I think they are sending more messages as we do these press   releases   In the brief time that I’ve been on the Board of Governors and participated in the FOMC   meetings, we seem to be stressed when we get to the point where our direction of policy is changing   So part of this stress is over the transitional language The more we seem to be locked into formulas   and words, the more difficult we make these transitions  That is a factor in how we think about   communication; we really need to look at what seems right for one meeting and how we get out of   that as we move forward  Maybe having these draft statements a little earlier and being able to think   about them for more than a couple days ahead of the meeting will help  But I think longer term,   painful as it may be, we do need to have discussions about transitional language, because that’s   when the market is going to look for guidance  And words like “appropriate policy action” I don’t   think communicate a whole lot to the Street  They may get us through today’s meeting, but I think   we have to be more transparent as we make the transition we need to make  "
5577,2005-05-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I guess I’m going to repeat a lot of the things that   others have said, but I think I will end up in a somewhat different place than some of you around the   table in that I’m much more concerned about the risks of inflation than I am about those for the real   economy   If we look at the first-quarter data, and more particularly the information that has come out in   the last several weeks, we can really see that the quarter started out very strong and that the more   recent data showed some weakness  First-quarter GDP growth at 31 percent was much weaker than   most folks, myself included, expected  But if one looks at the components of the underlying data,   they show that the weakness in the first quarter was primarily in net exports—particularly due to the                                 May 3, 2005 67 of 116  surge in imports—and in government spending  In fact, private domestic final sales were really   quite good in the quarter, growing by my rough estimate at somewhere in the high 3 percent range     So how do we deal with that?  Well, to the extent that the weakness is imports and is coming   from strong consumer and business spending, that’s a good sign  So, while I want to get some more   data on what is happening in the real economy, I’m not as pessimistic as some of you  Monetary   policy is still accommodative, if one looks at the liquidity in the banking system  And while the   weaker economic data caused some reaction in financial markets, overall the conditions are very   supportive of business expansion and consumer borrowing  Corporate profits for the first quarter,   which are still coming in, seem to show continued strength, and first-quarter earnings growth now   looks as if it will be in double digits for the twelfth straight quarter   To me the other remarkable development in the markets is what has happened in reaction to   news about compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley  This is the first year-end reporting Most companies   are on a calendar year-end, and a record number of companies have announced that they cannot   report in the regular time frame and are doing late filings  Normally, one would expect this to create   a disruption in the market, but the market has been very discerning in the way it has taken the news    Many companies that have reported have had to disclose weaknesses in their internal controls   around financial reporting And based just on the anecdotal evidence, the market seems to be   behaving very prudently in that it is distinguishing between companies where the reported   weaknesses are isolated in one small area and those where the control weaknesses are more   pervasive So, it appears that the sunshine associated with these disclosures is being handled well in   the marketplace  We’ll see what happens as we go along and those firms that have still to disclose   their Sarbanes-Oxley reports do so I was a little concerned that we might see more volatility in the   market as a result of these reports, but that worry has been disappearing in the last few weeks                                 May 3, 2005 68 of 116  Let me turn now to the inflation issue, which does have me more concerned  If we look at   the lagging indicators, inflation numbers over the last 12 months are still in the mid-1 percent range,   depending on what measure we look at  But one of the things we need to realize is that in the first   part of last year inflation rates were very, very low   If I look instead at inflation measures in the first   quarter compared to the fourth quarter, I get very much concerned about the trend we’re seeing  If I   throw out all of the volatile energy and food components, the way we typically do, and look at core   measures, core CPI has risen by 13 percentage points to 33 percent in the last three months  Core   PCE is up a full point to 26 percent   As to where we see prices rising, the big turnaround, as some of you have indicated, has   been in the goods sector of the market  Prices for services continue to be rising by a bit above 2   percent, but goods prices have gone from declining at an almost 3 percent pace at the beginning of   last year to being about unchanged now That is affecting the aggregate numbers and is something   we need to watch The employment cost index in the first quarter did show a slight slowing to 07   percent from 08 percent in the fourth quarter  But as David remarked, this is due to the slowdown   in pension funding that occurred in the first quarter   A recent survey of corporate CFOs shows that their number one concern continues to be   health care costs And as they look to pay for the cost of labor going forward, many of them are   trying to hold down wage increases because of the significant rise they’re seeing in health care costs    Where this will lead in terms of future hiring is a concern  It may impact the real economy, because   if employment growth continues at the more subdued pace of the last month, it could affect   consumption and the real final sales that are giving me confidence in the real sector  As for the   balance of risks, I agree with the comments President Yellen made; I believe the risks of inflation are   now clearly on the upside                                    May 3, 2005 69 of 116 "
5578,2005-05-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support the recommendation to raise rates 25 basis   points, and I’ll support alternative B As the Governors know, I’ve been frustrated with the whole   “assessment of risk” piece of this, but yesterday, after thinking about it, I realized that it isn’t so   simple to craft the alternatives  One of the things that I’m struck by is that sentences 3 and 4 are   really the meat of the release each time  They tell how we’re looking at the real economy and at   inflation, which are our two major mandates  But if we didn’t have something tying them   together—to convey some conclusion about the risks—that would leave the markets hanging  To   me, that’s what would happen if we got rid of lines 5 and 6 entirely  So, I think we do need   something to anchor that  At first I was leaning toward alternative C, line 6, thinking that would do   it Then the more I read it, I thought These references to fostering the attainment of sustainable   economic growth and price stability are like motherhood and apple pie  Obviously, this is what the   Fed is supposed to do So, is it really saying anything?  We could have that sentence in there no   matter what—if the rate of inflation were 12 percent or if unemployment were down to 3½ percent    So the question is What do we need there?   I think we need something beyond just the rationale for   our decision today Right now, I think sentence 2 is important because it says that while we get   noise in the data, underlying all of this we are still accommodative  And that sets up the notion of a   longer-run horizon beyond the next meeting                                       May 3, 2005 101 of 116  So, as we look to replace this, it’s almost as if the longer-run horizon is the important point   Maybe, as President Yellen said, this gets back to the way we set our goals and targets overall But   we need a longer-run anchor, and then we need a short-run signal to the market  So I don’t think we   can just eliminate the risk assessment  We have to say something, especially at times such as this   where we have risks on both sides  "
5625,2005-08-09," I wanted to follow up on your comments about mortgage hedging  I’m   hearing concerns that there is increased hedging activity for servicing rights on the new option   ARMS To the extent that they are servicing rights, the risk is the prepayment risk, and   historically banks have found it very hard to come up with any kind of hedging model against   prepayments on ARMs  So this could be a hit to earnings of banks that are building up big   portfolios of this—and it involves the servicing rights, not carrying the loan in the portfolio  Are   you hearing of anybody trying to hedge that prepayment risk?  "
5626,2005-08-09," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to focus my comments today on some   macroeconomic perspectives and on what we’re learning in the supervisory reviews of mortgage   products that we and other regulators are undertaking now   On the positive side, when we look at the large volume of ARMs in existence, most of   them are of the traditional form  And currently those ARMs are at a point—whether they’re   adjusted annually or they started out as 3-year fixed-rate loans and then move to annual   adjustments—where they will be reset  For the ones that started out in 2002 with fixed rates for   three years, this is the year when they will go to annual resets  We know all of them, since   they’re indexed to short-term rates, are going to have a big increase whenever their anniversary   comes up in the second half of 2005 and into 2006                               August 9, 2005 70 of 110  To the extent that long mortgage rates or the reindexed rates are very close to those   available to most borrowers on refinancings, it looks as if most of these ARMs can be converted   into a fixed-rate product without a large amount of payment adjustment  There will be some, but   it seems likely to be manageable for many of these borrowers   On the other hand, we’re seeing a lot of subprime ARMs where this may not be true  As   you know, those ARM products that have been pushed into the subprime market are much more   problematic  So the affordability for that group of customers is questionable  They are going to   be hit not only by higher gas prices but higher monthly mortgage payments when their rates are   reset And that is going to be more of an issue as we go forward and as we continue to raise   short-term interest rates   Also, I’m a bit more pessimistic about what is happening with regard to some of these   option ARMs and the more esoteric ARMs that are being marketed and have been marketed   particularly in the last nine months  Bankers as a whole I think clearly are doing a good job at   underwriting these We have some lenders on the edges, though, that we’re working on   But these mortgage market developments have some significant macroeconomic   implications  Many of these loans started out with teaser rates that were below current market   rates So first of all, the rates have to catch up to the market level  Then also, the index to which   the rate is tied will have moved up by about 250 or more basis points, say, by the end of the year    So if they are interest-only loans, the rate could go from something that maybe started out with a   “1” and could get to something with a “4” in front of it  And all of a sudden the monthly   payments are going to go up fourfold  Even if defaults don’t increase, it certainly is going to pull   a lot of discretionary income out of spending and have some implications down the road                         August 9, 2005 71 of 110  Another issue is that apparently many of these loans have limits on how much the   payment can go up each year in order to try to make the annual adjustment easier  But that puts   borrowers in a predicament because it throws them into negative amortization  During the teaser   period, they’re in negative amortization; and the cap on the index used to reset the monthly   payment could put them further into negative amortization So if they do want to get out of the   ARM and switch to a fixed-rate loan, they have to cover the additional negative amortization    Many of these loans have prepayment penalties, so the lenders recoup that  That may be   problematic in moving more people into fixed-rate products as interest rates rise  And to the   extent borrowers go to fixed-rate mortgages, they’ll go to fully amortizing loans, which could be   a financial burden—even though we are beginning to see mortgages of 40 years and longer  The   leverage that we see in households on their borrowing I think is another indication that if they’re   stretching to be able to afford these houses, it will be more problematic for them to stay in the   houses as their monthly payments go up—perhaps even double or triple    So, when we talk about the wealth effect of housing price bubbles, I’m getting concerned   around the edges that we could see a major impact on cash flows of both subprime and prime   borrowers because these ARMS are indexed to short rates and those rates are moving up  Since   ARMs are a big chunk of the mortgage market today, we have to realize that we can’t just look at   long-term mortgage rates and the affordability of housing  We need to look at the short rates,   too, because they’re getting to be more and more important     As I look overall at the economy today—and I’m going to echo some of the comments   I’ve heard around the table—I’m very comfortable that we have gotten past the soft spot of the   spring I also am a little pessimistic regarding how this recent bounce will be sustained  But I   think we do have a strong foundation going forward, with growth somewhere in the mid-threes                             August 9, 2005 72 of 110  And in my view, that is a good pace of growth  I also believe, to echo the comments Governor   Kohn just made, that the market has reacted to the understanding that we may have to push rates   up even further There is a tremendous amount of liquidity in the market, and I think that’s what   the market is seeing  When we talk about accommodation, the market is looking at the liquidity   that can flow into deals for both commercial activity and for consumers  So I think we need to   continue to push the funds rate upward And personally, my number for the upper limit on the   funds rate is much higher today than it was three to four months ago  "
5627,2005-08-09," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendations  I really like paragraph four   the way it is for the same reason Governor Ferguson just mentioned  I want to leave people with   the message that inflation pressures are out there and are elevated, and I want to make sure that   that message gets through  So I rather like it the way it is, even though it may not be as smooth   grammatically  "
5670,2005-09-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman  As many of you have already remarked,   preparing for this meeting was a lot more challenging than preparing for other recent meetings    The economy was poised for strong growth in the third and fourth quarters before Hurricane   Katrina And the forecast that the staff has developed in the Greenbook I think is reasonable,   given what we know at this time  That forecast suggests that while we may see some short-run   softness, with growth below the rate we had anticipated, the rebuilding efforts clearly will add   stimulus over the next year  I am also comforted that the underlying economy was strong  So   while we are going to see a slight downtick due to the impact of the hurricane, the Greenbook   forecast of real GDP growth in the mid-3 percent range over the next year indicates that we have   sound economic expansion ahead  So while uncertainty about economic growth has increased, I   still believe there are much more serious clouds on the inflation horizon   The rapid rise in energy prices in the last couple of months has pushed the level of prices   high enough that more firms are likely to find that they cannot absorb the increased costs and   must raise prices to protect their profit margins  This will become more so the longer that energy   prices remain high   I am still hearing mixed expectations about the availability of natural gas this winter    While the impact of Katrina may not be as severe as first feared, the limited ability to expand   natural gas supply, as we saw in the last two years, on top of slower fill due to hurricane damage,   may create shortages this winter, especially if the economy remains as strong as we expect                      September 20, 2005 84 of 117  As the Greenbook notes, business spending on equipment and software has only modest   forward momentum  This is despite solid economic growth, healthy profits, and favorable   financial conditions So why is business investment so limited?  I’m going to answer this by   referring to the most recent quarterly survey of CFOs conducted by Duke University with CFO   Magazine And I would note that this survey was concluded on August 28, the day before   Katrina hit   I want to read to you the lead on their press release for this survey  It says “Corporate   Optimism Plummets in Response to Housing and Fuel Concerns”  For the first time in the four-  year history of this survey, more CFOs are pessimistic than optimistic about the US economy    Their number one concern is high fuel costs, ranking above health care costs for the first time    Interestingly, the survey also noted a jump in what they call their terrorism index, with one-third   of the firms responding that costs to improve security and business recovery response has   negatively impacted their bottom line  I think after Katrina there will be more firms looking at   their business recovery plans   As some executives have told me, with the rising costs of benefits, energy, and financing,   they are closely managing discretionary items, including capital spending  Over the next 12   months, the CFOs who participated in the survey are planning slower growth of investment; they   now expect to increase capital spending by only 47 percent  The survey indicates that CFOs are   also worried about the housing market  They believe the market is overheated and that a   necessary and expected decline in housing prices will negatively affect their firms  This echoes   comments I’ve heard from others that a reversal in the housing market might have negative   spillover effects due to consumers’ reactions to a fall in the value of their housing wealth  So I                         September 20, 2005 85 of 117  find the survey results consistent with other comments I’ve been hearing that the business   pessimism we’re seeing is due in large part to growing concerns about rising prices on several   fronts   While recent inflation numbers are very well behaved, the Greenbook does reflect a rise   in the core inflation forecast over the next year  The volatility we saw yesterday in the energy   futures market, clearly due to Rita and other concerns, indicates how much the market is   focusing on the unknown path for inflation that companies are facing  While the impact on   inflation may be unclear—and we know the damage to platforms out in the Gulf and the effects   on refinery capacity are still being assessed—the nervousness about costs is a factor that is   affecting business behavior, and it is something that we can’t ignore  The fiscal stimulus of   Katrina and the rebuilding that will result is only going to add to inflation—and that’s on top of a   transportation bill that has a lot of spending on infrastructure that some of us think should have   less priority than rebuilding around the Gulf Coast   The chart on page 21—and I also love these new charts—helps us keep things in   perspective, in terms of the historical trends in inflation as we’ve been tightening up from   meeting to meeting  And we have to keep that in mind as we look to the future  We know that   there is still ample liquidity in financial markets, so the risks of higher inflation to me right now   are much greater than the risks to economic growth   I think it’s important that at today’s meeting we give the market assurance that we will   continue to focus on and be diligent in dealing with inflation, because rising costs appear to be at   the heart of companies’ concerns  To me that’s very important, and I want to support an increase   in interest rates at this meeting                                                                                    September 20, 2005 86 of 117   Mr Chairman, I support the increase of ¼ point today  I remain mainly   concerned about the inflationary risk, and I think we need to continue on our path  "
5713,2005-11-01,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  What I’d like to do today is to talk a little bit more   about some recent trends in consumer borrowing information, which a few people have already   mentioned, and then just make some general comments on the economy and on inflation   As a couple of you have already noted, the data on consumer borrowing have shown a lot of   noise, as I would call it, in the last couple months  Overall, we’re seeing a slowing in the rapid rate   of growth  It’s still growing in general, but the pace of growth is slowing  So it raises the question   of what is really happening here  Are consumers saying that they are nearing the point at which   they really can’t absorb any more debt?  Or are changes in underwriting under way that are slowing   the pace of growth?   As you know, the Senior Loan Officer Survey, covered in the supplement to the Greenbook,   reported only modest changes in demand for credit; it was modestly lower  And to the extent that   this could reflect consumer demand, we know that motor vehicles sales have slowed in the last                             November 1, 2005 72 of 114  couple of months, as the big incentives came off  Also, we’re beginning to see a moderation in the   pace of increase in median housing prices  So that could be consistent with a slowing in demand   On the other hand, if we look at the chart in the Greenbook on bankruptcy filings, there was a   huge spike in the week prior to October 17, just before the new bankruptcy law went into effect    And that could have front-loaded anywhere from three to four quarters of bankruptcy filings, as   everybody tried to get in before the law changed  We saw a tremendous increase at that point  It   doesn’t reflect what the banks are showing in the quality of their credit or in the securitized   transactions that are out there in the market where delinquency rates have basically been fairly   stable So this was a blip up ahead of what our normal leading indicators are showing   On home equity lines, I find the numbers really remarkable  Home equity lines grew 31   percent in 2003, 44 percent in 2004, slowed to 17 percent growth in the first half of this year, and   now, as Governor Kohn just mentioned, have shown declines in September and October  So the   question is What is happening with these home equity lines?  As you know, the banking agencies   collectively put out common guidance in May regarding home equity lines  There was really   nothing new in this guidance  It just pulled together what was out there to remind everybody what   safe and sound lending practices are  We know that the vast majority of banks follow these sound   procedures in almost all of their lending  So I felt comforted that in the Senior Loan Officer Survey   only a few banks said they had changed their underwriting standards because of the new guidance    That to me says that we did really focus on the outliers, which was our intention  So I don’t believe   that this reining in of home equity lines is due to underwriting changes  We know that home equity   lines have been used not only to extract equity for spending but also increasingly for downpayments   on purchases of homes—more so than in the past  So again, this could reflect something more that   is going on                                              November 1, 2005 73 of 114  As you know, the banking agencies later this quarter are going to issue some guidance on   mortgages and on loans for commercial real estate  Again, our intention is not to signal alarm that   overall credit quality and underwriting are poor, but to call attention to some lending practices at the   limit that are raising some concerns  So at the margin it could have some impact on the pace of   lending, but we think overall things are in pretty good shape   The other point I want to make is about credit card lending  More than a year ago now, both   the OCC [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency] and the Fed started to raise questions about   underwriting and credit advances for borrowers who go over their lines of credit and about   minimum payments expected on credit card balances  A growing number of customers were not   being required to cover late payment fees or fees for going over their credit line and actually were   into negative amortization when their outstanding balances exceeded their lines of credit   We’ve given the banks quite a bit of time to figure out how to get into compliance with these   guidelines  Some started doing so toward the end of last year and some will be doing it later this   year; so they are moving at their own pace  The change in practices will slow credit growth for   some clients—the ones who chronically are over their lines and who have paid only the minimum   monthly fee  Again, we don’t expect this to be widespread, but it could be a factor in some of these   bankruptcy filings People who have been at the fringe of being overextended are realizing that   they’re going to have to get their borrowings down   Now let me shift my focus to the overall economy  I find that the pace of the expansion has   been quite resilient, given everything that we’ve been through in the past year  Recently, despite   significant difficulties, whether it was hurricanes or the spike in oil prices, growth continued at a   sound pace in the mid-3 percent range  And the staff forecast shows more of that next year                                        November 1, 2005 74 of 114  Inflation has slowed in the last couple of months, but I’ve focused a bit on the nature of the   developments there  As you know, some of the slowdown has been in prices of services  And with   some of the trends we’re seeing in core elements of inflation, getting a number over 2 percent, as the   forecast has, begins to give me some concern  So I look at that and at the forecast for a continued   rise in labor compensation costs A potential slowdown in productivity also suggests that we need   to be much more attentive to what’s going on in terms of cost pressures on the labor front that could   affect workers’ expectations of compensation increases  So I think it’s even more important for us   to watch inflation in the next few months   I support raising the funds rate today  I also support the dialogue, as President Yellen   outlined, on the elements of our communication so that we have an orderly transition  We ought to   look carefully at every word in our statement  While it will be parsed when we make changes, at   least all of us will have had some time to think about the changes  And I would hope that we have   that dialogue at our next meeting  "
5714,2005-11-01,"  Mr Chairman, I support the 25 basis point increase and the language in   alternative B, and I look forward to seeing how Vincent will help get a consensus within this group    One thing I’ve learned is that whenever we try to tinker with this, we end up with a wide variety of   viewpoints around the table  So I wish him good patience with all of us as he tries to get our   comments in  "
5758,2005-12-13,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to echo Dave Stockton’s analogy of tidings of   great joy in this forecast  I think the upward revision in growth and the downward revision in   inflation are developments that we all welcome at this point in the economic expansion   As I tried to assess some of the information to see where I would want to come out on policy,   I tended to take an approach similar to the one President Yellen took, in saying Where do we stand at   this point in our effort to remove accommodation, and where are we going as we move forward?  In   the alternative scenarios laid out in this Greenbook, there is really only one where long-term inflation   expectations lose their anchor and which therefore gives me much concern  As I looked at where we   are on inflation, I was struck that there is some good news and some bad news and that there are   currently risks on both sides  Last year we saw inflation coming up from extraordinarily low levels—   moving up from 1 percent to over 2 percent  It rebounded quickly, and I was one who was quite   concerned by how quickly inflation had moved up  In the last six months, though, it has been 16   percent, which sounds like a fairly good area for it to be in  But the fact that it rebounded so fast   clearly indicates that we always have to be very alert to developments on that front, because prices   can move rapidly   The energy pass-through, I think, is a risk for higher inflation  I’d love to see the analysis that   San Francisco has done on that issue because, depending on what level of costs are passed through, I                                                   December 13, 2005 60 of 100  think we could see real concerns about disruptions and risks to the economy going forward—as a   consequence, for example, of believing that energy prices are going to stay in a high range for several   years or seeing the possibility of outright shortages in areas like natural gas    We’ve also seen that other central banks in the world are now expecting stronger growth and   higher inflation in their economies  The ECB [European Central Bank], as was mentioned earlier,   finally raised its policy rate, and even the Bank of Japan is coming out of a zero rate world  So some   of the cushion we’ve had worldwide may be moderating, and that could produce more risks on the   upside on inflation   On the other hand, when I look at what has been happening with jobs growth and labor   compensation, I continue to be struck by how moderate the growth in compensation has been  The   productivity story is clearly one reason for this  The numbers continue to amaze me at this point in   the cycle   It’s easy to achieve productivity gains in a company early on when you have excess   capacity But this many years into an expansion, it really takes a ton of attention and effort   Another thing that often comes up in my conversations with business executives is this  They   are sitting at very high levels of profit and cash flow generation; and when you ask them about their   main challenges, they still say their primary challenge is to maintain profit growth  If you start to dig   into that, you find that it’s beyond just managing wage costs and looking at capital  The lessons they   learned in the ’90s in terms of really changing the way business processes are run are continuing to   play a role in all of the decisions they’re making on issues like inventory management—not tying up   capital either in inventory stored or in warehouse capacity    As I looked at last month’s numbers, inventory-sales ratios hit record lows  So clearly,   businesses are continuing to learn more and more about how to keep inventory levels very, very   low—even though they’re trying to customize the delivery of products  And they are doing that                               December 13, 2005 61 of 100  through better information systems and better order management systems They also are focusing a   great deal on quality control, particularly in services and retail businesses, and in business services   where that is a key differentiator with the competition  But better quality also has major cost benefits   because it reduces errors and the need to redo work and it focuses on the timeliness of delivery  And   these are the kinds of values beyond prices that customers are rating as increasingly important  So   firms get both greater efficiency and value added for their customer base more than in the past   And finally, outsourcing—and I’m talking not internationally but simply outside of the core   enterprise—is a business practice that evolved in the ’90s and has proven to be very important  In the   old days when you ran a big corporation that was vertically integrated, there were cost centers   throughout the organization and it was very hard for CFOs to get a handle on controlling costs  Now   that the culture has become “if it isn’t a core function, you ought to try to outsource it,” the process of   renegotiating with the contractors annually or semi-annually or every three years and of going out for   other bids puts continual pressure on attaining productivity improvements and a favorable cost   payback But when the function was embedded in the bigger organization, the social politics   sometimes got in the way and made it difficult to wring out the costs  The fact is that firms now try   not to do everything, and to outsource functions unrelated to their core business  That this has   become an ingrained practice in many companies is another theme I’m hearing  So, in short, I’m   finding that changes in business practices are the focus of a lot of companies  And they believe that   despite higher costs, they are going to be able to improve the value with modest price increases going   forward   Pulling all of that together, I tend to think that we are very close to the end of the increases in   interest rates that we need to implement  There are risks on both sides, but it strikes me, based on the   Greenbook forecast, that we’re getting to full potential in a very orderly way  And as was mentioned                                                                                   December 13, 2005 62 of 100  a minute ago, according to the Bluebook, the real fed funds rate  that we would have with a 25 basis   point increase today is at the midpoint of the range of the staff’s estimates of equilibrium  Also, it’s   above the funds rate derived from the policy rules for all of  the alternatives  So we are close to where   I think we need to be, given the forecast  As a result, I think we really do need to talk about how to    make this transition and change our communication     Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, let me say that I support the 25 basis point   increase today  And I give my sympathy to Brian, who has heard our many different viewpoints in   the last week  I think he has done a good job of trying to get all our ideas out here in a reasonable   balance My initial feeling was that I really didn’t want to keep the word “measured” in the   statement; I wanted to drop it as part of this change  But for the reasons everybody has suggested, I   can accept the wording in alternative B as it is now   Mr Chairman, you talked about some of the risks to the long-term side of the market  I think   that is a serious concern because so much of the pricing these days seems not to involve looking at the   longer-term risks, and it’s so critical to what is currently driving investment and risk-taking  And for   that reason, I guess I’d like to leave the words as they are now  But the big change that I would like to   see is a move away from forward-looking language as we get to the point where there is more   uncertainty about future policy  It was easy for the last thirteen meetings to say, “We’re on a trend;   the funds rate is way too low and we have to get it back up”  So it was easy for us to signal ahead    But as we signaled ahead, the market looked at what we were saying we were going to do as opposed   to what the data were saying we would do  We, in effect, have taken the risk away from the market,   especially at the long end, because market participants think we’re going to signal ahead of time and   they will have time to get out of their long positions   In my view, we should go back to structuring section 4 to say basically where we think the   risk is Then I’d take the second part of that sentence and put it down in section 5, because it’s still a   tautology to me It still says we want to attain the right balance  Well, there’s no way any of us                                               December 13, 2005 83 of 100  around this table is going to say that we’re not going to follow the mission of the Fed  So if we’re   going to put in a tautology, I’d put it in part 5  And in part 4 I’d just indicate our assessment of the   risks—that we think the risks are balanced or that the risk to growth or for inflation is greater  That   would give the markets the message that they need to go back to looking at the data to figure out what   we’re going to do, rather than our laying out for them what our next policy moves are going to be  As   we get to the cusp, that risk perspective is really important  We saw when we turned from the bottom   and rates were heading back up again that it disrupted the markets  But we need the markets to be   ready to absorb that kind of risk because, as we sit around this table, we do not know exactly how   we’re going to engineer getting out of this pattern of moving 25 basis points at each meeting  And I   think the way to do it is to focus on where we see the risks and to stop giving any kind of signal on   what our likely moves are going forward  I would like to see that happen at the next meeting  "
5802,2006-01-31,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  When I was preparing for this meeting early last   week, I was feeling very comfortable with the forecast of good growth in 2006, in the mid-3 percent   range near potential, and a modest uptick in core inflation above 2 percent  As many of you have   already remarked, the GDP numbers on Friday made me slightly more pessimistic, both on growth   and on inflation  The surprise drop in government spending, I have full confidence will turn around    Final sales fell, however, so that all the growth that occurred in the fourth quarter came from   inventory growth  Given that inventory–sales ratios continue to run at historically low levels,   though, inventories should continue to be a source of growth going forward  As many of you also   have noted, other indicators show much stronger performance  Initial unemployment claims, goods   orders, capacity utilization, and strong corporate balance sheets—all of them effectively say that we   January 31, 2006 64 of 106    have a strong foundation underneath this growth  The inflation numbers ticking up to 22 percent   gave me a bit of pause  We came through two good quarters, the second and third quarters, with   very low inflation; but again, the uptick shows how much variability we see around the inflation   numbers quarter to quarter and warrants attention   The one area—and I want to second Dave Stockton’s remark—of main concern is the   housing market  Let me talk about it a little differently from some previous comments today    When we look at the aggregate levels of debt that households have and relative prices, one of the   things as an old lender I worry about is the ability to service the debt and the discretionary spending   that households have  While 80 percent of mortgages are fixed rate, 20 percent are variable    Starting in 2002, we saw a jump in ARMs, taking advantage of the very steep yield curve at the   time  We now are in a period when not only the fancy option ARMs, the exotic products of the past   eighteen months, but also the 3/1 ARMs and the five-year ARMS that became very popular in 2002   and 2003 are repricing   If interest rates just hold where they are right now, we estimate that the monthly debt service   cost is going to go up by at least 50 percent on that 20 percent of mortgage portfolios  If you look at   the Greenbook, you’ll notice that the financial obligation ratio rose quite substantially in the past six   months  It is now back to the peaks of 2001 and 2002, and we have a lot of mortgages still to   reprice  We also know that some of these exotic mortgages don’t amortize, but they will kick in and   start amortization and that will also pull cash out of discretionary spending   In an overall look at consumers, with housing and the cost of heating this winter rising,   you’re beginning to see a little caution in the borrowing numbers  The drop in home equity lines of   credit that I mentioned a meeting or two ago now has been sustained through the whole quarter  So   we have actually seen that home equity lines outstanding that have been drawn on have dropped    January 31, 2006 65 of 106    Consumer credit as a whole dropped, excluding mortgage credit, and mortgage growth as a whole   slowed to just over 10 percent  So households are signaling that they’re pulling back on new   borrowing, not just in housing but in general  When you look at the ability of consumers to spend   discretionarily out of their monthly take-home pay, these are signals we need to look at  And the   rising fixed payments that they have is something, in looking at the tail of the distribution on   housing market risk, that I think is important for that segment of the population going forward   The other sad thing is that this is our last meeting with the Chairman, and I just personally   also want to echo some of the comments of my colleagues around the table to thank you for your   leadership  I’ve been very impressed with the kind of atmosphere that I found when I joined during   your tenure as leader of this institution  The integrity with which everything is done, your emphasis   on the quality of ideas, and your continuing to search for new ways to look at information—because   the economy is dynamic—remind us that we have to watch for new things always evolving  The   collegiality with which you have led this organization has made it enjoyable for all of us to be here    And finally, as an old risk manager, I was glad to feel right at home with your approach to monetary   policy  [Laughter]  So thank you for your leadership  It has been a pleasure to have served with   you  "
5803,2006-01-31,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support both the 25 basis point increase and the   wording of “may,” and again, I think it would be good to defer the discussion about the implications   of the alternatives that Vince has laid out  "
