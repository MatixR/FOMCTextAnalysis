8106,2007-03-20,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Thank you for the earlier welcome  Over   the intermeeting period, aggregate economic activity in the Sixth District showed signs of slowing    Manufacturing activity appeared to soften, with the majority of reports suggesting declining orders    Retail reports pointed to a slowing pace of sales  The BLS employment data revisions for 2006   supported the view that Florida’s economy has decelerated considerably in the wake of the housing   downturn  Sales tax data suggest that retail spending in Florida actually declined in late 2006    Recovery on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi and Louisiana continues to proceed more slowly than   hoped  The immediate post-hurricane boost to spending has waned, and the problems of housing   and insurance availability remain largely unresolved   The biggest concern for the Sixth District continues to be in real estate markets  As stated at   the last meeting, it appears to be too early to suggest that the region’s housing situation has   stabilized or that the housing sector’s drag on the District has ended  Reports indicate that many   areas in Florida are experiencing dramatic declines in sales of single-family homes and condos,   March 20-21, 2007 50 of 196    even while new product continues to come onto the market  As a result of this oversupply,   construction plans have been cut back  In January, permit issuance for single-family homes in   Florida was 57 percent lower than a year earlier  For the rest of the United States the decline was 25   percent  Permits for multifamily development declined 40 percent versus a 7 percent decline   nationally  This situation is most extreme in Florida  Interestingly, we do hear anecdotal reports of   improved potential buyer traffic in Florida, but that improvement is not translating into sales    Buyers appear to be expecting lower prices  In the other states in the District, single-family permits   were down 19 percent in January, less than the decline nationally   Regarding the region’s exposure to nonprime and subprime mortgages, the concern is again   mostly in Florida  According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, over 9 percent of mortgages   serviced in Florida in the fourth quarter of 2006 were subprime ARM loans; this exposure was   second only to Nevada, which was at 13 percent, and compares with 6½ percent nationally  In   contrast, the exposures of the other states in the District were all at or below the national level    Reports from banking contacts suggest that delinquency rates on nonprime ARM loans in Florida   will continue to trend higher this year  Reduced access to credit for nonprime borrowers will slow   the absorption of the current oversupply of housing product and will put downward pressure on   house prices  Also, the boom in condo conversions and condo construction in 2005 and 2006   drained the supply of apartments in many areas in the District, and landlords have been able to   increase rental prices as a result   Turning to our perspective on the country as a whole, much of the slowdown in real activity   that occurred in the second half of 2006 reflected weakness in the housing sector  If weakness   remains contained within the housing sector, the outlook, although subdued, is acceptable in our   view  Much of the recent moderation in real activity is consistent with what we had forecast several   March 20-21, 2007 51 of 196    months ago  Realization of this moderation does not in itself imply that we should revise our   outlook  Some professional forecasters continue to anticipate that real GDP growth will rebound to   close to its trend rate of 3 percent for the rest of 2007, in effect discounting any drag from prolonged   weakness in residential investment  The Atlanta Fed staff forecasts for real GDP growth are   consistent with these optimistic commercial forecasts  The current Greenbook forecast implies a   slightly weaker outlook from extended weakness in residential investment and weaker growth of   consumer expenditures, perhaps incorporating some signal from the recent financial distress in   subprimes  Despite slight differences in these forecasts, the outlooks do not suggest recession at this   point  Measured core inflation remains in excess of 2 percent  Our staff consensus forecast sees   core inflation continuing in the range of 2 to 2½ percent for all of 2007  This forecast is a bit less   favorable than the Greenbook forecast, but we have no sense that the inflation outlook has   deteriorated significantly     The implications of the outlook for real output and inflation are that current policy is set   about where it should be  The US economy has performed about as expected  Financial market   turbulence and subprime mortgage distress raise potential concerns that should be monitored, but   for now it seems that the outlook has not substantially changed  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Well, like so many others, I agree with keeping the funds rate at the   current level and the language in alternative B  We’re experiencing real growth at about the rate   we expected, but inflation is no longer declining  Having said that, I’m comfortable with the   current policy and don’t see a need to move until we become convinced that our forecast for   inflation moderation won’t be realized  In regard to the language, I’m not yet a master of the   nuances, [laughter] and so I don’t have strong opinions on “predominant” versus “principal”    Because “predominant” is consistent with the past, it does strike me as being slightly stronger    Therefore, I’ll go with the consensus, but I would favor that     Having been a president for three weeks, I hope I can still get away   with some tentative or preliminary remarks on this subject  There really are two questions  The   first question is whether or not to go forward, and the second is, if we do go forward, how to   implement it  Regarding the first question, having only today been privy to these discussions, I’m   not going to make up my mind quite yet  But I would like to make a few comments on the “how”   side of the question in the event that we do go forward   First, I favor a quantitative price objective  As to whether it is an explicit objective and   whether it has a point goal or a range, I can see pros and cons to both  The point goal can help in   influencing long-term inflation expectations, and an indifference range can be more compatible with   the dual mandate  On balance, I favor a point goal with comfortable bands  Regarding exact   numbers, I’ve not settled on a specific number, but I would think that something in the range of   1½ to 2 percent, depending upon the index that’s chosen, is a reasonable guide to policy and   compatible with the dual mandate  On my preferred price index, I’ve been influenced by the   discussion today  My starting point was core PCE based upon consistency with the past  I’m more   convinced now that an overall measure makes sense because we should be consistent with the   pocketbook experience of the public, since we’re communicating to the broad public  So I would   favor one of the overall measures  I’d like to stress that I am very much in favor of an approach that   minimizes the political risk of conflict with the Congress and dilution of the principle of central   bank independence  For this reason I think that an unspecified medium-term time horizon would   work best, especially at the initial stage   I believe that flexibility going into this policy is sensible and important  I’ve thought a bit   about how we really ground this decision and ground the specific choices that we make  In   simplistic terms, I would say it should “work”—meaning that the policy should enable the   March 20-21, 2007 154 of 196    achievement of actual outcomes  Given the difficulty and the complexity that I’m learning about   and the many domestic and international uncertainties, I think we should be flexible enough to have   high confidence that we’ll achieve the stated objectives  Foreign central banks have changed the   details of implementation of inflation targeting—such changes have apparently not affected their   credibility—and I believe that the FOMC should be able to do the same thing  Finally, I believe   that, for inflation targeting to be effective, its goals should be communicated as a substantial   consensus  I’m making some distinction between the reflection of an actual consensus versus the   communication of some degree of unity on the part of the Committee  Mr Chairman, let me just   end there  Thank you  "
8128,2007-05-09,LOCKHART,"  If anyone is interested, please see me  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since the last meeting, aggregate   economic activity in the Sixth District has expanded moderately  Employment momentum in   most areas of the District continues to exceed that of the nation overall  Florida is our exception    Most areas of Florida now lag the nation  Similarly, the housing downturn, as measured by sales   and permits, remains less severe in the District than for the nation, except for much of Florida    The housing downturn in Florida has shown little sign of bottoming out, as builders continue to   expect even lower levels of construction  Permit issuance continues in steep decline, down over   50 percent from March a year ago  We are not inclined to suggest that there is significance for   the nation as a whole in the Florida developments  We have heard anecdotal views from Florida   that there was a run-up in speculative activity in the second-home market in 2004 and 2005    Buyers were bidding up prices in anticipation of flipping properties at higher prices  So Florida   is idiosyncratic  It is idiosyncratic also in the state’s ongoing insurance cost problem related to   hurricane risk  However, in the Atlanta region, the conversations we’ve had with homebuilders   about the housing market raised concern of a steepening decline in sales of new homes  Atlanta   has generally tracked the nation, so we are carefully watching housing-sector developments in   Georgia, particularly in Atlanta     Despite these negatives in the housing sector, we continue to find only limited evidence   of spillover from the residential real estate adjustment to other sectors of the regional economy    Labor markets appear to have remained very tight in the District  The measured unemployment   rate is around 4 percent for the District versus 44 percent nationally  Even the demand for   May 9, 2007 48 of 130    skilled building tradesmen appears strong, as builders—and this may be relevant to the earlier   discussion—seem to be taking the opportunity to upgrade the quality of their staffs  Trends in   state sales tax revenue support the view that consumer spending has been relatively unaffected   by the housing downturn  Again, the exception is Florida, where sales tax revenues in the first   quarter were substantially below year-ago levels   Our perspective on the national economy is that significant uncertainty remains about the   overall outlook for 2007 and for the path of inflation  Our economic staff uses three models to   forecast the key macroeconomic measures  Our average forecast for real GDP growth is   generally in line with the Greenbook forecast, and neither suggests that a recession is a risk    There are minor differences between our composite forecast and the Greenbook on   unemployment  The only significant difference is the declining path of inflation in the   Greenbook versus our inflation forecast that holds steady around 23 percent for the forecast   period  So, to summarize, we harbor greater doubt than the Board staff that the inflation rate will   come down as projected in 2007    Well, I, too, support alternative B, and simple logic  We haven’t   arrived at the optimal picture yet  Output growth is slowing, inflation is still elevated, and there   is a fair amount of uncertainty  Some of us focused on uncertainty in the inflation picture, and   May 9, 2007 96 of 130    some on both sides  I think the situation merits a patient approach at this juncture; we should   give it some more time  Regarding the language, not being well schooled in the literary style of   the FOMC, I, too, focused on the “on balance” phrase, thinking that it injected maybe a hint of   equivocation  I understand the logic  I believe what I heard President Yellen saying is that we   have to think in a two-step process here—that is, if you put it in and then the next time around   take it out, how do the markets react?  So for what it’s worth, I focus on that, not quite knowing   how to process the “on balance” language  Otherwise, I’m going to abstain from the language   debates here until I have a little more experience  "
8151,2007-06-27,LOCKHART,"  Aircraft constitute what share of capital goods exports, and   might they have something to do with the competitive situation, particularly between   Boeing and Airbus?    Five percent of capital goods or of total exports?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would like to speak earlier next   time, so I don’t have to give credit to so many of the previous speakers—[laughter]   including President Poole, who really said a lot of what I have to say  There wasn’t much   change in the Sixth District economic picture during the intermeeting period, particularly   regarding things that are relevant to the national outlook  So I am not going to devote a   lot of time to discussing across-the-board conditions in the District  My staff’s outlook—  and my outlook—for the national economy doesn’t differ much from the Greenbook   analysis and forecast, so I also won’t detail small differences between those two   forecasts  The Greenbook outlook reflects the baseline expectation of a diminishing drag   on real growth from residential investment  Since our forecast largely agrees with the   Greenbook, we obviously see the most likely playout of the housing correction similarly    However, as suggested in the Greenbook’s first alternative simulation, we may be too   sanguine  I think this is really President Poole’s message about a recovery in the housing   sector  That is to say, the downturn in residential investment will be deeper and more   June 27-28, 2007 62 of 261    prolonged and possibly involve spillovers  So I would like to devote my comments, in a   cautionary tone, to this particular concern   Credit available for residential real estate purchases is contracting, and the credit   contraction, specifically in the subprime mortgage market, has the potential to lengthen   the transition period required to reduce housing inventories to normal levels  This   tightening of credit availability, along with higher rates, may affect the timeline of the   recovery  One market of concern is the starter home market  The subprime mortgage   market has been a major credit source for first-time homebuyers—although, as has been   mentioned earlier, subprime mortgages are a small portion of the aggregate stock of   mortgages  Subprimes were 20 percent of originations in 2005 and 2006, and if you   added alt-A nonprime mortgages, you would get 33 percent of originations in the past   two years  In many suburban areas, like those around Atlanta and Nashville in my   District, much home construction was targeted at first-time buyers  We have heard   anecdotal reports from banking and real estate contacts in our region that tighter credit   conditions have aggravated the already sluggish demand for homes  The country’s   largest homebuilder—there may be a debate with President Fisher—[laughter] so one of   the country’s largest homebuilders, headquartered in Miami, reported on Tuesday a 29   percent drop in homes delivered and a 75 percent drop in average prices  But that is   combined with a 77 percent increase in sales incentives  They attribute their negative   sales experience to rising defaults among subprime borrowers and higher rates  That   company’s CEO said that he sees no sign of a recovery, and he provided guidance of a   loss position in the third quarter     June 27-28, 2007 63 of 261    Because of the major role that homebuilding—and, I might add, construction   materials, particularly in forest products—plays in the Sixth District economy and   because of some tentative signs of spillover, we will continue to monitor these   developments in our District very carefully  As I stated at the outset, we share the basic   outlook described in the Greenbook, but observation of the housing sector dynamics in   the Sixth District has raised our level of concern that the national housing correction   process may cause greater-than-forecasted weakness in real activity  If that is the case   and inflation gains prove transitory, as suggested in the Greenbook commentary, we may   be dealing with a far more challenging policy tradeoff than we are today  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, favor alternative B and the   current policy stance  My interpretation of the discussion around the table yesterday is   that we see encouraging signs that the current policy appears to be producing the desired   directional effects at least, or intermediate effects, so it seems to be working  There is   June 27-28, 2007 113 of 261    still a fair degree of uncertainty, and based upon my long experience, I think it is a   normal amount of uncertainty  So the current policy deserves being held     Regarding the policy statement, I favor the wording in revised alternative B that   was distributed by Vince yesterday afternoon because I think it captures the key points—  the ones that are important to me at least—and they are moderate growth prospects,   mention of the housing sector, better inflation readings and prospects of continued   moderation (though it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions), continued inflation   pressures, and a continued weighting to inflation risks with no suggestion that the current   levels around 2 percent are acceptable for the long term  So for that set of reasons, I   favor the wording as presented    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, applaud your putting a   concrete proposal on the table  With a Committee of nineteen, and as many moving parts   as this could have, we could end up with a camel when we wanted a horse, and therefore   having something concrete to react to is very helpful   Having said that, I have looked at this question both at the strategic level and at   the tactical level  Let me just comment on the strategic level first  The way I process the   question is that it is based on principles in some respect, and some of the principle-based   objectives are (1) transparency in governance is a best principle in general, and this   moves in that direction; (2) it should enhance accountability; (3) it should enhance public   confidence in our credibility; and (4) it should enhance the influence on outcomes—that   is to say, it should have a grounding in results and the optimal outcome should involve   somewhat less risk  I am trying to process the thrust of my decisions through that   strategic prism  So I asked myself under what circumstances this could backfire, and I   think the answer is perhaps that in periods of very rapid change, volatility, turbulence,   severe shocks, and the aftermath of severe shocks, we could find this degree of   explicitness and degree of openness problematic  But I don’t think we can manage to   those kinds of contingencies  I think we have to manage more with a view of normal   times   I see here in the Committee some tension, as we address this question, between a   mystique model of effectiveness, which perhaps optimizes flexibility and gives us an   opportunistic posture and, therefore, is built around closed deliberation and a transparent,   explicit, exposed, “out there” model  They both have some benefits in terms of our   ultimate effectiveness  So I view it as a bit of a balancing act between those two  But, as   June 27-28, 2007 192 of 261    I said, I support the thrust because I think the principle of transparency and accountability   trumps that of maximum flexibility, if those two things under certain circumstances are   opposed  I am influenced, Mr Chairman, by your and Don Kohn’s sense that this is   incremental  It is a step and, therefore, is adjustable  It may not be reversible, but it is at   least adjustable, and that means that we can tweak the overall tactical aspects of it to get   it to work as efficiently and as effectively as possible   As to some of the specifics, yes, we should proceed  Four times a year seems   right, and I think we have to line it up with the Monetary Policy Reports  I like the idea   of total inflation because I think that is where people live for the most part  I see the   narrative best done as an addendum  Regarding anonymity, I would say that not being   anonymous might be too much disclosure, so I support anonymity  On the third year, I   think of the third year as a statement of intentions  It is our intended steady state, if we   can get there  I do see a tradeoff there  Having a single third year is more consistent with   accountability, but it puts credibility a bit more at risk  So as I listen to the debate on   that, I am somewhat influenced by Vice Chairman Geithner’s approach of allowing for   more flexibility in the outyears  This is not a moon landing  We can’t be precise in   where it comes out in the thirty-sixth month  We are in a world of shocks and   uncertainty, so I, on balance, favor the idea of buying us some flexibility in the three-to-  five-year timeframe  I like the qualitative characterizations, particularly of uncertainty,   for the same reasons  I am not terribly in favor of accelerating the minutes for now  We   could do that at a later date, after we have refined and nailed down some of the other   moving parts here  I don’t think it buys us enough at this time, so I would view that as a   refinement that might be made at a later date  Let me leave it at that   June 27-28, 2007 193 of 261     Thank you, Mr Chairman  It may horrify everyone at the table   that before I joined the Committee, I didn’t actually parse this statement every few weeks    [Laughter]  I don’t have a lot of historical perspective, but I’m basically okay with the way   the process works now  I think that the inclusions in the statement all serve a purpose  I’m   not sure I fully understand the right and the left side of the Taylor rule, Rick, but maybe   afterward you can explain that to me  I view this statement as having a short term  If there   are forward-looking statements, they are short term  They signal the next meeting or two,   but not much more than that  Regarding the governance or the voting issues, I think we   should vote on the whole thing, and if we ever need to have a tie breaker, I guess I would   revert to its being at that time the Chairman’s statement  But in normal circumstances, we   all vote and agree, and that’s it  "
8175,2007-08-07,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman   August 7, 2007 48 of 136     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My basic view of appropriate policy is little   changed from the previous meeting  None of the intermeeting developments yet compel me to   change my view that our focus should remain on reducing inflation and inflation expectations  The   outlook for GDP growth remains acceptable, especially in view of the recent downward revisions in   the data and the associated lowering of estimates of growth potential  Our baseline outlook is   consistent with that of recent months, but the new concern is obviously the financial markets that   clearly are skittish about spillovers from the subprime market and about contagion in credit markets   spreading beyond structured products   Evidence within the Sixth District is consistent with this basically stable and positive   outlook  Florida is seeing some notable spillovers from their problems in real estate, but some of   these problems are idiosyncratic to the state—for example, the widespread inability to get wind and   storm insurance  The rest of the District has not seen serious spillover into the broader economy    Just like the Greenbook, we view the fundamentals of the economy to be stable  Although the   residential real estate market may take some time to stabilize, the problem seems generally   August 7, 2007 50 of 136    contained  Our model suggests slightly stronger growth than the baseline Greenbook throughout the   forecast period  Our trend growth rate has not been reduced quite as much as the Greenbook’s, and   our inflation forecast is not as favorable  At this juncture, we are not ready to give much weight to   some of the more extreme alternate Greenbook scenarios  We certainly recognize more uncertainty   and volatility than at the last meeting, but we’re still expecting results essentially in line with the   baseline Greenbook forecast   In the past few days, I have had substantive conversations with some well-positioned credit   market observers, including managers of large investment portfolios, suggesting that the skittishness   of financial markets is not likely to abate until later this fall  They have suggested that the   choppiness in financial markets will be the rule in the near term and, very important, that the   threshold for what constitutes a shock is now much lower than usual  I believe that the correct   policy posture is to let the markets work through the changes in risk appetite and pricing that are   under way, but the market observations of one of my more strident conversational counterparts—  and that is not Jim Cramer [laughter]—are worth sharing  This party sees problems in the subprime   structured debt market spreading to the CLO leveraged-loan market and, in a knock-on effect, to   repo and commercial paper markets as well as to investment-grade corporate credit  This party   points to nonprice rationing, commercial paper rollover risk, and general CDO contagion caused by   the damaged credibility of rating agencies and contraction of collateral values  This party argues   that treating the widening of credit spreads as normalization ignores substantial subsurface potential   dislocations as evidenced by the collapse of American Home Mortgage Corporation  All that said,   another counterpart noted a large pool of money now on the sidelines that is ready to provide   financing for reasonable deals if prices fall low enough  Importantly, a large portion of this money   comes from reliable long-term sources of investment, pension funds and insurance companies    August 7, 2007 51 of 136    Notwithstanding some descriptive rhetoric, this is not the credit crunch of the late 1980s, when the   traditional financial intermediaries were strained for capital  The traditional investors are still out   there with substantial liquidity, and they are just temporarily on the sidelines for understandable   reasons and, barring further shocks, should return to the markets in force later this fall  The   dislocations in the financial markets call for a posture of vigilant monitoring of developments but   nothing more for now   Regarding the balance of risks, it is early to materially adjust the weighting of GDP   downside versus inflation upside risks  But I have heightened concern, as many of you do, about   the continuing housing sector weakness combined with some potential of credit market turbulence   in time affecting business investment and consumer confidence and thereby the real economy    Thank you, Mr Chairman    I want to make a comment following the remarks of Governor Warsh   and Governor Kroszner related to the calendar of potential market stabilization and the   leveraged-loan market  Both of you cited a backlog of $300 billion or something maybe slightly   less than that  In one conversation I had, a market observer cited $470 billion and argued that it   would take well beyond our September meeting, into October and November, before the market   would clear in that particular part of the market  So to connect this comment to Governor   Geithner’s comment about maintaining some flexibility as we go into the fall and observe the   markets, we have different estimates out there of how much backlog there is, and therefore we   are likely to be still facing a great deal of uncertainty at our September meeting   August 7, 2007 81 of 136     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, feel that we should hold the rate,   so I am concerned principally with the way the statement plays to the various audiences,   particularly the market  The posture we should take is to acknowledge, while not reacting   prematurely to, the turbulence in the financial markets and the subdued or the improved inflation   numbers, and we should make an effort to maintain some flexibility  So I am a bit torn on   paragraph 4 between President Poole’s suggestion, which I have some sympathy for, and the   concern that paragraph 4 will come across as ritualistic repetition of what we’ve said every   month for several months and, therefore, will convey a sense that we’re not paying attention to   what’s going on in the market  So I come out ambivalent on that  I can support President   Poole’s suggestion, but on balance I guess I like the statement in alternative B as it is  "
8195,2007-08-10,LOCKHART,"  I don’t think seeing matters that much  I have a question for President   Geithner  Are any European or Japanese institutions to our knowledge in serious trouble?    Are there analogs to Washington Mutual or Countrywide, for example?  "
8208,2007-08-16,LOCKHART,"  I understand that there have been conversations with other G-7, G-8   central banks, and my question really relates to the announcement  If some of the downside in the   market relates to the effect on foreign markets, why would we not announce as soon as we have   decided this evening as opposed to waiting tomorrow morning and missing the opportunity to signal   to foreign markets what we’re doing?    I agree with President Fisher regarding “appreciably,” and I’m   wondering if we could not say that the Committee judges that the downside risks to growth have   increased somewhat  "
8231,2007-09-18,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the Sixth District, we indulge   ourselves with the conceit that our District looks a lot like the nation as a whole  We have 45   million consumers and an industrial composition that does resemble the country, so you can   process my regional remarks with that conceit in mind  Housing markets continued to   deteriorate in August in the Sixth District  Housing market weakness was most pronounced in   Florida, as you might expect, followed by Atlanta and middle Tennessee  The consensus view is   that the recent tightening in mortgage credit availability will exacerbate the region’s housing   market problems, and most regional contacts believe that housing markets will continue to   weaken, bottoming out no earlier than mid-2008, and some see a much longer adjustment period   Aside from housing, real economic readings in the Sixth District were mixed  Anecdotal   feedback across a number of industries suggested that business spending has not yet slowed   markedly, but the majority of contacts indicated that they are now approaching new capital   spending more cautiously  That said, most contacts acknowledge that tighter credit standards   have not significantly affected business capital investment outlays  Reports of factory activity   were mixed, with defense and export industries doing well, while industries linked to housing   were predictably weak  Transportation contacts indicated ongoing weak domestic demand    Consumer activity in the District was flat to slightly up in August compared with a year ago    Housing-related home product sales were especially weak, as were auto sales  Perhaps the most   September 18, 2007 59 of 188    notable change from previous months was a turn to pessimism on the part of directors, reflecting   their soundings of business contacts in their communities  I will mention that we have five   Branches, so we actually get director feedback from more than forty directors across the District    Sixty percent believe that economic activity will be slower six months out, twice the percentage   recorded in July  Even factoring out idiosyncratic conditions in localities such as south Florida   and the Gulf Coast, the outlook, based on these anecdotal reports, has turned to the negative     To summarize my regional comments—current fundamentals are mixed, and the outlook   is pessimistic  In our view, the economic outlook has changed since the last meeting, and the   balance of risk has clearly shifted to the downside  We do not see a near-term recession as a   high likelihood, but we do anticipate that growth will approach trend much more slowly with   employment edging up as a consequence  So in direction and tone, if not magnitude, we are in   agreement with the Greenbook, but our forecast differs from the Greenbook baseline forecast in   the depth of the below-trend growth, ours being somewhat milder because we condition our   forecast on deeper cumulative cuts in the fed funds rate over the coming months   Turning to capital markets, my recent conversations with a number of capital market   participants suggest that the adjustment process in financial markets is far from complete  Their   anecdotal feedback reflects a range of views about the severity of the current problems and the   outlook for stabilization  Here is the overall picture I gleaned from these conversations  Some   debt markets have firmed a bit  The leveraged-loan market, for example, is likely to renew   trading in the coming weeks, but structured-debt security markets are not yet clearing  The   principal reason—and this has been mentioned earlier by Bill and others—that debt markets   remain illiquid is weak counterparty transparency and, therefore, uncertain counterparty risk, as   well as uncertainty regarding the performance of collateral pools that back securities  The   September 18, 2007 60 of 188    process of achieving adequate clarity and stabilization of the markets will likely take many more   weeks  Markets will remain volatile while the condition of heightened uncertainty persists    There has been some spillover into markets that are unrelated to structured debt and subprime,   but creditworthy borrowers are getting credit  There is sufficient buyer liquidity currently on the   sidelines awaiting greater clarity regarding counterparties, market pricing of securities, and the   depth and scope of the difficulties  Widespread deleveraging, particularly by SIVs and hedge   funds and nonbank entities, is occurring and is likely to continue   One party argued, however, that all the news of financial distress has not pushed risk   spreads to the extremes of historical bands  This party argued, “We are experiencing a painful   adjustment from excessively high leverage to more-rational or more-realistic pricing in line with   historical averages”  But all contacts believe—and this is perhaps not unexpected—that   prolonged credit market problems will affect the broad economy, mostly through the consumer   credit channel   So I believe our decision today boils down to whether we cut ¼ percentage point or   ½ percentage point, obviously in combination with careful wording of the statement that conveys   a rationale focused on economic fundamentals while signaling some recognition that the   problems in the capital markets have the potential to deliver a credit shock to the broad economy    I consider it appropriate to adjust the federal funds rate to the now-weaker economic outlook,   and I support a 50 basis point move with the rationale that at least 25 basis points of that   represents recognition of a lower equilibrium rate and the remainder is a preemptive, preventive   measure designed to renew confidence, facilitate conditions that resolve uncertainty, and shorten   the necessary adjustment timeline in a deleveraging financial sector  It is a fair question whether   the process of information revelation—that is, removing uncertainty—will be accelerated by an   September 18, 2007 61 of 188    aggressive rate cut  My view is that this action, along with other liquidity actions, removes the   psychological barrier—that being the concern that the Fed might fail to ensure enough upfront   liquidity and might be pursuing an inadvertently tight policy, compounding problems by putting   undue stress on the real economy  I think a distinction can be drawn between trying to influence   the psychology around dangerous financial sector circumstances and bailing out the markets, and   care should be taken to reflect this in the minutes   Let me add that I agree with the earlier comments of President Fisher that we perhaps   should be looking at any policy move in the context of a total package that includes the auction   credit facility  So I do have, let’s say, some sympathy for the view that the total package must be   discussed  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Well, in my earlier remarks I stated my reasons for supporting 50 basis   points, so I will play Calvin Coolidge here—that is, 50 basis points, alternative B  It’s important   that we neither signal further actions nor suggest that we’re through and that we preserve some   flexibility because of the uncertainty  So that’s my comment  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I, too, want to congratulate the staff on a creative proposal  I think I   need more time to think about this, but let me offer, just to some degree, speculative remarks    They’re speculative because it has been a few years since I’ve even been around a treasury of a   September 18, 2007 155 of 188    money center bank, but I do think I have some feel for it  First, looking at it from the market   perspective, lengthening the maturity of liabilities and then, in train, assets is desirable  Clearly, that   will assist financial stability, which is our objective here  The sub-objectives are to reduce stigma   and to unstick the market from its short-term orientation     So I try to put myself in the shoes of a bank treasurer thinking about whether or not to use   such a facility  The way that large bank treasuries work, or at least worked when I was close to   them, is that you have essentially what is called an MCO, or maximum cumulative outflow,   schedule, which is a schedule of liability maturities going out for 360 days or more  Today’s picture   on the margin—that is to say, in the money markets, noncore deposits, the things basically where   banks are funding themselves on the margin—spikes very early  It’s dramatically early, and then it   tails off, and it seems to me that the treasurer would think about this by asking, “What MCO gain do   I get from using this?”  It is just a matter of days—maybe two or three days, not twenty-eight—  because you’re just adding it to a mix of liabilities that you already have  The offset of that would   be the reaction of the market, the stigma question, as they perceive a bank using this—that is,   whether there would be some countervailing reaction  It’s probably not insignificant no matter how   hard we try that, when you use the lender of last resort as a funding source, you are using the lender   of last resort as a funding source  So if I were a treasurer, I would be making a kind of calculation   as to whether I was really gaining from an MCO point of view any significant comfort relative to   the direction I thought the market was going   My own hope is that this issue will improve dramatically in the second half of October    This week and next week, I believe, we are going to go through the broker-dealer disclosures, and   then in mid-October, we’ll get the large bank and other bank disclosures, and the market   transparency should improve, it seems to me, reasonably strongly in that period  So it is   September 18, 2007 156 of 188    conceivable that we’ll have different circumstances in the second half of October regarding the   market’s being so terribly short term at this time  So, again, I am trying to think this through as a   treasurer would think it, and I think there are some market dynamic considerations that a treasurer   would have to think about, which suggests maybe not using it except in really extreme market   circumstances  "
8253,2007-10-30,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I have noted in the past, the industrial   mix in the Sixth District looks a lot like the country as a whole  The regional data and anecdotal   information show that, although the Sixth District economy is still expanding, the pace is marginally   weaker than it was in September  In earlier meetings I commented on the severity of the housing   situation in the District  There is no improvement in sight for the housing market, and there are   signs that the sharp decline in residential construction is spilling over into nonresidential real estate   segments, such as shopping center development  Employment growth is softening as well    October 30-31, 2007 45 of 162    Although the largest negative effects are in construction-related sectors, the slowdown in job growth   appears to be fairly broad based     The broad contour of our national forecast is similar to the Greenbook baseline  Like the   Greenbook, our forecast includes a slowing in business investment  Based on our survey of District   business contacts, it appears that the low levels of expected capital expenditure are due mainly to   pessimism about the pace of economic activity rather than restrictive credit conditions per se    Specifically, financial market turbulence does not appear to have directly affected economic   activity, but it has created a greater uncertainty about the outlook for the economy  As a   consequence, the majority of my directors and business contacts are reporting very little in the way   of plans to increase capital expenditures in the coming year  Where business investment is   discretionary, most respondents report a wait-and-see posture   More positively, the weaker dollar does appear to be having a positive effect on exports   from the region  For the year to date, the dollar value of exports through the Sixth District ports was   up 35 percent through August, whereas import growth was only 21 percent  Not coincidentally, the   majority of businesses that indicated they were increasing capital expenditures over the coming   months were exporters    In the run-up to this FOMC meeting, I again made calls to a few financial market   participants, and they reflected a range of institutional and market perspectives  A synthesis of this   opinion is consistent with the views that were expressed earlier by Bill Dudley and others  There’s   a widespread view that persistent volatility in credit markets is bound to negatively affect the   general economy  Credit market conditions have improved somewhat, but stability may be a long   way off  A second wave of volatility may accompany incoming details regarding mortgage   delinquencies caused by rate resets in 2008, and there’s a suspicion that third-quarter writedowns   October 30-31, 2007 46 of 162    may be followed by substantial further losses recognized at year-end  Also, as referenced in the   Bluebook, there is skepticism about the M-LEC (master liquidity enhancement conduit) proposal   from several angles   In summary, our soundings of the economy, informed by formal modeling work, point to a   continued slowing of the economy that will likely persist well into next year  Anecdotally, credit   constraints outside the housing sector do not appear to be a major factor at this stage  But   uncertainty created by financial market turbulence does seem to be acting as a constraint, and I   believe that the heightened uncertainty regarding the economic outlook for 2008 warrants   consideration of insurance against this downside risk   With respect to the outlook for inflation, I agree with the view expressed by others that   recent developments in energy prices, if they persist, make it likely that we are about to enter   another period in which headline numbers substantially exceed the trends suggested by core   measures  Because of this, I feel it’s appropriate to characterize inflation risk as having increased    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  One of my life-long purposes has been to   make the world safe for ambivalence and indecision  [Laughter]      Well, I’m gaining ground this morning  [Laughter]  Having said   that, I prefer that we reduce the federal funds rate target 25 basis points  My thought process is   that the softening of economic activity, at least in some sectors, and the lower estimates suggest   that the neutral rate of interest may be falling  The downside risks to economic growth and the   evidence of lingering liquidity issues are to me good arguments for taking steps that insure   against an inadvertently restrictive policy stance   With regard to the policy statement, I am going to continue to use the inexperience   excuse as long as I can, even though we have some newer members  But just a few remarks    The language in the rationale section of alternative A most closely reflects my assessment of the   situation, but I am not entirely comfortable with any of the options for the assessment of risk    The real economic outlook faces uncertainties on the downside that are difficult to characterize    Because of that, I am skeptical that we can credibly claim near-term downside growth risks to be   roughly in balance with upside inflation risks, as is done in alternatives A and C  That said, I   worry that the wording in alternative B would be interpreted as a rather significant loss of   confidence in the economy and a signal that another rate reduction is probable in the near term    At this point, I’d prefer not to send a signal that another rate cut is most likely in December   October 30-31, 2007 95 of 162    Since our last meeting, expectations were centered on no change in the fed funds target   today until a string of weak housing and earnings reports moved the probabilities strongly in the   direction of a rate reduction  Thus, judging from the evolution of market expectations since our   September meeting, the assessment of risk language in our last statement was sufficient to   convince financial market participants that our decision on the funds rate is being driven by   incoming data  As I said, I think the assessment of risk statement should try to recognize the   uncertainties inherent in our growth forecasts—and those uncertainties are greater than those   associated with our inflation forecast—but without tilting expectations in favor of a future rate   cut  As I said in my remarks yesterday, it is quite possible that we will enter another period in   which headline inflation numbers exceed the trend suggested by core measures  If that is even a   short-lived problem, my opinion is that—and this is based on the Bluebook version—we would   be well served to note that fact by adopting the language in alternative C, section 3  However, I   do note that the new language, as presented this morning, in alternative A, section 3, is quite   helpful because it largely incorporates the language in alternative C  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Has there been any reaction to the Greg Ip story?  Have we received   any feedback from the principal audience for the projections?    Is there an inconsistency in adjusting a forecast after the meeting   when the minutes are the minutes of the meeting and the forecasts informed the judgments that   were expressed in the meeting?    I’m not sure I see minutes reflecting subsequent actions or   subsequent decisions     Oh, okay  Good point  "
8278,2007-12-06,LOCKHART,"  Well, I will comment in support of both the TAF and the swap   facility  I think the circumstances warrant action  You have laid out the risks, the uncertainties,   and as you called it, Chairman Bernanke, the unknowables  I think they are there but not   extreme  I think this will help at a technical level and potentially at a symbolic level  This has   value in addressing the confidence equation  In the run-up to the FOMC, I commonly speak to a   number of people in the financial community, and I think this will help  So to me this is a   pragmatic response to the market situation, which, as you characterize it, we don’t know if it will   work, but we will see if it works  I also applaud the ability to get something done in the case of   two auctions before year-end  I think that is very helpful  So I am interested in the answers to   the questions that have been posed and other questions that will come, but for go-round   purposes, I am supportive of both  "
8300,2007-12-11,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Bill, the trouble with the mortgage   insurers has been a development since our last meeting, and I am curious—Do they have the   capability for raising capital?  Will raising capital correct or help them get their ratings back to   AAA, or is it more complicated than that?  I have read some concerns about the effect, for   example, on municipal markets if the guarantors cannot in fact maintain their ratings  So do you   have some insight into their ability to raise capital and correct the potential for a downgrade?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think President Stern framed it well in   bringing focus to the effect on our thinking that the financial markets are having  As many have   said, the central question is not whether the economy is softening but whether it is softening beyond   the range that underpinned the policy decision in October  I’d add to that a range of questions   related to financial markets, particularly the question of whether the deterioration in the financial   markets changes the prospects for achieving financial stability, the potential for spreading to a wider   array of financial markets and institutions, the potential for spillover to the general economy, and   the compounding of the already heightened degree of uncertainty  All of these weigh heavily on my   thinking  Like the Greenbook projections, Atlanta’s forecast has been revised down as a result of   incoming data since the last meeting  I just point out, speaking only for ourselves, that these   downward revisions of previous forecasts and our general outlook have been a pattern over recent   months   The current situation is extremely difficult to read—which is another way of saying that   uncertainty around our forecast has increased yet again  Contributing to this uncertainty is the   continuing, if not accelerating, gap between the anecdotal information and the views I’ve received   from Wall Street versus Main Street  The expectations of financial market participants have   deteriorated and can be characterized as extremely serious  However, the message I get from   directors and representatives of nonfinancial businesses outside the housing sector, though relatively   pessimistic, has not changed substantially since our October meeting  In my conversations with   financial market contacts, to varying degrees I heard the persistent and growing apprehension   December 11, 2007 49 of 138    concerning the spread of turmoil to an expanding set of affected markets and institutions and a   wondering of what will be the next shoe to drop  One consistent message is the belief that the   recent volatility and increase in term spreads cannot be entirely explained by the year-end problem    Most of my contacts agreed that year-end balance sheet concerns are adding to market stress, but no   one expressed confidence that getting past year-end will bring much reduction of concerns over   counterparty weakness, asset values, and secondary market liquidity  Most expect financial market   turmoil to be protracted, with increasing risk to the general economy  Almost all my contacts noted   that deteriorating housing values are a root cause, feeding problems in the markets  This view holds   that the adjustment in prices and inventory required to stabilize the housing sector will take many   months to play out, and until that occurs, the value of structured financial instruments and the   solvency and liquidity of structured investment vehicles will be uncertain  There remains a great   deal of skepticism that arrangements like the super SIV and the Treasury’s rate freeze plan will have   much tangible effect  The issue of SIV restructuring and support by sponsors is a growing focus of   concern because of their linkage to money market funds as well as their contribution to a general   contraction of credit availability  In sum, my contacts in the financial industry uniformly express   the belief that things will not get better any time soon and may well get worse  While recognizing   that a rate reduction does not directly address the information problems in the markets, there is   widespread sentiment that lower costs of funds will help     Turning to the anecdotal inputs from contacts in my District, there is some divergence of   views between contacts directly affected by the housing sector, including bankers, and others  Bank   loan activity remains particularly weak in real estate segments  Trucking, large retailers, auto   dealerships, and businesses supplying building materials and household durables were identified as   segments where loan volumes are slipping  Industrial warehouse markets have weakened in some   December 11, 2007 50 of 138    metro areas as subcontractors have exited  Bankers also expect that consumer credit exposures in   credit cards, auto loans, prime mortgages, and HELOCs will see a combination of credit   deterioration and demand contraction in 2008  The anecdotal messages from other contacts are less   dire  We took great care in our information-gathering this round to probe hiring expectations,   investment plans, and credit availability conditions  Though credit conditions do seem to have   tightened, we still are not hearing that they are preventing planned spending  Spending and hiring   plans remain on the weak side, but no more so than was the case at our October meeting    Consistent with the Greenbook projection for exports, we heard that spending from abroad,   including international tourism and condo-purchase activity, continues relatively strong  At the   branch board meeting in Miami, I heard that Russians are the latest foreign buyers of condos  So   combine that with President Poole’s comment on trucks, as a child of the Cold War, I think it is very   ironic that our bailout is coming from the Russians  [Laughter]  On the employment front, the   demand for workers in sectors such as hospitality and energy remains quite strong, but overall plans   appear to be more cautious  The trend in regional labor data mirrors the slowing trend in the   national statistics   Each FOMC round my staff provides a summary sentiment index of expected economic   conditions over the next six months based on responses of directors and contacts  Relative to the   October meeting, that index is little changed, with the majority expecting flat or slower growth    When I combine the somewhat, but not dramatically, worse data inputs since the last meeting with   the anecdotal and survey information from regional and other markets, I’m left with a view that   economic fundamentals, current and prospective, have not yet fallen off a cliff  That being said,   there’s not much of a case to be made for any risk assessment other than one weighted to the   downside  In my view, the potential for protracted and growing financial market troubles should   December 11, 2007 51 of 138    weigh heavily in the policy decision, and though recent core inflation readings are acceptable, I   continue to be concerned about the ongoing divergence between headline and core inflation  Until   they converge, price pressures cannot be removed from the watch list  But overall I see more   uncertainty and, therefore, more downside risk in the real economic growth picture  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I listened to the first go-round   comments, I charted everyone in a quadrant chart with high risk to growth and benign inflation   in the upper left-hand corner  Then, I had of course three other squares or quadrants, and so far I   am seven for eight listening to the remarks  So maybe this predictive power has some influence   or some spillover into how I come out on this  I don’t suppose 37½ would fly  [Laughter]  You   know, on balance I find myself in the upper left-hand quadrant, more concerned about downside   risk to the economy and viewing, at least for the present, inflation as a relatively benign   consideration  So given my sense of the downside risks and the uncertainty that is associated   December 11, 2007 107 of 138    with the financial markets, my recommendation is 50 basis points at this meeting, and my   preference is to remain, as much as possible, agnostic on the January action  I take note from the   advice I get from some of my own staff that Taylor rule projections suggest that the medium-  term nominal equilibrium rate is about 4 percent, and 4 percent comes the closest to being the   likely neutral rate  It is relatively likely that incoming data will suggest that a cumulative cut of   at least 50 basis points is warranted by the end of January  So in my view, moving to that rate   now is really the most prudential  In some respects, that is the most conservative and risk-  attentive policy  I continue to adhere to the risk-management perspective in dealing with our   challenges, and continuing to take out insurance against extreme downside scenarios seems   correct to me  Notwithstanding the view that the Fed is, and should be, reluctant to take back a   rate cut, I prefer facing up to that difficult decision possibly next spring to undershooting the   needs of the situation and potentially compounding the problems  So I don’t see a lot to be   gained from an incremental approach of 25 basis point cuts  It has been argued with much   validity that overnight liquidity isn’t really the problem and won’t cure the information gaps that   beset the market  But I would argue that, given the profoundly unsettled state of the financial   markets, erring on the side of more-aggressive action provides some insurance against   continuing liquidity seizures  To the extent that psychology and confidence matter—and I think   they matter a great deal in these circumstances—it is on its face a stronger message     Regarding the statement, I actually prefer alternative B  I think the finessing, if you will,   of the balance of risks and its mention of increased uncertainty come closest to my views  So I   suggest consideration of the thrust of alternative B, possibly with the insertion that Brian   mentioned, connected to a 50 basis point policy action  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8321,2008-01-09,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Many of my thoughts have already been   stated by others, so I think I can be relatively brief  I appreciate the approach that you are taking    I am inclined to be more proactive and would even support an intermeeting move if I felt that the   January 9, 2008 30 of 60    market were better prepared  I supported—actually, I argued for—a 50 basis point cut on   December 11, and the prevailing view at that time was that 50 basis points plus the TAF would   spook the market  As I recall, in your summary you said something to the effect that, if it were   0 or 50, you would probably go with 50 but, since we had the option of 25 plus the TAF, you   supported that approach  I saw greater risks to the downside in December, and I still do  But   like President Stern—I think President Plosser said essentially the same thing—I’d prefer that we   preserve the appearance of being a bit more orderly  So I have some misgivings if we go   forward with a 50 basis point cut today, and my concerns really relate principally to tactics   In my conversations with people over the holidays, I sensed a great deal of angst  I think   I mentioned this to you in New Orleans the other day  They worry that there is no one in charge,   and therefore I think the appearance of this move today would conceivably put our credibility at   risk  You can argue that point perhaps either way  If we were to move today and it worked well,   then it would preserve and enhance credibility  But let me just say that I am concerned that the   sequence of actions from December through a possible move today would appear to be panicky   and a bit incoherent  I think in many respects that is what President Stern said   So to summarize, I am very likely to support a 50 basis point rate move later in January   or even intermeeting in a week or so after more preparation of the market  I think it’s important   that we husband our credibility at this time, and obviously I agree that we have to watch inflation   and indications of changing expectations very carefully  I am not unconcerned with that, but I   see the risks as greater to the downside  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8342,2008-01-21,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the earlier discussion on January 9, as   I recall, I not only supported a move but suggested that I would support an intermeeting move if   the conditions merited, and I do think they merit it  I am really in the same camp as President   Geithner  I am not sure I see what is to be gained by waiting another eight or nine days  I think   the psychology here is bordering on, shall we say, a spiral quality  A preemptive move like   this—preemptive on two dimensions, the rate dimension and the timing dimension—has a shot at   changing the overall psychology of the moment, including perhaps even creating an atmosphere   in which support for the monolines, if they are having trouble raising capital, might very well be   a more rational decision on the part of some investor   I think we would appear much less panicky than we might have on January 9  We are not   doing this in combination with the TAF  The TAF actually appears to have done its work pretty   well, and the need for the TAF may be diminishing  Not much more data will come in the next   few days, if I have my schedule correct  I think we are at a kind of juncture now where the   spillover from the financial markets is not really much debatable; it is very clearly happening,   with risk of a dynamic that feeds off itself  So I am very supportive of this move, and that is   really my position  Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  "
8365,2008-01-29,LOCKHART,"  Bill, in your remarks, you devoted quite a bit of time to the   deteriorating situation in the monolines, the implication being that the risks they may have affect the   whole system  In the normal course, do we have direct contact with them to get any insight beyond   what we get through analysts and rating agencies?  I think you said that they are not terribly   transparent in terms of asset class and individual securities as to what they really hold  Have we had   any direct dialogue just to inform ourselves as to what the real situation is?    Yes  My staff is suspicious that the employment numbers have   actually been weaker than the data have shown  They have been focusing on the birth-death   model and the payroll survey is based upon assumptions related to the birth of construction   firms, which logically would not be creating jobs in this environment  Do you have a take on   that issue?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In my view, the decision we took on   January 21 reflected a broad consensus that economic fundamentals were weakening at a rapid   pace in an environment of continuing, even heightened, concern about financial market stress   and fragility  My contacts over this last week in the business and financial markets may add a   little texture to the picture on which we based our January 21 policy action  Conversations with   these contacts in various industries provide information generally consistent with a downward   revision of the outlook  Forward-looking sentiment of the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank   of Atlanta turned decidedly pessimistic in January  Retail contacts noted quite disappointing   results through mid-January and are taking a conservative approach to 2008 in terms of hiring   and inventory  Regarding the residential construction industry, regional weakness continues and   January 29–30, 2008 65 of 249    is spreading from coastal markets to interior markets  In addition, I had a conversation with the   CEO of a large public homebuilder of national scope  He cited historically high contract   cancellation rates, especially on the West Coast and the DC area, because of the buyers’   difficulty selling existing homes and getting financing  This limits their market to first-time   buyers  His judgment is that a change in market atmosphere will require inventories falling to   around six months  He pointed out that the spring is traditionally the key season for sales, so the   next several months will be particularly telling   Weakness in the region’s commercial real estate market appears to be spreading  The   retail segment is continuing to experience declining leasing activity, and weakness is now   emerging in the warehouse and office markets as well  In partial contrast, reports from the   manufacturing sector are more mixed  Activity remains very weak in housing-related industries    One CEO, reflecting the concern of others, predicted business failures in lumberyards and   construction supply firms because of excess capacity and the slow response to a lower building   environment  The trucking sector continues to slump  However, industries related to oil and gas   production; import-substituting industries, such as steel, aerospace, and defense; and the foreign   brand auto sector are all performing quite well  Atlanta’s national forecast is largely consistent   with the Greenbook in direction, and our differences with the Greenbook in magnitude and   timing are not material  Like the Greenbook, we premise our forecast on a lower funds rate at   the level of 3 percent   So the principal risk to the forecast in my view is the fragility of the financial markets    Uncertainty and fear continue to loom large  I made a number of calls to financial market   players, and my counterparts cited a variety of concerns relevant to overall financial stability    For instance, one of the recent concerns, as Bill Dudley depicted, has been the situation of the   January 29–30, 2008 66 of 249    monoline credit insurers  Several of my contacts had comments, but I spoke to the newly   appointed interim CEO of one of the two monoline insurance firms most prominent in the news,   and he characterized the firm’s solvency and liquidity fundamentals as in question only toward   the far end of current independent forecasts of subprime losses  Perhaps predictably, he   contrasted his assessment with what he views as alarmist atmospherics resulting from press   coverage, quixotic rating agency actions, and state regulator political positioning  A regional   bank’s CFO cautioned that more data on actual mortgage performance in 2007 will soon be   available, and that could force restatements in 2007 bank earnings  Commenting on market   illiquidity, one source said that in some fixed-income markets, where many on the buy side   currently depend on moderate leverage to achieve the required rates of return, banks have greatly   reduced their lending  He also indicated that, even though there are real money investors—as he   called them—interested in return to the structured-finance securities markets but currently on the   sidelines, they are reluctant to expose themselves to volatility that arises under mark-to-market   accounting using prices set in such illiquid markets  These anecdotal inputs simply point to the   continuing uncertainty and risk to financial stability with some potential, I think, for self-feeding   hysteria   I share with my colleagues on the Committee worries about the heightened levels of   inflation and uncertainties around my working forecast that inflation will moderate in 2008  The   assumptions about energy prices are the most precarious  Nevertheless, I am prepared to take the   position that the economy, with its apparently rapid deceleration compounded by continuing   financial volatility, is a greater concern than inflation at this juncture  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think the best course of action today is to   lower the fed funds rate by 50 basis points as in alternative B  I’ve heard cogent arguments that   50 basis points would be restrictive and likewise accommodative  Yesterday I had a chance to look   at the disabilities-related display in the elevator lobby on the Concourse Level, and I took some   January 29–30, 2008 125 of 249    comfort in the fact that many great people are or were bipolar  So whether it’s restrictive or   accommodative, I can be convinced either way  I can live with the idea that this does not   incorporate a great deal of insurance against the downside, provided that the language doesn’t   preclude further timely action as we have been using the word “timely”  So regarding paragraph 4,   my preference is for language that, first, serves to signal that the Committee is fully aware of the   situation and not behind the curve, a signal that’s reassuring and confidence enhancing, and, second,   preserves our nimbleness, our flexibility, meaning that it doesn’t preclude any options to respond to   developments, including further moves and intermeeting actions  I think the straightforward   phraseology “downside risks to growth remain” as opposed to what was suggested in alternative A,   which included “may well,” is preferable because the alternative A language strikes me as a bit too   clever and risks appearing out of touch  I also think that repetition of the “in a timely manner”   language from the January 22 statement preserves the options to move in an intermeeting action if   necessary  So I think alternative B language is acceptable because it is spare, straightforward, and   familiar, and it’s the least likely to confuse the markets in the near term  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I’d like to ask as a practical matter what weighting we should put in our   expectations or even our recommendations on reform of the rating system versus the expectation   that investors would actually reduce their reliance on ratings  My impression is that many   institutional investors, especially public pension funds, are notoriously understaffed  Then they   work for, as you pointed out in your presentation, boards that either represent the beneficiaries or in   some respects are quite political in nature and not necessarily financially sophisticated  That would   lead me to the conclusion that, as a practical matter, they’re going to be highly reliant on ratings    The ratio of professional employees to the volume of investment is so low that they have to choose   their restaurants by stars because they don’t have time to do the tasting themselves or they’re not   given the budgets to do that now  So I’m curious about this tension between getting the rating   system right versus having the investors reduce their reliance on ratings    But is your impression that those supplemental parties, the consultants   and the asset managers themselves, have the credit analysis and valuation capability to address   sophisticated structured products?

8393,2008-03-10,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The question relates to what President   Fisher was pursuing, which, if I understand correctly, is our chance of actually incurring a loss in   holding the less creditworthy paper  That would relate to a default on the part of a broker–dealer   in unwinding the swap and then an ultimate loss in how we dispose of the paper over time if we   were to hold it  So the question is, Are we aware of any primary dealers who are really in   serious condition at this stage and constitute a “first way out” risk?   March 10, 2008 12 of 39     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just a couple of comments  I, too, am   supportive  I think the escalating and lengthening crisis really justifies this, and I see the TSLF   action really as a measured and incremental response  In that respect, I am somewhat concerned   that it may be too small and that the market may react that it’s too little and not preemptive enough    Having said that, I do think it’s an appropriate step, and it has a chance of reversing the dangerous   dynamic that Bill Dudley referred to because it helps housing finance and may have some positive   effect on housing prices ultimately, and that’s critical to stabilization  So I support both the TSLF   and the swap  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8411,2008-03-18,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Reports from my directors and business   contacts are consistent with what others have said this morning—that overall economic growth   has slowed appreciably since the beginning of the year  Pessimism about the near-term outlook   has increased  At the same time, many are troubled by the continued elevation of prices and   price level increases and are apparently becoming less convinced that inflation will moderate any   time soon  In my view, the deliberations this morning and the decision we make must be about,   first, financial system stability—the threat to the broad economy of severe financial instability—  and, second, inflation risk and the role of rate policy in response to immediate problems  One   addition to the list of concerns is the continuing dollar depreciation since we met last and its role   March 18, 2008 35 of 127    in price pressures and overall uncertainty  In the run-up to this meeting, I heard little that casts   doubt on where the economy is trending  My assessment is that we have entered recession   territory  Previous forecasts premised improvement in the second half on the stabilization of   house prices and financial markets  Neither has materialized, nor are there early encouraging   signs     In the current circumstances, financial stability must be priority one  That said, the   inflation picture has become quite troubling  Headline inflation, perhaps excluding last month,   has been elevated since late summer, as have measures of core inflation, though less so  The   expected easing of pressures hasn’t yet convincingly set in  A longer view leads to the   conclusion that inflation has been relatively high, on average, since 2005  We must be mindful   of this as we address financial stability concerns   I mentioned the dollar’s trajectory when I listed what in my view are the relevant   considerations today  I am concerned about what I perceive as growing mention of the   possibility of a dollar currency crisis  Although only one conversation, I also heard mention of a   developing dollar carry trade fueled by interest differentials, expected rate cuts, and possibly the   view that recessionary conditions will persist for some time   Policy is often a balancing act, but I see our current constraints as tightening  The real   side has entered recession in all probability  There is increasing risk to the inflation objective    Financial stability is profoundly in play, exacerbated by the trajectory of the dollar, although to   be measured about this, I think the current round of financial market problems has not yet thrown   the economy irreparably off balance   I intend to support a downward rate move today, but with reservations about the utility of   continuing cuts in addressing financial stability problems  Discussion in the policy round may   March 18, 2008 36 of 127    address this, but I will comment now that balancing our policy objectives in such a risk-laden   environment may require decoupling rate policy from liquidity measures  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I came to the meeting preferring   alternative B—50 basis points  I certainly can bring myself to support your proposal—75 basis   points  I don’t view it as a fist pounder, but let me make the case for 50 basis points, at least as I   think about it  First, I do think it is a movement that acknowledges financial instability and the   growing real weakness  As I argued in my earlier remarks, it may set the scene for decoupling rate   policy from liquidity actions if conditions allow  I think the action makes a minimal   acknowledgement of inflation risk, and it may signal the view that lower rates can do only so much   and that, best case, the market will have to proceed to sort out the market problems and, worst case,   the fiscal authorities will have to deal with them  Although I am not a trained psychologist, let me   March 18, 2008 97 of 127    just propose that, in dealing with market psychology, there may be some value in appearing to firm   up our rate-movement policy and to set one element in the fluid situation with greater fixity than it   has been in recent weeks  That might generate the kind of firming dynamic and even help produce   a turn in psychology  That’s a lot to ask for simply 50 basis points, but I also prefer the language of   alternative A to that of alternative B, and I think Brian said that you could conceivably apply   alternative A language substantially to a 50 basis point cut  So in general I like that approach    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, if I understand the discussion about this, when you   say “some indicators have risen somewhat,” you are getting into territory that seems sort of   mealy-mouthed  "
8437,2008-04-29,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just to follow that up, Dave, how do you   build your assumption on the spending response to the fiscal stimulus?   April 29–30, 2008 39 of 266     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our high-level view of current   circumstances is that the real economy is quite weak, with weakness widespread  The financial   markets are turning optimistic, and elevated prices and inflation remain a serious concern  Reports   from our directors and District business contacts were broadly similar to the incoming national data   and information from other Districts reported in the Beige Book  Observations from such District   input support themes in the national data—for example, employment growth is quite weak  In this   round of director reports and conversations, I heard an increasing number of reports of holds on   hiring and expansion plans  One representative of a major retailer of home improvement goods   reported that hiring for seasonal employees will be down 40 percent this spring  This translates to   approximately 45,000 jobs  Nonresidential real estate development continues to slow in the   District, especially in Florida and Georgia  Of the 18 commercial contractors contacted in April, 15   expect that commercial construction will be weaker for the rest of 2008 than for the same period in   2007, with several predicting even more pronounced weakness in 2009  On the brighter side,   Florida Realtors are anticipating that sales over the next few months will exceed year-ago levels,   and builders are signaling less weakness than in recent reports  This is a level of optimism we have   not heard from Florida for some time  However, housing markets in the rest of the District continue   to weaken  We heard several complaints that obtaining financing is a serious problem for   April 29–30, 2008 57 of 266    commercial and residential developers and consumer homebuyers  In sum, the information from   the Sixth District seems to confirm what I believe is the continuing story of the national real   economy captured in the Greenbook—that is, shrinking net job creation, developing weakness in   nonresidential construction, and a bottom in the housing market still not in sight   In contrast, conditions in the financial markets appear to have improved substantially  As   has been my practice, I had several conversations with contacts in a variety of financial firms    There was a consistent tone suggesting that financial markets are likely to have seen the worst  This   does not mean that no concerns were expressed  Some contacts had concerns about European banks   and credit markets, and concern about the value of the dollar, notwithstanding the recent rally, is   coming up in more contexts  Concern was expressed about the dollar’s disruptive effect on   commodity markets, in turn affecting the general price level—in particular, the effect of high energy   prices on a wide spectrum of businesses’ consumer products and even on crime rates in rural and far   suburban areas related to the theft of copper wiring and piping from vacant homes and air   conditioning units  I worry that a narrative is developing along the lines that the ECB is concerned   about inflation and the Fed not so much  This narrative encourages a dollar carry trade mentioned,   again, by some financial contacts that puts downside pressure on the dollar that potentially   undermines both growth and inflation objectives  I remain concerned about the vulnerability of   financial markets to a shock or surprise, but overall, my contacts express the belief that conditions   are improving  The Atlanta forecast submission sees flat real GDP growth in the first half of 2008,   with gradual improvement in the second half  We continue to believe that the drag on economic   activity from the problems in the housing and credit markets will persist into 2009   On the inflation front, I am still projecting a decline in the rate of inflation over this year    I’ve submitted forecasts of declining headline inflation in 2009 and 2010, but I should note that my   April 29–30, 2008 58 of 266    staff’s current projections suggest that improvement to the degree I would like to see may require   some rises in the federal funds rate  It is my current judgment that, with an additional 25 basis point   reduction in the fed funds rate target, policy will be appropriately calibrated to the gradual recovery   of growth and the lowering of the inflation level envisioned in our forecast  This judgment is based   on the view that, with a negative real funds rate by some measures, policy is in stimulative territory;   that a lower cost of borrowing in support of growth depends more on market-driven tightening of   credit spreads than a lower policy rate; that further cuts may contribute to unhelpful movements in   the dollar exchange rate; and that extension of the four liquidity facilities may allow us to decouple   liquidity actions from the fed funds rate target  In my view, we are in a zone of diminishing returns   from further funds rate cuts beyond a possible quarter in this meeting  That said, as stated in the   Greenbook, uncertainty surrounding the outlook for the real economy is very high, and the   Committee needs, in my view, to preserve flexibility to deal with unanticipated developments    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I must say that I am sympathetic to the   “hold” advocates and the view that we are already accommodative  I think an apt anecdote is a   conversation I had in the past six weeks with a cruise line CEO who doesn’t know how to drive   his ships but who has in fact been at the helm a couple of times  He said, “When you turn the   wheel and nothing happens for several miles, the temptation to keep turning the wheel is   overwhelming”  [Laughter]  So I do have some sympathy  That said, I am going to support a   reduction in the target rate of ¼ percent, effectively alternative B, as I indicated yesterday  I   think it is pretty clear that we have a tradeoff between “a little more help to the economy” and   “enough for now” and really some shift in our focus to combating inflation   So let me lay out my rationale for not holding  I think there is still substantial downside   risk to the general economy, and it may take quite some time for recovery to materialize  A   quarter would help slightly to effect a lower cost of borrowing and, therefore, would stimulate   activity, although much of that is really beyond our control  It will be dictated by market forces    I think that halting today versus conceivably halting at the next meeting risks some interpretation   as a lack of recognition of the real state of weakness in the economy   April 29–30, 2008 113 of 266    Regarding inflation, I think the core numbers in the first quarter were not overly   discouraging, and I have to believe my own forecasts—in many respects, the forecasts I heard—  that inflation will soften in the coming months and be consistent with our working view of   expectations  I would say, however, that I am concerned that, in the minds of the general public,   high prices actually translate into inflation, whether or not the rate of inflation has flattened   As I have suggested, I am inclined to pause after this move, provided that the incoming   data are not too adverse and too divergent from expectations, but with the caveat that I think a lot   of shock risk is still out there and we have to remain flexible to deal with surprises  Holding or   signaling a pause may help the housing market a bit by starting to construct a bottom, as   borrowers or buyers begin to perceive that they shouldn’t expect any further rate cuts from us   Regarding the statement, I think the rationale section in alternative B is appropriate to the   situation that we face  Section 3 is a realistic acknowledgement of inflation trends and risk  I   gather that, with the changes in section 4, the question was whether or not to signal a pause or an   inclination to pause, and I tend to agree with a more cautious, less committal approach of the   proposed language—what yesterday was called a “soft” pause  So I am, on balance, quite happy   with the language in alternative B  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just to answer the questions that were   posed, I am comfortable with options 2 and 5, but I thought President Lacker’s presentation   made the case that option 4 deserves to remain in the mix  I think the objectives are appropriate    The only comment I have—and this is a bit vague, I realize—is to ensure that we are thinking far   enough ahead to ensure that we have a durable system that can operate in different mixes of   private and public in the payment system  Certainly, I think it is conceivable that in some years   April 29–30, 2008 181 of 266    we will be out of the business of retail payments, so I think we have to address different mixes of   private and public payment systems   Regarding the timeline, Governor Kohn already asked the question about approaching the   Congress to accelerate  Assuming that we do not approach the Congress to accelerate this, then   this timeline seems to me quite comfortable and gives plenty of time for very careful   consideration   In the room here is Will Roberds from our research staff, who by chance was at the Bank   of England talking about their experiences recently  I thought I would share a couple of things   that are apropos  They tried maintenance periods other than the intermeeting period, and they   found them to be not so effective, apparently because of ambiguity around the target rate  That   is a useful way of thinking—that the maintenance periods would be designed around the   intermeeting period  They apparently tried option 3, and it didn’t work because of too much   volatility within the corridor  Those two tidbits are feedback from the visit of a member of my   staff to the Bank of England  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8462,2008-06-24,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would like to start with some anecdotal   feedback from the region  As you know, we have a lot of Branches, so we have a lot of   directors, and we ask our directors a lot of questions  The anecdotal feedback from our 44   directors about the second half can be characterized as subdued  Almost all reported that they   expect economic activity to be flat or slower, and I took special note that these expectations   deteriorated in June after having actually improved a bit in May     The residential housing situation in the District resembles the national picture  Both sales   and new construction are weak  High levels of inventories are being exacerbated by   foreclosures, which are adding to downward pressure on prices  However, there are tentative   signs of a bottom forming  Our survey of Realtors across the District indicates that the pace of   decline of single-family home sales may be abating  Industry contacts tell us that foot traffic and   buyer interest are picking up, particularly in Florida, although I would say that what constitutes   progress in Florida would not be considered very encouraging elsewhere  Nevertheless, our   view is that the beginning of an adjustment process is under way, but the end of the process   looks to be a long way off  Some further home-price deterioration is likely to accompany this   bottoming process   Credit conditions in the District continue to tighten because of perceived risk and also   liquidity pressure on our banks  Our banks indicate that the process of deleveraging continues,   which is affecting lending for residential real estate and, to some extent, commercial real estate    We are also hearing from several sources that funding of community banks is becoming an   increasing problem because of their previous dependence on wholesale and correspondent bank   sources  Higher energy prices are, not surprisingly, affecting our outlook  Hospitality industry   June 24–25, 2008 45 of 253    contacts, for instance, expressed concern about low summer bookings  Although most tourist   destinations have reported solid activity to date, few expect this to continue     The reacceleration of energy and commodity price inflation has businesses focused on   cost pressures  Several business contacts indicated that price increases had been relatively easy   to pass through and make stick in this environment  I wouldn’t say that it’s widespread yet, but I   do hear some reports that businesses are expecting wage increases to eventually reflect the recent   increases in the cost of living  This could be a significant factor, particularly in service price   inflation  This and other anecdotal input has colored my outlook for the national economy for   the balance of the year and into 2009  I have revised up my forecast for headline inflation in   2008 and 2009 by 50 and 25 basis points, respectively  I am also assuming that the recent   inflationary pressures from elevated energy and food prices will unwind more slowly than I   previously projected—a view reinforced by expectations expressed by my District contacts    Like everyone else, I am deeply concerned that inflation expectations seem to be rising and that   expectations of general price inflation, reflecting second-, third-, and fourth-order effects of   recent oil and commodity price rises, risk becoming institutionalized  I am prepared in the near   term to think tactically regarding the conflict between growth and employment policy objectives   and inflation objectives; but sustained inflationary pressures that extend well into the fourth   quarter and rising expectation readings may force, at least on my part, a more strategic look at   the tradeoff   I would like to talk for a moment about financial markets  I made a number of calls   during the intermeeting period, and the growth-versus-inflation tactical dilemma is complicated   further by a very mixed picture in financial markets  My contacts all acknowledge improved   conditions since mid-March, but discussion of the current market circumstances and the outlook   June 24–25, 2008 46 of 253    had a sort of half-full/half-empty quality  My contacts, taken together, pointed to several   positives, including the health of the corporate loan market, improved CDO pricing, the   readiness of forming distressed funds to buy asset-backed securities, alt-A mortgage demand, the   growing perception that subprime loss estimates have been overstated, and some comment on   Goldman’s Cheyne deal, which they believe will help create price determination for certain   securities  At the same time, these contacts cited areas of continuing or worsening weakness,   including HELOCs and second mortgages; option ARMs and alt-A hybrids; indirect auto, given   the collateral value of SUVs in current circumstances; in contrast to CDO pricing, CDO squared   pricing is very weak and deteriorating; the obvious concern about the growing liquidity issues of   regional banks; and the view that the auction rate securities market valuations, given illiquidity,   are suggesting that this market has little probability of returning to normalcy  Overall, my   contacts in financial markets were encouraged but expressed worries over still-substantial   downside potential     Let me turn now to my national forecast compared with the Greenbook forecast  The   Atlanta projections for the national economy are broadly similar to those of the Greenbook  We   have the same general narrative of slow growth for the balance of the year followed by a gradual   pickup through 2009 and 2010  My projections for headline and core inflation are virtually   identical to the baseline Greenbook projections  However, I believe that there may be less   disinflationary pressure than seems implicit in the Board staff’s forecast  As a consequence, the   fed funds rate path that supports my inflation outlook is well above the Greenbook’s at the end of   2009 and 2010  We are 75 basis points higher at year-end 2009 and 100 basis points higher at   year-end 2010  Notwithstanding the upward revision of the first-quarter GDP number and the   better expectations for this quarter, I still believe the near-term risks to growth are weighted to   June 24–25, 2008 47 of 253    the downside  At the same time, as suggested by my revised forecast, I see the risks to our   inflation objective as weighted to the upside   On the subject of the long-term projections, I favor the third approach, which is three   years plus long-term averages, and certainly would be comfortable with approach number 2  I’m   generally dubious about the ability to do actual forecasting for the outyears, even as near-term as   the third year  So I really don’t favor approach number 1  My experience, in the brief time I   have been with the Fed, has at least personally been, shall I say, challenging from the point of   view of forecasting  I tend to think of the long-term projections as being roughly equivalent to   our targets or policy goals  In fact, the approach we have generally taken with our three-year   forecasts is making the outyear approaching at least what we would consider to be the trend rate   for growth and the employment and inflation objective  So I think long-term projections really   do amount to more-explicit targeting, and very likely the first question we get when we come out   of the blocks—if we have this kind of approach—will be, Is this your target?  I am comfortable   saying “yes” to that question and, therefore, would support the third approach  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also prefer the fed funds rate   recommendation and language of alternative B  It captures the delicacy—I think that word was   used yesterday—of the current tradeoffs and leans fairly heavily rhetorically against inflation and   inflation expectations  I note that inflation and inflation expectations are mentioned in both   paragraphs 3 and 4 using the language, “Uncertainty    remains high” and “risks    have   increased”  I think this constitutes considerable stress on the seriousness of our commitment to   address inflation and expectations, and it is a complete statement and will serve to condition the   market  As Brian said, it suggests that firming later in the year could occur, and I believe that is   appropriate  I would like to give the medicine that we have applied to resolve the situation and   the financial markets a little more time to work  I am in accord with Governor Kohn’s thinking   of stimulus or accommodation in terms of the cost of borrowing to real borrowers—individuals   and businesses—and, therefore, we really have not seen a proportionate improvement in the cost   of capital, notwithstanding such a strong reduction in the fed funds rate   So as of now, I would expect to support a reversal a little later in the year  I also think   there is enough ambiguity currently that giving the situation a little more time to clarify would be   helpful  Core inflation has not risen dramatically, whereas headline has, and it is headline that   the public is reacting to  Measures of expectations, such as they are, seem to suggest that short-  term expectations have risen more than long-term, so there really hasn’t been a clear breakout of   long term  It may be true that it would be too late if we saw that breakout, but I think we can   afford to wait for a greater preponderance of evidence to accumulate over the next few weeks   June 24–25, 2008 123 of 253    before considering a reversal  So I support, as I said, alternative B and the language of   alternative B    Thanks, Mr Chairman  I have maybe a variation on Governor   Warsh’s comment of yesterday  Much has been said by many, so I will try not to take too much   time here  I think Vice Chairman Geithner’s admonitions are correct, and I certainly support   them  I am quite supportive of extending through the year-end, and the short-term plan that the   Chairman laid out seems quite sensible to me   I don’t have well-informed or well-thought-out answers to the more detailed questions   that were posed in advance of the meeting  I didn’t devote the time to study them in any depth    So let me take refuge in some sort of high-level comments  A number of people around the table   have been expressing overview types of comments  I see the touchstone of all of this to be our   June 24–25, 2008 179 of 253    perceived accountability for systemic risk and financial stability  There may be, in the context of   legislation, regulation, and so forth, limits to that; but I think that we are largely perceived as the   most accountable party  I have to ask myself, Do we have a system today that is aligned with the   reality of the financial markets?  Or, put in more vernacular terms, do we have the right stuff to   do what we need to do to take responsibility as best we can for financial stability?  My answer to   that is “no”  I don’t think we have the right stuff  I think the answer to that lies in working out   the details of what the right stuff is  But the reality is that financial markets are not bank-centric   any longer, with the widely discussed shadow banking system, including hedge funds, a   complexity that is not going to go away; international integration that is not going to go away;   very, let’s just say, compelling economic and financial reasons for off-balance-sheet treatment of   various kinds of things; and on and on  We could make a long list of what that reality is  To me,   and I have been kind of dwelling on this for some time, that is a reality that is likely to continue    It may take a couple of steps back, but it will continue to develop along certain lines  Do we   have a system that is aligned with it?  The answer to that is “no”  So if we can take care of the   short-term plan and then buy the time over the next several months to hammer out what we think   is the best possible thinking opposite that reality, then that is what I believe we need to be doing    So thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8488,2008-07-24,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I apologize  I was a couple of minutes   late—caught in traffic here in Miami actually—and I missed Bill Dudley’s briefing at the   beginning  So I don’t really know all that he covered in terms of market stress  But my question   really relates to an impression I have that a high proportion of the TAF usage is actually foreign   banking organizations, where the primary regulatory would, in effect, be a foreign regulator    Listening to President Yellen’s discussion of coordination and communication among domestic   regulators leaves me with the question of what the state of our communication with foreign   regulators is, if they would be in possession of information that we might not have while we are   exposed on this longer-term basis to a foreign banking organization    I’m comfortable with the 84, Mr Chairman  Thank you  "
8511,2008-08-05,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  A question for Steve  Could you review   your thought process on core import prices and comment on how sensitive our inflation projections   are to the assumption of, I believe, moderation in core import prices in 2009?    I just want to point out that we hear a fair amount of anecdotal feedback   suggesting that just determining what is the net real price for a house is not so easy because of   incentives, particularly in multifamily but also new homes in general  You pay list, but you get a   Mercedes and a year’s worth of gasoline and your lawn mowed and a lot of things thrown in for the   seller to hold the price close to what the list is  So I don’t know how these things are actually   measured to take into account those kinds of incentives    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The contours and basic outcomes of   Atlanta’s forecast are similar to the baseline of the Greenbook forecast  So I want to focus my   remarks this morning on the underlying assumptions in both forecasts—assumptions that I view as   pivotal and if we miscalculate could result in a longer-term policy error   It seems that at every meeting there’s great uncertainty around the outlook, and this juncture   is no different  I perceive considerable uncertainty and debatable assumptions in the base-case   scenario  As I see it, the key assumptions broadly are that housing stabilizes, perhaps as indicated   by housing prices, in the second half of ’09  Inflation pressures intensify in the near term but then   abate because of economic slack and lower commodity prices and, as discussed, core import prices    Recent declines in oil prices stick, and prices remain more or less flat  Certainly since the   Greenbook was published, we note the fluctuations just in the past few days that were referred to   earlier, and I also can’t dismiss geopolitical risks and the potential of a severe shock  Finally,   financial market stress will persist for some months but diminish next year  These assumptions,   using the respectable term “assumptions,” have the feeling to me of “bets,” not so respectable a   term  The policy assumption integral to both the Greenbook and the Atlanta forecasts could be   added to this, and that is that rate rises starting in 2009 won’t choke off improving growth and will   be enough to blunt remaining inflation pressures   So I’ll devote my comments to input from regional and other contacts that either serve to   confirm or cast doubt on these assumptions  We oriented this cycle’s questions to our Atlanta and   Branch directors to, first, evidence of wage pressures and pass-through of higher costs  In   interpreting the feedback, we noted some confusion between a business’s management of its labor   August 5, 2008 36 of 145    costs versus general wage pressures  We heard that businesses are working to keep their total wage   bills in check by raising wages for key talent but letting less critical employees go or cutting their   work hours as an offset  The reduction in hours is attributed to some combination of weaker   product demand and increased average productivity  Rising unemployment appears to be keeping   wage demands in check  There are exceptions, such as the oil field services industry, for which   qualified staff are in short supply, and certain skilled industrial and business trades in which local   bottlenecks exist  In businesses enjoying strong export demand, some employers are utilizing   bonuses rather than commitment to permanent wage increases  So our regional contacts did not   indicate the development of broad-based underlying pressures on labor costs reflecting wage   demands  As for inflation pass-through, our contacts reported widespread and growing efforts to   pass through higher input costs  Pass-through efforts appear to be the rule rather than the exception    As one Branch director put it, people are passing through costs like crazy using high energy costs as   cover   The reports of my supervision staff regarding banking conditions indicate a continuing   decline in asset quality and a very nervous interbank funding market  Foreclosed properties, both   single-family and condo, are making up the majority of house sales and slowing the absorption of   the oversupply of new homes  Some contacts are very concerned about the prospect of a second   wave of foreclosures as option ARM mortgage borrowers, mostly concentrated in large states like   Florida and California—these are borrowers who are currently paying less than the accrued   interest—run up against maximum loan-to-value ceilings  New, higher GSE standards are resulting   in fewer borrowers being qualified, putting downward pressure on house prices and bringing more   foreclosures  Virtually all comparables for Florida residential valuation are based on forced sales   and foreclosures, we are told  Beyond the deterioration in real estate portfolios, banks are reporting   August 5, 2008 37 of 145    growing problems in credits to food distributors, restaurants, trucking, and other petroleum fuel or   input-intensive industries   Based on my calls with financial market contacts, it seems that—no surprise—much of the   attention in financial markets has shifted from private fixed-income markets to Fannie and Freddie    Fixed-income markets for private securities appeared to have improved relative to their lows since   the current financial turmoil began  Although significant concerns remain, it appears that   leveraged-loan deals are getting done  Volume is down, spreads are up, and the deals are very   conservative, but deals are getting done  That said, one of the patterns in my calls over the past year   has been that, every time one concern abates, another seems to jump up and take its place    Although the recent legislation appears to have alleviated concerns about the Fannie and Freddie   senior debt, my contacts indicate that there is widespread uncertainty about what will happen to   junior securities if the Treasury injects funds  Furthermore, more than once I heard the view that   foreign holders of GSE debt are concerned that their positions are not as safe as they believed  One   contact mentioned that the 18-month term of the guarantee is reportedly affecting some holders’   maturity choices  In response to my question about the relative weakness of European banks, one   contact suggested that they have booked much of their troubled assets in the “hold to maturity”   account, suggesting slower recognition of losses and difficulties ahead  We confirmed with one   large regional bank CFO significant deterioration of HELOCs in their portfolio and, by implication,   broadly among regional banks  The option ARM problem, by contrast, is perceived to be possibly   the next shoe to drop but, as I said earlier, not uniformly distributed across the country  Finally, we   heard the view that markets perceive banks as facing protracted difficulty raising capital     To conclude, the downside risks to growth have not diminished in my opinion  On the flip   side, I agree that the upside risks to inflation are obviously a serious concern  In particular, I put a   August 5, 2008 38 of 145    fair amount of weight on the possibility that inflation will not moderate sufficiently without a more   substantial tightening of monetary policy than that projected in the Greenbook baseline  My   intermeeting internal and external discussions make it difficult for me to dismiss some of the   alternative scenarios in the Greenbook, specifically the “severe financial stress” scenario, the   “typical recession” scenario, and the “inflationary spiral” scenario; and in a high-uncertainty   environment, I don’t view any of these scenarios as exclusive of another  That said, I see the risks   to both the inflation and the growth objectives as very roughly in balance at this time  Thank you,   Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the interest of time, I will be very   brief  I support alternative B in substance and concur with its wording  I think we are in a   delicate rhetorical balancing act at this stage, and as Brian described, the slightly greater   emphasis on inflation is appropriate at this time  I think alternative B has substantially captured   the current situations and concerns of the majority of the Committee, so I support alternative B

8535,2008-09-16,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I finalized the thinking that went into my   prepared remarks late last week, which seemed like a good idea at the time  But I should follow   the philosophy of Charlie Brown, who I think said, “Never do today what you can put off until   tomorrow”  [Laughter]  Obviously, we can’t ignore the events of the weekend and yesterday’s   financial markets  So late yesterday I reviewed the views that I shaped last week and tried to   ground them in an assessment of whether the outlook for the real economy has changed   materially, whether the balance of risks has been altered, and whether, in my opinion, we must   reintroduce a risk-management approach and consider taking out more insurance     With that as prologue, let me make just a couple of comments on regional soundings   from the last couple of weeks  Anecdotal reports from the Sixth District support the view that   the economy is quite weak but not deteriorating markedly  The CFO of a large retailer of   housing-related goods said that they think they see a bottom forming  I am also starting to hear   some reports that housing markets feel as though they are beginning to stabilize; but, really, it is   September 16, 2008 28 of 108    a little too early to say that a bottom has formed in any of our housing markets  My overall sense   from District contacts and our surveys is of an economy that is quite weak, with no clear trend   evident   Turning to the national outlook, like most forecasts, my view on the likely path for the   economy has not changed materially since our August meeting  I see nothing in the data and   hear nothing from District reports that alters my views that the second half will be very weak  I   expect this weak period to be followed by a slow recovery gathering in 2009, but the foundation   of a recovery starting around year-end or early 2009 may be far from solid  The contraction of   credit availability that is confirmed by both surveys and anecdotal evidence could deepen as   financial institutions face tight liquidity and difficulty recapitalizing  A protracted credit crunch   would likely operate as a substantial drag on the economy   Consistent with the Greenbook, I expect some near-term improvement in headline   inflation, as we saw this morning, some near-term deterioration of core inflation measures, and   inflation moving in the right direction later this year and into next year  That said, one director   said that he and his particular industry had seen no moderation of price increases up to this date    I am comforted somewhat that the upward drift in some inflation expectation measures appears   to have been reversed  In addition, my staff has been monitoring revisions to inflation forecasts   of professional forecasters, which also seem to suggest that concerns about accelerating inflation   have abated somewhat   Regarding the balance of risks in the economy, I am concerned that the downside risks to   growth may be gathering force, as evidenced by the weakening personal consumption and retail   sales data, the weakening economies of export partners, and the delicate state of the financial   markets  At the same time, I perceive that there is significant risk that the current disinflationary   September 16, 2008 29 of 108    environment may fail to bring core inflation down to anything resembling acceptable levels for   the longer term  Adding up all of this, I perceive a very rough balance of risks that could break   either way in coming months     My view of the appropriate policy path is consistent with the Greenbook—that the fed   funds rate target will remain stable at or close to the current level for several months going into   2009  My preference is to hold the fed funds rate at the current level of 2 percent  Among the   reasons is that a ¼ percentage point drop, as suggested by alternative A, is really not clearly   called for by a changed outlook for the real economy  Inflation risks are still in play, and I think   we should give credit markets more time to digest events and sort out rate relationships   As regards the statement, my preference is alternative B  However, I am concerned that   the reference to the recent financial turbulence is not quite strong enough, so I took a shot at   rephrasing just the beginning of the rationale section to read as such  “Economic growth appears   to have slowed recently, and labor markets have weakened further  In addition, strains in   financial markets have increased significantly”—basically taking the slightly stronger expression   in the alternative A rationale and putting it in alternative B  So my position, Mr Chairman, is to   hold at this meeting  Thank you very much  "
8568,2008-10-07,LOCKHART,"  Bill, how would you interpret yesterday’s size of the TAF auction?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also support the policy action and really   have nothing to add in terms of its rationale  But in the statement there is really no reference to the   coordinated and global nature of the action  I’m sure that’s purposeful  It does seem to me that we   have an opportunity perhaps to reinforce the psychological power of this by referencing it  So my   question is, Why not include some nod to that aspect, which in the minds of so many people seems   to be the real power behind this decision?  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8594,2008-10-28,LOCKHART,"  Another question for Nathan on swap lines is how this works   exactly  If the pattern holds and Mexico, for example, supports its banking system—in the case   of Mexico it is a little different from others, in that all of the large banks are foreign-owned   (Citibank owns Banamex, and the Spanish banks own the other two or three large banks)—  where does our responsibility stop and theirs begin?  Is it possible for the subsidiary of a US   bank or a Spanish bank to draw dollar liquidity in Mexico and with fungible dollars move that   around the world?  Or does it in one manner or another stay in Mexico?    So in the case of a foreign bank—they lend to a foreign bank in their   country, in Mexico in this case—defaulting, whose problem is it?  Is it the home country   supervisor’s problem, or is it Mexico’s problem vis-à-vis us?    To continue to grill you, Nathan—    You know, the atmosphere right now is largely precautionary on their   part—they are well capitalized with foreign currency reserves  But if we want to deal with   hypotheticals, let’s assume that some of these recipients of the swap lines get into a liquidity crisis    Is the European Central Bank being approached for swap lines?  I recognize that they need dollar   liquidity, but in a general liquidity crisis, the euro would do as well to help  Do we have any sense   of whether the ECB is considering swap lines for some of these emerging markets?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Most of the anecdotal information from   the Sixth District is consistent with the downbeat picture that has been emerging in the national   data  The sentiment of directors and their contacts has turned decidedly more pessimistic   regarding current economic conditions and the near-term outlook  Banking contacts indicate a   further tightening of credit standards, while stresses on household and small business finances   have resulted in increased credit card usage  A state economic-development official noted that   some banks have halted their 90/10 SBA lending  Bankers active in the VRDN (variable rate   demand note) market noted that municipalities are under pressure with declining revenues and   higher financing costs  Nonresidential building contractors noted a large increase in the number   of canceled projects  Advisory council members described a substantial decline in domestic   shipping and transport activity for most goods, other than energy products, and some slowing of   export volumes through regional ports  Finally, retail contacts, in anticipation of the coming   holiday season, noted that orders are down, and heavy price discounting has begun already   Thematically, Atlanta’s forecast is consistent with the Greenbook, but we are projecting a   slightly more severe and protracted downturn in business activity than the Greenbook baseline    My assumption is that the cascading dynamic at work in the financial markets may take longer   October 28–29, 2008 66 of 206    than projected in the Greenbook to come to an end  As a consequence, I view the Greenbook’s   scenario entitled “more financial fallout” as the most plausible storyline among the likely range   of outcomes  I should acknowledge that we’re in an interval between the announcement of the   TARP and its full implementation  The encouraging improvement in credit spreads and term   funding we have seen in recent days may accelerate once the TARP is operational   With inflation abating more or less as expected and with such uncertainty surrounding the   playing out of continuing and recently worsening turmoil in the financial markets, I have to view   the balance of risks as more negative for growth than upside for inflation  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think that this is a tough call  I support   alternative B, with the statement wording as presented  In my thinking, a 25 basis point cut   today is part of a total 75 basis point action, including the October 8 move  I believe the   deterioration we have seen in September and October and the resulting downward revision of the   outlook merit a cumulative response of this magnitude  That said, I am sympathetic to the view   that we would be well advised to keep some powder dry to respond to shocks or developments   ahead  I anticipate that, because a number of the dynamics in the markets have not really played   out, we will have more shocks and they could come from further financial institution failures,   corporate failures, a sovereign debt crisis, and market disarray; and in other markets, such as the   municipal market, there is always a chance of a geopolitical event  In all likelihood these things   come in combination or in rapid fire  So, as I said, I am sympathetic to the “powder dry” view,   but I see the powder dry objective as being in conflict with responding to the recent   deterioration  Therefore I come to 25 basis points or alternative B to some extent as a   compromise, combined with the 50 basis points of October 8  Thank you, Mr Chairman   "
8621,2008-12-15,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I add my thanks to the staff for the   excellent summaries, particularly those that covered the Japanese experience  My reading of that   experience argues for acting aggressively and moving directly to whatever lower bound we   consider the effective minimum  The economic outlook has deteriorated sharply, and as I look at   the incoming data and our near-term forecasts, I find it reasonable to expect that we will see   more troubling data by the time of our January meeting     I concur with the Greenbook assessment that the outlook calls for a cumulative reduction   of 75 basis points over the next two meetings  At the risk of jumping ahead a little, my   preference is to get there at this meeting  If there is an argument for a more gradual two-step   approach, it is that more communication is needed to explain the Committee’s strategy and   condition the markets for a zero lower bound policy regime  I was on the receiving end of this   December 15–16, 2008 58 of 284    argument at my Atlanta board meeting last week—which Don Kohn witnessed as a guest—at   which some directors strongly resisted moving to the lower bound without, in their view, a   clearly articulated statement about how policy will operate going forward  Mr Chairman, in   your speech two weeks ago you made a good effort to prepare the public for the possibility that   the Committee may soon have to operate with policy targets that are unfamiliar  But it strikes   me that there is a chicken–egg problem of when it is appropriate to lay out the new approach   Again, I read the Japanese lesson as move aggressively but at the same time   communicate very clearly the whys and hows of the policy course  President Plosser pointed out   in his memo circulated last week—and I believe President Lacker noted last meeting—that we   have at least implicitly entered into a quantitative easing regime already  The fed funds rate has   been trading for some weeks near the level that we are likely to find as the lower bound  I think   we must move to a decision at this meeting on communication strategy, independent of whether   or not we move to the lower bound in one step  I don’t see that this need is significantly reduced   by delaying the move to the lower bound, especially if that destination is inevitable, as I believe   it to be   On the question of costs of the zero lower bound policy to markets and financial   institutions, in my reading of the analysis and the background memos taken as a whole,   maintaining the effective funds rate at a level somewhere near 25 basis points may help avoid   problems in some markets that would otherwise arrive at zero  I think we have to be concerned   that at absolute zero the infrastructure of some markets might atrophy as market participants shift   resources in the direction of operations where profits are more attainable  These concerns might   argue for stating the federal funds rate target in terms of a range, and I would support a lower   bound in the range of 0 to 25 basis points   December 15–16, 2008 59 of 284    As regards communication strategies, to state the obvious, financial market participants   would prefer to know as much as possible about the level of rates in a zero lower bound regime,   the duration of adherence to that policy, and when and on what basis the policy will change  The   Committee can’t fully satisfy those needs, but we can provide assurances that equip market   participants with a clear framework for planning and anticipating change of policy  I think it is   important to communicate that we intend to stay the course with this policy until some   combination of materially improved conditions obtain in both financial markets and the general   economy  That is to say, we should indicate that the policy is not short-term shock treatment to   be quickly reversed, unless, of course, conditions dictate   As regards indicating specific conditions that would inform a change of policy or a   change of course, I favor an approach that addresses conditionality in general terms using   language such as “the Committee intends to hold the federal funds rate target at this level until   such time that it judges conditions are present for material and sustained improvements in   financial market functioning and economic growth”  I prefer to reference general economic   conditions rather than to use phrases like “near zero for some time” as in Bluebook alternative B    Further, I think it is appropriate to reinforce that our policy will be calibrated based on our   longer-term inflation objectives  I am not comfortable with formal statements indicating that the   Committee is willing to accept higher rates of inflation than it normally would find desirable  In   my view, the goal is to avoid entrenching expectations that deviate too much from our explicit or   implicit price stability objectives in both inflationary and deflationary directions  I think this   goal is best pursued by stating our commitment to medium-term price stability  This statement   can be in general terms, but I would also support the more explicit numerical reference in   Bluebook alternative A     December 15–16, 2008 60 of 284    As regards more purchases of agency debt, agency MBS, and long-dated Treasuries, my   view is that open market operations should be conducted in the manner that enhances overall   market liquidity in the most efficient and least disruptive way  This may well be by purchases of   agency debt and MBS beyond the level announced  However, to the extent that enhancing   overall market liquidity requires efforts to directly manipulate prices in particular markets   beyond the federal funds market, I think we may be better served by developing specifically   targeted facilities to do so   As regards the further expansion of liquidity facilities, to date we have attacked   dysfunctional market conditions in the interbank funding market, the Treasuries market, the   commercial paper market, the mortgage market, and, shortly, the asset-backed securities market    The more we migrate with these facilities in the direction of general corporate debt and other   nonfinancial issuers’ markets, the more our policy actions involve contentious issues of moral   hazard, possible distortion of the necessary process of relative price discovery, and the   appropriate division of labor between the central bank and the Treasury  I think that we just need   to keep this in mind as new facilities are considered  The extension and broadening of existing   facilities, and possibly new facilities, may be necessary  I judge that the broad policy of targeted   facilities has been successful to date   Regarding nonstandard tools, I find myself in agreement with the thrust of President   Plosser’s suggestions  In a quantitative easing regime, it makes most sense to express our   directive in terms of a quantitative target  And as regards your comments earlier, Mr Chairman,   I tend to look at this target question as a tradeoff between targeting quantities versus prices or   rates, and I believe that the quantitative target approach is the correct approach, even if we   decide to operate with the common understanding that our short-term objective is, for example,   December 15–16, 2008 61 of 284    to generate a particular path for long-term Treasuries or agency debt  Based on my reading of   the literature and history as well as on my own experience, I have doubts about our capacity to   reliably control specific relative asset prices, at least in markets unlike the federal funds market,   where we are the monopoly supplier of the asset being traded  But that does not preclude setting   quantitative targets for the purchase of particular assets and evaluating the appropriateness of   those targets against a variety of outcomes, including the interest rates that emerge in those   markets   I am, however, predisposed toward the line of thinking expressed by President Lacker in   his pre-meeting memo  By choosing to express the directive in terms of the monetary base or   some measure of reserves, the decisions of the Committee remain in the range of traditional   monetary policy  My conjecture is that a reserve base quantitative directive would help to draw   a clear line between traditional monetary policy decisions in the purview of the FOMC and the   enhanced credit policies implemented under 13(3) authority   Let me move to the communication approaches  Again, internalizing the Japanese   experience, we will be well served by a significant and coordinated communication effort  Our   press statement might be supplemented by an additional explanation of whatever new operational   procedures we adopt, followed by a public statement, perhaps even a press conference, by the   Chairman  Throughout this crisis, we have been provided excellent support in the form of   talking points  These have been a great help to me and my staff in providing accurate and timely   information on the various policy actions taken by the Federal Reserve  With similar assistance   in this case, I think we can collectively commit to providing the sort of common voice on the   facts that will promote public understanding of the direction in which we decide to head  Thank   you, Mr Chairman   December 15–16, 2008 62 of 284     Question for Nathan  In an earlier meeting, if I recall correctly, there   was mention of the European banks’ exposure to emerging-market sovereign debt—a concern about   the trend lines in that sovereign debt  Are you tracking that in any sense?  My concern is that there   could be another full-blown debt crisis of some kind coming  It is not covered in these charts, but   do you have a sense of default risk on the part of emerging-market sovereigns?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think President Fisher at the last meeting   actually proposed that, since we all knew where the economy was, we just suspend discussion and   get on to what to do about it  Forgive me for a six-week reaction function here, President Fisher,   but I tend to agree with that  I will be very brief  The points I will make have either been made or   will be made, I am sure  [Laughter]  We are facing dysfunctional financial markets, a rapidly   weakening real economy, and a very negative psychology, a darkening mood  In addition, I am   picking up in my contacts uncertainty or even questioning of what can be done and what good   anything close to conventional monetary policy will do  My board of directors, advisory councils,   and other contacts reflect deepening pessimism, and many of those contacts confirm the view that   consumer activity and the economy in general pulled back dramatically in September and October   I have adjusted my forecast similarly to the Greenbook and commercial forecasters  I think   it is very difficult at this point to forecast with any confidence that conditions will gel in a way   December 15–16, 2008 136 of 284    necessary for a recovery  The Greenbook sees a somewhat sharper snapback by midyear, reflecting   the influence of a fiscal stimulus, than I am prepared at this time to project  Our forecast assumes a   protracted period of weakness through all of 2009, somewhat more along the lines of the “more   financial stress” scenario in the Greenbook   Regarding financial markets, I would just comment that the pressures on the hedge fund   sector have clearly not abated and may be intensifying  Over the weekend we picked up rumors of   a Fed intervention that has not been discussed here, so I presume that it was just a rumor    Nonetheless, rumors were circulating that a major hedge fund group was about to collapse and that   our people were “in,” so to speak, over the weekend  As Bill mentioned yesterday, the Madoff   scandal certainly has not helped the picture regarding hedge funds   Regarding risks, it is not my baseline scenario, but the risk of deflation obviously cannot be   ignored, and the apparent speed of disinflation is quite a concern  The Atlanta staff prepared several   forecast scenarios, and there were some plausible downside scenarios that really were quite ugly    So to preview later comments, I think the balance of risks at this point is decidedly to the downside   and justifies a trauma-management approach—or, in more normal terms, a risk-management   approach—of acting aggressively at this meeting  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I am relieved to hear that    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My preference is to move in this meeting   to the consensus lower-bound range for the funds target, and I prefer the range of 0 to 25  So I   believe either alternative A or alternative B will work as serviceable options, and I can live with   either one  But I actually lean toward alternative B  I think it is the clearest, and with the   inclusion of the language related to deflation, it is also internally more consistent  In particular,   my preference is to indicate that the FOMC intends to keep the policy rate low until economic   and credit conditions improve, and I think it is appropriate to emphasize that our policies will be   calibrated based on longer-term inflation objectives   As I said yesterday, I am thinking that the conditionality language could be stronger    Specifically, I have in mind something along the lines of a statement that reads that “the   Committee intends to maintain this range for the federal funds rate until such time that it judges   conditions are present for material and sustained improvements in financial market functioning   and economic growth, and the Committee believes that this policy course is consistent with its   medium-term price stability objective”  I think that kind of language could fit at the beginning   of paragraph 4, around that area, in alternative B  I think that is stronger than the implicit   conditionality that is already in the statement  In my rounds of contacts before the meeting, one   conversation did resonate with me  It was a call from a financial market participant for hearing   December 15–16, 2008 184 of 284    what the plan is and what the strategy is and affirming that there is a plan  I think stronger   conditionality language would respond to that need in the marketplace   As regards the questions, I think I have already covered some of them  I would prefer the   specifying of a range in alternative B  I would lean toward including the language “and sees   some risk that inflation could decline” because it ties in with the “all available tools” language at   the beginning of paragraph 4  In other words, I think, if we include that language in paragraph 3,   we are setting up a risk and the “employ all available tools” responds strongly to that risk   Regarding the inclusion of the long-term Treasury securities, I am persuaded by   Governor Kohn’s comment that we should include it  It is consistent with whatever public   discussion we have had to date, including your speech of two weeks ago  So that is all  Thank   you, Mr Chairman    I can confuse the matter by saying that I was thinking of it in alternative   B, and Ms Cumming has it in alternative A  So somewhere in there   December 15–16, 2008 197 of 284   "
8644,2009-01-16,LOCKHART," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have gotten a lot out of the discussion   today I have to say that I am still really forming my opinion both on some of the more important   arguments in favor of this or that and on the details  But I think what I can best do at this point is   just to give you a sense of how I am leaning, which I think is broadly in line with what many of the   members have already stated  I favor an explicit target  I think going beyond simply the approach   of extending the forecast makes sense  I favor an inflation objective versus a price-level approach    I think the price-level approach, particularly for the broad public, will be more difficult to   communicate                                   January 16, 2009 47 of 69  I can see arguments on both sides of a point versus a range  On balance, I favor a point   forecast of 2 percent, a round number  For many observers of our policy, some range would be   understood, and I do like a range from a management point of view because it gives us a better   chance of hitting it But from the point of view of clarity with the general public, I could be   convinced that a point, as long as it is a round number, would make sense   I tend to view the approach that I am laying out as really espousing what I call a “serious   guiding principle,” which allows for pragmatic consideration of conditions at any given time and,   therefore, does preserve some flexibility, as Governor Kohn emphasized  Of course, if it is too soft   a guiding principle, then it is not taken seriously  It is not credible  So I think we want to   communicate it so that it is understood that, as a guiding principle, it is to be taken very seriously  I   do not see this in conflict with the dual mandate  I think we would be communicating a guiding   principle for the inflation part of our dual mandate  I tend to favor a medium-term horizon—three   to five years  I think that is a credible horizon  I also favor a headline number  Because we have   been using the PCE measure, although it requires a bit more education for at least the broad public, I   think headline PCE is a good approach  But I would certainly be easily convinced to go with   headline CPI   To anchor expectations on the part of households, as President Bullard discussed, I think the   approach needs to be one of simplicity  One test that I would use would be to find out if the average   informed citizen can recite our policy or our approach back to us  That is why I favor a round   number of 2 percent—because it is memorable and because I think the average person would get it    What we are doing here really is formalizing a consensus that already exists  In that respect I find   myself broadly in favor of what most have emphasized  I do like a staged approach to deal with the   politics of the matter  Under the current circumstances, there is such sensitivity out in the political                          January 16, 2009 48 of 69  world that it may require a staged approach  I agree with the comment made earlier, Mr Chairman,   that you would be in the best position to judge how to stage it  So as I said earlier, I am still forming   my opinion, but those are my leanings at this point  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8664,2009-01-27,LOCKHART," That is a credit risk That is not a foreign exchange risk   Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, since we are beginning the year, a   broad appeal to speak to the furthest person in the room rather than to the person next to you    [Laughter] It is very hard to follow many of these answers because I can’t hear you down at this            January 27–28, 2009 33 of 267  end of the table, and I can imagine our colleagues here in the back of the room have no idea what   is being discussed   A couple of questions It is probably a little premature to be thinking in this detail, but   the institution that Nathan described I think we can all guess because of their foreign operations    They have funding needs in many, many currencies  Charlie, can you hear me at the end of the   table? [Laughter]   Would we be using hard currency swap facilities to deal with softer   currency funding problems when the crisis could begin in a minor currency?  Is there that kind of   linkage conceivably in how we structure and address this?  That is the first question  The second   question is, If this is an institution for which we have already had an intervention with a   significant and very public amount of money involved, would we be offsetting this against that   intervention facility, or is this incremental?   Can you answer the buggy whip question?  [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just a couple of curiosity questions   really for the staff If we were to convey assets to the Treasury and mark them to market at that   time, let us say, Maiden Lane or AIG, what losses would we be recognizing at that point?   The second question—nobody has mentioned any particular markets   on our radar screen that, if we had criteria, we might intervene in  But the one on which I get   feedback is the municipal market, and we have a legal issue that we cannot lend to municipalities   unless they happen to be corporations Presuming for the moment that there was some   legislative treatment of that, what is the status in discussing with the Treasury an intervention in   that particular market?  It is a broken market as far as I can tell at this stage   Just to respond, Jeff, to the comment that the hedge funds haven’t   faced a run-like phenomenon One of my contact conversations with a hedge fund manager   effectively said, “We are in a run  This period is a run”  It is a run that has episodes at the end   of quarters and so forth, so it operates a bit differently, but the effect is the same   I decided to withdraw my question   Thank you, Mr Chairman  In Atlanta, we just completed a full cycle   of our Branch board meetings and the Atlanta board discussions, as well as quite a number of   pre-FOMC calls No surprise, sentiment about the economy continues to worsen as more parties   are feeling the effect of the downturn Fallout from financial market stress and the contracting   economy continues to spread and is affecting sectors previously thought to be insulated—for   example, hospitals and universities  Consumer retrenchment has significantly affected   restaurants, the travel industry, and a wide variety of personal services  The anecdotes I am   hearing on consumer behavior are quite colorful  Describing the popular culture, one director   said, “It is cool not to spend”  A director who is a chief financial officer of a large national   home-improvement retailer described the recent shifts in consumer purchases within their stores   in the direction of paint (if I am out of work, I might as well paint those walls), snow blowers (no   longer willing to pay for service in the snow belt), and zero-radius lawnmowers (not to mow   one’s lawn but to hire oneself out to mow others’ lawns)  Anecdotal feedback also supports the   Greenbook view that house prices continue to feel downward pressure  In some parts of the   Sixth District—for example, South Florida and metro Atlanta—I am advised that prices may yet   decline another 10 to 20 percent over the year        January 27–28, 2009 117 of 267  There is widespread frustration over the inability to make longer-term plans in such a   highly uncertain environment  This seems the case across the spectrum of economic actors,   including banks, large and smaller businesses, and households  Investment decisions are being   indefinitely postponed We are hearing from business and consumer borrowers that they can’t   get loans or that lending terms for new or existing loans have tightened to an extent that they   perceive as unreasonable Bankers are telling me that there is little loan demand from qualified   borrowers Our S&R examiners noted a migration to asset-collateralized secured loan structures   for previously unsecured cash flow-based C&I loans   Prompted by the question that we sent out in advance, much of the discussion at our   recent board meeting centered on Fed communication strategy and execution  Atlanta directors   were uniform in their call for intensified and simplified communication aimed at the general   public to treat confusion, anxiety, and a deficit of confidence  Saying much the same thing,   financial market contacts emphasized the heightened importance at this time of a clear and   credible framework and plan for improving financial conditions and the avoidance of the   appearance of one-off emergency policies  This theme reflects a context of deep concerns about   the financial sector in general and some very large institutions in particular     Turning to the national economy and my forecast, the broad strokes of my forecast   haven’t changed materially since October  Then I was, on balance, rather pessimistic, and I   remain skeptical of a more V-shaped recovery developing in the second half of 2009 and 2010,   as projected in the Greenbook Now, I acknowledge that the Greenbook narrative used the   words “gradually strengthening,” but it did depict 2 percent growth in the second half and   2½ percent next year In contrast, I continue to anticipate a flatter, more protracted, L-shaped   recovery moving through 2011  It is my sense that the rebuilding—or “rearchitecting,” to use        January 27–28, 2009 118 of 267  Governor Warsh’s term—of the financial system and the rebuilding of business and household   balance sheets will take a long time, restraining growth in the process   Similar to the “more financial stress” alternative scenario, I think the dysfunction in the   ordinary channels of credit intermediation is likely to linger; and as in the “more cautious   spending” alternative, I think rates of business and household saving could rise significantly and   remain elevated after the recovery takes hold  One Wall Street firm calls this their “frugal future   hypothesis” One of my financial contacts argued that the context of any recovery would be one   of working through structural issues that are deep and wide  The referenced structural issues   include the balance of saving versus consumption, with the obvious implication for consumer   demand   The potential for a longer period of more-intractable disinflation could obviously   complicate progress toward recovery, and this possibility weighs heavily on my assessment of   the risks we face Also, I find it hard to think of an “appropriate” policy that anticipates core   PCE inflation remaining under 1 percent through 2013, as in the Greenbook forecast  Again, of   course, the Greenbook forecast is not conditioned on appropriate policy  I have, therefore,   conditioned my assumption about the path of policy on adequately addressing the risk of further   unwelcome disinflation that threatens deflation  My longer-run outlook, assuming no further   adverse shocks, has inflation returning to a 2 percent trend, and my growth projection converging   to a 2½ percent potential Let me add that I support the subcommittee’s proposal on the long­  term forecast  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  In my view, the worrisome recent   developments in the financial markets, combined with the current self-reinforcing interplay of   bank news, economic data, and deteriorating public confidence, call for another increment of   action in advance of the Administration’s proposals with their inherent unpredictability—that is,   the unpredictability of the political process  I could or I will accept alternative B, but I support   alternative A, which I would characterize as signaling that things are a bit worse, take out some   insurance, and do a little more  I think the characterizations of the state of the economy in   sections 2 and 3 are appropriate I actually, to some extent, supported the use of the word   “sizable,” but I am certainly okay with the change back to “significant” as a safer term  I also   interpret section 3 as saying that at least continued disinflation is a real risk, and I think that is a   realistic statement at this time     I support alternative 1 in section 4 with its action of adding $250 billion to the MBS   program  I am persuaded by the staff argument, which is supported by my own staff, to defer but   keep on the table the introduction of a longer-term Treasury securities purchase program    However, I would tinker a little with the words “prepared to” for reasons somewhat similar to   President Plosser’s I think “prepared to” may convey too much intentionality It could be   interpreted as “absolutely ready but holding off,” or conceivably someone else might interpret it     January 27–28, 2009 193 of 267  as “inclined to but with some hesitancy at this stage”  I think it is, therefore, too ambiguous  I   would prefer signaling that the Committee “holds open the option” of such a program, and I   would prefer those words over something like “still evaluating”  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8688,2009-02-07,LOCKHART," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Can you elaborate on how the   sterilization is likely to be done?  Will there be an expansion of the SFP or will we be issuing our   own bills?  "
8710,2009-03-17,LOCKHART," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Back to Mr Sheets  I’ve followed a few   international liquidity crises over the years, and they often start in strange places, and my   question is Do we need to think about exotic currencies—currencies in which there is not really   a dollar swap or foreign currency swap market that could provide funding, but where the   institution in mind may have pretty sizable book?  The idea would be to try to nip something in   the bud before it gets to a hard currency   Would the design of the heterogeneous portfolios be up to the seller   or up to the FDIC?  There’s a sort of RTC analogue here  In the RTC period, assets were put   together to make the package attractive enough to bid on, knowing there was some terrible stuff,   but also some not-so-bad stuff in it  Who is going to design those portfolios?        March 17–18, 2009 71 of 266  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The time is late, and in the interest of   time and in response to the body language I see around the room, I’m going to limit myself to   talking about the asset-purchase question  I came here favoring growing the balance sheet with   more asset purchases principally because of the deteriorating outlook  A lot of good arguments   have been made on both sides, whether it be Treasuries or an MBS program  I, on balance, favor   the MBS approach for reasons a number of you have articulated, particularly Governor Warsh    But I would like to focus my remarks on a dimension that has been touched on, but perhaps not   explicitly addressed, and that’s the communications challenges  In lots of conversations over the   last few weeks, particularly with directors and so forth, I get the increasing sense that we have   big communication challenges, and they are part of the problem  There’s a lot of confusion and   uncertainty regarding how we’re making our decisions, what comes next, and how it all fits   together as a total policy set   I think we need to consider favoring programs that are already in place  Simplicity, I   think, counts in these circumstances  I would argue that it may be better to err on the side of “no              March 17–18, 2009 106 of 266  new stuff” if we can, to be as concrete as we can, to try to explain the decision framework that   we are using, and to try to repeat a holistic explanation of policy going forward  So I think a   consideration in the decision is the question of communication  President Fisher used the term   “confidence” President Bullard talked about “path”  President Plosser used the word   “uncertainty” This all comes together to me as one more element to take into consideration,   which is How do we communicate it clearly, so the public, particularly the business public,   understands?   Let me think about the question overnight, and I’ll come back with   an answer tomorrow   Thank you, Mr Chairman  On the international side, you talked   about and our focus seems to be on Eastern Europe and the European banks  But I’m hearing a   lot of concern about Mexico, both political meltdown—really serious civil disorder problems—   and, obviously, some economic implications  Do you have any comments on the Mexican   economy?   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me start by congratulating you on   having a highway interchange named after you  I’m sure we all envy you having your own   off-ramp  [Laughter]   Conditions in the Sixth District remain very weak, and our contacts expect worsening   conditions in the near term  Businesses have made significant workforce reductions and tell us   they are prepared to make additional cuts if economic conditions worsen The end of the first   quarter was seen by some as being a key milestone  If business conditions have not improved by   then, they will move further to put their businesses in survival mode, so more layoffs could be   forthcoming in April  All sectors of commercial real estate are under pressure from growing   vacancy rates and upward adjustment of cap rates  I’m concerned that growing problems in   commercial real estate are likely to further complicate efforts to stabilize the banking system and   credit markets   There’s anecdotal evidence of alarm being expressed about and by the local government   sector Some jurisdictions and authorities are pinched not only by falling revenues but also by   borrowing conditions in the municipal finance market  One large city mayor estimated several                 March 17–18, 2009 127 of 266  thousand private sector job losses from projects not helped by the stimulus package that will shut   down in the near term due to financing difficulties   Our directors and their contacts, as well as financial market contacts, are becoming   increasingly vocal over the lack of specificity regarding economic policy and their inability to   understand what we would call our decision rules  A major source of confusion is uncertainty   about what policy actions will come next and under what circumstances expansions of current   policy will be decided   Turning to the national economic conditions in the outlook, the numbers indicate we   remain in serious recession, with most data coming in worse than Atlanta’s already downbeat   expectations If we were to submit a formal forecast for this meeting, we would adjust our   trajectory for the economy downward and push the timing of the beginning of a recovery further   out   As mentioned earlier by Dave Stockton, one positive in the recent data is retail sales   numbers  However, the CFO of the country’s second largest retailer advised a cautious   interpretation of sales numbers Consumer purchases are occurring in an environment of deep   price discounts and may not be a very solid indicator of improving economic health  Also,   retailers are consolidating their inventories as they prepare for store closures   We believe the risks remain to the downside for both economic growth and inflation  In   my conversations this time with a few financial market participants and bankers, there was   acknowledgement of improved conditions in a number of markets, particularly where the Fed   continues to intervene Also, progress of investment-grade corporate funding markets was noted    At the same time, there was sentiment that the Fed’s credit programs may have to stay in place   for quite some time, well into 2010           March 17–18, 2009 128 of 266  On the subject of the housing and home mortgage market, I heard the view that the magic   rate threshold for qualifying mortgage applications volume is 5 percent  When rates drop below   5 percent, refinancing volume especially has picked up markedly   To repeat what I said yesterday, most of the sharpest comments dealt with the perceived   policy ambiguity and the effect of this on markets  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think the case for increased asset   purchases is pretty compelling  It’s the sense of the Committee, and certainly I agree with that    So I have to think through a series of other decisions  The first one has to do with scale, and my   thinking coming in was that the scale needed to be proportionate to the deterioration in the   outlook Speaking at least for myself and the Atlanta analysis, clearly, there has been   deterioration since January, but it’s within the range that I would have assumed at that time was   plausible  So I’m a little concerned about overreacting  When we first got the alternatives,   alternative B was $500 billion, and that, of course, was entirely in mortgage-backed securities   and agency notes Yesterday we learned that the TALF is likely to roll out slowly  That’s   information that, I assume, is not going to be understood by the public  It would probably   undermine the program if we said that we expected that  I had factored the TALF into my sense   of proportional response So I favor the alternatives that are below $1 trillion dollars  I don’t   want to overstate this, but I think we don’t have good guideposts for how to size the action, so I   think it’s reasonable to ask Will the public infer from our actions that we know something that   they don’t, and is this response of over $1 trillion—which will probably get some headlines—   really a signal that things are even worse than they actually are and in that sense could dig us a   little bit deeper?   Regarding timing  if we go with the mortgage-backed securities alternative, I do favor   the views of President Rosengren that there’s a chance of accelerating that and making it have   high impact in the near term  I can support the Treasury idea  But I actually think the central              March 17–18, 2009 207 of 266  question is the choice between Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities  I can support   Treasuries, but my bias really is to favor the mortgage-backed securities option, so that would be   one of the option Bs I like that for its certainty, its impact on housing, and its clarity in   communications As I mentioned yesterday in my comments about communications, certainly   what I’m hearing is that many of our constituencies would prefer simplicity and not a lot of new   programs, so I’m leaning against the Treasury purchases because it adds complicating factors    But if we are going to support the Treasury purchases, I endorse Governor Tarullo’s suggestion   that we explain why we did it very clearly For example, if we are doing it for liquidity reasons,   then we should explain that; if we’re doing it for the purpose of scaling up the balance sheet, we   should explain that; if we believe that there are spillover effects, we should be explicit about that   in our rationale   Regarding statement content, I have some sympathy for the version offered by Presidents   Plosser and Bullard, but I’m not sure we can avoid quantities  I think the logical question that   the press is going to ask, having been conditioned to hearing quantities, is  “How much does this   add up to?”  It’s very hard for us not to provide at least some estimate of that  Conceivably there   is some way of crafting language that would address both the pace of purchases as well as the   ultimate quantity  I don’t know how specific we have to be in the directive to make it a workable   directive So I’d leave that up to the Desk  I’m also okay with toning down “severe   contraction”—that was my original reaction when I read the alternatives a few days ago—to   something that’s not quite as stark as that  Regarding statement structure, I don’t have a strong   feeling I think we have two options  You either have a structure that builds up to the action,   which has been our traditional approach, or the action followed by the rationale  I have a slight   preference for building up to the action, based on Governor Kohn’s comment, namely, what              March 17–18, 2009 208 of 266  happens if we don’t, in fact, have an action  We certainly want to be consistent going forward,   as much as we can, on how these things are put together  So given all of that, where I come out   is in support of alternative B, but, when it comes down to the vote, I will support A, A′, or A plus   or B [laughter], or B′ Yes, I’ll end with a reference to Charlie Brown  You know, sometimes   I’m wishy-washy and sometimes I’m not  My definitive support is for alternative B  Thank you,   Mr Chairman  "
8736,2009-04-28,LOCKHART," Mr Chairman, I agree with the staff assessment that—to use their   words—hints of stabilization in the incoming data and some favorable financial developments   since the time of the March meeting have occurred  But I also agree with their words that the   evidence on this issue is by no means decisive  I see the situation as quite ambiguous   I note a positive turn in business sentiment in my District  I think it is best described as a   waning of extreme pessimism rather than growing optimism  Like President Fisher’s CEO, one   of my directors said that “flat is the new up”  [Laughter] My retail contacts advise that the weak   retail spending numbers of March are more characteristic of what to expect in the second quarter   than the strengths seen in January and February  The nation’s largest home improvement chain   announced that March sales are down sharply year over year, and they are further marking down   their modest sales projections for the balance of 2009   Home sales have shown greater stability—around low levels, of course—in most parts of   the Sixth District and are up year over year in Florida  By most accounts, new home inventories   continue to creep lower  But there is still considerable downward pressure on prices, and   builders do not anticipate any sustained increase in construction activity anytime soon  A large   backlog of foreclosures and other home inventory is likely to enter the pipeline soon  A   comment on condominiums, which represent a significant portion of my District’s real estate   market  They are under increasing pressure That pressure has been exacerbated by the fragile        April 28–29, 2009 62 of 201  financial condition of homeowner associations, further distancing some otherwise creditworthy   buyers from access to adequate credit  In addition, serious concerns continue to be expressed   about commercial real estate One contact said that there is almost no financing available  Even   after accounting for weakening fundamentals, this source indicated that there is a serious lack of   liquidity and predicted that commercial real estate will put major stress on financial institutions    On balance, the attitude that the economy would bump along the bottom for some time is   common among my business contacts and continues to be a factor affecting my outlook   The forecast I submitted is similar in some respects to President Yellen’s  It is similar to   the Greenbook over the balance of the year Although I, too, see a recovery under way toward   the end of the year, I expect that the expansion will be considerably slower than in the   Greenbook In my view, a slow restoration of credit market function, constrained consumer   activity, and lingering economic uncertainty that restrains investment spending are likely to   retard the recovery process   The general perception of improving financial and credit markets presented in the   Greenbook was supported by my financial market contacts  Like the Greenbook, I am hearing   positive reports of improved access to capital markets for investment-grade nonfinancial   corporations, and this has extended down to triple-B firms as well as some improvement in the   high-yield and convertible bond markets  But my contacts continue to describe financial markets   as quite fragile As President Rosengren commented on extensively, the bank stress tests are,   unsurprisingly, seen as a critical event, and opinions on the subject were varied  One contact   predicted that the results are likely to be quite contentious and disruptive  In contrast, another   argued that tough and aggressive tests would be a positive sign that problems are being   confronted Concern was also expressed in some of these conversations about the state of the     April 28–29, 2009 63 of 201  insurance sector The insurance sector is more than triple the size of the investment banking   sector, which in many respects was the source of some of our problems, and the view was   expressed that the sector could deteriorate further if capital restrictions begin to bite   As to the restoration of the financial markets, we did a poll of some of our directors   regarding the TALF, which they said was generating very little interest  They cited a lack of   demand from borrowers, insufficient detail about the program, uncertainty over future business   conditions, and some community banks saying that the minimum of $10 million was too steep to   participate   Regarding the balance of risks, my assessment of the risk to economic growth remains   weighted to the downside However, I have revised my assessment of the risk to inflation to   being broadly balanced Consistent with the ambiguous state of the outlook at this juncture, I   remain concerned about and attentive to deflation risk while recognizing that our various actions   to grow the balance sheet may stoke inflation expectations and bear upside inflation risk  Thank   you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, I am sure that this is covered in   some of the write-ups, but could you walk through how the number 450 billion was selected and   what other numbers were considered?   By emphasizing, as the Chairman just did, the ability to increase,   slow down, extend, and so forth, it sounds to me like a very tactical approach  The directives   that come every six or seven weeks from the Committee, are they a mode of guidance to the   Desk that’s going to be enough for you to interpret how to make those adjustments, or are we   talking about a more frequent consultation with the Committee in order to be able to respond   tactically?           April 28–29, 2009 128 of 201  Thank you, Mr Chairman  It is a challenge to be as succinct as   President Pianalto  B [Laughter] Actually, I am a little bit ambivalent, quite frankly, coming   into this decision As I said yesterday, I think that the economy is in an ambiguous state and   there is a lot of uncertainty  I have sympathy for the arguments that President Yellen made that   alternative A could actually tip the balance to better outcomes and improve on the forecast,   which really isn’t acceptable over the longer term  A negative, which President Fisher   mentioned, is the likelihood that alternative A would be interpreted as closer to deliberate        April 28–29, 2009 143 of 201  monetization So, as I said, I am supporting alternative B, and I favor adopting the language that   helps establish a clearer understanding of policy conditionality over time   I thank Presidents Plosser and Bullard for all their efforts because I think they drove that   point home very strongly  So I strongly support the alternative B language that says that the   Committee is prepared to make further adjustments in timing and overall amounts “as   appropriate, in view of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets”  The   full impact of March’s policy decision on real economic activity hasn’t yet been realized, and   there is fiscal stimulus in train that is yet to be fully reflected  So as many others have stated, I   would like to wait and see how the financial and economic environment evolves  That is it   Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8756,2009-06-03,LOCKHART," Yes, thank you, Mr Chairman  Dave, on the question of risks to   your outlook, there has been a lot of discussion of commercial real estate  Can you give some   sense of how you would quantify any risk to the outlook associated with worse-than-expected   problems in the commercial real estate sector?  "
8776,2009-06-23,LOCKHART," Thank you, Mr Chairman  To continue the grilling of Brian and   Trish, my interpretation in sort of street terms of what you said earlier is that the directive has   been a problem for the Desk for last few weeks  And we’re in somewhat extraordinary times   where you may have been uncomfortable—I’m putting words in your mouth—that you were   making policy as opposed to interpreting the wishes of the Committee  Can you be more explicit   about what you’d like to see in a directive that would work, and yet at the same time deal with   the external communication sensitivities?   Mr Chairman, really a question for you, not for this side of the table    The Treasury proposed that it would have the last call in approving 13(3) authorizations  Have   we developed a view on that and communicated that in any way?        June 23–24, 2009 68 of 261  I’ll help you with your time, Mr Chairman  Everything I believe has   already been said by one person or another   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The PCE energy prices seem to be   coming off in the forecast into 2010, while the oil commodity price continues to rise slightly,   suggesting it’s non-oil energy Can you explain what the thinking is there?   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to add my thanks to those of   President Evans for the improved amplification  I could hear President Plosser here very well    [Laughter]   In the last two weeks, because of the possible gap between reports of increasingly   optimistic sentiment and underlying reality, the Atlanta Bank took great care to collect a lot of   input from directors’ business and financial contacts  Reports from the business community   clearly indicate greater stability That said, the tone of these reports suggests an economy that is   still exceptionally fragile There is not much optimism among my contacts for a strong recovery    Business capital spending is being indefinitely postponed, and there is little appetite for hiring,   even for seasonal or temporary positions One Atlanta director, a partner in a top management                 June 23–24, 2009 122 of 261  consulting firm, stated that they are doing very little growth work and that most of their large   corporate strategy assignments relate to positioning for subdued business conditions for the next   five years In the financial sector, banks are still very cautious in credit extension  C&I loan   demand remains quite soft, and mortgage demand fell sharply when mortgage rates rose above   5 percent   The outlook I submitted is little changed from late April  I expect this will be an   exceptionally slow recovery I find the alternative simulations presented in this meeting’s   Greenbook to be quite pertinent My outlook has elements of the scenarios for both the slower   recovery and labor market damage  In my view, a slow restoration of financial markets will limit   credit availability well into 2010, and the rebuilding of wealth is likely to be spread over several   years These influences will inhibit the usual forces of recovery  The significant reorganization   of the economy could keep the unemployment rate elevated for years into the recovery   As regards prices, the recent rise in oil and some other commodity prices could raise   inflation statistics this summer, but we’ve also seen downward price pressure elsewhere in the   data Overall, I’m in the camp that is not overly concerned about inflation for the medium term    I continue to think the prospect for deflation is roughly balanced against the likelihood that   inflation will accelerate above a rate consistent with price stability  But even if I am somewhat   sanguine about inflation, I acknowledge a high level of uncertainty about the inflation outlook  I   also note that concern about inflation expressed anecdotally on the part of my business contacts   is clearly rising; this concern seems to be connected to apprehension about how the Fed will   manage its balance sheet going forward  As I see it, the context of our policy discussion   involves the potential of a widening separation in public and market sentiment between the   expectation of policy reversal and exit and a more uncertain and fragile underlying reality  I am                     June 23–24, 2009 123 of 261  concerned that too much talk of exit could get ahead of reality  As several said yesterday, this   presents a particularly delicate communication challenge coming out of this meeting  Thank   you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like President Lacker, I favor alternative   B in both substance and wording I think the staff captured my view with their description of   alternative B, which said the slow pace of recovery is largely unavoidable in light of the nature   and severity of the global financial crisis and the time required for healing and other structural   adjustments  I think alternative B also recognizes the tentative nature of improvement in the   economy, so I see it as a “stay the course” policy  As mentioned yesterday, the balance sheet is           June 23–24, 2009 174 of 261  expected to grow to approximately $28 trillion, so I think the playing out of programs as   currently designed should represent sufficient stimulus to sustain the progress we’ve seen   I am sympathetic to the view that was expressed by both Presidents Plosser and Lacker   that if we see better results, we should consider scaling back the LSAP programs  At the same   time, I think it would be a mistake to react too early and strongly to the signs of stabilization and   better financial market conditions  As many said yesterday and today, we have a particularly   subtle communication task coming out of this meeting  I think we need to encourage positive   views that can be self-reinforcing to stabilization and ultimately to recovery  But I also think we   have to present a sober characterization of the state of and outlook for the economy, and we   should be signaling that we’re not withdrawing stimulus and support for the economy at this   time  It’s okay, I believe, to signal that we’re thinking and planning for an eventual exit, but not   initiating an exit Yesterday, I supported—though I didn’t speak for it—the plan presented by   Brian Madigan for the expiration of the facilities, and I agree that the press release should and   does emphasize the conditionality of that plan  I think much of the communication task, as   discussed yesterday afternoon, should be accomplished after today’s statement, for example, in   the Chairman’s Humphrey-Hawkins testimony   On the statement itself, I can support it as it’s presented  In the revised proposal, I   favored B′ before it was eliminated  I think it is continuous with the April statement and gives a   “stay the course” message  As I said earlier, it accurately captures the economic conditions  I   think the inflation language is a logical update to the April language, and since my forecast does   not assume an increase in the policy rate this year or next, I’m comfortable for the time being   with the “extended period” language And finally, I do not support the bracketed statement that   was appended Thank you, Mr Chairman              June 23–24, 2009 175 of 261 "
8802,2009-08-11,LOCKHART," Thank you, Mr Chairman A question for Nathan You know, the   Chinese economy is increasingly a central focus as we evaluate the global economy  And you   referenced the bank lending in the last quarter, which appeared to be directed lending, top down,   telling them to lend  Some years ago there was continuing concern about the banking system in   China being insolvent They seem to have muddled through that, but do we know anything   about the potential of a banking crisis in China that could have been exacerbated by this directed   lending?   Thank you, Mr Chairman  My outlook for the economy has not   changed materially since the last meeting  I think we’re in the beginning stages of what is likely   to be an exceptionally slow recovery In the period since the last FOMC, we engaged our   contacts in the Sixth District and elsewhere around the country on the questions of slack in the   economy, inflationary pressures, the inventory situation, and the state of the real estate sector,   particularly commercial real estate   In residential real estate, we are seeing more stability in sales and prices in our District,   even in the Florida markets  The exception to this improved picture is the market for   condominiums in large urban areas, which remains burdened by oversupply and very slow sales,   due in part to very limited credit availability  The commercial real estate sector is still   deteriorating and poses a threat to recovery in its potential drag on the credit system  Our        August 11–12, 2009 76 of 165  District contacts reported rising vacancy rates across every significant market and property type,   resulting in widespread rent concessions  Financial contacts opined that so far delinquency,   default, and valuation problems have been managed through restructuring but pointed out that   much of the refinancing calendar is ahead   The Southeast has a sizable leisure and hospitality industry, which is suffering from a   slow tourist season Even with pervasive rate concessions, hospitality and resort vacancy rates   are high We asked a number of contacts about inventory levels and the direction of inventories    We got the sense that inventory reduction has a bit further to go before firms align their   inventories-to-sales prospects  Business contacts at all points along the spectrum from materials   manufacturing to retail claim that they are still cutting inventories  Furthermore, based on these   conversations, I doubt that inventories will be replenished to pre-recession levels as the economy   improves  This projection of businesses running on leaner inventories on an extended basis   contributes to my view that the recovery will be exceptionally weak   In the latest round of calls made in preparation for this meeting, we probed contacts about   their perceptions on available production capacity and willingness to rehire in a recovery  We   heard that a large share of what is counted as excess production capacity should not be   considered standing ready to be brought back into service  Contacts expressed unwillingness to   bring previously idled capacity, including permanent hires, back on line without much stronger   buyer commitments and better margins  This suggests much less disinflation potential in a slow-  growth scenario than would otherwise be the case   In this cycle, our financial market contacts exhibited much more confidence and   described an unwinding of the flight to quality based on the view that a catastrophic scenario has   been avoided These contacts reported that they believe markets in general have confidence and,           August 11–12, 2009 77 of 165  more particularly, that the Fed has the tools to engineer an exit strategy as recovery proceeds  A   widely held concern, however, is the timing of exit and the risk of a premature exit  In   preparation for the meeting, we had a long conference call with several representatives of the   American Securitization Forum in an attempt to gauge the rebound of the securitization sector   and its ability to support consumer activity  We talked about the TALF earlier today, and they   said that the TALF had been successful in bringing back the triple-A segment, but they cited a   number of factors that pointed to a protracted period of less securitization  This adds to my view   that consumer spending broadly will be constrained over at least the medium term  I think it’s   plausible that a major shift in household spending appetite is under way  But even if no   structural change in consumer behavior is building, consumer credit markets seem to be weighed   down by a still-compromised securitization process and constraints on credit card terms and   issuance   My view of the outlook is less optimistic than the Greenbook’s baseline scenario  There   are elements of the Greenbook’s “higher saving rate” and “labor market damage” scenarios in   my current thinking about recovery I see an economy burdened by voluntarily restrained and   credit-constrained consumer spending, a still-challenged financial industry that will be slow to   expand credit, weak re-employment prospects, and what we believe is lower growth potential   during a period of necessary structural adjustments  In light of this expected sluggish pace of   recovery, I see the risks to economic growth as still weighted to the downside     My view of inflation risks is roughly balanced  I do not get a sense that inflationary   pressures are on the rise, and I don’t see any indication that businesses and households are acting   on inflation concerns in any way that would suggest that inflation expectations are currently on   the rise That said, in almost every venue I am hearing strong concerns that inflationary        August 11–12, 2009 78 of 165  pressures will develop in the intermediate term as the economy recovers  And to anticipate the   policy discussion just a bit, I don’t think these concerns warrant an immediate policy response,   but they do tell me that our messaging is dealing with challenging crosscurrents and is   particularly crucial at this time  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support the policy described in   alternative B, much for the reasons laid out in the Bluebook and as Brian just explained in his        August 11–12, 2009 121 of 165  lead-in The economic story in my view is unfolding close to my expectations, and negative   deviations from this outlook might justify an increment of stimulus as detailed in alternative A,   but I don’t see such deviations developing quite yet  At the same time, as noted in the earlier go-  round, I view the economy as remaining in a fragile condition, so I think the reduction in   stimulus laid out in alternative C is premature    I support the language in alternative B (revised)  I think it best serves us in remaining   flexible and keeping our options open And I don’t favor the language “prepared to consider” in   alternative B′ In our deliberations, we translated this subtly suggestive language into Southern    In Southern it would come out “fixin’ to ponder” [Laughter] If you detect a little sarcasm in   that, that was my view of the “prepared to consider” language    I do support the extension of TALF I favor this  As I mentioned in my economic go-  round discussion, we had a long conversation with the American Securitization Forum, and the   take-away from that conversation convinced me that the securitization sector is extremely vital to   the financial system  Its recovery is important, and it continues to need help I think it does raise   the question, in terms of exit, of whether we will have to extend the TALF further in order to   continue that support, particularly for CMBS, beyond June 1 of next year  So at this time, I think   it is sensible to extend the TALF  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8829,2009-09-22,LOCKHART," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I had the impression from earlier   conversations we’ve had that, at least at one stage, there were two mechanisms under   consideration, one being the classic corridor system and the other being a mechanism more   centered on interest on reserves, where the interest on reserves would become the policy rate  Is   it a foregone conclusion that we’re going back to a classic corridor system?  The whole   discussion is about the ability to manipulate excess reserves in an interest on reserves regime to a   degree that we could decouple those things  Maybe I’m the one who is unclear, but are we going   back to a classic corridor system?  Is that a foregone conclusion?   I have a question for Nathan regarding the dollar, and it relates to   your tracking the tone of the market over the intermeeting period  Yes, the dollar has stabilized   in the last few days, but two or three weeks ago it was under pretty severe pressure  I know it’s a   tremendous exaggeration, but one begins to think about the dollar in a rout of some kind—the   markets really selling off strongly—and, at least in theory, that could produce some response on         September 22–23, 2009 69 of 212  our part How do you follow and think about the dollar and, as I call it, the tone of the market?   Are you in touch with people in the market, or are we just tracking it more quantitatively?   Thank you, Mr Chairman  First I have just a quick comment to   Dave Stockton Because of our trade policy, chicken entrails could back up in Georgia, and if   you want to change your policy on that, we can help  [Laughter]   Much like the Greenbook, my views have moved in the direction of   greater optimism since the last Committee meeting in August  The incoming data have been a   little stronger than were anticipated then  At this late September juncture, I think the picture can   be characterized as improving, but still with very mixed vital signs, and the outlook is somewhat   more optimistic but tempered by awareness that this is an economy powered by a large number   of government supports  I agree with all who are declaring that a technical recovery is under   way, but it is a tentative recovery, not well established  Even with the improving data, I think   there is substantial uncertainty around the question of whether the recovery has its own legs or is        September 22–23, 2009 73 of 212  propelled by transitory government programs  Governor Tarullo in the last meeting talked about   a relapse scenario I see the economy as still vulnerable to relapse   Over the last two weeks, our Sixth District contacts provided a lot of support for this   view of the current reality Sixth District realtors and homebuilders reported that the first-time   homebuyer subsidy noticeably boosted new home sales and construction of moderately priced   properties The “cash-for-clunkers” program provided a big lift to Southeast auto dealers and cut   deeply into new car inventories In response to the Board’s request, our regional executives   contacted six state budget officials  They told us that the stimulus money, as intended, has   helped support construction activity, but it represents spending that would have been cut or   funded by running down rainy day funds This input supports the view that stimulus spending is   mainly eliminating a negative in the outlook   In this contact cycle involving directors and other business leaders, we tried to probe their   sense of factors critical to transitioning from government support to sustained growth based on   private demand Our business contacts said that the inventory drawdown is slowing but may not   be followed by an increase even as sales increase  As the Chairman pointed out at the last   meeting, in the near term, inventories don’t have to rise to improve economic growth, they just   have to fall more slowly Nonetheless, we’re hearing claims on the part of some businesspeople   of permanent adjustments to inventory requirements and businesses  Apart from a modest rise in   back-to-school spending, general merchandise retailers reported continuing restrained consumer   demand  Transport firms reported very little in the way of increased activity, and the Sixth   District survey of purchasing managers reveals a drop in new orders and production after more   promising numbers in July        September 22–23, 2009 74 of 212  As regards employment, we heard that layoffs have subsided, but there is no indication   yet that firms anticipate hiring  In summary, the nascent optimism expressed by my contacts just   before the last FOMC meeting has been supplanted with unease over the economy as the   influence of public support programs diminishes   We are revising up our third-quarter GDP estimate and are inclined to do the same for the   fourth quarter, but in comparison with the Greenbook, I remain much less bullish about 2010 and   2011 There are reasons at this juncture to question whether the economy will have healed   enough for a significant expansion of private demand  I would cite several factors likely to   weigh on the economy through the medium term  high unemployment, cautious business   investment, diminished consumer finance, the potential drag on the banking system from   commercial real estate, the slow repair of the banking system, and slow-moving adjustments,   such as intersectoral labor movements   Regarding prices, the incoming data show disinflation to be more persistent and more   broad-based than the Atlanta bank put in its last forecast submission  I think these disinflation   trends bear watching, but at the moment, I still judge inflation risks to be roughly balanced   As regards growth, the incoming data have clearly been more positive, and I would judge   the balance of risks to be more balanced than was my view in August  Thank you, Mr   Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like so many others, I’m also going to   support alternative B To me, it’s the stay-the-course alternative at this stage  So many have   said that the recovery is under way but fragile or tentative, so I think it is still appropriate to be   cautious about that And the inflation outlook, in my mind, doesn’t warrant a policy response  I   think there’s a great deal of consensus around the table about the state of the economy and the   outlook, so it strikes me that this is really more about the language in the statement and the way   we communicate with markets and the public, which is, to some degree, more in the realm of   psychology   As I think about that, I certainly believe that paragraph 1 is sufficient to convey an   accurate depiction of the economy as it stands today, and I’m comfortable enough with it  I do   think it’s important to convey a commitment that we are going to stay the course, to follow           September 22–23, 2009 161 of 212  through I think the removal of the “up to” language conveys this I don’t have terribly strong   feelings about it, so I’m certainly not going to argue strongly if the consensus is to keep it  I do   think it’s a small change, but it does help build confidence that we’ll follow through with the   programs that we have in place  At this point, I don’t think we want to suggest an itchy trigger   finger regarding exit   I have a couple of other comments on the suggested language Again, I’m a bit   ambivalent about the inclusion of the word “wide”  I think it could generate a lot of speculation   about what we mean by it, and I think continuing with the language of simply “a range of tools,”   which is a little more measured, is adequate     There are a lot of language revisions already on the table, and it’s going to be difficult to   sort all of them out, so I won’t add to them  But I would make the final comment that the   difference of opinion around the table is more about language than it is about the conditions     And I agree with your comment, Mr Chairman, on the need for a nuanced policy  I’m a little   concerned about a too nuanced statement that tries to capture all of those sentiments  So I tend   to prefer much of what’s on the page now and what’s been proposed along with the removal of   “up to” I think that will convey the necessary continuity and follow-through that we want    Thank you, Mr Chairman   I thought Vice Chairman Dudley laid it out well, and I hadn’t   thought of it so cleanly, but there are essentially three degrees of emphasis here  One is the old   language, I gather, which would have been “all available tools,” then “wide range” is sort of the   middle ground, and “range” is the weakest  Is that the way you thought of it?  So we’re actually   moving from “all available tools” to something else  "
8857,2009-11-03,LOCKHART," This is not on this particular question, but to—is it Chris Burke?  Did   I hear that correctly?   Help me with connecting the dots at a high level here  I took your   overall discussion of the reverse repo market to be sort of discouraging on net—near term at   least—that we have obstacles, various technical challenges that are building up, and that it is far   from certain that this is going to be a large-capacity drainer of excess reserves  Then I look at   the market’s view of this question in exhibit 26, and it appears that they are ranking the reverse   repos as the largest possible drainer of reserves  Are we building here to a disconnect between   the reality of this tool and what the market thinks this tool can do and, therefore, a schism   between public views of our ability to drain and what we can really accomplish?   If we gave you an answer today, how long do you think it would take   you to be in a position to do a large-scale program that approaches that collateral level of   $800 billion?              November 3–4, 2009 27 of 201  This may not be a question for Chris, but is this coming to a question   soon?   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want just to explain how I understand   something and ask the question whether I understand it correctly  It is really a comment in   support of moving quickly, with a sense of urgency, counter to what President Lacker said, on   the reverse repo counterparties and all of the other tools  I think we need to address any   uncertainty about our ability to drain As I understand it, if we are going to make a decision to   tighten or even signal in our statement that we are moving in the direction of tightening through   the rate mechanism, we need to be able to execute an operation to move the federal funds rate,   and that is going to require the draining of lots and lots of reserves   If we find that it is not feasible, realistically, to drain reserves in a time frame that is   going to allow us to execute rate policy, then we are probably opting for an interest on reserves   policy rate that is somewhat independent of the level of excess reserves And if we are going to   opt for that, then we need to begin to educate the market that our implementation of monetary   policy is through interest on reserves  So that is what I am thinking  Tell me what I am missing   or whether I don’t understand something   In the old federal funds rate system, we used to operate with   essentially about $30 billion to $50 billion, did we not, of excess reserves in order to create the   supply to meet the demand that allowed us to hit that?  We are a long way from that, so that            November 3–4, 2009 48 of 201  suggests to me that we are going to have a hybrid system  Is that it?  We bring excess reserves   down by $300 billion or $400 billion and operate in that territory?   Mr Chairman, just to beat a dead horse here, many of us have been   out reassuring the market that we have the tools If there is uncertainty about that, I think we   need to smoke that out and get as clear as we can as fast as we can  I think there is a big sense of   urgency around these issues   That is very helpful to me, just to hear your views on it     November 3–4, 2009 50 of 201  Nathan, aren’t these facilities to four central banks effectively   providing liquidity facilities through the central bank to at least three and maybe four major   Eurodollar markets that would operate just as we did?  They have foreign bank organizations that   can get liquidity in a time of crisis  So South Korea or Thailand or whatever would be going to   market conceivably in one of these places to get their liquidity; is that right?   Lead-off hitter [Laughter]  Singles and doubles, Mr Chairman    Despite better-than-expected economic growth in the third quarter, the sentiment of my Sixth   District directors and business contacts has neither improved nor deteriorated substantially since our   last meeting The current tenor of business activity is flat to moderately more positive, but where it   is more positive, there is uneasiness that improvement may not be sustainable   Several directors reported conversations citing uncertainty about the future policy   environment, including health care policy, as retarding hiring and investment  We also heard   skepticism about the durability of private spending absent stimulus programs  A number of my   contacts said that orders and top-line revenue would have to grow a great deal and be sustained for   many months before new full-time hiring or capital expenditures would be undertaken  Firms   reported that they have ample ability to expand their business with their existing labor force and   temporary labor if needed  However, few expect a significant upturn in orders in the near term                              November 3–4, 2009 65 of 201  Our inquiries about capital expansion got more than a few incredulous looks  Capital spending for   business expansion does not seem to be a realistic consideration for most of our contacts   I continue to hear that small businesses are struggling to find adequate financing to support   any expansion and rehiring  Work done recently by the Atlanta research staff on the makeup of job   losses points to the unusually large concentration of job losses in the small business sector    Through the end of 2008, businesses with 50 or fewer employees accounted for about 45 percent of   net job losses in the recession  Firms of this size accounted for only about 9 percent of job losses in   the 2001 recession  Our contacts also broadly confirm the view that a major commercial real estate   problem is developing  We have the view, along with others, that commercial real estate will have a   sizable downside impact on regional and small banks  I am concerned that the interplay of the   commercial real estate correction and weak job growth due to constrained credit is shaping up to be   a serious headwind   To sum up, anecdotal feedback from our recent contact cycle does not validate any reliable   trend in the stronger GDP numbers and paints a picture of highly cautious and extremely reluctant   business actors  That said, I think it is reasonable to incorporate solid near-term growth in second-  half estimates, but I remain skeptical about the medium term  I remain to the pessimistic side of the   Greenbook forecast, and I am not inclined to make too much of improved recent and near-term   expected data in thinking about exit timing and communication   As regards the inflation outlook, incoming price data suggest a little more disinflationary   pressure than I had assumed in June  In the forecast submitted with this meeting, I marked down   my core inflation projection a little, and I judge the inflation–deflation risks to be roughly balanced   In preparation for this meeting, I and my staff had a number of conversations with financial   market participants  There was uniform satisfaction with the continuing normalization of financial                                   November 3–4, 2009 66 of 201  markets  Contacts expressed more confidence and reported that they believed the markets, in   general, have confidence in the idea that the Fed has the tools to execute an exit strategy  A   universal concern, however, is the strategic approach to and timing of the exit  My contacts see   some risk of a premature exit, a concern I share But what was most notable in my recent   conversations was concern about premature communication of exit intentions and the market   reaction to changes in the Committee’s statement wording  I won’t venture any further into   tomorrow’s discussion  So I will stop there  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Brian, in your discussion of alternative B and the new language that   precedes the “extended period” statement, if I heard you correctly you were saying that you were   proposing to add the new language, but it is not necessarily the sole trigger, and that that is   conveyed in the statement  Is that conveyed by the word “including”?   And it is your sense that adding this new language, which is a lot   more specific as to conditionality, is balanced with the “including” word and others to convey   that it is not necessarily those factors that are going to dictate our decision   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like so many others, I support the policy   choice in alternative B  I interpret this as a stay-the-course option  For the most part, I support the   language in draft alternative B, but I do have some reservations about the changes in paragraph 3   from the September statement   I’m not sure I see the benefit of replacing the assertion that the Committee continues to   anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the fed funds   rate for an extended period with the new statement of low rates of resource utilization, subdued   inflation, and inflation expectations  I think it’s generally understood that the conditionality of our   decisions is based on resource utilization, inflation, and inflation expectations  So I think this could   be interpreted as trying to emphasize something new by changing the language in this way, and I   suspect it could be interpreted as implying increased focus on the unemployment rate, which of   course I’m sympathetic with as a criterion, but we may very well begin to initiate tightening before                  November 3–4, 2009 154 of 201  there’s any substantial improvement in unemployment  So I think this could serve to confuse more   than illuminate So I don’t see a percentage in a lot of forward guidance at this point, and I would   prefer simply to stick with the language that we used in September   I am concerned, based on some of my soundings in the financial markets, that we’re sort of   in a strange loop dilemma We’re not ready to initiate tightening, at least through the policy rate,   but changes in the “extended period” language, including maybe even the words around that   language, depending on how they’re interpreted, could create an unwanted adjustment in rate levels   that would amount to tightening  So I prefer that we start to signal when we’re much closer to   action   As regards the $175 billion agency debt purchases language, I would have the concern that   this could be misinterpreted, but I think the adjustments between the first draft and the draft we have   in front of us adequately explain this as very much a technical matter; so it will avoid   misinterpretation or overinterpretation  So I’m comfortable with that  Thank you, Mr Chairman   I spoke against it  "
8885,2009-12-15,LOCKHART," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, a couple of questions that are   triggered by the slides, but you may want to wait until next month to answer them  Looking at   slide 23, if we wanted to shift this maturity schedule, could we trade within the portfolio to   adjust the way that maturity schedule looks?   A second question, if I may According to slide 30, if I understand it   correctly, a great majority of respondents believe that we would start tightening the fed funds   rate target while we have relatively high levels of excess reserves  How are they thinking and   how are you thinking about how the fed funds rate market works in the condition of high   reserves?   So if we raise the interest rate on excess reserves, the fed funds rate   will follow to an extent   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The sentiment of directors and contacts   in the Sixth District supports a modest recovery scenario  In the most recent cycle of board   meetings, surveys, and calls, I heard views that suggest an improving but still quite fragile   economic reality  We collected a number of comments that represent “color,” and not much that   raised doubts about the modestly better conditions  We heard reports of better retail spending for   appliances and building materials  This was confirmed by last Friday’s retail sales estimate    Retail sales improvement, however, seems to be tied to deep price discounts, and we heard   retailers are not building inventories in anticipation of a sustained spending pickup  We heard   that retailers are prepared to lose sales for lack of in-store inventory   We also heard reports that temporary hiring has increased, and that, too, was reflected in   the most recent employment report for November  Temp agencies told us that they are seeing   growth in higher-level administrative jobs  Anecdotal feedback also supported the story that   President Bullard pointed out—that policy uncertainty about health care, taxes, regulation, and   cap and trade is feeding a very cautious approach to business investment and hiring   The Atlanta Bank’s economic growth and recovery forecast continues to foresee a path to   the downside of the Greenbook outlook, particularly in 2011 and 2012  Notwithstanding some   better-than-expected incoming data, I am holding to the view that there are formidable and very              December 15–16, 2009 57 of 247  likely persistent suppressing factors that will inhibit a buildup of growth momentum  Our   greatest concerns are centered on business investment and the impact of commercial real estate   value contraction on bank credit to smaller businesses, which ultimately affects job growth   We looked more deeply at the inventory and the commercial real estate-related concerns   during the intermeeting period and did not find reason to adjust our forecast assumptions  We   found that, while inventories are lean in a few retail categories, significant excess inventory   remains in many manufacturing categories We also found that there is a strong coincidence of   banks with commercial real estate exposure in excess of three times capital and small business   loan share An implication of the Atlanta Bank’s outlook is very slow progress on   unemployment and underemployment   As regards price stability, I remain of the view that upside inflation risk is not much of a   concern for the near and medium term  I find it hard to pinpoint a source of broad inflationary   pressure and see some indications of disinflation  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B I think it’s   premature to reduce stimulus, and I support retaining the “extended period” language  My   soundings of participants in the financial markets suggest that, whether we like it or not, this   “extended period” language has become a fixation, and it gives us little flexibility until we really   are genuinely ready to signal that we are going to tighten the policy rate  So I don’t see the   benefits at this stage of coming off that language   I also support the inclusion of the language in the final paragraph  I think this language is   a useful reaffirmation of our intent, and I see the inclusion of paragraph 4 as furthering a   communications practice of clarifying various exit questions related to management of the   balance sheet Having said that, if I understood President Yellen’s suggestion, I am sympathetic   to the removal of the TALF sentence, if that was her suggestion, because I see the commercial   real estate problem going forward as possibly requiring continuing use of TALF in support of the   CMBS market   Perhaps it does not require comment, but I will say I am comfortable with the Desk’s   recommendation of an interim policy pending further deliberation starting next month of not   reinvesting proceeds of maturing MBS and agency securities  I also agree with the   recommendation to wait on the decision regarding the Treasury’s portfolio  I’m comfortable   with that because, given the small amount of maturities in the near term, I think these interim     December 15–16, 2009 122 of 247  arrangements will have little effect on the market’s interpretation of our policy direction I think   it’s worth commenting on that because we’re planning next month to discuss the overall exit   policy   I see in January and possibly in subsequent meetings that the Committee is going to have   to take up a number of questions that are quite complex regarding exit implementation—when to   begin active shrinking of the balance sheet, what tools to use, and what proportion and what   sequence or what combination, and how much tactical adjustment is required in response to   developments in the financial markets and the economy  These are going to be very challenging   questions, because there are so many policy variables at play and possible economic states that   we will be dealing with  So I would have been proposing something like the Chairman’s   suggestion Let me just say that I welcome the January session, and I hope we devote a   significant period of time to it   Like President Fisher, I was a bit taken by surprise or flatfooted by the recommendation   on the primary credit rate, and I too would like to hear more discussion on that, and I think   President Rosengren also commented that he had doubts regarding the timing of this, and I share   those doubts as well Thank you, Mr Chairman   This may be too fine a point, but I have a thought about the use of   the phrase “adding to payrolls” In light of the increase of temporary workers, I am wondering if   the business community thinks when they add temps, or they add contract workers, they are                 December 15–16, 2009 142 of 247  adding to payrolls, when what we’re trying to say is they’re not adding permanent hires, which is   the fine distinction   Right But we are getting anecdotal feedback that there’s a sort of   sequence—you add hours, then you add temps, and then ultimately you add permanents  And   we are getting anecdotal feedback that there has been a pickup in temporaries  I just raise it to   make sure we are communicating what we want   Fair enough  "
8913,2010-01-26,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, this question may be more   appropriate for the next discussion, but looking, again, at your last chart, number 30, first to   make sure I understand what this is telling me—if we had set the interest rate on excess reserves   at 200 basis points and had $1 trillion of excess reserves, then fed funds would likely trade   between 20 and 50 basis points below the interest rate on excess reserves  Is that right?    Preserving, in effect, the kind of situation we have today  And   assuming for the moment that we were at the stage where we were trying to implement a corridor   system and the fed funds rate target would be above the interest rate on excess reserves, then the   gap between where fed funds were trading and where the target would be could be 75 basis   points or more conceivably, worst case  Is that a credibility problem?  If that situation persisted,   how would the market react to a chronic situation of setting a target and being that much off the   target?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the original memo I thought you also   proposed—maybe I just missed this in your commentary—that we withdraw the “renewable on   request” clause  Is that correct?    Wouldn’t keeping the “renewable on request” clause conceivably   have the effect of treating this stigma problem?  It is “no questions asked”    The way you proposed this as an incremental step—I guess to see if   there is some adverse reaction that we didn’t anticipate before probably going back to the full   100 basis point spread—what adverse reaction are we concerned about?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As regards the primary credit rate, I, too,   support this  I think it’s either a partial or a final normalization  We’ll figure that out as we go   forward  I think the “when” question probably should be after your communication in February,   more or less coincident with the TAF announcement  There is a communications challenge here,   and we have to ensure that this is not interpreted as some kind of a signal regarding the policy   rate, but just a technical adjustment  I believe that can easily be done, and the market will   acknowledge that  As President Yellen said, to avoid any misinterpretation, I will just say that it   is best that there be no dissents from any of the Reserve Banks, that we basically all do this   together and put the requests in together  So I support the primary credit rate recommendation   As it regards the TAF, I also support those recommendations  I think they are consistent   with eliminating the other credit and liquidity facilities  I would comment that it’s good that this,   as I understand it, has been codified in Regulation A and, therefore, remains on the books so that   we can bring it back if economic conditions require that  Just an interesting point—not a point   that has any particular policy relevance, but it was pointed out to me when my staff and I were   discussing this—this is actually retiring the third discount window because the Federal Home   Loan Bank lending was a second discount window in the process   Turning to the exit discussion, I am going to premise it by saying that this is a   preliminary discussion, so I reserve the right to change my mind after more discussion and   hearing more about it  Near term, I would focus on redemptions only  I think we do not want to   take chances with any interpretations that are going to create an effect in market rates  I think   January 26–27, 2010 72 of 260    that a redemptions-only policy could last for all of this year, conceivably even longer  I am open   to sales when the market appears that it can absorb the sales, but I do not think that this should be   signaled near term  I kind of like President Kocherlakota’s approach of small, steady, and well-  communicated sales when that time comes   Regarding question 2, I think the policy should be to redeem all agencies and MBS and   some Treasuries  As I’m thinking about it, we have a longer-term objective, and that is to   change a proportion of MBS to Treasuries in whatever we consider to be the year in which that is   adjudged  So it seems to me that we have to be trying to manage that proportion while, at the   same time, we are reducing the balance sheet  That is the way I would think of that question   Regarding sequencing, this is the key question, and I see arguments on both sides of ex   ante and ex post, and I really don’t have a strong conviction yet  There certainly is a lot of   uncertainty about our ability to control the federal funds rate when we get around to rate   tightening, and some would argue that it may not even be necessary to control the fed funds rate    If I had to decide today, I would favor draining relatively close to a point of actually taking a rate   action, but some draining in advance, recognizing that it’s very likely going to tighten financial   conditions at the longer end of the yield curve  But I do think it reduces uncertainty and just   raises the probability that, if we are dependent on the fed funds rate or we want to affect the fed   funds rate, we will be successful at doing so  And I do think we have maybe some time in the   course of this year to explore this question a little further   As regards the longer run, question 5, I prefer moving as close as possible back to   previous practice, which would be all Treasuries across the maturity spectrum  I’m favoring a   corridor system  It may be an open question when we get to that point of whether we are   focusing on monitoring or targeting a market rate, but I do think a market rate within the corridor   January 26–27, 2010 73 of 260    is clearly going to be a centerpiece of how we think about monetary policy  Again, I think we   have some time to consider this further  My instincts here are to prefer the tried and true if we   can get there, and that’s something like a corridor system with the fed funds rate as the market   rate in between  Thank you, Mr Chairman      Thank you, Mr Chairman  In my remarks today, I would like to   press two themes  first, the tentative nature, the fragility, of the recovery and the need to be   patient with accommodation and, second, the gap that we are picking up in the Sixth District   between anecdotal intelligence and the Greenbook outlook and even some data   Our contacts in the Sixth District over the last two weeks seem more optimistic about the   state of the economy  However, there is still much uncertainty about the medium-term picture,   and this is contributing to more restraint than one would ordinarily expect as the economy   emerges from a deep recession  Retailers reported that they are not stocking ahead of sales—that   is, in anticipation of improved sales numbers—except where there is no choice in the case of   seasonal goods or imports  The approach to inventory management up and down the production   and supply chain is exceptionally cautious  We heard that the posture of retailers is that missed   sales opportunities are an acceptable cost of doing business in the current economic climate  I   continue to hear reports of firms reorganizing their workforce to be more cost effective, and this   includes more downsizing  There is still little appetite to add permanent staff  I am also hearing   that there is considerable interest among stronger companies in cost-reducing M&A activity that   January 26–27, 2010 124 of 260    would consolidate operations in an industry and improve competitive positions  I hear little   enthusiasm for business expansion requiring new capital expenditure, a view that was confirmed   by the recent cap-ex survey we conducted  Maintenance cap-ex that can’t be postponed   dominates business investment spending   As regards the outlook, I expect real GDP growth to moderate significantly this quarter   and remain on a path under the Greenbook baseline over the two-year forecast period  My   outlook assumes the continued significant deleveraging of businesses and consumers  I think   firms dependent on bank credit are unlikely to have their credit demands fully met, and in an   environment of weakened balance sheets, soft labor markets, and exceptionally heightened   economic and policy uncertainty, many simply do not have the appetite for more debt  A key   difference between Atlanta’s updated forecast and the Greenbook is the outlook for business   investment  I am projecting a very modest trajectory for new fixed capital spending this year and   next   Now, I have to acknowledge some upside risks to the forecast I submitted  The pace of   spending and production in the fourth quarter suggests that real growth could be relatively strong   this year and next  But this is not what the ground-level economic intelligence I gathered in   preparation for this meeting suggests  I am still getting a sense of a lot of fragility in the   recovery with continuing downside risks  So as I total up the risks to economic growth today, I   judge them to be roughly balanced   As regards inflation, risks exist on both sides of the forecast, and uncertainty remains   high  We heard from contacts that price pressures are influencing business decisions in   companies with commodity exposure  We also heard that, while pricing power of businesses   isn’t strengthening, price discounting is less intense than at the time of the December meeting   January 26–27, 2010 125 of 260    Overall I acknowledge the improving data, and like just about everyone else, I have   raised my growth forecast from where it was in October  But the private sector still faces   considerable impediments on the path toward a full recovery, and those impediments continue to   have a significant weight on my expectations for the economy over the forecast period  Thank   you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support the language and the policy   prescription in alternative B  I also support maintaining the wording “purchases of securities” in   paragraph 3, as opposed to “holdings”  Governor Kohn made the simple statement, “We are still   purchasing,” and it seems to me that we change that language when we are no longer purchasing    I will point out that I don’t believe the last sentence in that paragraph is a stand-alone sentence; I   think it is connected to the previous sentence  It says, “We are slowing the pace of purchases”    So I see a consistency between those two  I also think that shifting it would endanger the rate   curve accommodation and the stability that supports the recovery  And since the existing word   “purchases” seems to be well understood by the market and conforms to my preferred policy   path, I prefer leaving it in place  Thank you, Mr Chairman   "
8938,2010-03-16,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Can you offer an explanation of the   tightening of the gap we’ve seen just in the last few days between the fed funds rate and IOER   rate?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  This is, of course, our first one-day   meeting in a long time, and the premium is on brevity  I was reminded of this on Sunday when I   March 16, 2010 46 of 146    was driving to the bank to do my final preparations, listening to Garrison Keillor’s “Prairie   Home Companion”  He was reciting pearls of cowboy wisdom—I would think my western   colleagues would know this—including “Never pass up an opportunity to remain silent”    [Laughter]    Actually, I do have something to say  In our conversations with   directors over the past two weeks, the most common characterization of the economy in the Sixth   District was fragile  We detected some improving optimism, but this optimism is tempered by   concern and uncertainty about top-line prospects, policy coming out of the Congress, worsening   problems of state and local government, and the commercial real estate exposure to the banking   sector   The Sixth District’s outlook narrative is broadly consistent with the Greenbook, but   Atlanta’s forecast remains weaker than the Greenbook, stemming in large part from our   assumption of a slower pace of business investment  Over the last two weeks, we focused our   inquiries to directors and their contacts on this assumption  We heard that inventories are being   managed to unusually lean levels, and businesses seem committed to tighter inventory ratios on   an indefinite basis, in some cases even at the expense of sales  We also heard a good deal about   advancements in just-in-time supply capability on the part of most domestic and foreign   suppliers  This feedback casts some doubt on the prospects for much near-term GDP   contribution from inventory replenishment  We also detected from our Sixth District contacts   very restrained intention to invest in equipment and software or nonresidential structures beyond   maintenance levels  This anecdotal feedback produces some cautious skepticism regarding the   Greenbook forecast of strong economic growth and expenditure on equipment and software  Our   March 16, 2010 47 of 146    contacts also conveyed a strong hesitance to hire, and their opinion was that, where investment is   occurring, it is labor-replacing  One contact also noted the renewal of offshoring activity  We   heard through directors that many business people seem to be talking about potential inflation,   but few appear to be acting on this concern  There is a widespread assessment that pricing power   remains very weak   Regarding inflation, it’s hard for me to summon much concern about inflation in the   immediate future  Almost all measures of core inflation show indications of disinflation, and   inflation expectations continue to strike me as stable   Finally, I see the growth risks as pretty balanced  Not one Atlanta or Branch director   expressed the opinion that growth in their businesses would be slower in the next six months   versus the past six months  At the same time, as I noted, they characterize the economy as   extremely fragile and the recovery as tentative and held back by uncertainties  These reports   capture what I perceive to be an encouraging but inconclusive real economy picture at this   juncture  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  In my remarks   in the economy go-round, I highlighted some differences, and some others around the table did,   in my sense of the economy and outlook versus what is in alternative B and in the Greenbook,   but those differences aren’t large enough for me to take issue with the language  So I’m okay   with the language in the first paragraph   I see little value added in the bracketed language in paragraph 2  We already have the   conditionality statement at the end of paragraph 3 that the Fed is monitoring risks to price   stability, etc, and will take appropriate actions based on revisions to the outlook  So this   statement seems to me to be quite balanced and appropriate   I favor keeping the “exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended   period” language  I don’t see the economic case for changing the language at this time  I think   changing to “for some time” will be interpreted as a signal that tightening is imminent, probably   in the next three meetings, which I’m not prepared to support quite yet  So it’s obvious that I   don’t support the inclusion of the bracketed language in alternative C of “at least through the end   of the second quarter”  I think this is too short a time frame and too strong a commitment   Regarding the language in alternative C and C′ that describes the sequencing of events in   draining reserves and raising interest rates, I think that, once agreed to by the Committee, this   would provide useful information to the public about the exit strategy  However, I think this   March 16, 2010 107 of 146    information is better explained in testimony, speeches, and press conferences where it can be   carefully framed  My impression from feedback received from market contacts is that this   approach has been fairly effective in raising public understanding of the Committee’s thinking   about the exit strategy  Again, the inclusion of such an explanation could be interpreted as a   prelude to an earlier move of the policy rate than many on the Committee may be contemplating   Finally, alternative A lays out a recommendation for additional MBS purchases, and,   while I don’t support such an action today, it does raise the question of what we would do if our   forecasts turn out to be too optimistic and warrant further accommodation because of a double   dip developing or something like that  So I’d like to see some contingency discussion about   policy options if the economy appears to be dangerously weak  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8962,2010-04-27,LOCKHART,"  Brian, on the reverse repo report, we have made progress with the   agency MBS as collateral  But the primary collateral will continue to be Treasuries, is that   correct?    But it’s conceivable that, as we approach draining, we would have a   tradeoff between the use of Treasuries and a fairly substantial initial portfolio of MBS    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me add to everyone else’s praise of   the staff and thanks for the memo that framed a complex subject very well   First, I’d like to weigh in in support of what President Rosengren said  I’m trying to   frame my thinking by, first, starting with the end goal, which, I think, is the achievement of the   mandates and nurturing a positive path for the economy, not, strictly speaking, the balance sheet   size   Second, preliminary to commenting on the specific issues, I think we have to keep in   mind a context here  The first context is the state of the economy as it is today, which we will   discuss later  But also, as others have commented, we are in new territory regarding monetary   policy, and a lot is not known or understood  We have a lot to learn, such as, the market reaction   to monetary policy actions taken prior to changes in interest rates, the behavior of the fed funds   rate in the presence of high reserves, the ability to use the interest on reserves as the policy rate,   the effectiveness of reverse repos and term deposits, and the optimal balance sheet size  The   point is that there are simply a lot of things that we’re going to learn along the way, and I think   the best approach is to recognize what we don’t know and to maximize flexibility through the   process, and not to jump to what I would consider less reversible measures before we have   clarity, that is, I’d take an approach that takes a step and assesses, and then takes another step   and assesses   That said, the approach that I would take has elements of 2 through 4, perhaps even 1   through 4  I would not initiate sales immediately or early  I would do that after a conscious   decision to tighten, which, in my mind, is not necessarily a rate move but is the commencement   April 27–28, 2010 43 of 206                   of draining, and conceivably the dropping of language  I would not redeem Treasuries  I would   reinvest them biased toward bills  I see a relatively small gain from the redeeming of Treasuries   in terms of the reduction of the balance sheet  I think there is something to be said for preserving   ammunition for the reverse repo activities   And I think I’d like to avoid the later need to   purchase Treasuries to fill in after we have sold them or redeemed them early in the process  I   see sales as, in effect, a permanent step in reduction of the balance sheet, and I would sequence   things to let the impermanent measures precede the permanent, meaning the use of reverse repos   and term deposits  Then, as we know better the optimal size of the balance sheet, the success of   the draining tools, and what’s needed to affect the fed funds rate, we could begin to let the   permanent measure, which would be the asset sales, take over for the impermanent measures   Regarding communications, I would communicate that the sales program is conditional,   and I would accelerate it if market conditions allow  I favor an announced program, in effect a   kind of reverse of the LSAP program that communicates that it is conditional, as in option 3    And I am open to the reverse taper idea in option 4 that basically communicates a clear   framework that, again, is qualified as being conditional on the course of the economy and market   conditions  Those are my thoughts, Mr Chairman  Thank you very much    Withdrawn    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Business contacts and directors in the   Sixth District are a bit more positive and optimistic about the economy than they were six weeks   ago  Sales growth is reported in a number of sectors, including retail, transportation services,   and manufacturing  Retailers in my District, including one very large national retailer, explained   the spurt in consumer activity as highly value-focused and responsive to aggressive discounting   and incentives  Construction activity continues to be subdued in both residential and   nonresidential categories, and, contrary to President Plosser’s anecdote, one national   homebuilder I spoke to reported that, following a very strong March in terms of sales, April was   shaping up to be very weak   While acknowledging some encouraging developments, most of my contacts across the   Southeast viewed the signs of improvement as inconclusive  They continue to temper greater   optimism with a cautious approach to hiring and business spending  Businesses continue to   pursue productivity enhancements in their spending on equipment and software  In several   conversations, we heard that investment spending is either mandatory for replacement and   maintenance, or aimed at labor-saving efficiencies  We heard for the most part continuing   reluctance to hire permanent employees  Our contacts in the temporary services business   reported growing activity, and we also heard opinions that large firms have renewed offshoring   activity   Banks in the Sixth District continue to struggle to varying degrees with problems related   to real estate loans The position of smaller banks is more tenuous than that of regional banks    The wave of small bank failures will persist through 2010, while some regional banks are   showing signs of stabilizing  Anecdotal input from borrowers suggests somewhat stronger   appetite on the part of District banks for C&I lending  One midsized telecommunications   April 27–28, 2010 98 of 206                   company reported a marked improvement in bank posture toward lending for expansion  There   seems to be lots of variation by industry  Our survey work found no small manufacturing   companies denied credit, but this was not true for construction and retail  We also heard reports   from a variety of sources that investor funds are active in making a market for troubled bank   assets, including real estate, providing a floor for valuations   Regarding the national economy, stronger incoming data has led us to mark up our   economic growth forecast marginally higher than our January submission  That said, our   forecast projects more modest growth than the Greenbook baseline, particularly in 2011 and   2012  We see less desire on the part of firms to invest for growth or expand inventory  We also   take the view that the recent strength in consumer spending won’t be sustained  We see a slower   pace of reduction of unemployment weighing on household spending  Our outlook for   unemployment is worse than the Greenbook’s because of firms’ persistent caution in hiring full-  time US employees  We’ve assumed a little more productivity growth and a lot less job   creation in comparison to the Greenbook   Regarding inflation, the incoming retail price data argue persuasively that disinflation is   still occurring and more so than we anticipated in January  As a consequence, we have marked   down our near-term outlook for core inflation   I see the balance of risks for economic growth biased to the upside  That is to say, I think   there is a greater chance I’m proven wrong by stronger growth than by weaker growth    Manufacturing activity is quite strong, and consumer activity so far has exceeded my   expectations  So it’s possible that underlying consumer demand is more sustainable than I am   forecasting  I continue to see the risks to our inflation forecast as broadly balanced  Our   business contacts frequently express anxiousness about the possibility of higher inflation down   April 27–28, 2010 99 of 206                   the road, but we do not get a sense that many are acting on this concern, and expectations seem   to be well anchored for now  In summary, the recovery, in my view, is immature and has not yet   achieved a solid foundation  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  My   interpretation of Bill English’s very good summary and analysis of the market reaction to   alternatives is that language changes today equal tightening itself, not preparation for tightening    And I believe the economic recovery is too tentative to move away from the current   accommodative position, so I continue to believe we’re well served by the “extended period”   language  I’m also satisfied with the description of economic conditions in alternative B   Regarding the Treasury reinvestment options in paragraph 4, I take it that the   recommendation to postpone that for further study and analysis, in my mind, takes paragraph 4   off the table, which I agree with  But for what it’s worth, I would have supported, and do   support, the status quo of reinvesting maturing Treasury securities, and I’m not in favor of   allowing Treasuries to roll off  I think the impact would be modest, and the gains would not be   substantial  I would have also recommended that it’s better to communicate the reinvestment   strategy in the minutes or the directive, than to elevate that discussion essentially to the policy   levels reflected in the statement  Having said that, I’m flexible about addressing redemptions or   asset sales in the statement  But, considering my assessment of the current state of the economy   and outlook and the sobering issues of financial stability risk that the Vice Chairman, among   others example, discussed regarding the contagion risk from Greece, at this meeting, in this   statement, I prefer a plain vanilla approach  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8986,2010-05-09,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  When we put the swap lines in place last   year or the year before, there were questions at that time about what the status of the dollar   reserves was in the ECB countries, and why would they not use those reserves  As I recall, the   answer was that they simply wanted a supplemental capability and that they were protective of   their reserve positions  Do we know the status of their reserve positions today?  And what   likelihood is there that they would actually draw down their reserves to provide some of this   liquidity?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, support giving you the authority to   agree with the Europeans to reinstate the swap lines  Michelle Smith actually captured one of   my sentiments, and that is that we should do what’s necessary to combat this within the   European banking sector, trying to keep it from having a contagion effect and hitting us here in   the United States  I think the contagion risk is real, and it is, as Don said, not inconceivable that   it beats a path to the United States, and we all know that the result would be a possibly severe   adjustment in the United States at a very delicate time  So, in weighing the political risks versus   doing the right thing economically, I think we should subordinate the political considerations to   the economic intervention   May 9, 2010 33 of 42             I agree with all the commentary on transparency  This is a situation where we should lay   out all the information necessary in order to try to keep the discussion of it at a serious level as   opposed to the kind of discussion we’ve seen in the last year or so in the political circles  Those   are my thoughts  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
9012,2010-06-22,LOCKHART,"  Shifting to the time deposit trial, do you have a sense, when we   really do this at scale, of what will happen to the rate that clears the market?    Just to clarify, if you think in terms of a general market observer  If   you do the swaps, the balance sheet stays the same; if you follow Jeff’s provision, the balance   sheet shrinks  And the interpretation of that is what we are debating, right?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I line up with President Rosengren and   with the gist of what Governor Kohn said  First, I think we have two questions  a direction of   policy question, and a timing question  I think there has been quite remarkable change since the   last meeting—risk is higher, and uncertainty is a whole lot greater  So, from a timing point of   view, I would do nothing at this meeting that risks misinterpretation   I tend to look at these questions in a risk–reward sense  I do not see the great reward in   acting at this meeting on any of the moving parts of the policy direction  I do see a risk not only   of market misinterpretation, but, depending on the compounding effects of conditions that   develop over the next few weeks, also of conceivably a policy error of some kind  Directionally,   then, I line up pretty much with what Governor Kohn just said—to shorten the maturities using   option 2 or, conceivably, option 3  I think that decision can be made at a later date  Because it is   a relatively small sum and it, in effect, will be interpreted as preserving the status quo, I would   favor the coupon swaps idea  I continue to favor sales after tightening  And finally, at least as   June 22–23, 2010 36 of 213             I’m thinking of it at this point, I see tightening as multi-modal  We’ve talked about the   tightening effects of a number of different possible actions, but I see it as one decision that   comes at a particular time, and I would not want to risk the possibility that something that we do   not think is tightening is interpreted by the market as tightening    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Looking at exhibit 14, I want to ask a   sort of qualitative question, and that is  In summary, how would you characterize our grasp of   our system’s exposure, and I mean not only direct exposure, which is pretty well measured here,   but also indirect, counterparty kinds of exposures, which, I guess, as of now we don’t fully   understand because the stress test results are not known  Contrast that, if you would, to the run-  up to the seizing up of markets in September 2008   June 22–23, 2010 73 of 213              Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, I’ll talk about feedback from   contacts in the Sixth District  They have become more reserved in their optimism, less   unambiguously confident that the recovery will continue, as the events and risk factors that   accumulated since the last meeting have made business contacts “more pensive,” as described by   June 22–23, 2010 74 of 213             one of our directors  Among the accumulated events causing this reaction is the Gulf oil spill    Because its direct effects are most felt in my District, I’d like to spend a couple of minutes   commenting on the oil spill  The direct effects of the spill on the Sixth District economy are, so   far, quite modest  About 130,000 jobs, not including those in exploration and drilling, are   directly at risk, mostly in areas connected with commercial fishing, recreation, and tourism; then,   ultimately, there will be some at risk in drilling and exploration  In many instances, direct costs   have been temporarily offset by cleanup spending and compensation by British Petroleum    We’re closely watching port activity, but to date the effect on ports in the northwest Gulf area   has been negligible   Aside from the angst that results from the environmental effects of the spill and the   modest economic effect so far, there is concern that hurricane season will bring a storm that   spreads the physical problem in unpredictable ways  For example, contacts in the power industry   are concerned about potential problems for upstream power-generating facilities that use near-  coast river water for cooling  So far, however, there have been no power disruptions   Deepwater drilling will be affected so long as the moratorium continues  The estimates   of job losses directly resulting from the moratorium range from 20,000 to 50,000 over the next   12 months  Contacts in Louisiana expressed concern in recent board meetings about the longer-  term costs of reduced drilling activity  Given that the physical capital—rigs and associated   equipment—that’s used in drilling operations is mobile and scarce, there is much concern that it   will be deployed elsewhere in the world and that the energy industry and the region will be   permanently affected   Although the measurable economic impact so far is limited, this episode is weighing   heavily on the attitudes of households and businesses in the Gulf region and, I would suspect,   June 22–23, 2010 75 of 213             with the American public more broadly  I think uncertainty about the duration and extent of this   growing environmental tragedy is contributing to what one of my directors called “an attitude of   cautious pessimism”  We have a team in our research department that’s dedicated to following   the oil spill and its effects, and, if it’s appropriate, in future meetings I’ll report to the Committee   on their findings   Before turning to the national economy and forecast, let me add a few other pieces of   feedback from our recent soundings in the District  The transportation and logistics sector is   seeing exceptionally strong demand  Because of large reductions of capacity during the   recession, the increased demand is causing transport bottlenecks and giving service providers   pricing power  One contact believes wholesalers and retailers are using transport as a substitute   for building inventories—that is, requiring more frequent and smaller lot shipments  The CEO   of a commercial airline reported a very strong resurgence of business travel, up an estimated   60 percent from a year ago  Almost all our corporate directors reported strong cash   accumulation, and this was confirmed by bank directors  Loan demand, however, remains very   weak  Finally, at the May meeting of our Real Estate Advisory Council, members warned   against becoming complacent about problems in the commercial real estate sector  They felt the   problem is not receiving sufficient attention, because the bulk of property loans has not yet come   due   Turning to the national economy and the outlook, my reading of the national economic   situation is that recovery continues, but incoming data are quite mixed, and potentially transitory   sources of strength have not yet evolved to broad-based and sustainable final demand  My sense   is that the economy is moving through an ambiguous phase, and visibility has shortened due to   the sovereign debt problems and the banking situation in Europe, softer consumer numbers, and   June 22–23, 2010 76 of 213             a stall—admittedly, only one month’s data—in private job creation  My previous forecasts have   been somewhat less optimistic than the then-Greenbook and the central tendency of the   Committee  I’ve pushed up my estimate for second quarter growth, but otherwise have not   changed my outlook from the last meeting  My forecast now is close to the recent Tealbook for   this year and next   Finally, as regards the balance of risks at this juncture, I have shifted from one of the one   or two of us who weighted the risk to the upside at the last meeting and now I see it as balanced,   so I’m directionally similar to the majority of the Committee  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support the policy of alternative B and   most of the language  I do want to point out a slight concern—it may not amount to much  In   the first paragraph of alternative B, it reads that, “Economic activity has continued to   strengthen,” and I wonder whether there will be some inconsistency in the interpretation of the   minutes with that word “strengthen”  One slight change could be to say that “the economic   recovery continues to proceed,” which avoids the risk that people will think there was an   inconsistency between the statement and the minutes  I think it’s particularly important at this   juncture that the statement and the minutes align well, because the market is, in all likelihood,   June 22–23, 2010 148 of 213             going to react to the minutes  The results of the forecast, as well as the tone of the meeting,   could evoke quite a response, and it’s important that we make sure there’s consistency   I favor the approval of the coupon swaps and the inclusion of it in the directive as   proposed   And, finally, I’d propose that we delay the statement by half an hour and cite the World   Cup as our excuse   I think this will add to the prestige of the Fed [laughter] and will, on a global   basis, add to the credibility of our institution and have very positive effects on the efficacy of   monetary policy going forward  Let the transcript read that I’m kidding  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    I basically proposed what you just said, and that is the recovery   continues to proceed or is proceeding  So I favor that  "
9037,2010-08-10,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a question for Larry  I thought it   was interesting that you laid out a sort of dichotomous view of the consumer; that is, the   consumer could gain confidence if employment continues to improve, and that would play   through to spending, or the consumer could be on a continued deleveraging track trying to raise   saving, and that would play through to weakness  My question is  What tools do we have to dig   deeper to try to get a sense of which way that arrow is actually going to go?  It strikes me as   being one of the key swing factors in our outlook, and it’s frustrating not to have much more of a   profound sense of what really is happening    Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, let me thank President Lacker for   educating us on the peanut market  I have often maintained that if there’s such a thing as   reincarnation, I’d like to be reincarnated as a Smithfield pig—you have a very short life, but you   get to eat peanuts the entire time   August 10, 2010 45 of 160             Many around the table have already summarized the situation we seem to be in, with   momentum slowing, economic growth decelerating as we come out of the recession, and the   uncertainty and caution that seem to have increased and that affect both consumer and business   spending  I agree with these summaries, particularly President Plosser’s excellent survey,   indicating that the outlook remains one of very modest but continuing economic growth and slow   private job creation   What I’d like to do with my time is devote my comments to some of the anecdotal input   we’re getting from our region  It helps me, at least, assess the nature of the problem we’re   dealing with and the slowdown we’re seeing, and it gives a little bit of texture  It also helps me   supplement the lag and the revisions that we see in the data, which could be problematic if we’re   dealing with quickly changing circumstances   The sentiment of our directors and other business contacts is a little more downbeat than   it was a few weeks ago  Orders have leveled off across a range of industries, and expectations   for growth for the coming six months have shifted from increasing to flat  Interestingly, the   transportation sector remains very strong, and the interpretation we are hearing is that businesses   are attempting to manage their strong aversion to holding inventories with more frequent   shipments and more just-in-time kind of activity  In some instances, transportation surcharges   have been levied, and there’s growing concern that transportation bottlenecks could become a   serious problem if additional capacity in the industry isn’t brought online  Elsewhere, capacity   problems do not appear to be an issue, and firms see pricing power as very limited  The demand   for new capital goods remains primarily limited to the replacement of worn-out equipment,   upgrades to computers and software, and certain other labor- and energy-saving technologies   One director said that the decision to replace occurs when the duct tape starts to fall off    August 10, 2010 46 of 160             Otherwise, plans for capital expansion, aside from the transportation sector, appear to us to be   almost nonexistent   Labor markets in the District are soft  Firms are still exceptionally resistant to bringing   on permanent hires  One major employer in the District has turned to relabeling their temp   workers as a “contingent workforce,” an indication that firms may view their relationship with   temporary workers as a more permanent arrangement   Housing markets have deteriorated a little in the District, and we anticipate that the   inventory of unsold homes will grow as some of the governmental loss-mitigation programs   wind down  Substantial downward pressure on home prices is not assumed in my baseline   forecast, but it is a bigger risk factor today than it was at the last FOMC meeting   At the last meeting, I gave you some sense of the oil spill impacts, and I’ll do that   probably at this meeting, but only at this meeting  Again, it’s the best news I’ve had—no oil has   flowed into the Gulf for almost four weeks  Efforts to seal the well permanently appear to have   worked, so very little crude can be found at sea, and there are no reports of crude on any of the   Gulf beaches  Of course, the long-term ecological impact isn’t known  But, in terms of   economic damage caused by the spill, the worst appears to be behind us  Interestingly, one of   our directors, who represents a large home improvement retailer, said that just after the well was   capped they had one of their strongest weekends of sales  That suggests that there is a   connection between these kinds of generic bad news events and consumer attitudes  Losses   experienced in the Gulf Coast tourist areas appear to be largely offset by gains elsewhere in the   southeast  So my contacts along Florida’s east coast reported increases in activity, as well as in   lake and mountain destinations in the Sixth District   August 10, 2010 47 of 160             Because we haven’t seen disruptions in the energy or transportation sectors from the oil   spill, and because of the limited size of the affected Gulf economic footprint, we do not see the   oil spill having a significant impact on the national outlook  I should mention, however, that the   effect of the deepwater drilling moratorium remains a major uncertainty on a regional basis, and   there will likely be jobs lost in this sector  But, again, the long-term effect on US energy   production does not appear to be significant   My outlook really hasn’t changed a great deal  Our directors essentially advise, “Don’t   panic, and stay the course”  They are not overreacting, as line businesspeople, to what they are   seeing in the way of a slowdown   Turning to the banking sector, credit demand remains quite weak  Large firms seem   capable of funding their limited demand for new capital expenditure out of cash  Small business   lending has picked up a little, according to one source that specializes in small business surveys    But, generally, there’s a view that credit remains constrained for all but the strongest borrowers    I would say, however, that the results of our July small business credit survey indicates that, of   the 37 percent of the small businesses that reported seeking credit in the last quarter, more than   half—60 percent—had their financing needs met substantially or in full, and only 15 percent   were unable to secure requested credit  I do think that the picture around small business credit   availability is a mixed and confusing one  It’s hard to get to the underlying reality   Regarding the balance of risks, like President Pianalto, I think the incoming numbers are   not much off the path that I would expect, but I’m very much aware that the consensus outlook   has deteriorated further and may have stepped a little closer to an unwanted deflationary   scenario  While I don’t think that’s likely, I still judge the balance of risks to be a bit more to the   downside  Thank you, Mr Chairman   August 10, 2010 48 of 160              Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I approached this policy round, I   thought in terms of three goals—first, recognition of the situation that’s as accurate as possible;   second, obviously, commitment to maintenance of a policy that is supportive of recovery; and,   third, signaling readiness to act   I have to confess to some ambivalence  I think some strong arguments pro and con have   been made around the table related to alternative B with paragraph 4  I support alternative B  I   think the weakening certainly does not justify C, and I’m concerned that alternative A—and   there have been a couple of voices of support for alternative A—may be so preemptive that it   could actually be alarming, and, therefore, be somewhat self-fulfilling  I base my policy   August 10, 2010 122 of 160             recommendation on my previous forecasts  The way the situation is playing out is not far from   those forecasts—there may be some quarter-to-quarter intertemporal changes occurring, but it’s   pretty close to what I expected   Coming into the meeting, I actually appreciated the choice between the status quo, B2,   and B1, and I thought that was worthy of some discussion  I think we have to strike a balance   between overreacting to the recent slowdown and deceleration of recovery and appearing to be   clueless and, as Governor Kohn said, “not on the job”—that is, failing to acknowledge that   there’s some weakening going on and perhaps more downside risk   So, with a little apprehension, I can support the policy action in paragraph 4  I have a   preference for Treasuries  I actually view it as a signaling device  I think there’s a lot of   uncertainty regarding its effect, and I’m not sure its effect is the point  It’s a signaling device,   and, to me, it signals that, as Governor Kohn said, we’re on the job, we’re capable of acting  I   also think it actually can, in some small ways, preserve the credibility that we developed during   the 2008 and 2009 period  It would be confidence-supporting in that sense, and, by taking some   small action, we may avoid a situation where the public—recognizing, perhaps, some of the   constraints on the fiscal side—thinks that we’re in an utterly helpless situation  I don’t think we   want that kind of atmosphere to develop  So I view it as tactically preemptive  I think we can   reverse the policy if the circumstances change  It’s the opposite of a tap on the brakes—it’s a   slight tap, in my mind, on the pedal  And I don’t think we should overreact to the suggestion of   a small change in policy, so I support alternative B  I think the “extended period” language   remains appropriate, and I would hold that guidance   I have a couple of small comments on the language  The first is more rhetorical, because   I’m not pushing strongly, necessarily, for a change  I noted this time that there was more   August 10, 2010 123 of 160             comment on household deleveraging than I had heard in previous meetings I wonder if, to be   absolutely accurate in describing our view of the situation in paragraph 1, the list of constraints   to household spending might not include reference to the continuing balance sheet adjustment   and household deleveraging  I don’t think it’s necessarily recognized   The second is about business spending on equipment and software  Comments have been   made about some of the reasons that it’s rising, that is, replacement as opposed to growth, and   about the caution that’s being applied to that kind of investment  So I wonder if a qualifier isn’t   required for the word “rising,” for example, “rising somewhat” or “rising in the context of   emphasis on replacement,” or something that doesn’t make it sound as positive as it appears to   be in this paragraph  Those are my comments, Mr Chairman  Thank you    I just put them on the table more rhetorically because they’re fine-  tuning, and I don’t think you need to follow up, Mr Chairman  "
9061,2010-09-21,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The conditions in the Sixth District are   consistent with the national picture of a slowdown in the middle of the year  Generally speaking,   September 21, 2010 47 of 151             activity in the District has been moving laterally, and there is a bit more pessimism, or at least   backpedaling from earlier optimism, regarding the medium-term business outlook   That said, recent reports have been uneven by industry  Activity in surface transportation   or trucking remains especially strong  Business travel also remains very strong  Retail remains   soft, but varies by specialty and price positioning  Most notably, sales of retail home   improvement material have slowed sharply  Because of the weakness in the housing sector,   homeowners appear hesitant to invest in their houses—even in smaller projects—because it   amounts to putting additional equity into their homes   For the most part, however, I do not sense that businesses are preparing for a significant   deterioration in the economy  Rather, they seem generally of the mindset that activity will   remain marginally positive, but subdued, for some time  Firms continue to position themselves   for this lackluster future by cutting costs and streamlining operations  As President Fisher and   President Lacker pointed out, a common, indeed, almost universal, theme is that uncertainty   about economic policy and the fiscal situation, in particular, is paralyzing employment and   investment plans  This has become a mantra in the business community, whether or not fully   justified  The great majority of our business contacts seem to be in a “wait and see” mode as   regards domestic investment and hiring  This suggests to me that the Committee should be   careful to avoid policies or communications that might add to uncertainty   On this point, in our board meeting last week, we posed the following question to   directors  If uncertainty were lifted, but not one additional customer came through the door,   would you hire or invest?  Most responded in the affirmative, citing taxes, regulations, and costs   associated with recent legislation as factors holding them back   September 21, 2010 48 of 151             Finally, on the price front, I detect no price pressures to speak of in either direction  No   one reports much in the way of pricing power right now  The anecdotal reports in my District   have not changed in tone or intensity enough to cause me to alter my current assessment of the   economy and forecast  As in August, I continue to believe a recovery is proceeding, if at a very   slow pace for the moment  I have not concluded this is something other than a temporary   phenomenon absent big surprises  My forecast conforms reasonably closely to the Tealbook   through 2011, though I think structural factors and labor markets in certain industries are more   significant than the staff seems to have assumed in contributing to a slow recovery and   preventing faster achievement of the Committee’s mandated objectives   Hinting at my position in the policy round, the incoming data, while certainly   disappointing, along with the anecdotal evidence, have not been sufficiently downbeat to   convince me yet that the economy is evolving on a direr path than the Tealbook base case of   slow recovery, no double dip, and avoidance of deflation  The economic policy historical   moment strikes me as one of hoping for the best but appropriately preparing for the worst   In a standard upside versus downside balance of risk, I judge the risk to economic growth   as being weighted mostly to the downside  I would also judge the risk to the inflation outlook as   being biased to the downside, particularly over the medium term  Given the modest growth path   we appear to be on and the uncertainties that confront households and businesses, it seems clear   the recovery is fragile and the economy remains vulnerable to shocks  And all of this suggests to   me a posture of full alert to near-term developments that contradict and further shape one’s   confidence in the base-case scenario  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m going to confine my comments to   the decision at this meeting  Coming into the meeting, it was my expectation that we would   pretty much settle on alternative B, so I’m not really set on my opinion yet regarding further   quantitative easing  I look forward to the November meeting and the work between now and   November to harden that decision   For now, I favor alternative B, and the language presented is acceptable  However, I am   somewhat sympathetic to President Kocherlakota’s suggestion to stop the sentence at “support   the recovery,” in order to create the sense that we are flexible around that and are not moving   headlong into more accommodation   In support of alternative B, the question in my mind at this meeting is whether the   situation in the economy has gone awry so convincingly that the Committee should take action,   September 21, 2010 107 of 151             and I don’t think that is the case  I don’t think the accumulated data and the anecdotal evidence   that I get calls for action at this meeting  I do accept that there are some risks in not taking action   and that we could get behind the proverbial curve if the situation deteriorates rapidly But, in the   absence of a shock, I don’t see that happening, so I think the risk of being late by not taking   action in this meeting, but waiting until November or later, is acceptable   I also want to thank President Evans for his memo  I think raising the question of an   explicit price level objective is an appropriate thing to discuss at the next meeting, so I certainly   hope that will be on the agenda   As regards the language in alternative B, I think that, if there is any debate at all, it’s   around paragraph 4  As I said a second ago, I support it and could support President   Kocherlakota’s suggestion  I think it signals the capacity to act and the willingness to act if   conditions require it  I think we can explain this to the market in subsequent communications  I   hope this is not too naïve; that is, I hope that it’s simply signaling capacity and willingness under   certain conditions to act, as opposed to actually heading in that direction   You asked earlier, Mr Chairman, for some thoughts on a framework  This would be a   decision framework, I presume, for action at a later meeting, and some have described this as   essentially moving toward a new regime  Obviously, at this meeting, I don’t have definitive   answers, but I do have some thoughts regarding what I think the requirements of a discussion of   the framework should be  There are a lot of open questions, to my mind, and, therefore, the   meeting that we have in November should focus on four requirements      First, let’s get a consensus on the nature of the problem  Are we principally talking about   an inflation expectations problem and the potential for deflation, or are we talking about a “gap”   way of thinking about the problem, which focuses more on unemployment?  Second, what   September 21, 2010 108 of 151             conditions would call for action?  The basic question—and I think President Yellen actually   raised this in the economy round—is whether a persistence of current conditions would call for   action or whether we’d be looking for deteriorating data in order to pull the trigger  Also, as has   been raised earlier, there’s the question of whether a rule-like reaction or a more judgmental   approach is appropriate  Third would be the estimates of the likely effect of specific policy   actions  Would rate reductions result in credit expansion?  Some have raised doubts about that    Or would a price level targeting policy raise inflation expectations?  Or could we estimate the   effects on unemployment?  I do think there’s enough ambiguity around the effectiveness of   monetary policy in these times that we should do our best analytical work to arrive at some   measure of what we should expect  Finally, there are communications tradeoffs  As I perceive   it, there’s a tradeoff between clarity, reducing uncertainty, very explicit programs, and expected   policy outcomes on the one hand, and the more incremental approach in which we adjust policy   as developments unfold, on the other hand  I think that needs to be debated   With all of these questions about a framework, I support President Rosengren’s idea—  let’s make sure we take enough time at the next meeting, and, that may mean extending it to two   full days, because there is simply a lot to discuss  Thank you, Mr Chairman    It does improve dramatically, I think, from “decline,” which suggests   that it occurred in the intermeeting period  But I wonder if you can drop the whole thing and just   have it read this way “Measures of underlying inflation are currently at levels somewhat below   the Committee…” and don’t make it subject to interpretation  "
9085,2010-10-15,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me add my thanks to the staff for their   excellent preparation of materials for the meeting  In my comments, I’m going to express, at a   fairly high level, what I favor and am sympathetic to versus what I’m skeptical about   At this point, I favor an explicit inflation objective  I could see it as possibly a step in the   direction of a price level objective, with which I have some sympathy, but, at this point, I think it’s   best to stay with an inflation objective  I do think it’s timely to introduce an inflation objective  I   believe it would shore up concerns about the growth of the balance sheet in the event that we do   October 15, 2010 34 of 62             implement new LSAP programs  As I said, I am sympathetic to price-level targeting, but I think the   public needs much more preparation to understand that and to be able to factor it into expectations   I am very concerned and very skeptical about quantitative guidance related to the   unemployment rate  As I think President Lacker said, I think this would be construed as a target,   and one where we have little if any flexibility  I’m not clear how useful the concept of a longer-run   unemployment rate is  As regards communication, because I’m skeptical about this, my skepticism   also applies to draft statements 2 and 3  Again, President Lacker said something that I had   considered  Although it wasn’t in the staff’s materials, I wonder if the statement could combine a   quantitative inflation target with some fortified qualitative treatment of unemployment  That might   produce a satisfactory model for the statement   I do favor additional LSAPs at this time  For my part, it would be preferable to do so with   an inflation objective, but, if necessary, we could do so without  I think LSAPs will have some   positive effect through a variety of channels   I’m skeptical at this stage about interest-rate targeting  But if we go there, I would prefer a   10-year Treasury rate option  I see that as almost a benchmark for the curve in the minds of market   participants in many respects   Regarding the method of adjusting policy, I favor the smaller, more continuous approach  I   think we can do the same kind of thing with LSAP adjustments that we have done with the federal   funds rate  We can accustom the markets to small, discrete, incremental adjustments  I do think it’s   important to introduce conditionality or state-contingency, which I think will help with   communication  We can manage the communication and the market reaction to some extent by   assessing the program at each meeting and trying to communicate that assessment as clearly as   possible  I think we are best served by estimating the cumulative size of the LSAP, announcing this   October 15, 2010 35 of 62             as the size, and then treating this number as the most likely outcome, barring any clear evidence that   conditions have changed enough to alter the stated direction   As regards communication issues, I don’t have a lot of comments today  As I said, I think   it’s important that we make clear the conditionality of an LSAP as well as the notion that it goes   both ways  I favor the idea of the Chairman conducting press conferences, particularly to explain   any regime change that comes out of these meetings   I do want to bring up a question that I thought was close to being on the table a few months   ago, which may seem in some respects a digression at this stage  I think at that point we were at   least beginning to entertain the idea of introducing some treatment of interest on reserves in our   communication and in our statement  I think at some stage in the future, during an exit period or   even earlier, that might serve us  I raise this issue because, if we’re going to make substantial   changes in how we communicate, or if we’re going to try to socialize a new approach to monetary   policy, this might be the time to introduce more treatment of interest on reserves  Those are my   thoughts at this stage  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
9104,2010-11-02,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, how confident are you that, if   circumstances arose and we had to start to drain, we could get a significant amount of draining   accomplished over some kind of reasonable time frame, say, six months?  I’m looking for just a   really broad-brush sense here    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity across the Sixth   District appears to be steadily trending positive but is still quite lackluster  Expectations, while   somewhat uneven by sector, are more positive than negative  Among our directors and business   contacts, there has been a small but discernible improvement in sentiment about the future    However, nothing in the regional reports during this cycle would cause us to alter our slow-  growth outlook  Business leaders in the Southeast pretty uniformly report that their investment   spending relates to share capture, continued productivity gains, necessary equipment replacement   and maintenance, and meeting regulatory imperatives  There is still little spending premised on   domestic demand growth   Turning to the national economy, the glide path of the overall national economy also   seems to be upward, but at a moderate pace and still from a low base  The third-quarter GDP   report last week provided some encouragement in the private demand components of personal   consumption expenditures, business investment inventories, and nonresidential structures  These   modest improvements are consistent with the outlook that my staff and I have projected for quite   some time  My submitted forecasts for economic growth have been on the low side of the   spectrum over the last year and outside the central tendency of the Committee  In the context of   this rolling outlook, the softening experienced in the middle months of this year hasn’t so much   constituted a falloff from expectations and a worsening of the outlook as much as it has the   playing out of substantial quarterly variability along a path of slow, gradual recovery   We’ve been testing our basic narrative in a variety of ways and have come up with little   reason to change it  My view of the economy and the one represented in the alternative scenario   entitled “Lower Potential” are nearly identical  A key attribute of this outlook is the existence of   constraining elements that can be described as headwinds or structural factors or simply   November 2–3, 2010 47 of 238             processes that are slow to work themselves out  The Committee is familiar with the litany of   headwinds  These include a cautious and restrained credit environment; ongoing deleveraging,   especially in the household sector; a housing sector that has not yet achieved stable and growing   prices, and, therefore, uncertainty regarding house-related wealth; a commercial real estate sector   with much painful restructuring and debt resolution ahead; productivity gains by firms that have   been “banked,” so to speak, and thereby give these firms a new standard for “normal” long-term   operations; and, finally, persistent uncertainty connected to the country’s fiscal, tax, health-care,   and regulatory considerations  Because of this convergence of factors tending to retard the pace   of growth, my forecast remains subdued even with the assumption of appropriate monetary   policy that implies further stimulus   I admit to some ambivalence on the question of how effective more quantitative easing   can be, given my view of the world we’re in  To my way of thinking, there are two prominent   considerations relevant to the questions we’ll deal with in the policy round  First is the structural   character of current and prospective unemployment  I’m finding it increasingly difficult to   achieve much clarity by using the terms “structural” and “cyclical”  It’s easier for me to think in   terms of those features of the employment picture that are likely to abate with further stimulus or   not  Both analysis of the trend of new business formation, to cite one important driver of job   creation, and anecdotes from business contacts and various industries suggest to me that there are   material structural impediments at work   Second is the direction of inflation expectations, particularly since this is a time to be   watchful for moves in either direction  The other side of the inflation expectations coin is, of   course, deflation probabilities  There has been some action in this arena recently  Break-even   rates in the TIPS market declined from May through August and have since retraced much of   November 2–3, 2010 48 of 238             that decline  The recent run-up of TIPS break-evens rates coincides with speculation about a   second round of quantitative easing  Factoring in survey measures as well as conversations with   business contacts about price pressures, I conclude overall that expectations are relatively stable   and appear not to be moving outside historical bounds  That said, my staff has recently done   work to derive deflation probabilities from TIPS yields  Our estimate of the probability of   deflation rose from about 14 percent in April to a peak of just over 30 percent at midsummer    We place the market’s current assessment of the probability of deflation over the next five years   at about 20 percent—elevated, but a clear improvement since last summer   Connecting all of this to my outlook narrative, I come to the view that the slow-growth   trajectory implies persistent slack that will put pressure on wages and prices for at least the   medium term  In weighting my balance of risks, I have to treat the prospect of unwanted   disinflation that possibly leads to deflation as a tail risk to be sure, but not one that can be   prudently dismissed  So I see the balance of inflation risk currently to the downside  Thank you,   Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Back to Brian, at the risk of asking you   to cover ground you’ve already covered, I’d like to understand a little more your thought process   in striking the degree of transparency that you’re proposing in this statement  Are there   arguments that you weighed against this degree of transparency?  And then, to echo what I think   President Lacker referred to, what more could you do if you wanted to be more transparent?    I take it you don’t see any concern about stepping up the   transparency of your guidance, while, at the same time, alternative B’s statement, to some   degree, steps up the conditionality and stresses that we’re going to review this periodically and it   could change  You don’t see that as creating any confusion in the market?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I don’t know if it’s great to be speaking   after the break when everybody’s on a sugar high from the doughnuts  [Laughter]  I support the   policy action in alternative B  I also support the implementation approach detailed in paragraph   3 of alternative B  I think it’s appropriate at this time to respond to evidence suggesting that the   risks of further disinflation remain elevated  I think risk management is the justification for the   action, an insurance policy that has the intent of taking deflation risk off the table   As I said in the economy round, my sense is that the headwinds restraining the economy   and the structural adjustments required may make further monetary stimulus through an LSAP   program less effective than we would like  I think it’s important, therefore, to be measured in   our expectations about how much further stimulus can accomplish in the current environment    There’s simply a lot of uncertainty associated with this policy action   November 2–3, 2010 160 of 238             I prefer an approach that preserves flexibility and stresses the conditionality of the policy   and does not lock us into specific triggers for future action at this time  I think paragraph 5   serves to make it clear that the pace and size of the program will be continuously evaluated as the   economic outlook evolves  That said, I agree with the suggestion that discussion of the decision   framework associated with conditioning would be useful  I also want to add that, even though   it’s not a consideration at this meeting, I remain sympathetic to the idea of using this moment to   be more explicit regarding an inflation objective   I am not entirely comfortable with the language in paragraph 2 of alternative B  It seems   likely to me that changing the language to call out the unemployment rate specifically will   inevitably invite the conclusion that we have a specific rate in mind and that we are introducing   an unemployment target as a guide for future monetary actions  I’m sensitive to the fact that we   are pursuing a dual mandate, of course, but, in my opinion, the language we have been using   does appropriately honor the mandate  Specifically, I think the statement that “Measures of   underlying inflation are currently at levels somewhat below those the Committee judges most   consistent, over the longer run, with its mandate to promote maximum employment and price   stability,” makes it clear that we have a focus on labor markets  More importantly, it does so   without risking overinterpretation of how much we can do about altering the path of the   unemployment rate in the near or even medium term  Most of our forecasts suggest that the   unemployment rate will remain above what anyone would call desirable levels, even after the   pace of the economic recovery has improved  I think the current version of paragraph 2 in   alternative B may well create issues in exiting from that language  The September language, it   seems to me, still serves us well  But if the Committee feels the need to put somewhat more   emphasis on employment, I would suggest something closer to the language in the initial version   November 2–3, 2010 161 of 238             of alternative B that was circulated last week  A streamlined version of that would say   something like, “The pace of economic recovery would likely be too slow to make acceptable   progress toward maximum employment, and underlying inflation likely would remain   undesirably low for some time, posing risks to the economic recovery”  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Mr Chairman?    I think we can be too cute here in trying to frame the conditionality    I think the original language, just “incoming information,” is enough    This may be too simplistic a way of thinking about it, but I think   there are differences of opinion around the table about how much we want to stress the absolute   stock amount  To cut through that, I’d be consistent with what I remember we did when we   announced the first LSAP, which was to lead with the amount  I think people are going to parse   this statement for every nuance more than they have ever parsed a statement, so to add another   invitation to misinterpret what we’re saying doesn’t make sense to me  If the first time around   we said we were going to do a program of X, I would stick with that, just to keep it simple  "
9130,2010-12-14,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, in chart 3, how tight is the   distribution of opinion among survey participants?  Is this a median of a broad spread of opinion   as to what we’ll do or what the program will be, or has it tightened up?   December 14, 2010 8 of 127              Thank you    What would be the interpretation of extending longer than six   months?  Is there a risk that that would be interpreted as more alarmist in some way?   December 14, 2010 16 of 127              Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a couple of questions for Nathan    The first is a narrow one To what extent is there an Iberian problem?  That is, if Portugal really   gets into serious trouble, does it almost automatically create contagion that draws Spain into it?    But he does have a job    My second, broader question is, again, for Nathan  When you did a   European recession scenario in the summer, it had a more severe impact on the US economy   than the one that is in the Tealbook this time around  You’ve touched on this a little bit, but   could you give a deeper sense of what has changed, and why we see less impact on our economy   in the current circumstances?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Recent reports from contacts in the Sixth   District were a little more optimistic about near-term growth prospects compared with what I   heard going into the November meeting  As is appropriate for this time of year, we asked a   number of directors and contacts about their early assessment of the holiday retail picture  We   heard that post-Thanksgiving receipts beat retailer expectations, in some cases by a good margin    One contact with 85 shopping malls in the Southeast and Midwest said that mall traffic and sales   through last Thursday were much stronger than expected   I spoke a week ago to the CEO of one of the two leading parcel shipping companies, a   company that claims to touch about 7 percent of the country’s GDP daily  He said they had   planned for traffic to be 3 percent over last year, but so far they’re achieving 5 percent with the   strongest week still ahead  He also offered the opinion that if the pace of spending and   accompanying shipping carries into January, inventory shortfalls among his company’s retail   clients will require a step-up in production   Notwithstanding this upbeat information, we came away from our board meetings and   calls with a sense that very few firms are revising up their 2011 business plans  Contacts still   cite a host of uncertainties as justification for their “wait and see” posture regarding new hiring   and capital spending  We heard mixed messages, for example, regarding the proposed   December 14, 2010 51 of 127             investment expensing provision  One buyer of big-ticket transportation equipment indicated that   accelerated write-offs would certainly cause his company to shift investment into 2011  Most   others, however, said they would base investment decisions on business fundamentals and in   general had not yet factored any substantial effect of the proposed stimulus into their 2011   forecast and plans   Overall, I saw little in the incoming data and heard little in the input from contacts that   would require a revision of my November forecast of slightly over 3 percent GDP growth for   2011  The basic outlook that most here in the room share—moderate and slightly accelerating   growth, slowly reducing unemployment, and below desired but gradually rising inflation—still   seems appropriate   In our conversations with contacts over the last two weeks, we probed on the question of   pass-through of rising commodity prices  We heard that, for the most part, commodity price   increases are being absorbed at various stages of supply chains, some of which may be offshore    Few firms claimed any pricing power at present  I think the likelihood of accelerating   disinflation, tipping into sustained deflation, has come down quite a bit since last summer    Measures of inflation expectations have moved back up, and the estimates made by my staff of   probabilities of CPI deflation over the next five years have moved back down  I believe the   inflation risks have become somewhat more balanced   As regards the overall balance of risks, I’m not quite ready to abandon the cautious view   that risks to the downside outweigh those to the upside, but my overall sense of risk has   definitely been moving in the direction of balance  That said, I see tail risks as having fattened   somewhat on the downside  To back up that statement, I’d cite the European situation and   renewed pessimism about the residential housing sector  Thank you, Mr Chairman   December 14, 2010 52 of 127              Bill, looking at alternative A, is it your sense—and I don’t want to   put words in your mouth—that the market might see this as a sequence of steps?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, support alternative B  I believe   some patience in letting the effects of the new LSAP materialize is warranted  I would also say   that in my view the reversal of the summer’s downward trend in longer-term inflation   expectations represents an early sign of the success of our current policy course   Though I don’t feel any adjustment of policy is needed at this juncture, and though I am   comfortable with the statement language as presented, I would favor in the coming meetings a   more thorough discussion of the broad policy framework the Committee believes it has adopted   and how it should be conveyed in the statements going forward  In that regard, I would like to   comment for a second in more detail about the language in alternatives A and C  Like others on   the Committee, I think the policy concern of the moment is communication  The reason I asked   Bill English the question about the $200 billion change signaling potentially a sequence of   adjustments on a more open-ended path is that it strikes me that A and C could be interpreted as   a first step in a sequence  In that light, the language seems to signal a move toward an approach   to policy that resembles the funds rate targeting approach when the zero lower bound did not   pertain  In alternative A, for example, it has already been mentioned that an additional   $200 billion might be viewed as roughly equivalent to a 25 basis point cut in the fed funds rate   In my mind, this asset purchase analogue to funds rate targeting adds two characteristics   that the Committee might consider beginning to convey in statements  First, a sequence of   similar moves is likely unless economic conditions change in some significant way  And,   second, the total value to which the sequence of moves accumulates is left unstated, because that   quantity is conditional on economic conditions  If this is not the policy framework we intend to   communicate, then the language needs to be carefully constructed to avoid any confusion about   our policy strategy  So I’d like to advocate that, whatever action we take next on the asset   December 14, 2010 81 of 127             purchase program, we convey it choosing language that more openly reflects a deliberate   Committee choice about our policymaking framework for the foreseeable future  I hope,   therefore, that at the next meeting we might devote a little time to discussion of our policy   framework options and the content of communications that would convey them and support the   effectiveness of the chosen approach  Thank you, Mr Chairman     I have, in some respects, a more narrow idea  I think some of the   debate over time has been about a discretionary versus rules-based approach, so it’s that tension   that I have in mind  To explain what I mean, I describe our approach today as involving   meeting-by-meeting reviews that result in decisions around a fairly large asset purchase program   that is closed-ended, in the sense that a final cumulative target for purchases is explicitly stated    In contrast, it has been suggested before that the Committee adopt an incremental approach with   the cumulative purchase target left open  So that’s what I am trying to convey  "
9158,2011-01-25,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Under the worst-case scenario, the high   sales/high interest rate, you have a deferred credit asset accruing  First, is there precedent for   that?  And, second, has that been discussed with Treasury?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a question for Nellie—it’s not a   fair question [laughter], so just try, if you could, to do your best to answer  The middle right   panels on exhibit 5 and on exhibit 12 deal with European exposure  One of the things we learned   in the crisis is that it’s not the first degree of separation, it’s the second—that is, it’s your   January 25–26, 2011 81 of 282              exposure to the people that have the exposure to risky entities  Steve commented that the Greek   sovereign debt situation is probably unsustainable, which suggests that it’s moving toward some   form of restructuring or default that may be managed or unmanaged, and it may trigger a lot of   concern about other countries’ debt  Do we have any sense of our system’s exposure to the   people who have the exposure and the risk that could come from a contagion getting started?    As I said, I realize it wasn’t a fair question, but I was trying to get a   sense of what the real risk might be  Thank you    Thanks, Dan     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The improved tenor of the incoming data   has been clearly reflected in the comments coming from business contacts in the Sixth District in   this intermeeting cycle  The best characterization of those comments is more optimistic than   before the December meeting but still a bit tentative, cautious, and reluctant to place significant   bets on stronger demand  As the data show, the pace of consumer spending has clearly picked   up, but our conversations with retailers, some of which have national scope, convey little sense   that they are preparing for a stronger year in 2011  I draw this conclusion from our queries about   inventory, store expansion, and hiring  The inventory of unsold homes continues to weigh on   residential real estate markets in the Southeast  Reports from our survey of Realtors are   consistent with the current Tealbook’s forecast of a modest drop in house prices  The data also   indicate that business investment in equipment and software remains buoyant  Our contacts in   the region tell us the lion’s share of this investment is oriented to further productivity   enhancement and streamlining of supply chains and distribution systems, not a response to an   improving economy  Our directors and contacts pretty uniformly stated the view that gains in   labor productivity have not been exhausted and will continue to take priority over hiring   Regarding labor market conditions and prospects for hiring, our most recent round of   discussions with business leaders in our District evoked some widely held views that may be   relevant to yesterday’s discussion of the NAIRU  We heard a lot of comments to the effect that   job descriptions have been, and continue to be, transformed to require broader skills, modern   technology savvy, and generally a higher degree of versatility and flexibility, even in positions   January 25–26, 2011 92 of 282              that are relatively low on the totem pole  We heard such comments about truck and car sales   personnel, truck drivers, and agricultural workers, to mention a few  The CEO of a large auto   retailer described the extension of the salesperson’s job into financing arrangements, warranty   negotiation, and documentation  This seems to be occurring across a spectrum of industries and   occupational lines  The message we heard is that the new employee is not so easy to find and   that many of the unemployed lacked the skills and the attitude to fill these redefined jobs   Turning to my forecast, with some comparison to the Tealbook, my economic growth   forecast has been revised up a little, but not materially  In reality, my forecast for growth,   unemployment, and inflation are really not much changed from my November submission  I   continue to hold the view that headwinds from a variety of sources will restrain growth to a pace   a little under 3½ percent this year, keep unemployment elevated, and allow for only a modest   rise in core inflation   My forecast for inflation is slightly higher than the Tealbook’s, and, as I mentioned, my   forecast for GDP growth is slightly lower  On balance, I don’t think the differences in the near-  term outlook between what I submitted for this meeting and what I read in the Tealbook are all   that significant  While I have not incorporated the recent rise in commodity prices into my   inflation outlook, for largely the same reasons delineated in the Tealbook, my recent   conversations with business contacts have introduced more caution into it  These conversations   reflect a growing sense that attempts to pass through higher commodity prices to the consumer   are about to be implemented across a range of products  I heard that price hikes in apparel,   transportation and delivery services, household goods and hardware, and grocery products are in   the works  There is much uncertainty whether these price increases will stick, but this is the first   indication I’ve heard that businesses believe they have pricing power  Influenced by this   January 25–26, 2011 93 of 282              anecdotal feedback, I have changed my assessment of the inflation risk from weighted to the   downside to balanced  I also think the specter of deflation is less likely today than it seemed last   fall, in part due to the effect of our policies  Regarding economic growth and employment, I still   see the risks as broadly balanced  However, if pushed to express a bias one way or the other, I   am now tilting in the direction of the upside  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  I think the   wording in paragraph 1, with the slight updates, is appropriate as presented  I think President   January 25–26, 2011 175 of 282              Fisher suggested in a note before the meeting adding a clause to the end of paragraph 2 that said   something like “though there are indications that the recovery is strengthening”  I am   sympathetic with that, because I think that most of our 2011 forecasts, including my own, have   been revised higher, and I don’t think that is inconsistent with paragraph 1   I support keeping the “extended period” language in paragraph 4  I think the phrasing   still pertains, and I am wary of making a change at this juncture, given the intense attention this   phrase has had in past months and the likelihood that dropping it or stating an explicit date would   set off an unintended market response and certainly would mislead markets regarding how policy   may play out   With respect to the addition of the numerical inflation target language bracketed in   alternative C, paragraph 5, I am hesitant to support this in this statement  I do, in general,   support the notion of a more explicit inflation objective as part of our framework  However, I   think that further official policy communication moves in that direction ought to be taken only   after the Committee has come to a more formal decision about whether and how to implement a   more explicit inflation target   On the question of dropping or adding guidance on the quantity of purchases to $80   billion—here comes a double negative, which I love—I see no reason not to include the language   that was added yesterday that raises the number from $75 to $80 billion  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    First, let me say thanks to Tom for pointing out FRAM—I think it’s   a good foundation  Over and above that, I really favor an informal set of guidelines and   principles that puts the emphasis on exercising good judgment and taking perhaps greater care   going forward  I think strict limitations on contacts who might—I emphasize the conditional—  generate trading or positioning profits is unworkably broad and, certainly, in my case, might   interfere with the usefulness of many contacts  Likewise, defining a strict frequency limit or   rule, I think, goes too far   I don’t favor centralized reporting, but I do think it’s reasonable to assume that each   participant will maintain a record of meetings and contacts  And I do favor some tightening of   elements of the guidelines  For example, meetings with most parties, and certainly those with   the press, should include, if possible, a public information officer as an associate or someone   from the research department—a witness, if you will  I think events in which businesses, clients,   and prospects are the exclusive invitees, should be avoided or discouraged, even if the media are   present, because I don’t think that changes the appearance of privileged access   I think participants should refrain from characterizing FOMC deliberations before the   publication of the minutes, and then, after the minutes are out, they should characterize FOMC   meetings in a manner consistent with the minutes  And, of course, I think we all agree that we   should adhere to a defined blackout period That’s something I think should be strictly defined   January 25–26, 2011 208 of 282              On the question of expressing personal views on monetary policy that have not been   stated publicly, again, I think this goes a little too far and should be left to judgment  I accept the   spirit of this guideline, because it does suggest privileged access to insider views   And, finally, if guidelines and principles are adopted by this group, I think they should be   made public  "
9184,2011-03-15,LOCKHART,"  Nathan, regarding the predictive power of futures markets, I had the   impression that they had individual idiosyncrasies  In the case of short-term oil futures, my   sense was that the spot price and the storage cost create the curve  The futures price is obviously   different than the spot because of the addition of the storage cost  Whereas for a food   commodity, it would be more a question of predicting supply and demand, with maybe   something else factored in  In foreign exchange, we know that futures prices are no prediction of   the future spot rate; they’re just interest rate differentials   March 15, 2011 28 of 165               To what extent is using just commodity futures as a benchmark a   valid approach?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As we collected inputs from our business   contacts and directors over the last two weeks in the Sixth District, we probed especially on   economic growth assumptions, including changes in outlooks as a result of oil prices, business   cost pressures and pass-through intentions, and on planned investment, including motivations for   expenditures  Most sources described the economy as stronger and increasingly self-sustaining   but voiced concern about the potential adverse effects of continued upward pressure on oil   prices  Contacts representing industries with little connection—namely, the auto industry, food   retailing, and tourism—point to $4 per gallon gasoline as a tipping point for consumer budgets    March 15, 2011 31 of 165              According to these sources, at $4, significant changes in consumer spending behavior should be   anticipated  Some contacts expressed concern particularly about the region’s economy   continuing to be weighed down by excess residential real estate and the potential for resumption   of falling home prices  Our questioning on actual business cost pass-through from rising   commodity prices was mixed and inconclusive  However, a number of contacts across a wide   spectrum of businesses are at least entertaining the idea of trying to push higher costs along  A   few are confident they will be successful, but most are taking a wait-and-see approach  We   heard little from our contacts about continuing disinflation, and it’s clear to us the tone of the   conversation around inflation has shifted to upside inflation risk and, in their view, reality   There are a few upside developments to report  Industrial activity is strong in the Sixth   District  Air travel nationally, both business and pleasure, is much improved from this time last   year, and wage pressures remain light, particularly for lower-skilled and less-educated workers    While conditions across business and industrial sectors differ, most have evidenced improvement   in the last few months, and business executives are cautiously positioning their companies for   higher business activity  The exceptions are largely associated with homebuilding, commercial   real estate construction, and building materials   Turning to my outlook, my baseline outlook looks essentially the same today as it did the   last time we met  I continue to expect the economy to gradually gain strength over the course of   this year and next  My growth path for the economy is more modest than the Tealbook’s  The   difference owes largely to my assumption that businesses will continue to be cautious regarding   capital spending for business expansion as well as new net hiring  This results in a more modest   rise in private spending over the forecast horizon   March 15, 2011 32 of 165              I have not revised my inflation outlook and still see the underlying price trend on a path   consistent with our price stability mandate  That said, I think the price conditions, as opposed to   inflation conditions, are creating quite tricky circumstances that present communications   challenges  Nonmonetary pressures on prices—that is, commodities’ supply and demand, for   example, affected by weather—combined with rising global demand from strong economic   growth in emerging markets and accelerating recovery in advanced economies, combined with   rising risk premiums in petroleum markets reflecting unrest in the MENA region are fueling   increasingly vocal inflation anxiety  My conclusion is, all indications of expectations bear very   close watching   Anticipating the policy round discussion of statement language, let me add that my   reading of the core inflation data since November leads me to the view that the word “subdued”   may not aptly characterize what has occurred  As I see it, there has been an upward firming of   the inflation trend as was intended   My sense of the balance of risks associated with my economic growth projection is   reasonably balanced  It is worth mentioning, however, that prior to the emergence of the Middle   East–North Africa unrest and the resulting rise of oil prices, I was moving toward an outlook that   acknowledged more upside than downside risk to growth  Two downside considerations are in   my mind returning the scales to balance  As I said, oil prices and, second, a resumed decline in   home prices could damp household confidence and sap some of the strength coming from   consumer spending   I think the risks around the inflation projection are also balanced, but here I make that   judgment with more apprehension  While longer-term inflation expectations measured by TIPS   or household survey data are still inside their range of the past five or six years, they are at the   March 15, 2011 33 of 165              upper ends of those ranges  It seems to me, therefore, a lot depends on those expectations   remaining steady  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B, but I do have   some suggestions on language, and I’d like to get to those in just a moment  But first, I’d like to   comment on why I think B is the correctly calibrated policy for the situation   I have a pretty mainstream view relative to those around the table regarding the most   likely path of the economy  I see the most probable path as continuing expansion at a moderate   pace, continuing but gradual employment progress, and acceptably well-behaved and stable   underlying trend inflation  So that’s a mainstream view   What has changed in my assessment of the situation is the range of risks and plausible   negative scenarios that would deviate significantly from a baseline scenario  Analysis by my   staff suggests that an immediate, large, and sustained-for-some-period rise of oil prices would   push the economy close to recessionary territory  At the same time, I take seriously the risk   identified in the Tealbook alternative entitled “persistent rise in inflation”  In that scenario, high   and rising commodity prices lead to an unanchoring of medium- and longer-term inflation   expectations  I think these two negative but opposed risks are very roughly balanced, but if I had   to rank order them today, I would give a little bit more immediacy and weighting to the higher   inflation concern  That said, I don’t think there is yet compelling evidence of a magnitude that   March 15, 2011 112 of 165              requires a response that longer-term inflation expectations are becoming unanchored  But I   would note, as I did in the economic go-round, that the TIPS indicators are at the top end of the   range we’ve been depicting as stable, and the recent Michigan survey involved a tick up of   longer-term household inflation expectations   A firming of policy, as others have suggested, may be needed sooner than we would   otherwise intend  But I think any signaling of that change before we are more certain it is   needed will create unnecessary volatility in asset prices  For that reason, I would prefer not to   change the current asset purchase program, and I oppose the tapering idea  Nor would I change,   at this point, the “extended period” funds rate guidance   So my basic thought is  Stay the course for the time being  With employment levels   improving, but having still so far to go to reach the desirable and achievable position, I don’t   favor a tightening action as in alternative C  Likewise, because I see rising inflation borne of   shifting expectations as a real risk, I don’t support alternative A  So net-net, I think B is the right   answer at this juncture for the economic circumstances and the array of plausible negative   developments   Let me comment on statement language  First, I like President Kocherlakota’s   suggestions that refine the language in paragraph 2  Regarding the characterization of inflation   and commodity price rises, as I commented in the previous round, I think describing measures of   underlying inflation—and per President Plosser’s recent question, I take that to mean,   technically, core and trimmed mean PCE measures—as “subdued” somewhat misrepresents   recent activity in those measures  I am concerned that this language could make the Committee   appear out of touch  Over the past three months, all measures of inflation have risen, and for that   March 15, 2011 113 of 165              reason, I prefer a description of measures of underlying inflation that says  “Measures of   underlying inflation, while firming recently, remain low”   In paragraph 4, I think we repeat the “subdued” language  My concern with that repeat   is, one, it’s redundant; and two, as I have just suggested, it’s not quite aligned with recent data   movement and could serve to antagonize the public, conceivably, and ultimately undermine our   credibility  So in paragraph 4, I would simply suggest that we delete the language starting with   “including,” so that the sentence reads  “The Committee will maintain a target range for the   federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are   likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period”  My   concern, Mr Chairman, is around not only the use, but the repeat use of the word “subdued”    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Well, we want to say that they’re not falling anymore   March 15, 2011 114 of 165               This is at the end of paragraph 1?    “The measures of underlying inflation have remained low”?    Well, my concern is that the attention of many of our audiences is   going to be on the last three months, not the trend, as Bill is suggesting, and that we are inviting   a view that we are not in touch    Maybe we could say, then, “The measures of trends of underlying   inflation have remained low”  So you emphasize the word “trends”    I’m finished  Thank you    You are emphasizing the word “trends,” which is just a longer term   than the last three months     I am not sure you have enough people supporting the view that the   word “subdued” is a problem around the table  So you should really go with the majority of the   Committee    Janet, obviously, a press conference after four of our meetings a year   really adds a great deal of clarification to what the Committee is thinking  Did you discuss at all   whether any change in the statement format would be required at those meetings or at all?    And as a practical matter, Michelle, can we produce a transcript that   is in our hands in what would be, I guess, 22 hours?    I think I heard Tom say, “extend the blackout period”    But isn’t the practice today two days after the meeting?   March 15, 2011 141 of 165               So this would be shortening    Dan, do you want to make it longer than two days?    Keep it where it is now  Okay    That would be a nice benefit    I go with Dan’s approach here  I was very comfortable with two   days after a meeting ending on Wednesday, which effectively means that you’re not saying   anything until the following Monday, in most cases  I am perfectly comfortable with that  I   don’t necessarily see a compelling need to get out very quickly, and I do think that it invites a lot   of what we would consider to be more “short-termism” in the discussion  So I’m okay with the   current policy    What was your question again?    So it’s the end of day Thursday  "
9208,2011-04-26,LOCKHART,"  Brian, a more general question on your outlook for the effect of the   FDIC fee on the repo market  When we were considering the zero lower bound, we were   concerned that there could be a destruction in the infrastructure that would occur over time with   professionals leaving because they couldn’t operate at that low level, and then generally that   there could be a relationship to IOER and its ability to have the effects we want as we begin to   raise it  Can you generally talk about your concern about whether this fee complicates our life   over the longer term?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  A question both for Bill and Brian Sack    I think you suggested that we may want to drain in advance of moving the fed funds rate  Do   you have any sense of how sharp the market reaction would be in long rates to the beginning of   draining?  My thoughts  The market would anticipate that that is a precursor, obviously, to   moving the fed funds rate, and there would probably be an immediate reaction  Is there any way   to estimate how much that reaction would be?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, would like to thank the staff for   their framing of a complex set of issues and tradeoffs  Before I answer any questions, I’d like to   express some preliminary views   First, as others have said, I see the endgame as a return to a balance sheet configuration   that aligns with more-normal conduct of monetary policy and has the best chance of   effectiveness in shaping economic conditions consistent with our mandates  I see that   configuration as all-Treasuries, scaled at a level that supports the use of the fed funds rate target   as the central policy instrument operating within a corridor structure   To some extent, removal of accommodation will effectively begin with an announcement   effect resulting from our first communication about exit  I think it is possible with good   communication to limit the announcement effect on the announcement of ceasing reinvestments,   and I think we may be able to limit an announcement effect even with the initiation of small asset   April 26–27, 2011 64 of 244              sales, but this will require skillful communication, and it seems to me that the timing would best   coincide with the Chairman’s press conferences so that he can explain that a rise in the fed funds   rate is not necessarily imminent   The unknown of the announcement effect associated with the first step may be an   argument for not taking this action too far in advance of the decision to implement the full exit   plan  I think the objective should be that any substantial announcement effects on long rates   would occur when we have decided to actively begin removal of accommodation and not before    Said differently, I’d place a high priority on avoiding any actions that inadvertently cause policy   tightening to begin before the Committee has arrived at a consensus that tightening is warranted   by economic conditions  Because in my view we will be in new territory in unwinding the   policy actions of the last three years, I prefer an approach that recognizes that there are a number   of unknowns  This in my mind argues for a simple and conservative plan that minimizes the   risks of market distortions and can be relatively easily communicated  I would favor an   accelerated pace of asset sales only to the extent that policy effectiveness and market function   are not put at risk   With those preliminary comments, let me give answers to the four questions  For   question 1, I agree that the first step should be stopping reinvestment of principal payment of   agency securities, and I would also stop reinvestment of Treasuries at that time   For question 2, along with the question of starting the cessation of some or all   reinvestments comes the question of when  My thinking is that we would stop reinvestment   when the Committee agrees that conditions have evolved to the point that any notion of QE3 can   be taken off the table  I favor a predetermined and announced-in-advance path for asset sales    There may be some learning involved as the asset sales proceed, so my preference would be for   April 26–27, 2011 65 of 244              an approach that is relatively conservative in terms of the pace of sales  As I said, I do not view   a quick reduction of the balance sheet as an end in itself  I would not want to implement sales at   a pace that would add a lot of de facto tightening beyond what we intend with interest rate   policy  I think it will be possible to communicate a predetermined asset sales program and at the   same time convey that the program could be revised or halted if conditions dictate   For question 3, I would prefer to start asset sales simultaneously with beginning to move   the fed funds rate and the interest rate on excess reserves  Given the unknowns, I’m wary of too   much sequencing and too many moving parts that have to be coordinated  In my thinking, when   the Committee decides it’s time to move, all the wheels are set in motion   I agree with the thrust of the statements in question 4  In some respects, I think the exact   process we use to remove policy accommodation is less important than our communications   about the timing, magnitude, and conditionality of our planned actions  I would not want any   early communications on a framework to impact private expectations in such a way that we end   up with a de facto removal of accommodation before we make the decision to change the policy   stance   To summarize, the approach I would recommend tries to achieve simplicity and the least   risk, and it’s really a two-step approach  At a point not long before active exit, we cease   reinvestment of both MBS and Treasuries  Then, simultaneously, we raise the interest on   reserves rate and the fed funds rate target, and begin a gradual, orderly, preannounced program   of asset sales  We leave to the Desk the decision on draining operations as a tactical move to   improve the ability to hit the fed funds rate target, and we communicate that the pace of sales   will be reviewed periodically in light of economic conditions  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Again, for Nathan  At least if you’ve   followed the press, there has been an intensifying discussion of Chinese inflation and their   tightening  Do you see any concern that they will actually have to tighten enough to materially   slow down their growth rate?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m going to focus mostly on anecdotal   reports from the Sixth District, and those anecdotal reports that I’ve recently received from   directors and other contacts are more positive than the tenor of the incoming data  While these   contacts acknowledge that the pace of economic activity weakened in the first quarter, there has   been no significant falloff in business confidence about the outlook since the last meeting  In   many cases we are getting reports that suggest a stronger economy than the macro numbers   would indicate, and this is puzzling considering the incoming numbers   On the positive side, manufacturing activity remains quite strong in the District,   consistent with the national numbers  The strength in auto manufacturing, in spite of some   rescheduling associated with Japan-based supply chains, heavily influences this perception    Transportation- and logistics-related businesses continue to experience very strong demand    Tourism is strong in Florida and other tourist areas in the Southeast, helped in part by   international visitors  Convention business is returning nicely, which is taken as a sign of   improving confidence in the economy  This has spurred a significant increase in capital   expenditures in the tourism sector   On the more negative side, housing markets in my District remain distressed with no   clear signs of improvement, but, at the same time, with not a lot of deterioration  Perhaps more   noteworthy, some retailers reported a falloff in sales as the quarter proceeded  One large home-  April 26–27, 2011 109 of 244              improvement retailer has measured fewer visits, which is attributed to shoppers reducing their   outings to save on gasoline  And there is acknowledgement that poor weather, of course, in the   early part of the quarter affected first-quarter numbers   Overall, however, retail sales in the District appear to be up modestly from the last   meeting  In our monthly survey of Sixth District retailers, the majority of respondents reported a   slight increase in both sales and traffic in March  About three-fourths of them indicated that they   expect sales to increase in the coming months, and overall sentiment continues to be positive   Consistent with the measured optimism expressed in most of our conversations, we did   not as of yet detect any widespread backing-off of investment plans  However, our director that   represents the large retailer that I mentioned earlier did note that cap-ex budgets would have to   be cut if the decline in the pace of activity that they’re experiencing persists much longer, and   many of our directors agreed  So in this instance, I did pick up some wavering on the outlook   Labor markets in my District appear to have firmed a little  Demand for workers has   improved in line with the pickup in hiring nationally  I think it’s a reasonable thesis, broadly   speaking, that firms have pushed productivity enhancements close to their limit and are now   reaching the point of needing new workers to keep expansion going  In our first-quarter survey   of small businesses, 42 percent of respondents reported that they expect to add workers over the   next six months, up from 29 percent at year-end  Views on wages and on wage pressures have   shifted slightly  Wage and benefit pressures have moved from neutral or even downward to   moderately upward  We did hear greater concern about talent retention, and I note that the NFIB   and the Duke CFO survey in March showed upticks in the wage–cost outlook   Our contacts continue to voice concern over cost pressures, especially material costs   deriving from commodities  What is noteworthy is how broad-based these material cost   April 26–27, 2011 110 of 244              pressures seem to be  We are hearing some concern that margins are tightening and are   projected to tighten, and that pass-through inhibitions are weakening   Chief among the commodity prices, of course, are oil and fuel  I see the direction of oil   prices as a major swing factor in economic performance for at least the near term  Based on   so-called expert analysis, if there is such a thing, and conversations with knowledgeable   observers of developments in the Middle East, I think there is no better working assumption than   the one that oil prices have leveled off but will remain elevated near current levels for some time    The possibility of a spike from current price levels represents a significant downside risk to my   outlook   Our District-level soundings suggest to me that the economy is at something of a pivotal   juncture  Gasoline prices and energy prices more generally will influence the evolution of the   economy in the near term  Right now the general sentiment seems to be that the negative   influence of higher energy prices is likely to be transitory, but this view is cautiously held, and   there is a sense that the prevailing optimism about the balance of the year is fragile   As I said, anecdotal reports I’ve heard seem mostly inconsistent with professional   interpretation of incoming data and are in tension with the results of our recent model runs  The   suite of models that we ran in preparation for this meeting almost uniformly suggest a downward   revision to our 2011 growth outlook on the order of ½ to ¾ percentage point, and this is similar   to the downward adjustment of the Tealbook baseline  In my forecast submission, however, I   decided to give some weight to the economic intelligence we’re getting from our contacts  So   I’m holding to the view that the economy is on a moderate growth path, and that the slowdown   in the first quarter suggested by the incoming data is really an initial shock effect that will not   persist  This is to say that the fundamentals have not changed that much   April 26–27, 2011 111 of 244              As regards the balance of risks, I see the risk to economic growth to the downside   connected to the risk of a further oil price shock  My assessment of the inflation risks is clearly   weighted to the upside  Although expectations remain in the territory reasonably described as   “anchored,” expectations have drifted higher and are at the top of the recent historical range    Despite exceptionally high rates of unemployment, wage growth seems to be firming  This,   along with the drumbeat from businesses that inflationary pressures continue to build, raise some   concern on my part that we may not be able to count on inflation expectations as a restraining   influence on underlying inflation  Although normally one would think of these two risks, the oil   price shock to growth and the inflation risk, as moving against each other, in my view there is a   scenario where we get higher inflation and a weaker economy  But this is not my base-case   outlook, and, as I said, that outlook holds to a moderate-growth path with a slight backup on the   full-year growth estimate and tame core inflation measures for the forecast horizon  Thank you,   Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  I think the   situation calls for a steady-as-she-goes posture  I think there are scenarios that would call for a   policy adjustment earlier than I think the Committee would otherwise intend  But at this juncture   I would not signal anything that suggests a change of policy in the near term or any likelihood of   deviating from the announced LSAP2 plan  This could create unnecessary volatility in the   economy at this time when crosscurrents have produced somewhat more ambiguity than was the   case at the beginning of the year   Turning to the statement, the characterization of the economy in alternative B is broadly   consistent with my own reading of the current circumstances and outlook  Because various TIPS   measures are up since the last FOMC meeting, I can see the case for describing longer-term   inflation expectations as “generally stable” rather than “stable”  But I am not convinced longer-  term expectations are so out of line as to warrant this potentially significant change in language,   which could come close to sounding like an FOMC call to action   April 26–27, 2011 197 of 244              I am, I have to say, somewhat sympathetic to President Evans’s suggestion of a modifier    I think there is some potential for our treatment of inflation in this statement to still be confusing    But, in some respects, in response to President Plosser’s recommendations, all things considered,   I think in this statement I would keep changes limited  I would introduce few or no new ways of   describing or explaining, even if I’m sympathetic with the thinking  I would put the emphasis on   the press conference and try to keep this statement as spare as possible  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
9238,2011-06-21,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, support the principles here  I just   finding myself feeling that—and I hope this isn’t too cavalier, but—this is close enough for   government work at this time  I think we have so much to learn in this process  There are so   many unknowns that, at this juncture, I would posit some principles that we agree on without   pinning ourselves down to, particularly, timing  The sequencing here is logical, although I think   it may be highly compressed when the first steps are made because the market will react and   tightening will have begun in the longer rates  I also would hope—my own personal view—that   by getting this out through the press conference or however, we will reduce the chatter about exit   among ourselves and in the market because I think it’s not an appropriate time for continuing   chatter  I have sympathy with the arguments regarding the corridor outcome largely because it’s   the most familiar, but again, I agreed with the earlier decision  And finally, we haven’t talked   about this much, but I think President Plosser suggested three to five years if we’re going to have   an explicit time frame in the document for asset sales purposes  I thought that also made sense   simply by buying more time because we don’t know exactly how long it’s going to take  So   overall, I am supportive of these  I think this will do the job for the time being    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, regarding the debt ceiling, you   noted two things  One, this could be very disruptive if taken to the limit, and, second, that the   market has not yet priced that into bond prices  When do you think the market will begin to react   to a lack of resolution if we go right up to August 2?    Turning to exhibit 6 on the forecasts of the external sector, my   question relates to China and perhaps to Japan  What, notionally, is the confidence interval you   have around those forecasts for the second half and next year—the sharp bounceback in Japan,   but more importantly, perhaps, the relatively flat and still very strong growth in China  Put   differently, is there any risk of a China slowdown that really does change the global outlook?    I was going to bring this up later, but I think this is an appropriate   time to ask a question raised by Vice Chairman Dudley’s remarks  Even though we will come   back together again in early August, is it appropriate to be doing some contingency planning   around the early August period, just to know what we would do under various circumstances?  I   took Brian’s comments earlier to be that, essentially, he’s clear on operational questions, but if it   turned out to be a big deal, it would be back to the Committee to have to decide how to respond    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall sentiment of our business   contacts and directors in the Sixth District remains positive, but they are not as optimistic as they   were before the last FOMC  Several directors mentioned greater uncertainty around their   cautious optimism for the second half  Few of our contacts cited major changes to their plans for   the remainder of the year  Among the larger contacts we spoke to, the indications of a slowdown   were mixed  Those that expressed disappointment in activity levels cited causes we had heard   before  higher gasoline prices that reduced shopping trips or ate into consumer discretionary   spending and supply chain disruptions that affected auto manufacturing  A large package   June 21–22, 2011 113 of 282              shipping company headquartered in Atlanta—you can guess who it is—has seen a general   slowing of domestic volume year to date  In contrast, the country’s largest home improvement   retailer is seeing very strong traffic in sales volume, to some extent defying broad perceptions of   the economy  Tourism remains quite strong across the region, both international tourists and   domestic  Our New Orleans directors were notably bullish about the energy industry in the Gulf    They foresee strong activity and job growth in the coming year   We asked a number of contacts about the pass-through of higher input costs  The   atmosphere seems to have shifted from resistance on the part of major buyers to being resigned   to some pass-through from suppliers, and a number of contacts across several sectors spoke of   having raised prices or having plans to do so soon  One grocery chain attributed rising fresh-  produce costs to higher fuel costs, and I’m hearing similar accounts from business contacts in   places I wouldn’t expect  The distinction between energy and non-energy consumer goods and   services that was suggested in the first draft of the policy statement may not be so neat a   distinction   Turning to the national outlook in comparison with the Tealbook, the Atlanta Bank’s   forecast and the Tealbook are now essentially the same, whereas earlier there was some   separation in terms of the overall trajectory, with Atlanta being more pessimistic  We decided to   hold to our basic forecast path of rising economic growth and interpret the recent incoming   numbers, particularly the household spending data, as a temporary setback  Our forecast   incorporates a modest second-quarter number, but jumps to a GDP growth number above   3 percent in the third and fourth quarter  I actually find this an awkward moment to make a call   regarding the implications of the recent disappointing data  I am “tentative” about both the   growth and inflation pictures and won’t be holding to my forecast much longer if incoming data   June 21–22, 2011 114 of 282              continue to disappoint  I took note in our recent board meetings of concerns expressed by more   than one director about the economy simply being on a longer-term weak growth path, say, a   2 percent economy  Also, as was mentioned earlier in the financial stability discussion, I think   the shock risk has risen dramatically with the debt ceiling, Greece, and Europe, and as my   question inferred earlier, the potential of a slowdown in China   As regards the balance of risks, I assess the risks to economic growth as heavily, if not   exclusively, weighted to the downside  The alternative scenarios in the Tealbook ably covered   the most obvious downside risks  Regarding inflation, I think there is a reasonable chance that   core inflationary pressures play out for longer than I assume as final prices come to reflect the   influence of elevated commodity prices  I don’t expect this to be on a protracted basis, but I’m   concerned that such a story might adversely affect inflationary sentiment with uncertain   follow-on effects thereafter  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  As I said in   yesterday’s round, I continue to see the most probable path of the economy as expansion at a   moderate pace, and I also continue to forecast subdued inflation once the effects of the earlier oil   and commodity price increases dissipate  But I do think we are at a difficult juncture  The   economic data have underperformed  My outlook, like many, has been marked down   moderately, and there are abundant downside risks as well as increased shock vulnerability  At   the same time, the uncertainty around the inflation outlook has increased, and upside inflation   risks remain  I think maintaining the current extent of accommodation will help mitigate some   of the downside risks to the outlook   Turning to the statement, the characterization of the economy in alternative B is broadly   consistent with my own reading of the current circumstances and outlook  I do think, however,   that the context in which the Committee would be issuing the alternative B language involves   heightened and shifting risks, and I note that the draft statement is silent on risks to the outlook    If the Chairman were not doing a press conference after this meeting, the public would learn   three weeks later that the central tendency of the Committee’s forecast has been written down   somewhat, and the balance of risks adjusted to a meaningful extent  Absent the press   conference, a disconnect might be perceived between the statement and the later accompanying   information  I think today’s press conference affords the Chairman the opportunity, if you wish   or if you get the question, to convey the Committee’s sense of the risk context  But overall I’m   June 21–22, 2011 170 of 282              satisfied with the current draft of alternative B, and I suggest no changes  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
9263,2011-08-01,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Much of what I would say has already   been said  I think that the staff has laid this out well  Actions 1 through 5 are recommended, and   I think they’re routine  I take actions 6, 7, and 8 as sort of contingently recommended, and I   agree with that  Action 8 is very similar to the AMLF that we did in 2008, so there’s a precedent   for that  And as I understood the memo, actions 9 and 10 are laid out as possibilities but not with   an absolutely clear recommendation  Action 10, if I understand it correctly, is similar to action 3   with the requirement of appropriate pricing  So I think those are to be considered, but I don’t   have strong feelings at this point on those  Those are my thoughts  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
9285,2011-08-09,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a question for Dave Wilcox  In   your discussion of unemployment, do you have an explanation for the decline in participation   that we’ve been seeing?  What are the underlying forces causing that decline?    Mr Chairman, a second question for Dave Wilcox  I think I heard   you mention that the rebound in auto manufacturing or assembly in this country in the second   half that you anticipate is associated a lot with Japanese nameplates  Was that the comment?    And do you mean by that foreign nameplates?  Does that include Koreans and others?  Or is it   really specific to Toyota and Honda?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Yesterday’s equity market selloff   certainly gives pause, but I don’t think it obsoletes the views that I prepared as long ago as   Sunday afternoon, the diagnosis that pertains to the context of policy  I wanted to start by saying   that President Bullard in an earlier meeting posed a good question when he asked if there was   ever a time in the past 25 years when uncertainty did not seem higher than at other times, and he   got quite a laugh when he asked about that  I do think the context of this meeting really does   present a lot more uncertainty than whatever the Committee could consider normal  It seems to   me that there’s simply a lot that we don’t know at the moment  We don’t know if the growth-  restraining effects of the first half will fall away as expected  I think the Tealbook nicely   captures the central forecasting challenge of the moment, which is determining the forces   responsible for what it calls the “greater-than-expected restraint on the expansion”  We don’t   know whether the consensus base-case forecast of a stronger second half and stronger 2012 will   materialize  We’re one month into the third quarter, a quarter that the Tealbook projects GDP   growth at 3 percent, with little indication in the data of that level of growth  We really don’t   know how the European debt situation is going to play out in coming weeks  We don’t know   beyond yesterday’s developments and this morning’s, if we’re tracking them without   BlackBerrys, how the market will sort out the implications of the downgrade  We don’t know   whether the projection of inflation settling out will come true, and we don’t really know whether   there are underlying forces at work, forces captured in the Tealbook’s phrases “persistent   spending weakness” and “supply-side corrosion and damage,” that portend a longer and deeper   problem of sluggish growth   The outlook, of course, always involves a lot of uncertainty, but it certainly feels to me   that the combination of uncertainties at this juncture is unusual  And, at least going into this past   August 9, 2011 36 of 162              weekend, it inclined me, obviously excluding extreme financial instability, to emphasize an   agnostic view regarding the outlook  So I am holding to the base-case outlook that I submitted in   my last forecast in June of stronger economic growth and subsiding inflation in the second half,   but with less conviction  The BEA’s NIPA revisions somewhat changed the narrative in my   thinking  The revisions, along with the negative tone of the incoming data, make it harder to   sustain my previous forecast  When I submitted my projections in June, I was thinking of   restraints on economic growth primarily in terms of commodity shocks and the economic fallout   from the earthquake and tsunami disaster in Japan  I think now the list has to be expanded to the   uncertainties associated with the ongoing government debt messes here and in Europe  Friday’s   employment report somewhat took the edge off of accumulating doubts, but at this point, I’m   reluctant to entirely dismiss the possibility of an outright contraction, which is also a change in   my thinking since June  The Tealbook also references the possibility that “the self-equilibrating   tendency of the economy has been greatly weakened by the damage resulting from the financial   crisis” and/or that “the economic weakness reflects structural factors” that have lowered the   potential path of GDP  I think these are plausible scenarios as well, and they imply much longer   periods of relatively slow growth than have been reflected in any of the projections I or the   Committee has published at this point  In many ways, that’s Governor Tarullo’s point  So going   into the past weekend and before yesterday’s market instability, I felt that a wait-and-see   approach to the incoming data over the next weeks or perhaps months is especially warranted   Now let me turn to input from my District, and once again, there is some contrast   between anecdotal reports we’ve heard and the picture presented by the incoming data    Listening to reports from my directors and business contacts, I find it hard to identify major   shifts in overall business conditions in my District  Overall, activity appears to be growing at a   August 9, 2011 37 of 162              modest pace  Business sentiment has slipped a little since June, but I wouldn’t say there has   been a significant deterioration in assessment of the near-term outlook of our various boards of   directors and affiliated business contacts  In fact, for the most part, the feedback across contacts   was not qualitatively different from June  Large firms are still reporting a favorable business   environment, while small firms continue to struggle  Improvements in residential real estate   have been spotty by property type and region, though overall the housing market remains   depressed  Industrial activity is still expanding, but at a softer pace than earlier in the year  Auto   producers and sellers, however, are seeing a pickup in activity following tsunami-related supply   disruptions, and the expectations for auto production and sales are reported to be favorable for   the balance of the year  Consumer spending has slowed, consistent with the national indicators    Retailers continue to note significant differences between upmarket spending, which has been   reasonably good, and middle- to lower-income spending, which has been exceptionally weak    Many households appear to be reprioritizing their spending baskets in response to constraints on   disposable income and heightened uncertainty  The Atlanta Bank’s chairwoman, who represents   the country’s largest home-improvement chain, reports strong sales across stores, with some   emphasis on what might be called “home-value investment spending”   Wage and other compensation pressures in general remain very modest, and commodity   price pressure evident earlier in the year has lessened  The capacity to pass through price   increases seems to be mixed  The same home-improvement retailer expressed surprise at the   willingness of customers to absorb price increases and noted that they expect to test the limits of   that willingness over the second half of the year  A firm that represents several thousand grocery   products opposite supermarkets said their suppliers will be pushing through price increases in the   coming months  A major auto retailer, however, indicated that pricing power has largely played   August 9, 2011 38 of 162              out in that business  Although a few pieces of anecdotal feedback could cast doubt on the   “subsiding headline inflation” scenario, on balance I detected no clear movement of price   pressure in one direction or another   As regards the balance of risks, none of my discussions in the past several weeks have   revealed sentiment that the economy is sliding back into a recession, but the tone of these   discussions was decidedly cautious, and many acknowledged that the downside risks outweighed   those to the upside  I share the view that downside risks to the outlook for economic growth   over the near term have risen, and regarding inflation, I still judge the risks as broadly balanced    Thank you, Mr Chairman    I had the same question as President Lacker because if you think   about the debt markets—the 10-year Treasury, the number of things that are priced off the   10-year Treasury—it’s hard to say that this has created financially more-restrictive conditions   across the board  I think it’s the equity markets themselves and potentially the wealth effect   down the road  But I had the same question, and I’m glad President Lacker brought it up    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Well, I came into the meeting supporting   alternative B, at least as of Sunday afternoon, and I am prepared to support your   recommendation, Mr Chairman, about transferring from alternative A to alternative B the   language that basically employs the idea of it being explicit about the time frame of “extended   period”  I see that as a modest, almost minimalist, but probably meaningful recognition of   what’s happening at the moment, and it certainly overrides the wait-and-see approach that, short   of yesterday’s events, I might have recommended  I think this is a well-calibrated action  It’s   responsive, concrete, but not overreacting  In some respects, I think it buys some time for more-  deliberate planning  I very much support Governor Yellen’s suggestion  Others have made the   August 9, 2011 99 of 162              same suggestion of having a two-day meeting in September to have enough time to do that  And   I don’t mean to sound cavalier, but I also don’t think an explicit time frame on “extended period”   is irreversible  I think most observers understand the conditionality of our policies and   statements  I think that if we were surprised to the upside in terms of economic growth and the   circumstances of the economy, we could certainly reconsider it   I have to be a little cautious  I’d like really to hear more discussion regarding Governor   Yellen’s suggestion of an explicit quantification of an unemployment trigger  It just seems to me   that being explicit on that while being more general and not explicit regarding the inflation   situation may create some misinterpretation  There may be a whole lot of questions about how   we chose that particular number  So at this particular juncture, I guess I just feel it’s better to be   non-explicit than explicit on that  I would like to hear more about what other people have to say   A small thing regarding wording in the statement  I supported the idea of moving from   “will act as needed” to “will employ its policy tools as appropriate”  I understood that the   drafters thought that was stronger language, and I supported it from the point of view of it being   stronger language  I think we need a very strong statement combined with a modest action at the   moment  And I do support the suggestion that Governor Yellen made—that is, to change the   very last paragraph to “is prepared to”  I think, again, the economy and the market are hoping to   hear that we stand ready to act  We will show that with the Chairman’s recommendation, but I   think standing ready to act further is appropriate  That relatively small change of verb conveys   that  Those are my thoughts, Mr Chairman  "
9312,2011-09-20,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I realize you have emphasized that this is   contingency planning  I’d like to focus my attention really on my reactions to the policies   suggested in terms of their immediate potential  There’s a caricature of the French that they tend   to think along the lines of, “It works in practice  Will it work in theory?”  And I think our   situation is, “Will it work in practice, or are we just dealing with psychological operations, and   will they work?”  So let me start with an overview of how I reacted to the whole set of memos   and questions  I doubt that the balance sheet tools will have much real effect through the credit   channel  Looked at on a benefits versus potential costs basis, I think the MEPs are safer   considering the projected modest effects  However, for “psych ops”—to use an Army term—  September 20–21, 2011 61 of 290              effects, the LSAP is much more powerful if we conclude that shock therapy is needed  Dropping   interest on reserves will have little or no effect and carries significant uncertainties  And I’m   unconvinced about, but not closed to, employing explicit unemployment and inflation policy   triggers in a statement versus using the SEPs to communicate participants’ projections  But, as I   said, I’m open to further discussion and could be convinced  And finally, I thought Governor   Tarullo sent out a quite useful memo, and I am substantially in agreement with Governor   Tarullo’s position   Rather than go through each of these points, let me just highlight some thoughts on two   or three of these elements  As I said, I doubt that there will be much in the way of real effect   from the use of our balance sheet tools  I concede that we can drive down long-term rates a bit,   but rates are already low  We’d be doing this in a context of continuing deleveraging  Credit   standards are necessarily higher  There’s plenty of liquidity, and from a business point of view,   even a better revenue outlook from some anticipation of growth may not generate much hiring    I’d like to see further analysis—and my staff and I discussed this at some length— along the   lines of the question, with lower longer-term rates, who—meaning, which borrower class—will   actually borrow and for what purpose, and how much incremental demand will that produce?   My own sense is that longer-term rates will affect mortgage costs for consumers, both   new buyers and those refinancing, and for commercial real estate owners, both new projects and   refinancing  That’s where the long rates will have the most effect, but only if short-term rates   also fall, and that’s uncertain, according to the study that was presented  Are other financed   consumer purchases—namely, autos and other durables—cheaper?  And furthermore, consumer   revolving credit—credit cards and equivalent store charge cards—is very sticky at high rates in   order to absorb credit costs and fraud costs  Most ordinary business credit is at short tenors—  September 20–21, 2011 62 of 290              that is, revolving credit that is typically priced around one year and term loans in the five- to   eight-year range  So the best chance for lower longer-term rates to stimulate sustained activity is   consumer spending from lower mortgage costs due to refinancing, with some cash flow that is   freed up going into increased savings  And I ask, what’s the recent response from the point of   view of refinancing to lower rates, which have been declining since the first of the year or since   about April, per Brian Sack’s exhibit 3?  I don’t know what the credit aggregates have done, but   I think if we look at that, we could get a sense of what the response is to lower rates; some of that   is certainly contained by the fact that many mortgage holders are underwater and therefore not   pursuing refinance   Regarding interest on reserves, I’m skeptical that reducing interest on reserves alone will   do much to stimulate more economic activity  Bankers don’t perceive a business tradeoff   between 25 basis points on reserves and 300 to 400 basis points average yield on a loan, and for   what it’s worth, bankers tell us that dropping interest on reserves will not incentivize them to   make loans they wouldn’t otherwise make  One banker did suggest that eliminating interest on   reserves would cause some layoffs  Also, I think there’s a question related to the FDIC   assessment  Because of the FDIC assessment, interest on reserves at 10 basis points would   imply a net tax on large domestic banks, and if we were to go so far as LSAP 3, that would   increase the tax if implemented  So the question I have is, have we engaged the FDIC at all on   their continued policy of applying this assessment, because it does affect, at least in some   scenarios, monetary policy?  I’m also concerned, although I heard President Rosengren argue the   opposite, that there would be disruption of short-term funding markets  I think this is something   of an unknown  So I ask, why should we take the risk of doing that?   September 20–21, 2011 63 of 290              One final comment on the targeting of unemployment within a framework as portrayed in   paragraphs 2 and 4  As I said, I’m unconvinced but not closed minded on the subject, but I’m   concerned that labor markets today are very confusing  There is much we do not understand, and   an explicit number will be taken as a harder commitment than perhaps we can back up with our   understanding of how labor markets are in fact working  Those are my comments  Thank you,   Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Business conditions in the Sixth District   remain in positive territory, but anxiety levels have risen  Most firms report that they expect   their businesses to post gains in the second half that are marginally better than the sluggish   September 20–21, 2011 130 of 290              growth in the first half  Forward expectations have deteriorated compared with the beginning of   the year, but most firms are not yet preparing for an outright decline in business activity  There   are still pockets of relatively strong activity  Tourism is doing well  Auto production has   rebounded nicely  Freight traffic has moderated a little but is still strong  Port contacts report   that export activity remains strong, and they have seen no significant drop-off in recent months   During the intermeeting period, we mobilized our regional network to get a grassroots   perspective on the labor market  The key takeaway from this effort is that the labor market   situation is complicated  Firms are resistant to add to their payrolls  As reasons, most cite a   combination of soft demand, uncertainty about the course of the economy, and uncertainty over   regulatory and fiscal policy  Where jobs are available, structural or structural-like impediments   seem to be at work  A number of contacts describe the hard and soft skill sets of applicants as   substandard  Consequently, hires are made only if and when the right candidate presents himself   or herself  Some workers are finding it difficult to reset expectations about wages and personal   lifestyle  Some potential hires have to be wooed away from unemployment, which is preferred   to some offers of work because of extended unemployment assistance  Despite earlier evidence   casting doubt, firms of various stripes continue to say that “house lock” is inhibiting relocation,   which has complicated business expansion plans and contributed to persistent unemployment to   some extent  Taken together, labor markets appear to be restrained by a host of both supply-side   and demand-side negatives   During the intermeeting period, my staff also conducted a formal survey of business   inflationary conditions and sentiment  We noted a very modest rise in expected inflation over   the coming year compared with readings a few months ago  While firms say their pricing power   remains limited, they now do not see much room to offset cost pressures by productivity-  September 20–21, 2011 131 of 290              improvement measures  The firms in our survey see rising materials costs as having the greatest   potential for upward cost pressure in spite of some recent stabilization  At the same time, the   survey data indicate that potential for labor cost pressure has intensified a little in recent months    Overall, shifts in business inflationary sentiment since midyear have been modest and do not yet   suggest an unanchoring of business cost expectations   Turning to the national outlook, I have not adjusted my economic growth outlook from   the August meeting  My baseline for growth is essentially the same as the Tealbook baseline,   which is similar to the consensus of private forecasters  However, I have been surprised by and   disappointed with recent inflation data and judge the inflation trend to be near the upper end of   the desired long-term range  Given the unexpected persistence of elevated headline and core   inflation readings, I’m incorporating into my outlook less assurance that inflationary pressures   will subside as predicted in the Tealbook base case   As regards the assessment of risks, I see the risk to my economic growth projection as   elevated and weighted to the downside—no change in that assessment from the August meeting    I would add that the risk of financial system instability did intensify in recent weeks because of   the European situation  In addition, the fact that I and others have repeatedly underforecasted   actual inflation, combined with what I’m hearing about the declining ability of firms to offset   further cost pressures, leads me to shift inflation risk to the upside  A final comment on the   balance of risks  The recent behavior of prices has deviated from earlier projections and, in my   view, made the Tealbook alternative scenario “Greater Supply-Side Damage” more compelling    It seems to me to be an entirely plausible characterization of the economic environment we now   face   September 20–21, 2011 132 of 290              I want to take one more moment to try to summarize my sense of the economic context in   which we will consider a range of policy actions today and tomorrow  The economy is growing   modestly and, I expect, will grow slightly faster in the near term and medium term  Revisions of   earlier numbers have evoked a downshifting of growth expectations, but not a forecast of   outright deterioration of the economy  I am wrestling with the recognition that our forecasts   have both overestimated growth and underestimated inflation, and this introduces a degree of   ambiguity that is influencing my views about policy; I’ll address that in the policy go-round   tomorrow  Let me conclude with one parenthetical comment  The atmosphere in which the   market and public are anticipating policy and in which we are making policy has deteriorated in   the sense that the recognition of slow growth and persistent unemployment has spread and   intensified  Since last July, we’ve seen the GDP revisions, the raising of the debt ceiling—a   spectacle that dominated attention—the downgrade, a volatile equity market, a worsening   situation in Europe, and a bad jobs report following earlier weak reports  In my opinion, all of   this has contributed to a public psychology of impending crisis  While this may color how   policy decisions will be perceived, I don’t believe we should give it undue emphasis in crafting   this meeting’s decision  Thank you, Mr Chairman    To follow up on the mortgage-backed securities questions, if by   reinvesting we’re putting pressure on those rates, we’re also putting pressure on Treasury rates   that are often references for mortgages  Is it possible that our prepayment assumptions need to   be adjusted so that the actual duration of the mortgage-backed securities portfolio will somewhat   soften and, therefore we have a two-step duration concern?  One is that we are changing our mix,   and the second is we have to rethink what the prepayment assumption is  Is that possible, Brian?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I usually begin my policy round   statement declaring support for one of the alternatives, and that is usually alternative B, which is   appropriate for a member of the quiet middle  Today, I am going to take a different approach    Because I am a nonvoter at this meeting, I am going to give myself permission to put some   arguments on the table for the sake of devil’s advocacy  As I stressed in the economy round, I   would argue that the ambiguity of the moment should give pause, pointing to a preference for   alternative C at this meeting  One might prefer alternative C not out of strong conviction that no   action is called for, but out of preference for not acting quite yet  The case for holding off is   included in the broader Tealbook case for alternative C, which Bill English just recited  I would   add to that case, as devil’s advocate, that an approach that might have the most positive impact in   jolting the economy out of its apparent torpor is a binary one  By that I mean either do nothing   or go all in, but avoid incremental half-measures   Let me present three reasons for holding our fire at this meeting  First, the hard data and   anecdotal reports suggest that the second half of the year will be better than the first half, even if   not by a lot  The staff Tealbook forecast assumes that an alternative B is required to generate   this outcome  I would argue that skepticism on this point is warranted  Even conceding that the   very modest rate effects assumed by the staff will be realized from an alternative B policy,   marginally lower longer-term rates won’t stimulate much additional borrowing and business   September 20–21, 2011 221 of 290              activity producing job growth  Lower longer-term rates might stimulate some refinance activity   by homeowners and commercial real estate owners, but short of some top-down program of   comprehensive mortgage refinancing, the effect is likely to be marginal on real-side activity    Second, while acknowledging the sentiment that the Tealbook benchmark implies an   uncomfortably slow decline of the unemployment rate, one could be just as uncomfortable with   the persistent upward drift in core inflation measures  As the Tealbook shows in charts labeled   “Evolution of the Staff Forecast” on page 31, misses giving rise to upward revisions in   unemployment forecasts have been matched by misses in upward revisions of core inflation   forecasts  A benchmark forecast that has a fairly large drop in inflation premised on an   unemployment rate projected to remain high, in my opinion, should be questioned  A third   argument for holding fire is to let a little time pass to gain perspective on the circumstances the   Committee is facing  Per this argument, sentiment is being weighed down by an unfortunate   confluence of bad or troubling news that arrived in a very short span of time  By that I mean   benchmark revisions, the debt ceiling spectacle, the S&P ratings downgrade, Europe, the jobs   report, Hurricane Irene, and inflation numbers   I would argue that, considering both the data and the reports from contacts, the economy   is not presently on a slippery slope to recession  This view argues for giving ourselves a little   more distance from the events of late July and early August before concluding that the economic   landscape has changed so fundamentally that the economy cannot achieve escape velocity   without further action on our part   Turning to the action side of what they called a binary approach, I would argue this  If   there is no progress toward firmer economic growth, and there is actual deterioration and/or it   becomes clear that the European issues or the fiscal mess in this country are likely to suppress   September 20–21, 2011 222 of 290              economic activity going forward, stronger action than alternative B is needed, conditioned, of   course, on no deterioration of the inflation outlook  It may be the case that a sequence of   incremental policy steps ultimately accumulates to a big step  But if a jolt to the patient is what   is needed, one big step may be preferable  So going all in—the expression I used earlier—could   resemble President Bullard’s proposal an open-ended, quantitative easing commitment to be   held in place until the Committee is satisfied that a sustainable recovery is firmly established or   until we have to change course to meet our price stability mandate  Again, I am presenting these   arguments in a devil’s advocate vein, not in outright opposition to alternative B   Switching to angel’s advocacy, if that is a term, regarding alternative B, just a couple of   comments  First, I favor 3′ as being somewhat more flexible  Second, I am sympathetic to the   mortgage-backed securities reinvestment proposal  I think it might make a difference  If I could   wave a magic wand once to help demand, it would be to lower all mortgage payments in the   country  Third, in response to President Bullard’s suggestion, I agree that there is something   slightly wrong with the description of inflation in paragraph 1  A simple fix would be to add the   word “somewhat,” “inflation has moderated somewhat,” to try to capture a little bit of the   ambiguity and slight disappointment we feel in the way inflation has evolved during the year    Thank you, Mr Chairman    But not “quantitative easing”  [Laughter]    Mr Chairman, there was such a call for contingency planning that   November seems, at least under certain circumstances, pretty far away  Is there any thought in   your mind as to how we can address that between meetings?   September 20–21, 2011 258 of 290               The process sounds like react to memos and circulate views and   essentially do it all that way between now and November    Well, we may be overtaken by events  You never know    Yes  Something like a videoconference where we can have a   spontaneous exchange of views as opposed to the formality of reacting to a memo and   circulating that and then reacting to someone else’s reaction, and so forth    I really wasn’t, in my mind, making a distinction  I’m just noting   there’s such a call, and November may be too late in some respects  "
9340,2011-11-01,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, would like to compliment the staff   on the fine work they did in advance of the meeting  I see this discussion of alternative   frameworks—and I hope I am not getting ahead of the discussion—as boiling down to two   questions  The first is  Should the Committee shore up its existing framework to be more   effective?  To that, I would answer yes  The second question is  In light of the extraordinary   circumstances of the economy, should the Committee shake things up, go beyond the existing   framework, and go in another direction?  To that question, at the moment at least, I would   answer no  I don’t think the cost-benefit or the risk-reward tradeoffs justify such a move  I do   see that clarification and reaffirmation of the Committee’s basic framework and strategy, and an   explicit inflation target, could serve to make the existing and future policy elements more   effective  It will serve to reassure the public that there is coherence to the Committee’s approach   November 1–2, 2011 47 of 282              and remove some uncertainty at a time when uncertainty is a major negative factor weighing on   the economy   Now let me turn to the questions posed by the staff, and I will paraphrase these questions    Is a flexible inflation-targeting framework consistent with the dual mandate?  Yes, I think   flexible inflation targeting, with flexibility around the price-stability mandate, allows for   balancing the two objectives in the short term when required while still encompassing the belief   that the two mandates are complementary over the longer term   Should we enunciate it as our working framework, perhaps in a way similar to the exit   strategy statement?  I think it would be constructive to clarify our working framework in a   general sense, and the method used in communication of the exit strategy seems like a reasonable   approach  Also, the consensus-building process that preceded the addendum to the minutes I   thought was quite effective  I also think it would be useful to provide more specifics about   certain operational definitions relating to an inflation objective  We might put more definition   around what is meant by short term, medium term, and long term  For example, we might state   that over a long-term horizon of five years or longer, the Committee believes an average year-  over-year growth rate of 2 percent, as measured by the overall PCE index, is consistent with the   price-stability mandate   We might then state that over a medium-term horizon of three to five years, the   Committee seeks to maintain an average year-over-year growth and overall inflation in a range   —and this is for example only—of 1 to 3 percent  This range reflects the intent to keep overall   inflation reasonably close to the long-term target while maintaining the flexibility to respond to   economic conditions and shocks as required by the other half of the dual mandate  In the short   run—a period of up to three years, and a horizon captured by the Committee’s SEP—the   November 1–2, 2011 48 of 282              Committee, we might say, aims to closely monitor underlying inflation trends and inflation   expectations  In such a scheme, there is a cascading from explicit long-term objective to   performance within a range in the medium term to monitoring underlying inflation expectations   in the short term   Should the Committee announce conditional commitments?  If so, how to communicate   them?  It is difficult to argue against the principle of credible commitment to an optimal policy   path  That said, I view an explicit threshold for the unemployment rate as potentially   problematic  Our understanding of participation trends, the equilibrium rate of unemployment,   the lag in unemployment relative to GDP growth, and any number of other recent labor market   developments suggest to me that an explicit threshold for unemployment is risky  I am also   concerned about combining a real-time threshold for unemployment with an inflation threshold   based on forecast, because the realization of an unemployment rate result is immediately   verifiable, while an inflation forecast is inherently speculative  I am concerned that the public   would interpret such conditionality as a de facto subordination of the inflation objective to an   unemployment threshold  I am more comfortable with the communication method used in   paragraph 4′ in this meeting’s proposals, which treats the interest rate, inflation, and   unemployment rate conditionality symmetrically—an approach indicating the Committee’s   expectations of conditions that will prevail prior to commencing exit  If the Committee decides   to be more activist, I think we need a nominal anchor to reassure the public that we have not lost   sight of, and are not jettisoning, the inflation or price-stability objective  The public wants to   know how much tolerance we will admit around the 2 percent inflation objective   What about price-level targeting or nominal income targeting?  Although both of these   options have merit, both entail serious communications challenges, as the staff memos have   November 1–2, 2011 49 of 282              pointed out  My concern is that a shift to either option, but particularly nominal income   targeting, would be viewed as a significant change of the Committee’s approach  This might   introduce more uncertainty about monetary policy and its intent at a time when we should be   trying to reduce uncertainty   Finally, a more general question  What steps should the Committee take to provide more   information to the public about the expected course of policy?  I continue to favor inclusion of   implied policy paths in the quarterly SEPs  If the Committee decides to move in the direction of   explicit employment and inflation thresholds in the statement, then a more complete rethinking   of the SEPs seems necessary  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just to continue on the question of MF   Global, a couple of weeks ago, as you see on chart 12, there was—and I hesitate to call it a “run”   —but certainly a lot of pressure on Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which has eased  Then,   we get the first casualty with MF Global  My broad question, Brian, is  Are you more or less   concerned about financial instability now than two weeks ago?  How is that trending?    But their reliance on short-term funding is a lot different, too   November 1–2, 2011 112 of 282               Do you see any dynamic of predatory market players essentially   gaining any victory with this one and moving on to the next most vulnerable?      No, we don’t see anything like that?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll do my best to ensure that we   complete this meeting by nine o’clock tonight  [Laughter]   In our recent round of board meetings and contacts, the majority of directors and business   contacts in the Sixth District described activity as expanding at a slow pace  While most reports   were a bit more upbeat than before the last FOMC, a plurality of directors and their contacts   stated that they had revised down expectations for their firms’ performance  Two directors   representing the country’s second-largest retailer and largest airline expressed pessimism about   the business outlook, citing continuing uncertainty and weak confidence emanating particularly   from the political process  Overall, I would characterize what we heard over the past two weeks   as falling in a range from “still somewhat pessimistic” to “very cautiously optimistic”  In our   questioning of directors and other contacts, we asked about intentions to hire or reduce staffing   in the coming months  Although we heard some rumblings about reducing employment, the   modal response was no near-term intention either to hire beyond replacement requirements or   seasonal needs or to downsize staffing  Most firms seem to be holding steady as regards staffing   In our formal survey of business inflation sentiment—this time, it involved   164 respondents—we detected less pressure on input costs than earlier in the year  Also, no   significant wage pressures were noted  However, the vast majority of respondents noted that   they intended to pass on at least some of any cost increase to their customers  Businesses in the   November 1–2, 2011 137 of 282              transportation sector noted that they have faced little resistance to surcharges to cover fuel cost   increases   Turning to my sense of the outlook, Atlanta’s forecast is very similar to the Tealbook’s   through 2013  In the last year of the forecast horizon—2014—we depart from the Tealbook’s   trajectory and project flatter growth, reflecting the weight of fiscal drag, continued deleveraging,   and restrained consumer confidence  Our forecast has unemployment above the Tealbook’s   2014 projection and above the 6½ to 7 percent projections suggested in version A1 of the   Tealbook draft statements  At the same time, our inflation forecast stays in the neighborhood of   2 percent over the forecast horizon, while the Tealbook numbers stay south of 2 percent    Therefore, we have assumed less slack in the economy than the Board staff   To be more specific, I have a strong sense that the labor market involves much more in   the way of inchoate rigidities, inefficiencies, and behavioral impediments than fully appreciated    Now, admittedly, I am basing this sense on a lot of anecdotal input, but here is some of what   we’re picking up  With respect to the relatively slow pace at which reported job openings are   being filled, we are in fact told that some vacancies are so-called purple squirrel openings  If a   purple squirrel shows up, the company will hire; otherwise, the company waits  [Laughter]  My   sense is that this employer attitude will change if confidence increases and demand picks up    But we are also consistently told of many skills mismatches  These mismatches are related to   hard skills in specific industries and job types, but we hear much more broadly of issues related   to soft skills, such as basic work habits, attitudes, and expectations  I frequently hear of jobs   going unfilled because a large number of applicants have difficulty passing basic requirements   like drug tests or simply demonstrating the requisite work ethic  As an example, one contact in   the staffing industry told us that during their pretesting process, a majority—actually, 60 percent   November 1–2, 2011 138 of 282              of applicants—failed to answer “0” to the question of how many days a week it’s acceptable to   miss work  [Laughter]  Now, I am not suggesting that these are necessarily new phenomena    But for a variety of reasons, employers seem to be paying much more attention to the quality of   prospective hires than pre-recession  We also hear that job requirements have been updated to   combine a wider spectrum of performance competencies, such as those that are required for   receipt of the ACT’s National Career Readiness Certificate   There is anecdotal evidence of structural shifts  Companies of various sizes in various   industries report moving to increase their permanent part-time workforce, typically as a way to   manage uncertainties about health-care expenses and requirements  Now, I stress that these are   anecdotal accounts, and the effects are difficult to quantify  But combining these and other   inputs with the somewhat confusing participation data suggests to me that a great deal is going   on in labor markets that we don’t fully grasp  And I am not quite ready to argue that all this   means the structural rate of unemployment is permanently higher, but I am inclined to think that   clear progress in the labor market will lag economic growth more than usual  Further, I am   somewhat skeptical of the capacity of monetary policy measures to speed up the process   Let me conclude with comments on the balance of risks  I see risks to growth to the   downside  Financial market volatility, slow jobs growth, and weak confidence make the   economy vulnerable to any number of adverse shocks  Regarding inflation, I judge the risks to   be broadly balanced, reflecting some ambivalence on the question of the amount of slack in the   economy  It is possible that the high unemployment rate reflects more slack than I have assumed   in my inflation outlook  But as my earlier recitation of anecdotal input suggests, the labor   market could be struggling under the weight of forces that have raised the natural rate of   unemployment for at least some time  I also think there is a chance that the influence of   November 1–2, 2011 139 of 282              commodity prices and other pressures on core inflation numbers could play out over a longer   period than I have assumed, and inflationary sentiment could be adversely affected as a result    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m going to support alternative B  I do   not support alternative A2 because I don’t favor additional asset purchases at this time  But I do   have to express some sympathy for alternative A1, with its policy thrust of pushing the funds rate   guidance further out to 2014   My own forecast projects a funds rate near zero at least through mid-2014  Considering   the language options for paragraph 4 of alternative A1, I am sympathetic to the first option   because, as I said, it reflects my forecast  I’m also sympathetic to the second option for   paragraph 4 because, in my view, it makes sense to move in the direction of policy conditionality   in terms of projected economic outcomes, versus guidance based only on a calendar date  I am   less sympathetic to the third option in paragraph 4 because I think its introduction of an explicit   unemployment threshold could prove to be a step too far  For reasons that I expressed yesterday,   November 1–2, 2011 209 of 282              I am concerned that the unemployment problem is multifaceted, not well understood, and quite   possibly not as responsive as we might hope to a sustained accommodative monetary policy   stance  I am reluctant to connect the path of policy so concretely to what might show itself as   time passes to be a problematic number that is taken as a trigger  Despite my sympathy for   alternative A1, paragraphs 4 and 4′, I lean to alternative B at this meeting  I would prefer a “stay   the course” approach for the time being  The economy is improving, and I think we would be   prudent to take a breather and see how the European and congressional fiscal stories play out and   the economy evolves     I think it would be best to avoid the impression of a policy change, and the easiest way to   do that is to stick with our previous language  I say this because I do not really think the   presumption of a very low funds rate through mid-2014 is a change from the consensus view that   has prevailed since August  Because alternative A1, with the first paragraph 4 option, does   reflect this reality, I do not strongly object to it in substance but advise against it at this meeting   as a matter of tactics  If the Committee goes in that direction, I would hope we might convey   that pushing the horizon of the current funds rate policy to mid-2014 is more an extension and   continuation of the August policy decision than a change in the implied degree of stimulus   relative to September  This could perhaps be done through the Chairman’s comments on the   SEP   As regards the language of alternative B, I prefer no change at this meeting  As I already   implied, I do not object strenuously to the change that comes off a date and allows a rolling   approach  It does suggest an extension, as I said, which is consistent with my forecast, but that   may be too narrow a point  It’s early enough, it seems to me, to treat this tactically at this   November 1–2, 2011 210 of 282              meeting  So all things considered, I prefer the existing “mid-2013” language  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    The dropping of “significant” is okay with me, I think, at this time   because of the slight improvement in the economy  "
9363,2011-11-28,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I really have an FYI that leads to a   question  I take it from remarks earlier about the idea of a network of bilateral swap   arrangements that you would draw the line with the G-7 currencies  552 USC (b)(4)  , who’s the governor of the central bank, and in a private   discussion, he made an appeal  Even though they have quite ample reserves at the moment, he   made an appeal for a swap line because they are concerned about the turbulence that could come   out of Europe that would affect hot money flows back and forth into  552 USC (b)(4)    So that’s the FYI    Maybe the Board has already heard officially from  552 USC (b)(4)   or some other country, but I wanted to   mention that  The question, really, is the following  Is the current thinking that we would draw   the line with simply G-7 countries?  "
9381,2011-12-13,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  David, I think you just answered my   question, but I noted in yesterday’s Wall Street Journal two comments in an article; one, that the   Federal Reserve, using a different set of data, said last week that the saving rate rose markedly in   the third quarter to 74 percent, and the second comment was that Fed data suggest that income   may be rising faster than preliminary reports from the Commerce Department  I think you just   December 13, 2011 20 of 198              answered that, but can you summarize what your bottom line is in trying to sort out these   indicators?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since the November meeting, the data   have mostly surprised positively to the upside, and the economic environment feels better, but   despite somewhat better-than-expected incoming data—and I would add the tone of reports from   Sixth District directors and contacts—I have not changed my outlook from the November FOMC   submission   As regards to directors and contacts, they’re saying that business is good, but they also   don’t seem to be buying it yet as a trend  My baseline, which is broadly in line with the   Tealbook through 2012, sees GDP growth next year at around 27 percent, inflation contained at   or below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, and unemployment continuing to decline slowly,   notwithstanding the recent sharp fall in the household survey  In short, a pretty much   mainstream outlook of moderate expansion   December 13, 2011 32 of 198              The key restraining factors that are materially influencing this outlook are three in my   mind  First, the situation in Europe constitutes both a factor incorporated into my forecast for the   real economy in the near term and a downside risk  I think the discussion in the Tealbook does a   nice job of distinguishing among the export channel, the asset price channel, and the financial   linkages channel  The export channel effect seems to be already largely baked into the outlook    The asset price channel effect and the prospect of severe financial market disruption propagated   through financial linkages are more contingencies in my mind and, therefore, part of the balance   of risks equations   Second, we continue to hear the repeating theme of uncertainty and its companion theme,   weak business and consumer confidence, as a restraining force on the recovery  Whether or not   the times are actually more uncertain than in the past, our contacts clearly think they are  To   gauge the current uncertainty mental map, if you will, in our District, we polled our 44 directors   and other District contacts during the intermeeting period on the question of sources of   uncertainty influencing business decisions  Two uncertainties dominated  economic   performance, defined as the sustainability of demand; and economic policy, and this being   mostly nonmonetary matters such as regulation and taxes  Other unknowns, such as global   economic and financial conditions (you can read that as Europe), credit availability, and health   care costs seem to be considerably smaller influences on current decisionmaking  I think it’s   realistic to conclude that the uncertainties that are contributing to a conservative approach to   investment in fixed capital and labor are likely to be part of the economic picture for quite a   while   A third factor is the lattice, you might call it, of recognized conditions and structural   elements that are or likely will be drags on growth in employment  These include housing sector   December 13, 2011 33 of 198              factors like home prices, construction activity, and continuing foreclosures; fiscal drag; labor   market dysfunction; weak income growth; and PCE growth, drawing on a saving rate that may   not be sustainable   Because of the tenuous character of the current situation, I give more-than-normal   attention to the downside alternatives laid out in the Tealbook  The “European Crisis with   Severe Spillovers” scenario continues to be plausible  I am less concerned about the   “Homegrown Recession” scenario absent a shock from Europe  The “Further Disinflation”   scenario cannot be dismissed, given the apparent global slowdown and the current limitation on   the potency of monetary policy  I perceive downside risk to the economic growth outlook  For   now, I’m holding to the view that the risks to the inflation outlook are balanced  The “Further   Disinflation” scenario frames the downside  On the upside, I’m taking into account my District’s   most recent business inflation survey that reveals a growing concern about price pressure from   labor costs   To summarize, momentum in the economy seems to be building, but the outlook is really   very cautiously positive  There are a number of restraining forces already detailed  I see   downside risk to economic growth and the inflation risks as roughly balanced  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support Alternative B  I believe a stay-  the-course approach is appropriate for the time being  As I said in the economy round, I expect   the most likely outcome is that growth will continue to improve modestly, inflation will settle out   at acceptable levels, and the labor market will improve gradually  This outlook is about as good   as can be achieved in the face of the current set of headwinds and drags on the economy—factors   December 13, 2011 94 of 198              likely to be unresponsive to aggressive further stimulus  I think it is appropriate to acknowledge   downside risks, but not act on them at this meeting  There certainly can be circumstances that   justify taking out insurance against downside risks, but with the biggest downside risk being   associated with contingent developments in Europe, it’s not clear to me that this is such a   circumstance   As regards the statement language, I favor minimal changes beyond the updating of the   description of current economic conditions  I think that materially changing language beyond   updating the description of conditions could be disruptive  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, want to thank the subcommittee  I   know this was hard work, I could tell that in Charlie Plosser’s voice on the phone  [Laughter]   I will respond to the questions as presented  First, regarding the enhancement to the SEP,   I support the subcommittee’s recommendation and favor implementing it with the January SEP    I also support considering the inclusion of a question about balance sheet assumptions in the SEP   December 13, 2011 156 of 198              questionnaire and summarizing responses as part of the narrative  The staff assumptions about   the balance sheet path seem like a reasonable benchmark on which to build that narrative  Down   the road, however, this could be somewhat challenging  I see a difference between publishing   the very familiar and relatively simple federal funds rate information, and trying to explain   participants’ various views on the balance sheet with all of the different exit scenarios and   preferences that we will be considering at some stage, as well as other influences on the balance   sheet—for example, use of the swap line  I see that as conceivably a bit more challenging   But in general, I support considering further enhancements noted by the subcommittee  It   could be especially useful to provide information about the linkages between participants’ policy   projections and their economic forecasts  I am less convinced, however, that information or   commentary about the participants’ sense of the balance of risks around policy projections would   be all that useful   President Fisher has offered some useful cautionary points  I would like to make a   couple of counterarguments  I am not so concerned about a succession of quarterly forecasts that   include policy forecasts putting pressure on the Committee to stick to prior forecasts or risk   disappointing markets  I don’t believe market participants will fixate on past statements unless   there is a stark difference from one to the next  I think market participants understand that we   are constantly reappraising the path of the economy and reoptimizing appropriate policy  Also,   markets understand that response to shocks and unexpected developments is part of   policymaking  The markets will see the policy forecasts as useful information but understand   them for what they are  Most market participants understand that the composition of the   Committee will change and can factor that into their processing of the information   December 13, 2011 157 of 198              Turning to the statement of longer-run goals and policy strategy, I support the adoption of   the statement drafted by the subcommittee  Like many, I had some small nits to pick  I   conveyed those in a detailed memo a week ago Monday, so I am not going to repeat them here  I   am in favor of treating the statement as a living, breathing document, to be reaffirmed at the   annual organizational meeting in January, although I agree with President George and others that   in all likelihood, as a statement of guiding principles, we should not be adjusting it frequently    Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
9405,2013-10-16,LOCKHART,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have two questions for either Bill or   Simon  First, as regards numbers 8 and 9, where we would actually be removing securities from   the market, is there an interpretation that we would be forbearing in some way?  Is there an   implicit forbearance associated with the Fed’s taking securities out of the markets that have due   dates in the coming days?  First question    In terms of the independence or perception-of-independence   question—again, this is a little bit more of an atmospheric question—do you see a bright line   between coupon payments and principal payments?  That is, for those securities that involve a   principal payment due, is there likely to be a perception that that’s materially a different step   than coupon payments?  "
