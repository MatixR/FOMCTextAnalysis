636,1989-10-03," That's all that you'd be doing, Governor  -16-    10/3/89   It's the same as the vote of directors of a bank ratifying loans made by the bank The loans are [already] made "
755,1990-03-27," Hopefully, it'll never get to a court But--   As you know, Governor Angell, the Board's General Counsel in 1962 issued an opinion with respect to the System's authority to resume foreign exchange operations   It was all three Warehousing was part of that opinion; there's no question about that That opinion justifies the warehousing of open market purchases of foreign exchange from the Treasury For that purpose the Treasury is in the--   I don't think so Again, that's been the Board's position for 28 years and the Congress has passed a statute which, in effect--I don't want to put too much emphasis on this-- sanctions the System's practice The statute authorizes the Federal Reserve to invest the proceeds of its foreign exchange operations in foreign government bonds and obligations It specifically enacted [this legislation at the] request the Federal Reserve for that purpose And it seems to me that that act by the Congress very much [strengthens] the System's position on this--   It has never been tested, no "
1146,1991-05-14," No, I think these are technical The major reason is that the Committee is required by law to have a fee schedule for processing requests under the Freedom of Information Act, so we came forth with these recommendations Because we had to do so, we suggested certain other changes to the rules to update them They are all technical; they don't result in any substantive change in any of the disclosure policies of the Committee "
1625,1992-11-17," This Committee is not subject to the Sunshine Act   Not subject to it at all   There are exemptions The FOMC is exempt   Yes   The Board of Governors is subject to the Sunshine Act; therefore, we have an obligation to open the meetings to the public unless we find some exemption   The discount rate is the responsibility of the Board of Governors and we have to go through the procedures of Government in the Sunshine, but we close the meeting   Financial speculation   I think the tape of this meeting is destroyed as soon as the--   Legally if someone asked for the tape before it's destroyed, we'd have to go through the tape and we could delete the recommendations and opinions We'd have to turn over the segregable facts  -63-    11/17/92   No question "
1683,1992-12-22, Right 
1951,1993-11-16," I will, Mr Chairman Mr Chairman and members of the Committee, there are two federal statutes that bear on the issues before the Committee this morning of public access to the existing transcripts of FOMC meetings and to tapes, transcripts, or other types of records of future FOMC meetings, should those detailed records be prepared in the future These are the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Federal Records Act (FRA) FOIA governs what information the FOMC must release to the public and when The FRA governs what records the FOMC must maintain As explained in the memo, I believe that under FOIA the Committee is entitled, but not required, to withhold from public disclosure most of the material in each of the existing transcripts as well as in memoranda of discussion (MOD) type documents, should they be prepared for future meetings There are two relevant provisions in FOIA Exemption (4) would protect confidential information from [foreign] central banks and from individual businesses I don't think there's any question about that Exemption (5) would protect the Committee's deliberations By that I mean the discussion and debate among the Committee members before they reach a decision on the directive or other monetary policy matters This would cover the recommendations by staff as well as views and recommendations of individual members leading up to the time of decision Factual portions of the transcripts would have to be released, however, where they could be reasonably segregated from the deliberative materials These types of factual materials would include the vote, the attendance, and material that was already public or non-confidential The view that public disclosure of the transcript is not required by FOIA is supported by the 1976 decision in the Merrill case against the FOMC There the lower court, the district court, held that the FOMC was required by FOIA to disclose only the reasonably separable factual portions of the two memoranda of discussion at issue in that case The great bulk of the material-- running as high as 85 to 90 percent of those documents--was in fact withheld under the deliberative exemption  I should note at this point that FOIA does not protect the transcripts or any information of the FOMC from Congress I'm only    11/16/93  talking at this point about release to the public While FOIA literally protects most of the transcripts, the Committee needs to consider the new FOIA policy recently announced by the President and the Attorney General That policy is designed to promote maximum disclosure of information within the Federal government Under the new policy the Justice Department has stated it will not defend an agency's decision to withhold information unless the agency reasonably foresees harm to important governmental or private interests protected by the exemption that is claimed by the agency In accordance with the Committee's instructions, Ernie Patrikis and I discussed the impact of this new policy on the transcripts with the Justice Department official responsible for administering the new policy We described to him the Committee's deliberative process and the Committee's view regarding the need to protect from premature release confidential information as well as information regarding its deliberations in order to maintain the high quality of monetary policy decisionmaking The Justice Department official's response was quite positive He stated that the new policy was intended to end automatic invocation of FOIA exemptions and instead require a careful, case-by- case consideration of the harm that might result from discretionary disclosure Based upon our description, the Department official stated that it appeared that the Committee could satisfy this new policy He also agreed that exemption (4) would cover the central bank information and that exemption (5) appeared to be relevant to cover the deliberative materials I judged from what he said that the Department would defend the nondisclosure by the Committee of transcripts or other records of its meetings, certainly meetings for the more recent years As the memo points out, there is an issue that at some point in time the sensitivity of deliberations in older transcripts might diminish to the point where the harm to the deliberative process of the Committee is outweighed by the benefits to scholars and other members of the public from access to these documents  If the Committee decides to prepare and release, with a time lag, MODs or edited transcripts for past or future meetings, the issue arises as to whether a tape or transcript used to prepare the final document must also be retained The Federal Records Act governs this issue The FRA states that an agency record may be discarded only with the approval of the Archivist of the United States To obtain that approval the agency must prepare and submit to the Archivist a schedule which the Archives is required to publish for public comment The staff has had several discussions with the Archivist's office--the last as late as yesterday--regarding whether transcripts or tapes need to be retained under the Federal Records Act if an edited transcript or MOD type document were prepared and retained Our discussions indicate that there is a different treatment for the past transcripts than for those that may be prepared for future meetings Based upon our discussions, it is likely that for future meetings, after an MOD type document is prepared and approved by the Committee on a fairly contemporaneous basis, the Archivist would find that the tapes and transcripts used to prepare the MOD were merely temporary working materials and could be dispensed with once a schedule was approved by the Archivist This advice was based on our description of the MOD as a near transcript-like document reflecting all of the substance of the deliberations of the Committee    11/16/93  With respect to the existing transcripts for the past 17 years, the Archivist's staff felt that they were the best historical record of the deliberations of those meetings The staff was not at all receptive to substituting for those raw transcripts an MOD type document because such documents would not have been contemporaneously prepared and then reviewed by the meeting participants Without contemporaneous review and approval, the Archivist's staff said that the accuracy of any edits could not be verified and that there could be no assurance that the MODs were truly reflective of the Committee's deliberations The Archivist's staff was also concerned about the temptation of participants or others reviewing transcripts well after the fact to rewrite history with the benefit of hindsight Based on these comments, our staff feels it is unlikely that the Archivist would approve the schedule allowing for the raw transcripts of the past 17 years to be discarded in favor of MODs The Archives staff suggested that rather than editing the raw transcripts the Committee could produce an annotated version in which the Secretariat would note potential or likely inaccuracies in the raw transcripts They did leave the door open to approval of a schedule to substitute a lightly edited transcript for the raw transcript, as long as nothing substantive was deleted And they would have to review that [lightly edited transcript] and compare the two documents to make sure that in fact nothing substantive was deleted I should note that these are the preliminary views of the Archives' staff and a final decision could be made only after a proposal was submitted and published for comment   Yes   Going forward we would have the participants immediately review what was said for accuracy   And we'd have the tape   Well, I'll try to answer your question The way the subpoena power works in the House is that the House has delegated to its committees the authority to issue subpoenas And in the House Banking Committee they haven't delegated it further Therefore, the Committee would need a majority vote to authorize a subpoena Once the subpoena was issued, in the House there's no procedure in the law to challenge that subpoena As I indicated, the exemptions under FOIA do not protect information from the Congress at all If a statute were passed that protected MODs or MOD information from public disclosure during the three- or five-year lag period, that would, of course, help immeasurably with the FOIA problem But it would not help technically with the Congress although, as I think Don Kohn pointed out, the enactment of such a statute would indicate Congressional agreement that this process was too important to be unnecessarily disrupted and the FOMC would get some at least moral support in your arguments to fend off a subpoena    11/16/93   Oh sure   My view of the most recent correspondence from Chairman Gonzalez is that he is asking this Committee to turn those documents over on a voluntary basis   I know, but that is the substance of what he's asking He may take issue with what I've said, but there are only two ways to get material He either asks for it [to be given] voluntarily or he uses the legal process, which is the subpoena   No I would point out [as an example] the B&L case where the Chairman refused to turn over the examination reports, which were replete with confidential information Chairman Gonzalez then obtained subpoena authority from [his] Committee and we were forced to turn over the examination reports   I don't know   That's correct   Well, that's correct But Chairman Gonzalez in the past has exercised care when he thought the materials were of a confidential nature He has not released, for example, examination reports   It would be his judgment, yes   Well, the annotated copy has the benefit of preserving the historical record, but in a marginal note the staff can indicate that this comment may [reflect a transcription] error or something because it's obviously not consistent with the rest of the discussion A note can be made like that In a lightly edited transcript, I'm not sure that the Archivist would allow us to change what was actually said [or what the transcriber thought was said] unless it was very obvious from the existing transcript that a mistake had been made   We could go through it--   That would be the issue   It would be likely that you would have waived your deliberative privilege and you'd have to turn over the raw transcripts That's an argument, of course   Right   No, I think they could delegate authority to issue a subpoena and it would [imply the need for an] investigation as to whether additional legislation is appropriate It doesn't imply that there has been wrongdoing  -15-    11/16/93   Well, again, I don't know that Conceivably one basis would be to determine whether the minutes that the Committee has released since 1976 accurately reflect what actions transpired during the meeting   Mr Chairman, just a point of clarification My understanding of your recommendation is that, going back or going forward, confidential central bank information and confidential business information would be redacted from the copy made available to the public    11/16/93   Absolutely   Yes   They are required to turn those transcripts over to the public unless they can claim--   Upon request   Well, there is a schedule whereby material is turned over to the Archives It has to be turned over in 30 years   Yes, but--   Correct   Well, once it's turned over to the Archives, you can still retain the confidential nature of the information if you can support that   I think that's right I can't give you any assurance that some judge--or not a judge so much as the Justice Department--might decide that a five-year lag would be too long under some circumstances The only sure protection is legislation   I can't make a comment on that The possibility certainly is higher than it is now But as I indicated in my comments, I think we have a very strong legal argument that this material is exempted And the FOIA statute doesn't have a time limit in it It says that if [the information] is deliberative, it's protected forever   Thirty years because of the statute   Chairman Gonzalez's letter says he wants to work out an agreement on that with this Committee   I think they would not until a lawsuit was filed That was what he said But I thought the Department of Justice official we spoke to--Ernie [Patrikis] can speak up--was very positive that they would defend this Committee on these materials, certainly the recent ones When I say ""recent"" I mean five years, or maybe even longer But he was very positive on that Now, that was based on our description of--   So I think our description is accurate   But that is more than I expected to get   As for the Archivist--Dave Lindsey can speak up--he was more forthcoming than I thought he was going to be about our ability to substitute an MOD for these raw transcripts going forward He was very positive on that and he was very positive on maintaining an historical record   They could if they invade personal privacy, things like that   If it was very obvious from the transcript that the ""not"" was an incorrect transcription you could take it out, yes In other words, if the transcriber typed ""adversary"" and the word really was ""emissary"" and it was clear that the speaker meant ""emissary,"" you could change it   As the Chairman said, yes "
2017,1993-12-21," Not that I'm aware of   [Not] after 1976   No, no we wouldn't have to do that at all That's all deliberative material   We would not have to disclose it, and I don't think that we waive that right when we make it available to the Oversight Committee   A lot of that October 15th tape was attorney/client material anyway   I don't think so, no   I've expressed it--   Well, I think--   Just because you grant him access to [the Secretariat's records of] the October 15 meeting doesn't mean you have to grant him access to other meetings of the FOMC, either the monetary policy part or something else   Yes, I think so I think the Committee has the right to maintain the confidentiality of its deliberations and also has the right to make an exception on occasion when it believes that is warranted And that's what we're doing here In the face of the allegations that have been levelled at the Committee, suppose you decide that in order to address those things and put them to rest it's best to grant access in these circumstances That does not mean that you have to grant access to all other conversations   I believe there is, yes   Yes, it can But you're giving up your right to keep all of that confidential when you let Henry Gonzalez look at it On this particular matter, you're correct   That's my view, yes "
3492,1998-09-29," I do not know what has happened, but I suspect that fund has  gotten rid of everything over 5 percent   Nobody has told us, but I read in the paper that they have been  dumping equities, so I assume that they are trying to get down below 5 percent   Mr Chairman, some of the banks can take an equity position in  LTCM in satisfaction of a previously contracted debt, but some of the foreign banks may have  reached the 5 percent limit of the Bank Holding Company Act   They were anticipating that the market would move and that  they would lose their position The DPC exemption does not require an actual default The  exemption is also available in anticipation of a default "
3874,1999-11-16," What is involved here is the fact that only the Committee can   direct a Federal Reserve Bank to take action What the Chairman’s authority derives from is the   ability to interpret that direction And that’s what this language is intended to address I don’t   think it’s possible for the Committee to give to the Chairman the authority to move monetary   policy on his own    The Working Group did change the draft wording to say the   New York Bank could adjust the rate but only with the approval of the Chairman, instead of after   consultation  "
