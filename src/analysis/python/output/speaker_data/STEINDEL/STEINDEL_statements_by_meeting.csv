6354,2001-06-26," Thank you I’d also like to thank Don and Sandy for  giving me the opportunity to speak today  It seems my job is to talk about a  less optimistic period of productivity performance   As we all know, productivity growth in the nonfarm business sector was  noticeably slower from 1973 to 1995 than in earlier or later periods  The  transition to slower productivity growth appears to have been gradual  Labor     6/26-27/01 18   productivity growth in the years from 1967 through 1970 was low by the  standards of the postwar period There was a resurgence in 1971-72, but  1973 saw a drop to the lower numbers that became customary through the  mid-1990s  Table 1 shows measures of productivity for various subperiods  since 1960 We can see that the downshift in productivity growth after 1966  through 1973 was widespread across sectors  Nonfinancial corporate  productivity growth moved in line with the total, though manufacturing  productivity remained rather strong   Developments in various multifactor productivity measures in the late  1960s and early 1970s were similar to those in labor productivity  Chart 1, on  the next page, shows the annual estimates of multifactor productivity growth  for nonfarm business made by the Bureau of Labor Statistics  There were  several years of negative multifactor growth in the late 1960s and a very brief  1971-72 revival  From our vantage point today, the slowdown in multifactor  productivity growth in the years in the late ’60s appears to be a good  indication that the basic productivity trend was beginning to falter  However,  as Dan noted earlier, such estimates of mutifactor productivity depend very  heavily on detailed, definitive data that simply were not available at that time   Contemporary observers were well aware of the sluggishness in  productivity in the late 1960s, especially in 1969  Nonetheless, there  apparently was a widespread belief that productivity growth would rebound  to the trends of the 1950s and early 1960s  Table 2 pulls statements from  reports of the Council of Economic Advisers from 1967 through 1971  They  continually asserted that the longer-term trend in productivity growth was 2­ 1/2 to 3 percent The transition from the Johnson to the Nixon  Administration only seems to make a difference in the boilerplate language or  where the discussion of productivity was placed in the report; the numbers  were generally the same   Of course, the inability to detect the shift in the productivity trend was  likely compounded by the exceptional turbulence of the late 1960s and early  1970s Just to remind everybody, major events included  the Vietnam War,  large swings in federal taxes, substantial expansion of federal regulations and  entitlement programs, the collapse of the Bretton Woods system of fixed  exchange rates and gold prices, a period of widespread wage and price  controls, the first oil shock, and sharp shifts in monetary policy  Given the  disruptions of the day, it is not surprising that low productivity growth was  often dismissed as reflecting short-term disruptions--in 1969, for example, a  shortage of skilled workers often was mentioned as impeding productivity-­ rather than the beginnings of a more disturbing long-term trend   There were a number of developments in the late 1960s and early 1970s,  potentially observable at the time, which could have suggested that the  productivity trend was weakening  First, productivity growth was weak on a     6/26-27/01 19   number of occasions, given the overall state of the economy  Chart 2 shows  the results of a number of rolling regressions I ran of productivity growth on  output growth  These regressions were estimated year by year over samples  ending in the late 1960s; the regressions were moved forward every year-­ extrapolating forward a further year and seeing how the forecast compared  with actual productivity The forecast line is shown in red and the actual  productivity change, Q4 to Q4, is shown in blue While the errors were  mostly rather modest, we see repeated cases where the projected productivity  growth was greater than actual growth in the late 1960s, and the shortfall in  1969 was rather large However, as we all know, such regressions are subject  to normal sampling error of some magnitude  In any event, these regressions  were back on track from 1970 to 1972   Profit trends and equity market developments provide some further  evidence that productivity growth was deteriorating in the late 1960s and  early 1970s As Chart 3 shows, current-dollar profits of nonfinancial  corporations dropped substantially as a share of sectoral output in this period   At the time, one might have attributed the decline in the profit share to some  of the special forces then at work, besides of course the recession in 1970   the upward trend in nominal interest rates, increased pension costs, increased  payroll taxes, intensified foreign competition, and the surge in imported  commodity prices The recovery in the profit share in the expansion of the  mid- and late 1970s does suggest that there were some unusual short-term  factors--again, aside from the cyclical decline--holding profits down around  1970 However, the longer-term signal provided by the profit slump appears  to have been reinforced by the stock market’s performance    Chart 4 shows the earnings-price ratio and various measures of real  interest rates  The earnings-price ratio, in black, was little changed on  balance after the mid-1960s before beginning a prolonged uptrend in 1973   The blue dashed line is the real funds rate, measured as the nominal rate less  the four-quarter change in the core PCE price index  Real interest rates  appear to have peaked around 1966 and drifted down for a few years in the  late 1960s; but they were then quite volatile through the early 1970s before  bottoming out in the middle of that decade  The real 10-year rate, shown in  red and computed on a comparable basis, behaved similarly   The impression, therefore, is that real rates may have peaked around the  mid-1960s and perhaps started trending down  This impression is reinforced  by the Board staff’s calculations of the equilibrium real rate, which shows a  pronounced decline from the mid-1960s through the mid-1970s  But that  measure of the real rate, which is based on current estimates of the output  gap, was not observable at that time  The relation between the earnings-price  ratio and real interest rates depends on perceptions about the riskiness of the  stock market and expectations of earnings growth  The rise in the earnings- price ratio relative to real rates in the late 1960s, as a matter of logic, suggests        6/26-27/01 20   that investors either were regarding the stock market as an increasingly risky   investment or were revising downward their estimates of future corporate   earnings Either adjustment would appear to be consistent with reduced   estimates of the longer-term productivity trend    In conclusion, the experience of the late 1960s and early 1970s suggests   that productivity trends can indeed change rather unexpectedly, and it shows   the difficulty of detecting such a trend shift while it is occurring  Using our   knowledge of subsequent developments, comparisons of observed   productivity to that predicted by overall activity as well as observations of   profits and the stock market would seem to have provided evidence, available   at the time, that the deterioration of the productivity trend was under way in   the late 1960s  However, an observer of the day, familiar with the long   record of a strong productivity growth trend, may well have overlooked those   signals In sum, the experience of thirty years ago shows us how hard it is to   detect in real time that the productivity trend is shifting and by how much    That concludes our presentation, Mr Chairman  "
