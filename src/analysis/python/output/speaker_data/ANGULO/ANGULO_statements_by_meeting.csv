8343,2008-01-29,"  The top panel of exhibit 12 sets forth the question we sought to   address—namely, to what extent did regulatory incentives contribute to or fail to  mitigate weaknesses exposed by the recent turmoil?  In doing so, we defined the term  “regulatory incentives” to encompass both regulatory capital and financial reporting  requirements  In addition, we distinguished between policies that may have mattered  for the buildup to the market turmoil and those that have made managing the turmoil  more challenging  Our conclusions are summarized in the middle panel  Not  surprisingly, incentives to minimize regulatory capital are a much more important  driver of bank behavior than financial reporting incentives  Moreover, the current  regulatory capital framework is not neutral as to how banks structure risk positions   Both the leverage ratio and the Basel I risk-based capital framework have encouraged  banks to securitize low-risk assets and, importantly, to support securitizations of  higher-risk assets through instruments with low mandated capital charges, such as  364-day liquidity facilities  Financial reporting incentives were not critical to banks’   January 29–30, 2008 186 of 249    decisions, although certain financial reporting issues—particularly disclosure  practices—have been a factor in how the turmoil has been unfolding       Before I turn to specific recommendations, it is important to emphasize that   improvements were already in train even before the market difficulties emerged last  summer  Most significantly, the Basel 2 advanced approaches and related  improvements greatly enhance the risk sensitivity of the regulatory capital framework  and create incentives for better risk management  In the bottom panel are three  examples relevant to the issues we have been discussing this morning  First, capital  charges for most unused short-term credit and liquidity facilities have been increased  to more adequately reflect the risk exposure  Second, new standards for banks to hold  capital against the default risk of complex, less liquid credit products in the trading  book are being finalized, as the Basel Committee is currently seeking public comment  on principles for calculating a so-called incremental default risk charge against such  products  I should note that the work to develop the incremental default risk  principles was done by a joint Basel Committee–IOSCO working group co-chaired  by Norah Barger  Third, the securitization framework in Basel 2, which builds on  previous unilateral US enhancements, establishes a more risk-sensitive capital  treatment for securitization exposures—it bases capital charges on estimates of  underlying risk rather than on an exposure’s legal form       I will now turn to recommendations in exhibit 13, beginning first in the top panel   with those related to regulatory capital  First, notwithstanding the improvements  brought about by Basel 2, there is scope for reassessing the treatment of  securitizations involving ABS CDOs  The risk weights and resulting capital charges  for these “re-securitizations” were calibrated under the assumption that loss  correlations within a pool of securitized assets would be no greater than those  exhibited by CDOs backed by traditional corporate bonds  It is now apparent that the  actual loss correlations within such re-securitizations—especially for the most highly  rated tranches—may be much higher  At its December 2007 meeting, the Basel  Committee agreed to take up this issue         The second recommendation addresses the issue of “reputational” risk  There   have been several occasions over the last 6 months in which banks have elected to  purchase assets from, or extend credit to, off-balance-sheet vehicles they had  organized and money market and other investment funds they managed, even though  they were not contractually obligated to do so  Whether a bank management will  provide support in excess of its contractual obligations is a business decision  Thus, it  is not practical to attempt to design an explicit capital charge for reputational risk   Instead, supervisors should exercise supervisory oversight to ensure that banks  sufficiently consider reputational risk and its implications for capital and liquidity  buffers     The third and fourth recommendations deal with the issue of the procyclicality of   capital regulations  The existence of fixed capital requirements (as well as rating  agency expectations for capital ratios) discourages banks from drawing on their   January 29–30, 2008 187 of 249    capital cushions in times of stress  It is therefore very difficult to devise changes in  capital regulations that would allow capital to function more effectively as a shock  absorber without compromising safety and soundness objectives  Nonetheless, these  last two recommendations are aimed at mitigating the potential procyclical effects of  a more risk-sensitive capital framework  The third recommendation is based on  elements of the Basel 2 framework that were designed to allow supervisors to address  both safety and soundness and procyclicality concerns  The advanced internal ratings  based approach of Basel 2 requires that banks’ loss-given-default estimates reflect  economic downturn conditions and that stress tests of their advanced systems include  consideration of how economic cycles affect risk-based capital requirements   Rigorous supervisory evaluation of these two elements can help ensure that  (1) regulatory capital embeds forward-looking forecasts of recovery rates and  (2) banks manage their regulatory capital positions in a manner that enables them to  accommodate variations in the amount of minimum required capital over an  economic cycle  The fourth recommendation is to explore ways to encourage  inclusion in the regulatory capital base of debt instruments that mandatorily convert  into equity when a banking organization is under stress  The automatic conversion of  debt instruments into equity under such circumstances is appealing from a  supervisory perspective as well as from a broader macroeconomic policy perspective   This concept has not yet been examined in depth by the staff, but we believe it merits  further study, including an assessment of the past experiences of banks with such  instruments, to determine its feasibility       Let’s now move to the recommendations in the bottom panel  These deal with   improving disclosure practices, which can help to reduce the uncertainty that has been  a key feature of the recent turmoil  First, financial institutions—especially those in  the United States—improved their disclosures about subprime-related exposures as  the turmoil wore on  Nonetheless, supervisors and regulators should continue to push  market participants to make timely and detailed disclosures about the size and  composition of subprime-related exposures  The second and third recommendations  focus on disclosures related to asset-backed commercial paper programs  In view of  the potential exposure associated with reputational risk, market participants appear to  desire additional details about banks’ dealings with ABCP programs  Disclosing  information about the distribution of assets underlying such programs by type,  industry, and credit rating would bring the disclosures on par with those provided for  on-balance-sheet assets  Similarly, in view of the extent to which investors in asset- backed commercial paper have retreated from rolling over or purchasing paper that  they suspect may be supported by subprime-related assets, banks and asset managers  that sponsor ABCP conduits should improve disclosures to investors, particularly for  conduits other than the traditional multi-seller programs  That completes our  prepared remarks  We would be pleased to take your questions at this time       Well, I would just comment on the first point that you made in terms of   silos  I guess we would fully agree we’re having a great time here, so we would love to see more   interaction between supervision and the FOMC      You know, when people debate whether to have supervision with a central   bank or not, one of the key arguments is that only we can bring to bear the resources of the entire   central bank and also provide input from the supervision side  So clearly, that’s something I think   we need to do more of  In terms of the second question, do you want to take a fresh crack at that,   Brian?    I would also agree that your general point about banks being more   exacting in their stress testing is a good one because it’s something we and other supervisors, to be   honest with you, continually look at, and many times the response that banks get internally from   either owners or managers or through supervisors is that, well, if it’s too extreme, it’s not really   plausible, and you can’t really act on it  The other argument you sometimes hear is, well, it costs a   lot of money to integrate that across the firm and do it the right way, and that’s a tough sell  So I   agree with your point that we need to do more and then push harder on stress testing  The way that   you suggest is kind of novel  You do a back test and show it to them  That’s an interesting concept  "
8443,2008-06-24,"5  Thank you, Mr Chairman  We’re now in the handout  Why  don’t we start on page 2, and I’ll give you an overview of where we are headed this  morning, at least from my section  First I’ll talk a bit about the objectives and the  approach of our monitoring program  Then I’ll talk about how we’re focusing  primarily, but not exclusively, on four investment banks and where our focus is there   I’ll say a few words about the extent of usage of our section 13 facilities  Again, the  PDCF is primarily our focus, but for the sake of completeness, I’ll also discuss and  provide some highlights on TSLF usage by the primary dealers  Then I’ll close by  just highlighting near-term issues that we’re addressing or dealing with                                                       5 The materials used by Messrs Angulo, Alvarez, and Parkinson are appended to this transcript (appendix 5)   June 24–25, 2008 138 of 253    On page 3, in terms of the objectives of our monitoring program, we’re very  cognizant that our efforts are tied closely to our section 13(3) authority in the  establishment of the Primary Dealer Credit Facility  Our effort does not stem from  our general supervisory examination authority  We’re very clear on that  We have  two key objectives  The first is the ability to exercise informed judgment about the  capital and liquidity positions of the primary dealers that have access to the PDCF   Second and just as important, we’re aiming to, in shorthand, mitigate the moral  hazard that accompanies the creation of the PDCF in particular  So we will make  sure that the PDCF does not undermine the incentives for the primary dealers and the  firms that own them to manage capital and liquidity more conservatively     On page 4, in terms of our approach, our focus is on the firms that own primary   dealers that are not affiliated with financial holding companies  That’s primarily, but  not exclusively, the four largest investment banks  I’ll touch at the end of my  presentation on several other primary dealers with which we’ve had interactions of  late  Our effort does include an on-site presence, but that is limited to examiners at  each of the four largest investment banks  We also have a small off-site staff, which  includes staff members from our Research Group, our Markets Group, our Legal  Group, and Bank Supervision  We are in direct contact with the management of these  firms  We are obtaining information directly from the firms as well as from the SEC,  and of course, we are communicating and coordinating closely with the SEC  It’s  important to point out, however, that we’re not engaged in traditional bank  supervision  Our scope is fairly narrow  We’re not conducting examinations, and  we’re not providing or issuing examination reports back to the firms  Therefore, we  are making assessments, I would say, without the normal range or normal  complement of supervisory protections that we’re accustomed to  To be frank, that  carries with it some risk and some vulnerability for us  I’ll touch on that at the end of  my presentation as well  Our current focus is limited or narrowly focused on capital,  as well as liquidity, which I’ll get into in a moment  So let’s turn to page 5     Page 5 gives us a view of the leverage of the four investment banks  I should note   that it may be a bit confusing at first glance  Leverage is typically expressed as a  multiple  We’ve converted that into ratios because bank supervisors tend to look at  ratios  So bear that in mind  Investment bank leverage does tend to be cyclical  This  graph picks up really the latter half of the last cycle, so I can orally give you some  perspective  If this graph had moved back to the left, in approximately 1999 to 2001  you would have seen the investment banks deleveraging in response to the Russian  default and the LTCM crisis in the third quarter of 1998  So we would see leverage  coming down between then and 2001  In 2001-02, leverage was essentially flat, and  then this graph picks up the increasing leverage from 2004 to the end of 2007  As  you can see, 2007 marked the cyclical low point in the ratio, or high point in leverage  as a multiple  Since then, the firms have been deleveraging  Right now they are  clustering around 4 percent, with the trajectory, I hope, still up, and we may have  something to say about that      This is gross leverage, so it is just equity—in this case, a ratio of  equity over total assets—a very blunt measure       Page 6 gives us a more current view  In the left-hand panel is the tier 1 capital   ratio for the four largest securities firms  As I think you know, the SEC has made a  decision to use and hold investment banks to a Basel II ratio that’s consistent with  how the bank supervisors apply it  To date, the firms have not disclosed those ratios   That begins this quarter, the second quarter  For Goldman, Lehman, and Morgan  Stanley, that quarter ended May 31, 2008, so we show the estimated ratios there   These were not in their earnings releases, although they were picked up by some of  the analysts in their conference calls—so these numbers are seeping out there   Merrill reports on a bank cycle, June 30, so they have not yet released their tier 1  capital ratio     A couple of takeaways from the left side of this page  First, the quarter has not   ended, but Merrill was obviously low compared with its peers  They do have the  benefit of seeing and being aware of where their peers have come out, so we shall see  if Merrill takes some action in the near term to bolster capital  The second point is  that the investment bank ratios look fairly high compared with where the commercial  bank tier 1 capital ratio would be  There are a couple of reasons for that  First, the  assets of the investment banks are concentrated in the trading book, so there are two  issues there  Those assets tend to have a lower credit charge  The other issue, which  we have to do more work on, is that we need to understand better the modeling  methodologies and the model approvals that the SEC has given these firms to  compute tier 1 capital  That could be a significant factor as well  So at first blush  they look very healthy, very high; but I think it will take more analysis to get beneath  those       The right-hand side of page 6 gives another way of looking at capital—what we   call an “FRBNY-adjusted leverage ratio”  What we’re trying to do here is to have  another way of putting investment banks and commercial banks on a somewhat  similar footing  So in terms of the numerator, we use tangible equity for two reasons   First, it’s a higher form of equity capital, perhaps the highest form  Second and just  as important, it avoids current differences between how investment banks and  commercial banks calculate tier 1 capital  Right now there’s a grandfathering period  in which the securities firms are allowed to carry a higher portion of subordinated  debt in tier 1 capital  It does not apply to bank holding companies  This puts them on  more of an equivalent basis in terms of the numerator  The deal is the same with the  denominator  Again, we’re trying to make allowances for the differences in business  models  So here we subtract from the denominator secured financing assets  These  are reverse repos and securities borrowings  Of course, these are collateralized by  cash and thus are relatively low-risk assets  So by making those two adjustments, we  have a somewhat comparable view  The takeaway here is that they don’t look too far  apart—they are not dissimilar—at least at this point in the cycle        June 24–25, 2008 140 of 253    Why don’t we move now to page 7, to liquidity?  I have a picture of liquidity, but  not a full picture  This shows the trend in parent company liquidity pools  This is  unencumbered cash or high-quality securities at the parent company of the four  investment banks  As you can see, the trend has been increasing since the middle of  March  The general trend has been to increase  This, of course, tells us only half the  story because one wants to know what that pool is held against  So, let’s turn to page  8, and I can talk a bit about how we’re trying to look at and assess this       We’ve been engaged with the SEC and have entered into an approach in trying to   assess liquidity at the four investment banks  When we first started this endeavor  back in late March, the first thing we did was to go back to the firms and to say,  “Show us what would happen to liquidity if you experienced a Bear Stearns, full-run  kind of scenario?  For that exercise we want to know what assets you have eligible for  the PDCF  We want to know how bad and how dark it would get”  That exercise  was pretty demanding  No one would have passed the test  We looked at that and  asked whether a full run on the institution was an appropriate way to look at it or an  appropriate standard to hold them to  So we came up with another scenario that we  put back to the firms  We basically said, “Listen, we want you to do a stress analysis  for us  Look at something that’s pretty severe but short of a full Bear Stearns  scenario  Look out over thirty days  By the way, you have no access to the PDCF   Let’s see how that looks”  We’re in the process of doing that right now  The table on  the left gives you an idea of some of the things that we’re looking at and how we’ve  asked the firms to provide the information to us  Basically there are several buckets  (1) their unsecured and secured funding; (2) what comes on the balance sheet under  stress, either general market stress or firm-specific stress; and (3) the impact from  operating cash flows toward the bottom  Those are the combination of liquidity  claims that they would face under stress  The last piece is the additional funding from  affiliated or unaffiliated bank lines along with, obviously, the liquidity pool, which  we have separately  Basically, we’re engaged in an exercise in which we compare  and converge assumptions  We’ve had multiple discussions with each of the four  firms, trying to understand where their assumption differed and trying to converge  those  We then constructed, or are in the process of constructing, a cash flow  analysis  Again, we are relating their cash needs under stress, given these  assumptions, to their available liquidity pool plus the unaffiliated or affiliated bank  lines that can be drawn     The drivers here, obviously, are going to be the mix and term of secured funding,   which is going to be a big driver in terms of the liquidity needs, as well as some of the  operating cash flow assumptions that firms make in looking at a stress scenario  We  are fairly close to pulling together information with which we can construct an  analysis, go back to the firms, share with them our assessments of where they are, and  give them a chance to explain to us how we were spot on or where we may have  missed certain things  But those conversations will happen in the near future  So  that’s basically what we’re doing in terms of liquidity  It has been an interesting  exercise  I think that there is no simple way to look at liquidity but that this is the  best way to do so     June 24–25, 2008 141 of 253      Let’s turn to page 9  I have just a few words about the use of both the PDCF and   the TSLF  I have graphs later on the TSLF  A graph of the PDCF usage would be  kind of boring  It would show Bear Stearns as far and away the dominant borrower   Actually I think Bill Dudley conveyed to you yesterday that Monday was their last  night of borrowing under the PDCF  So Bear Stearns is now out  Until very recently  there were three others that I’ll call chronic users of the PDCF  First, we had Cantor   I’ll say a few words about that  They started borrowing in late March, initially  $600 million to $700 million  They stabilized in mid-April at about $500 million   We saw that borrowing coming in every night  Members of the team here spent one  afternoon at Cantor at the end of April  We asked them for some information in  advance  We spent a good chunk of time with them  We came away not being  comfortable with the number or the size of their borrowings in relation to the firm’s  capital  We then consulted with our colleagues in both the Legal and Markets  Groups  We asked Cantor to submit a plan to wean itself from the PDCF and to  submit that to us in writing  We then followed up with a friendly letter from Mr  Dudley and Mr Baxter asking for a little more information and a little more  specificity  They got the point  They started to bring that down in accordance with  the schedule they gave to us  In fact, they ended up winding down to zero in their  borrowing last week, ahead of schedule, and they obtained third-party financing  So  that was the Cantor story     Countrywide was a somewhat similar situation  They had been borrowing from   day 1 of the PDCF  Initially they would ask us for $1 billion  They had borrowed  and stabilized at about $900 million  Our Markets Group initiated a conversation  with Countrywide Securities at the end of May  In short, we were uncomfortable  with, in essence, providing bridge financing to the close of the acquisition by Bank of  America  We felt some vulnerability there  So our initial salvo or proposal back to  Countrywide Securities was that they needed to wind down the use of section 13(3)  facilities by the end of June—both the PDCF and the TSLF  They came back to us  and in essence said, “Well, couldn’t you just let us go into July a bit because our  merger is supposed to be approved today actually by the Bank of America board?   Our legal Day 1, our closing is July 1  We can transfer positions July 2  What’s a  couple of days among friends?”  We had a little negotiation back and forth  We  reached, I think, an agreement that was amenable to all  They agreed to wind down  their use of the TSLF—no new borrowings  They could swing some of that into the  PDCF  We would allow them to go until the closing, July 2, when they could transfer  those positions  In return we got a little extra margin  So, in effect, those borrowings  were being collateralized at a margin of roughly 7 percent  We got an additional  13 percent, bringing us to 20 percent, which will bring us through until July 2  So I  think all sides are reasonably comfortable there, and with friendly persuasion, Dudley  and Baxter sealed the deal there       Let me say a few words about Barclays Capital  We handled this a bit more   informally  They started using the PDCF more in late March, at around $5 billion   They got to a peak of about $7 billion  Both Bank Supervision and Markets had   June 24–25, 2008 142 of 253    conversations with Barclays, asking them to tell us a little more about why they were  using this  What’s the rationale?  They had a consistent story  They would tell us  that it was economically advantageous for them to use that  They thought it was  good  In one conversation with our colleagues in the Markets Group, one of the  traders conveyed that Barclays thought they needed to support the TSLF in much the  same way that they supported open market operations  Our colleagues in Markets  very quickly disabused them of that notion  After a couple of conversations, they got  the message  They eventually ceased borrowing from the PDCF around the  beginning of June  So as of now, the only outstanding we have is with Countrywide  Securities, and that should come to a close next week, knock on wood     Again just for the sake of completeness, on page 10 I’ll talk about the TSLF   usage  First, schedule 1, which is OMO-eligible collateral—as you can see among  the primary dealers, Merrill has had the highest amount outstanding  Merrill is, I  guess, the tan line  The biggest users have been the commercial banks—Deutsche  Bank is up top, a pretty consistent user  Then Citigroup (the green line), which has  also been a fairly consistent and heavy user  Let’s turn to schedule 2 (page 11),  which is the less liquid collateral  Here among the primary dealers, Lehman (the blue  line) has been the most consistent user, followed by Merrill Lynch  As you can see,  UBS among the banks was clearly far and away the biggest user, although within the  past two weeks they have reduced their TSLF borrowings  So that’s, very briefly, the  top five  There’s again a bit of a mix here  But as you can see, the investment banks  are not the biggest users of the TSLF     Let’s turn to page 12, and I’ll finish up here  I’ll just highlight a very near-term   challenge that we face, and I think it will provide a nice transition to Scott’s and Pat’s  portions of the briefing  I don’t want to get too much into their sections  But I think  generally we have an issue  I think that, the longer we stay on site with this effort, the  reputational risk to the Federal Reserve increases  As Governor Kohn testified last  week, we’re not examining; we are just very narrowly focused  I think that message  was well received  At this time, it’s not too problematic  But if someone is up on the  Hill six months or a year from now, I think it’s going to be very difficult to say that  we’re just doing this liquidity and capital thing  People are going to want to know a  little more about our judgments and how we made those judgments  As I said early  on, I think there’s some risk to making those judgments without having a little more  information  So I think the trick for us is, if we have our traditional bank supervision  model on the left and what we’re doing right now on the right, we have to move this  way, more to the left  By no means should we be way over here  But I think we have  to figure out how to get this way a little more  With that, I will end my remarks and  pass to Scott and then to Pat      Correct  We went back to the firms and asked them to give us the   information cut this way because it’s not readily available from any public information that we   have  We also asked them to give us, under a severe test scenario, what their assumption was    June 24–25, 2008 146 of 253    Based on the submissions that we got from the four, which we converged and massaged, we came   out pretty close to these assumptions  We didn’t make these up    We left it somewhat in their hands, saying that it’s going to be short of a   full run    Yes    You would have a lot higher numbers on secured funding  You would   have the numbers coming much closer to the illiquid, 100 percent, and you would have a—    Under fixed-income finance, for example, under the secured funding,   there’s liquid and less liquid  Those are 20 percent and 50 percent  Those would have been   approaching 100 percent    How much runs—exactly    The SEC is working on a post mortem  They have promised to share it   with us when they’re done  They have folks—I wouldn’t say forensic accountants—in there   looking at that, trying to piece together what happened  So we did not have the exact numbers    No    Things moved pretty quickly at the end    I guess a couple  We’re saying that we’re looking at the capital position  I   think Governor Kohn was careful to say in his testimony that we’re looking at capital in relation to   near-term earnings prospects  That gives us kind of a short window, but we know from examining   banks that a capital number that’s reported to you depends on how you’re carrying your assets  We   have not done any work in trying to get behind, for example, the evaluations on Lehman’s   commercial real estate portfolio  That’s a potential vulnerability there  Also, we have not really   looked to a consolidated assessment of risk management at these firms, something we do in the   bank supervision process  So we’re basically taking the inputs, for lack of a better word, at face   value and not doing our own work to try to validate those  That’s what I was referring to in terms of   the risk to us  I think as long as we’re there, people expect us to be doing a little more than what   we’ve been doing to date   June 24–25, 2008 148 of 253     It may be too fine a distinction, but we didn’t say “no” to anyone when   they came in  When they came in and stayed for a month and a half or two months, then we started   to say “no”    I would defer to my colleagues in Markets, but I would just give one   anecdote  Over the past few weeks, in particular, when Lehman announced its second-quarter   results, some observers in the market stated that Lehman might not have come through this period if   the PDCF had not been there  They never drew on it  I think it’s an interesting point  I think there   may be some relevance, some truth, to that  Bill, you would have a better sense as to whether the   markets are back to normal or not    About $150 billion     There are definite differences among dealers  I don’t have the Bear   Stearns cut, but we did a cut recently, and there are very clearly differences among dealers  As we   know, the share of less liquid assets being financed by tri-party has been growing over the last—  June 24–25, 2008 157 of 253    pick a number—five, seven years  The trend line is going like that, clearly at a steeper or more   pronounced rate than the growth in more liquid or more eligible collateral    Pat, do you have that?    On the first question, yes, we were picking up the pressures on liquidity    We saw some cracking, but it never broke  There were some counterparties that were skittish, but   we never saw the type of accelerated withdrawals or running that came to mark Bear Stearns  We   were watching it very closely, and so were they  But basically it hung together  The second   question is a very difficult one  It goes back to the point I finished on, that we are somewhat   vulnerable in making these assessments without having a more robust process  One way to look at   it in the near term, though—again, as best we can, looking at capital—is the chart on page 6  If you   look at Lehman—with its capital raise, their tier 1 risk-based capital would be 125 percent  There   may be some range around that  There are certainly questions about how accurately Bear’s capital   was stated  But as a rough measure, I think it would be difficult to say that Lehman would be a 4 or   a 5, looking at it from a solvency perspective  They’ve bolstered liquidity  As I said, it started to   crack, but it never really shattered  "
