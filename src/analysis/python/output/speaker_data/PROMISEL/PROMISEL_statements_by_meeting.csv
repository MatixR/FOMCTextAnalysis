4297,1991-02-05," Well, at $15 billion, if you take the $9 billion out of net exports it is something on the order of-- "
4496,1991-10-01," Well, it's hard to rule that out, but I wouldn't think so I think inventories have been held in pretty good shape; in the second quarter, I'm not sure how well they did The Japanese are talking quite a bit about the need to get investment going--I'm referring to fixed investment, not inventory investment--at this time, and they are concerned about increasing their output capacity as demand increases My sense is that they do not have an overhang of inventories that is going to damp significantly the output rise over the near term, although we do not expect a very robust growth in Japan in the near term We have growth fairly sluggish in the second half of this year and picking up only to about the rates of potential growth, maybe 3-1/2 to 4 percent, in 1992 So, we're not anticipating very strong growth, but I don't know that an overhang of inventories would be a major downside risk in that "
6111,1998-03-31," I would like to highlight four areas of uncertainty on the international side the crises in Asia, Japan, oil, and the dollar  First, the crises in Asia There is an Asia effect, although we do not have a systematic handle on it We see evidence in the trade statistics of the Asian economies themselves The combined trade balance of Korea and Thailand in November-December swung from a deficit of $5 billion in 1996 to a surplus of $4 billion in 1997--a swing of more than $50 billion at an annual rate We see evidence of it from the US side Trade statistics for January show a substantial decline in exports to Korea and Thailand The US purchasing managers' survey reports weak export orders The anecdotal reports from the special survey conducted by the Reserve Banks contribute substantially to our sense of the weakness in exports to Asia And we see evidence in the trade statistics of Japan and Europe Based on all of this somewhat fragmentary information, most of the effect to date seems to be on the side of Asian imports, not Asian exports  The question now is not whether there is a noticeable effect, but rather how large and how long-lasting that effect will be On that score, about all I would assert is that the probability of some of the more negative scenarios that we and others have talked about has diminished While the problems in Asia certainly have not been solved, the situation outside of Indonesia--and perhaps Malaysia--seems to have stabilized, and we can be a bit more confident that at least some of the needed reforms and policy measures will    3/31/98  be implemented The evident resolve of the new government in Korea and the success of the rescheduling effort for claims on Korean banks have added importantly to our degree of confidence  Second, Japan Recent data--including fourth-quarter GDP and indicators for the first quarter--suggest that the Japanese economy is even weaker than we had been expecting Progress on resolving the problems of the Japanese banking system is slow, at best On the other hand, substantial fiscal stimulus has been signaled, although the details are missing, and there is some prospect for stimulus in the form of tax cuts What remains to be seen, of course, is how much so-called ""real water"" there will be behind the headline figures I would say there is now some upside risk, not just downside risk, to the outlook for Japan that is presented in the Greenbook  Third, oil The decline in oil prices through mid-March was a surprise If that had been sustained, it would have been a central element in the revision to our Greenbook forecast since January Of course, the decline has not been sustained Oil producing countries have responded with an agreement to cut production, and their decision is sufficiently credible that prices have backed up quite a bit We anticipate that prices will stay near current levels, with expanded exports from Iraq working to keep prices from rising further later this year and next The price of oil in our forecast for 1999 is now $2 per barrel lower than in the January Greenbook We think the risks to oil prices are fairly evenly balanced around the forecast path I might note that the price of oil in our forecast also is about $450 per barrel lower on average in 1998 than it was in 1997 The decline in price from last year plays a significant role in the allocation of the burden of current account adjustments in the world and tends to some extent to support global aggregate demand  Fourth, the dollar We have a small decline in the dollar's value built into our forecast, in both nominal and real terms against the yen and European currencies and in real terms against the currencies of emerging market economies Again, there are risks on both sides Especially in the short run, we see some upside risks The market may continue to be disappointed in the performance of the Japanese economy, putting further downward pressure on the yen Problems in Indonesia could spread and Asian currencies could weaken again Persistent vigor of the US economy could entice investors And while the process leading toward the next stage of EMU seems to be on track, there is scope for problems--associated, for example, with the German election in September However, over the longer term, what we see as the need for the dollar to decline to begin to correct US current account imbalances could assert itself, as some of the factors that have been putting upward pressure on the dollar diminish in force the uncertainties related to EMU, the Asian crises, and even the weakness in Japan    3/31/98  Putting all four elements together, I myself see the balance of risks skewed toward the upside, in terms of the foreign impact on US demand and prices My colleagues probably would not be so unequivocal, but then again, this is not their last FOMC meeting! [Laughter]  How much higher depends on what you mean by the dollar There  are a lot of different ways of weighting and characterizing the dollar's average value It has gone  up some against the yen, but I don't think there has been a big change in terms of the various  weighted averages that we use I am looking for one average that we employ--it was 1013--  Yes  That's against the other G-10 currencies, but it is up less than that  presumably against some of the other weighted averages It does not change the basic picture  Absolutely, in our view  We do have a bit of a lag built in between the exchange rate change  and the effect on import prices So, even if the dollar starts coming off its current level, we will  see some effects in terms of lower nonoil import prices for a little while "
