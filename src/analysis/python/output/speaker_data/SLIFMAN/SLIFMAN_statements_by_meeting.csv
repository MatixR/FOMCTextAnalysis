2587,1983-11-14," I was cheating and looking over your shoulder and I see that the terminal unemployment rate is 8-1/2 percent in your simulations and the terminal unemployment rate in ours is 87 percent, so I really don't think there is that much difference between the basic thrust of the results that your staff has gotten  I couldn't read all those numbers!  Well, zero velocity doesn't [unintelligible] "
3885,1989-08-22," What the Chairman said is correct There is the issue of whether or not the claim is accepted; then it shows up in the ongoing benefits But the BLS in most instances knows who's filing the claim, so they can sort of monitor these things since it's an administrative count And they normally will note it, as the Chairman has said  Clearly, if that were the case, under those circumstances we would have to do something that was a combination of a [net] change for all other items and then worry about the level of inventory investment It turns out, however, that in this instance that's not really the case  So it's not a problem this time "
3960,1989-11-14," Governor Angell, let me just say in answer to your question that once we take account of our assumption about Boeing then we would have, in fact, a rather smooth deceleration in PDE growth over the near term "
3988,1989-12-18," Well, on Exhibit 10 the chart in the lower panel shows the simulation in the wage and price sector taken together So, it has the Phillips curve and then also the mark-up To be sure, you can see that in 1984, as I said, there was a substantial error; but it had dissipated over the subsequent year and a half And in the most recent period, this dynamic simulation of the wage and price sector together measured on the price variable has been pretty much right on track Now, we also did some simulations of the wage equation alone Again, it is true that there was a period where the model was tending to overpredict the actual experience--that actual wages were falling faster than the model would have predicted So, between '81 and roughly '85 there was a period of overprediction in measured growth rate terms But since about the middle of 1985, again measured in growth rate terms, the model has been pretty much right on track  This is sort of estimating it up through--  '79 and then--  Right, correct  Well, it's not so much a matter of what we would expect; it's really a question of what policy actions would be taken at that point We expect that the policy action that would be taken at that point would be to ease monetary policy further to bring down real interest rates as a way of trying to continue to support real GNP and bring that unemployment rate down closer to the natural rate So, the point that I'm trying to make is that you end this period with an unemployment rate, in this model, that is still substantially above the natural rate It does [pose] this continuous strategic problem because, with the unemployment rate above the natural rate at that point and with essentially no inflation, the model then would want to produce an outright deflation, at least for some time That's really the point I was trying to make  Well, that downward slope--and maybe it's a problem of the way we charted this--the rate is only going from 72 percent down to 70 percent So it's--  That is correct  -10-    12/18-19/89  Let me also just reemphasize the point that this model does not incorporate any credibility effects It seems likely, if one were successful in bringing down inflation the way that this particular simulation shows, that probably over time the credibility effects would begin to build So the final result in terms of the costs probably would not be as high as this simple simulation of the model itself wants to produce  In this particular model, to a first approximation the model is linear in regard to these sacrifice ratio calculations So, if that were to be stretched out over a longer period of time it would still require the same cumulative excess amount of unemployment; it would just be stretched out further--if, of course, the amount of disinflation were the same  That's the first approximation; it is not precise "
4300,1991-02-05," First, it turns out that in the second quarter itself we still actually have some liquidation going on but the rate of liquidation is slower than in the first quarter, so in a GNP accounting sense it shows up as a positive number here We do, however, start to get some accumulation beginning in the second half of the year But the amounts of accumulation are very, very small in dollar terms Again, it's because of these swings from rapid liquidation to slower liquidation to a small accumulation that in GNP terms that winds up adding to real GNP That is really what I was trying to show on the preceding chart, Chart 12, where you can see that even during part of that projection period we still have GNP below final sales and then it rises just very gradually We think it's a very modest amount of inventory accumulation that takes place; in fact, the inventory/sales ratio that's consistent with this actually falls for a while and then basically just flattens out at these historically low levels  Actually, it's a very small amount, as you can see In terms of our forecast we see it basically all coming from state and local purchases But they're very small; they're growing 03 percent, which is a very small number The federal net real purchases are falling What we really have in terms of the state and local sector is some construction going on but not very much  Right And it turns out that that also happens to be the growth rate as well  They happen to match up in that one instance "
4382,1991-05-14," Relative to what is happening to GNP, this is not atypical In other words--    5/14/91  The falloff in GNP, assuming our forecast is right, would be about half the typical peak-to-trough decline in GNP But if you look at the ratio, say, of personal income to GNP, that ratio has its own cyclical pattern "
4473,1991-09-13," First of all, the total Consumer Price Index was up 02 percent and, excluding food and energy, the CPI was up 04 percent One of the big players there was the perennial problem with college tuition at this time of the year If we were to exclude the college tuition--I haven't actually done the calculation--I would suspect that the core CPI would have been up more like 03 percent In terms of the retail sales data that we got this morning, total retail sales were down 07 percent The total excluding the automotive group was down 02 percent However, we did get an upward revision to that grouping--the total excluding automotives--for the month of July I haven't actually done the precise calculation yet but I would suspect that on balance the level of retail sales in August was probably about in line with what the staff had been anticipating or maybe even a tad stronger  That I don't have  You have more information than I do!  Okay, a shade under    9/13/91  Basically, that's the only information that we've been able to get We haven't actually gotten the press release on the retail sales data so we don't have the full breakdown yet "
4887,1993-02-02," Well, I think the main [effect] would be on those households that might feel their liquidity is constrained That is to say, the wealth is there but the [increased] ability of such households to liquify that wealth could boost consumption The other point is that in the case of turnover of the [housing] stock, some would argue that when capital gains are realized we do see evidence that some of those realized capital gains are not plowed back into the housing industry One can see that from the mortgage debt data So we have a feeling that some of [the capital gains] are being used to support consumption We also note from the refinancing data that a fair amount of cash is being taken out there, too There is no direct econometric evidence, but other kinds of ancillary information seem to suggest that this is going on  Well, it's true, as my other chart shows, that we have this shifting of the baby boomers into peak life cycle saving years and that demographic factor [tends to raise] the saving rate But, as I suggested, working the other way are economic factors, primarily the fact that net worth positions are a bit stronger and that household perceptions of income and job prospects seem to be improving substantially Both of those would tend to give you a lower saving rate Finally, though, there is the statistical question of who knows what the real level [of savings] is anyway!  Yes It is true that in some longer-run sense, all other things equal, we would expect the demographics to work toward a higher saving rate "
4980,1993-07-06," Even within consumption, [for] their PCE, there are some places where Commerce does not use the CPI For example, I think for air fares, which as you know has been a player in this  -16-    7/6-7/93  seasonality problem, they use independent information rather than CPI information "
5581,1995-07-05, [Statement--see Appendix] 
5605,1995-08-22," Let me add just one other comment that works in the other direction There are other changes that BEA is considering implementing over the next several years One in particular that would work the other way would be the inclusion of software as final output At present, when software is not bundled with the computer, it is counted as an intermediate product If output of software has been growing faster than other output, that would push up ""true"" output growth There are some other things that are service-related where BEA is planning to implement new procedures to try to get a better handle on service output, such as this issue with software Those things won't be reflected in the next benchmark this December, but they will be reflected in the following benchmark revision In fact, it may well be that productivity is growing faster and that we just are not measuring output properly  Only in the most recent quarters The statistical discrepancy doesn't have a particular trend to it  In the most recent couple of quarters  I don't think that's a trend phenomenon "
5702,1996-01-30, [Statement--see Appendix] 
5965,1997-07-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman We will be referring to the packet of  material titled ""Staff Presentation to the Federal Open Market Committee"" Dave Stockton, Ted  Truman, and I will jointly share the honors this afternoon [Statements--see Appendix]  I think they purposely have chosen to stretch out deliveries, as they  have done in the past, because they know a bust will inevitably follow the boom  We have not quantified it, as I suggested in my remarks, but we  think it will have a relatively modest negative effect with a lag on consumer spending in 1998  No We anticipate that the slowing of activity will result primarily  from some stock adjustments following the large increases in investment spending in recent  years  Right, in both consumer spending and business investment "
6583,2000-06-27,"  Your next chart presents our   productivity forecast  The upper left panel provides some longer- run perspective, while the upper right panel magnifies the current  situation  We are projecting that the rate of growth of structural  productivity in 2000 and 2001 will be a bit higher than it was in  the preceding two years   Indeed, at a 32 percent annual rate this  year and next, our projection is clearly at the high end of the range  of outside estimates     The acceleration of structural productivity evident since   1995 reflects both a quickening in the pace of capital deepening  and a pickup in the growth of multifactor productivity  The  middle panels address the capital deepening issue  Capital input,  shown on the left, measures the services derived from the stock of  physical assets  As you can see, the index of capital services from  information technology equipment and software (the red bars) has  been accelerating since 1973, while the growth of other capital  inputs (the gray bars) has remained close to the 2 percent annual  rate observed over the past quarter century  Of course, to go from  capital input growth to capital deepening, the trend growth in  hours of work--currently about 1 percent annually--must be  subtracted off     In calculating the contribution of capital deepening to   productivity growth, changes in capital-labor ratios are weighted  by capital income shares  The middle right panel shows the  capital income share of information technology equipment and  software  The steep advance of this share, combined with the  acceleration of IT capital input, has been the primary source of the  pronounced pickup in the contribution of capital deepening to  structural productivity growth--line 2 of the table  Between 1973           19  and 1995 (the first column), capital deepening added seven-tenths  of a percentage point per year to productivity growth, compared  with 16 percentage points in the late 1990s (the third column)   Multifactor productivity growth--line 4--which reflects the effects  of such things as new technology, economies of scale,  improvements in managerial skill, and changes in the organization  of production, picked up nearly half a percentage point over the  same period  Going forward, our investment forecast is consistent  with more capital deepening, while ongoing improvements to how  business is conducted will show through to even faster growth of  multifactor productivity     Despite the favorable productivity performance, we still   are forecasting a build-up of inflation pressures   Focusing on the  upper panels of chart 12, you can see that both core CPI and core  PCE prices have accelerated recently, measured at either the  three-month, six-month, or twelve-month frequencies--the red,  blue, and black lines respectively  In the case of the so-called  “pipeline” inflation indicators, presented in the middle panels,  twelve-month changes in both the core intermediate goods PPI  and the core crude goods index have moved up distinctly over the  past year or so  Similarly, the index of prices paid in the NAPM  manufacturing survey shows that since late last year a sizable  number of firms have reported paying higher prices for their  materials and supplies  It should be noted, however, that  industrial commodity prices and the NAPM index have softened  of late, as manufacturing output has moderated     During the last two periods of rising inflation pressures--  1988-89 and 1994-95--widespread bottlenecks and shortages were  reported as firms in a number of industries--for example, primary  metals, textiles, paper, and plastics--were operating at very high  utilization rates  Currently, however, capacity utilization is well  below the levels reached in those episodes, and bottlenecks and  shortages seem to be few, apparently reflecting the rapid growth  of capacity during recent years     To illustrate the point, in the lower panel I have listed a   sample of the items that purchasing managers reported to be in  short supply during the two previous periods of rising inflation as  well as the complete list shown in the most recent NAPM survey   Consistent with the numerous press stories on the subject, the  purchasing managers do report shortages of one critical group of  products--electronic components; and, as noted in the Greenbook,  those shortages are having an effect on computer prices  But  that’s pretty much it  There are no reports of shortages for such  basic materials as aluminum, steel, or industrial chemicals           20    So, where does that leave us in terms of the outlook for   inflation?  Chart 13 presents part of the staff’s view  The first part  of our story has to do with sustainability--or lack of it, to be more  precise  One way of demonstrating this point is illustrated in the  upper panel  The idea behind the picture is one that the Chairman  has discussed many times and is based on a modification of the  growth accounting identity  That is, arithmetically the growth of  domestic demand equals the sum of the growth of productivity,  population, the participation rate, and one minus the  unemployment rate, plus the contribution of net imports  The  chart shows the role of three of those items  falling  unemployment and rising participation--that is, a shrinking pool  of available workers--as well as the widening trade deficit  So,  for example, during the four quarters ending in 2000Q1,  domestic demand rose 57 percent, of which 1-1/2 percentage  points was met by the factors shown on the chart     In terms of the sustainability issue, there are two ways to   satisfy above-trend growth of domestic demand We can make the  goods here or foreigners can make them for us  If we make them  here, we can do it by drawing more people into the workforce or  by increasing productivity  But the pool of available workers  can’t be drawn down forever; likewise, the trade deficit can’t  widen forever  The upper panel is one way of scaling the extent  to which we have been relying on these two “safety valves” to  maintain demand growth     By this measure, the growth of domestic demand has been   relying on these unsustainable sources for most of the past seven  years, which has contributed to a widening GDP gap--the middle  panel  Indeed, currently we estimate that the level of actual GDP  is about 3 percent above the level of potential     The lower panel shows the historical relationship between   the GDP gap and price acceleration, as well as the staff  projection  The horizontal axis plots the GDP gap measured at  the end of year “t-1” and the vertical axis is the acceleration in  core PCE prices during year “t”  Although there are one or two  obvious outliers, for the most part the points cluster around the  fitted regression line, plotted in blue  The regression suggests that  a 3 percent imbalance between aggregate demand and aggregate  supply at the end of last year is likely to be associated with a 06  percentage point step-up in inflation this year  Although the  approach we actually use for projecting inflation is more complex  than this simple bivariate relationship, the forecast suggested by           21  the regression is reasonably in line with what we’ve written down  in the Greenbook for the average acceleration in core PCE prices  during 2000 and 2001--the red dots on the chart     An alternative, but certainly not independent, way of   thinking about the inflation process is presented in Chart 14  Here  I show a cost accounting of inflation for the nonfinancial  corporate sector  This is just an extension of the tables I send the  Committee shortly before each meeting  The logic of this  approach is based on the identity that relates inflation to changes  in unit labor costs, unit nonlabor costs, and unit profits, where  output is measured in value-added terms from the income side   The upper panel shows fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter increases  in compensation per hour and productivity--the components of  unit labor costs  As you can see, with aggregate demand growing  more quickly than supply and with labor markets extremely tight  over the forecast period, we expect hourly compensation growth  to pick up  At the same time, we think that productivity growth is  likely to slow, as employers catch up on some hiring while output  is slowing  The result is an acceleration in unit labor costs for the  nonfinancial corporate sector over the next two years     The middle panels show the other two components of the   identity  We are projecting a continuation of the modest increase  in nonlabor costs posted over the past year or so, primarily  reflecting higher interest costs  Finally, unit profits, which  climbed sharply earlier in the expansion, are projected to drop  back somewhat over the next year and a half, as a competitive  business environment makes it difficult for firms to fully pass on  higher unit costs     The bottom panel illustrates how this all adds up for the   nonfinancial corporate deflator  Note that because this is a sector- wide price index, it includes energy and food  The jump in unit  labor costs expected this year leads to a pickup in inflation from  about 1/2 percent during 1999 to 1-1/4 percent over the four  quarters of 2000  In 2001, however, the further acceleration of  unit labor costs is offset by the projected drop in profitability, and  price increases slow a bit  This contour is roughly similar to the  one shown for total PCE prices in the bottom panel of Dave’s first  chart       As for how sure we are, the answer is our usual answer There is a   wide range of uncertainty  The model that we use, as you probably know, is the so-called stock   adjustment model for the demand for labor  So our view, as I noted and as we said in the   Greenbook, is that even though output growth decelerates, hiring will continue, as firms that   right now are running with very stretched work forces try to get their work forces to more   preferred operating levels  That is the underlying logic  How confident are we that that’s what   is going to happen?  Well, obviously, there is a wide range of uncertainty around this cyclical           37  component of our productivity projection  It could also be the case that we're too pessimistic   about underlying structural productivity growth, particularly total factor productivity, which   could give us some additional boost to overall labor productivity    Yes    Yes  The slowing in overall labor productivity is all happening, in   an accounting sense, as a slowing in total factor productivity  The capital deepening component   is still surging ahead because we are at such high levels of investment  "
6724,2001-01-30,"  We will be referring to the package of materials you've   received, entitled “Staff Presentation on the Economic Outlook”  2/   As you know from the Greenbook, we are expecting a sharp  deceleration of production in the first half of 2001, as shown in line  1 of the table in your first exhibit  This pattern reflects, in part, a  pronounced drag on real GDP from inventory investment (line 5) as  firms seek to bring their stocks into better alignment with sales  But  it also reflects a notable slowing in the pace of final demand  In  particular, as shown on line 2 of the table, private domestic final  purchases are projected to rise at only a 14 percent pace in the first  half of this year, with both consumption (line 3) and business  investment in equipment and software (line 4) relatively weak     A number of forces seemed to come together in the latter part   of last year to damp the growth of aggregate demand  Among these  were the rise in energy prices, waning wealth effects, and the earlier  tightening of monetary policy  In addition, domestic production was  curbed by the strength of the dollar  As I will discuss shortly, many  of these restraining influences turn more favorable fairly soon in our  projection and begin to provide support to economic activity   Moreover, the drag from the inventory adjustment abates after  midyear  Reflecting these influences, real GDP growth is expected  to pick up in the second half of this year and to grow at close to  potential next year     With real GDP rising at a rate slower than that of potential--  especially this year--the unemployment rate rises  By the end of  2001, the jobless rate is projected to reach 52 percent and  unemployment then rises a bit further in 2002  The widening slack      ______________________  2/  A copy of “Materials for Staff Presentation on the Economic Outlook”   is appended to this transcript  (Appendix 2)       1/30-31/01 100  in labor and product markets and a drop-off in energy prices reduce  inflation this year and next to around 1-3/4 percent, when measured  in terms of the PCE price index     Your next chart summarizes some of the key background   factors of our forecast  For our baseline projection, we have  assumed a 25 basis point cut in the funds rate at this meeting and  then a flat funds rate through 2002  Our other financial assumptions  include a near-term decline in the stock market with a leveling out  thereafter  This implies a falling wealth-income ratio through the  end of the projection period  Long-term corporate interest rates  remain near current levels and risk spreads on corporate bonds,  which already are high by historical standards, stay elevated   Reflecting our financial assumptions and the projection for activity  here and abroad, we expect the foreign exchange value of the dollar  to decline moderately  Fiscal policy also is assumed to be  stimulative next year  And finally, prices of oil and natural gas are  expected to recede over the next two years, consistent with quotes in  the futures markets     The next chart looks at the question  What has been happening   to some of the high frequency indicators of activity, and how does  their current behavior compare with the 1990-91 recession?  As you  can see, many of the high frequency data series that we follow have  turned sour recently  The process seems to have been kicked off by  a weakening demand for consumer durable goods--autos as well as  other big-ticket items--and for capital goods (the upper two panels of  the chart)  Comparing the recent experience with the shaded areas,  the declines in the consumer sector are on a par with those seen in  1990-91, while the drop in capital goods orders is steeper  The  resulting cutbacks in production have been widespread  The middle  left panel shows a diffusion index of three-month changes in  manufacturing industrial production  You can see that since the  middle of last year the preponderance of manufacturing industries  have been cutting production  Indeed, the recent pattern of this  index looks increasingly similar to what happened in 1990   Accompanying the reduction in production has been a spate of  layoffs and an upward climb in initial claims for unemployment  insurance  The actual layoffs that have occurred, and the fear of  more to come, have taken a dramatic toll on consumer confidence   The lower left panel shows the Michigan survey’s index of consumer  sentiment  And, as you can see on the table we distributed at the  lunch break, the Conference Board’s expectations index, which was  released this morning, also fell sharply in January        1/30-31/01 101  One bright spot in all of this gloom is the housing sector, where  activity measures such as permits for single-family units, after  receding in early 2000, have stabilized more or less in recent months  at a fairly high level; this stands in sharp contrast to the plunge  during 1990  In addition, anecdotal reports on consumer activity in  January suggest that spending steadied or perhaps turned up     Your next chart addresses the question  What are the near-term   dynamics of our forecast?  It is clear that the extent of the weakness  in final demand that emerged in the latter part of 2000 came as a  surprise to many businesses  As a result, buildups of inventories  were widespread across manufacturing  The most well-publicized  has been the accumulation of light motor vehicles, and the  production adjustments in that sector recently have been quite deep-- the upper two panels  A similar story of excess inventories can be  told for other manufacturers as well--the middle left panel   Businesses in some industries, such as construction supplies and  industrial materials, already have cut production dramatically, and  their inventories should be brought into better balance fairly soon   However, the reductions in output for many of the industries within  the machinery and equipment categories have been relatively small  thus far, and further declines in the next few months are likely before  the overall factory stock overhang is worked off     So, what keeps things from building on themselves and the   economy from collapsing into recession?   As I will discuss shortly,  we think the fundamental determinants of final demand are sound   Consequently, we see the current situation as one in which  production is fluctuating around a comparatively well-maintained  final sales path in order to bring actual and desired inventories into  better balance  In our forecast this adjustment occurs very promptly   We expect manufacturers to slash production at a 7-1/2 percent  annual rate in the current quarter, and factory output is projected to  edge up only slightly next quarter  As shown on line 2 of the table at  the lower left, the sharp drop in factory production accounts for the  bulk of the near-term movements in real GDP     The lower right panel translates this into more familiar NIPA   terms  The dark bars show the growth rate of final sales and the red  bars show the growth rate of the stock of inventories  In our  projection, the stock of nonfarm inventories is virtually unchanged  during the first half of this year, while final sales grow moderately   As a result, we expect the bulk of the inventory overhangs to be  worked off by the middle of this year  It is this rapid response by  manufacturers that helps check a broader and deeper unwinding of  activity  But an important risk to the forecast, and one that we     1/30-31/01 102  explored in the “recession” alternative in Part 1 of the Greenbook, is  that the abruptness of the production cuts and the recent torrent of  layoff announcements--such as yesterday’s from Daimler Chrysler--  might lead to a severe break in consumer and business confidence   That in turn could cause a sizable contraction of final sales, with all  the attendant multiplier and accelerator effects on GDP     In the context of our baseline forecast, however, one might ask    What are the fundamental forces supporting the expected  reacceleration of aggregate demand?  That question is addressed in  chart 5  The first fundamental is monetary policy  The upper left  panel shows the effects of changes in the real funds rate on GDP  growth since the third quarter of 1998, as estimated by the Board’s  FRB/US econometric model  As you can see, the model suggests  that the rate hikes initiated in mid-1999 damped GDP growth  considerably during 2000  The move taken on January 3 of this  year, along with the further easing action assumed in our forecast,  should begin to ease some of the earlier restraint in the next few  months  The degree of restraint progressively lessens through most  of 2002  The assumed changes in discretionary fiscal policy, as  measured by our fiscal impetus indicator, also are projected to boost  aggregate demand, adding about a quarter of a percentage point to  GDP growth next year, according to the FRB/US model     In terms of the components of GDP, we think the fundamentals   for both business investment and consumer spending will be  supportive  Looking at investment first, the actual and assumed  easing of monetary policy and the ongoing descent in the relative  prices of business equipment are expected to lead to further declines  in the user cost of capital--the middle left panel  Moreover, the  banking system is vastly more sound than it was a decade ago, and  we don’t see much in the way of financial headwinds that would  impede funding for worthy projects  Consequently, we are  projecting an acceleration in capital spending later this year and  another sizable pickup next year     For the consumer sector, activity should be boosted by the   projected drop in energy prices  The lower left panel shows a rough  back-of-the-envelope estimate of the direct effects of changes in oil  and natural gas prices on the growth rate of real PCE  As you can  see, after the first quarter of 2001, the depressing effects of last  year’s energy spike begin to unwind and the expected declines in  those prices then contribute to PCE growth     Last, but certainly not least, a critical fundamental factor   supporting activity is our belief that multifactor productivity and     1/30-31/01 103  overall structural labor productivity are still growing rapidly  Dave  will talk about our productivity projection shortly  Suffice it to say,  however, that the effects of this assumption permeate the forecast   For one, the rapid growth of structural productivity is reflected in a  strong expansion of permanent income, and, after the economy  passes through the current inventory correction, in actual income as  well  Indeed, as you can see in the lower right panel, we expect  before-tax real personal income to rise 3-1/2 percent next year-- about the same as in 1999 and 2000  This, of course, is an important  force supporting consumption growth throughout the projection  period     Dave will now continue our presentation     It’s probably on about the same scale relative to what’s going   on in terms of final demand and so on  It’s a touch sharper and faster than historically;   there’s no doubt about that  And that is based on our judgment that there have been   changes in the flexibility of businesses, both in terms of their labor inputs and their   supply chain management systems, to adapt to unexpected changes in final demand that   lead to these excess inventories  So, yes, we have factored in some change in the speed   of the adjustment It’s not a massive change, but it has been informing our decisions    Well, let me talk a little about what we know  We know that   much of the inventory overhang initially began in domestically produced autos  We   know the physical size of that overhang  So, that clearly is one sector where we could   say that the excess inventory has been in domestically produced goods and where we can   set aside the import issue  Another place where we have seen major imbalances   beginning to develop and adjustments taking place is in construction materials and   supplies, much of which is domestically produced although not entirely so  We   obviously import some lumber and other construction supplies  But a great deal of that   adjustment also--and we can tell that from industrial production--has been in domestic     1/30-31/01 117  industries  Another area where we’ve seen overhangs is in materials  Those goods have   a broader range of sources of supply  Clearly, some of the overhang in steel has been in   imported steel  But we know also that a lot of it must have been domestically produced   because we can see the production adjustments taking place; for example, this morning’s   data on the most recent weekly numbers for steel production indicated that it was down   again this past week  So we know that a lot of it has been on the domestic side  I’ll defer   to Karen to speak about what we know from the import side    That's a good question  I can see how the confidence   surveys--because the questions are asked in terms of one’s expectations about what will   happen to the economy--could be plunging and yet people’s views with regard to their   own personal situations and their individual longer-run income prospects could be well   maintained  So implicit in our thinking, although we don’t write it down this way   explicitly, is the view that once we get past this inventory correction--and the layoff   announcements slow down and so forth--people’s expectations about the longer-run   prospects for the economy will start to go back up again  We don’t envision a severe   confidence break that is long lasting  But that’s clearly a risk to the forecast, and it’s the   reason we included an alternative simulation in Part I of the Greenbook with a greater   near-term loss of confidence    Actually Jeff Fuhrer, who is here today, has done a lot of the   staff’s work on this  As we’ve noted many times before, the one series that seems to   have a bit of predictive power is the one about unemployment expectations       1/30-31/01 121 "

6996,2002-01-29," Let me turn now from the broad contours of our projection to  some of the details  Chart 6 shows a few of the high-frequency production indicators  that have influenced our judgments about the current state of the economy  One  important indicator that has informed our thinking is private payroll employment (the  upper left panel) As you can see, the rate of decline began to slow at the end of last  year More recently, initial claims for unemployment insurance—shown to the  right—have continued to fall, on balance, and are now reaching a level that typically  is consistent with stable employment  In terms of production itself, assemblies of  motor vehicles (the middle left panel) have been moving in a sawtooth pattern during  the past few months but at a fairly high level on average  And as shown by the              January 29-30, 2002 Page 48 of 194  dashed line, automakers plan to maintain output at close to the recent pace  However,  elsewhere in manufacturing—the middle right panel—we estimate that production  continued to contract at a substantial pace through December  Even here, though, the  very recent news is promising  For one thing, an index of selected weekly physical  product data, excluding motor vehicles and electricity generation, which is  constructed by the staff, appears to have stabilized during January The weekly index  is illustrated in the black line of the lower left panel, while the bars show the monthly  averages Although this index represents only about 8 percent of industrial  production, the fact that it seems to have stabilized is certainly a good sign   Moreover, the ISM—formerly known as the NAPM—new orders diffusion index  turned up sharply in November and December  Based on historical relationships,  these increases, if maintained, suggest that the contraction in the IP sub-component  shown in the panel above should come to an end in the not too distant future   Turning from production to sales, the table at the top of chart 7 shows some key  near-term indicators of private domestic final purchases  By now, the story for sales  of motor vehicles—line 1 of the table—is quite familiar  The only point I would  make is that, even with the phasing down of the zero percent financing incentives,  sales are still relatively buoyant More broadly, real consumer spending for goods  other than motor vehicles (line 2) rebounded in October from a depressed September  reading, and sizable gains were maintained in November and December  Moreover,  for what it’s worth, the weekly readings on chain store sales (not shown) suggest that  spending held up reasonably well in the first four weeks of January  Activity in the  housing sector—line 3—also has held up quite well  The outlook for business  investment, however, is more mixed  I’ll talk about the information technology  sector in a few moments  Let me note here that outside of IT, shipments of  nondefense capital goods—line 4—have yet to show a sustained pickup  But the  orders data we received this morning—line 5 of the table—were encouraging and  could contain the first hints of a turnaround in this sector   The near-term path for production is being influenced importantly by the  dynamics of the inventory cycle  The middle two panels show measures of the days’  supply of inventories These measures are based on a system that uses industrial  production and other indicators to trace the flow of goods and materials through the  economy  The left panel shows the huge overhang of semiconductors and other items  related to the IT sector that developed during late 2000 and the first part of 2001   While severe overhangs still plague producers of communications equipment, stocks  of semiconductors and computers have been brought down to more manageable  levels, and the days’ supply for the entire sector has retraced a good part of its earlier  run-up Outside the IT sector (the right panel), progress has been more uneven, and  inventories in several industries—notably, paper, electrical machinery, furniture and  apparel—remain excessive  Accordingly, we expect production in many of these  industries to remain subdued a while longer   The bottom panel shows how we see the near-term inventory dynamics playing  out The solid black line shows the level of GDP excluding motor vehicles, while the                 January 29-30, 2002 Page 49 of 194  dashed line shows final sales excluding motor vehicles  When the level of GDP  exceeds the level of final sales, the gap is shaded green and reflects the extent of  inventory accumulation  Similarly, the red-shaded area is a period when production  is below sales and inventories are being liquidated  In our projection, the maximum  amount of non-motor-vehicle liquidation is estimated to have occurred in the fourth  quarter of 2001 We expect the pace of liquidation to diminish over the next couple  of quarters as businesses boost the level of production up to the level of final sales,  providing a considerable fillip to near-term GDP growth   The next exhibit focuses on the outlook for two key components of GDP—  business and household spending As shown on line 3 of the table, the prime mover  of business investment this year in our forecast is a revival in spending for computers  and peripherals, which we think is already under way  Indeed, with the growth of real  computer shipments surging well into positive territory lately—the right panel—we  estimate that investment outlays increased at an annual rate of 30 percent in the fourth  quarter of 2001 The question, of course, is whether this is just a short-lived burst or  the start of a sustained upswing The anecdotal reports have been increasingly  favorable, with stories of a pickup in the demand for high-end servers near the end of  last year and the likelihood of an “upgrade cycle” for PCs beginning during 2002  In  terms of hard data, one encouraging indicator is the series from our IP system on  production of semiconductors (the middle left panel), which we have found to be  useful in predicting computer investment for up to two quarters ahead  As you can  see, this series has recorded solid gains in recent months  As firms step up the pace  of spending for new computers, we expect that they will want to upgrade their  software as well—line 4 of the table In contrast to computers and software, the  outlook for communications equipment—line 5—remains negative  Both our near- term indicators, such as production and new orders, and the anecdotal information  suggest that a substantial capital overhang is still weighing heavily on this segment of  the market  At best, we don’t expect the situation to stabilize until sometime this  summer Business spending for other equipment (line 6) is also projected to be quite  soft A sizable portion of the spending for this category, which includes such things  as metalworking and industrial machinery, comes from manufacturing firms  But as  shown in the middle right, manufacturing capacity utilization currently is quite low,  and it stays relatively low throughout the projection period, providing little incentive  for many manufacturers to boost spending on new equipment   The lower panels examine our consumption forecast  In light of the robust  performance of PCE last year, especially given the rise in unemployment and the  slump in the stock market, one might be tempted to ask whether our wealth effect  story has been failing us One crude way to answer the question is to compare the  behavior of the wealth-income ratio (the black line in the left panel) with the ratio of  PCE to income, essentially 1 minus the saving rate, which is shown by the red line   As you can see, over time these two series track each other fairly well, and they have  been well aligned recently  Moreover, our more-elaborate econometric models of  consumption that include wealth have not been making persistent errors  One reason  that consumption growth has been as strong as it has is that real income growth—the                 January 29-30, 2002 Page 50 of 194  yellow bars in the lower right panel—also has been relatively well maintained   Looking forward, consumption spending is held up in part by the strong growth of  real disposable income that we expect in 2002, with a chunk of that gain coming from  the cut in tax rates that went into effect on January 1   The upper left panel of chart 9 shows our projection for core PCE price inflation   As David pointed out earlier, we expect core PCE inflation to slow by ½ percentage  point over the next two years The projected deceleration of core inflation reflects, in  part, the indirect effects of declining energy prices  As shown in the middle right  panel, according to staff estimates, energy input prices faced by nonfinancial  corporations other than energy producers have reversed all of their 2000 spurt,  dropping rapidly since early 2001  Of course, changes in energy input prices are not  necessarily fully, nor immediately, passed through to final purchasers  But over the  next year, we expect lower energy input costs to reduce the rate of core inflation  about 02 percentage point—essentially offsetting last year’s boost  Another  important factor leading to a deceleration of inflation over the next two years is the  low rate of resource utilization that we anticipate  As shown in the middle left panel,  we expect actual GDP to be below the estimated level of potential GDP throughout  the projection period, albeit with the gap narrowing somewhat; and, as David  mentioned earlier, the unemployment rate remains in the vicinity of 6 percent  The  slack in labor markets is likely to be a damping influence on the growth rate of unit  labor costs over the projection period judged relative to either actual productivity (as  illustrated by the bars in the middle right panel) or structural productivity (the line)   That said, the bottom panel highlights one upside risk to the inflation forecast, which  we discussed in the alternative simulation section of the Greenbook—namely,  extremely narrow profit margins  As you can see, the profit share dropped sharply  between 1997 and 2001, and we expect it to remain low  In part, this reflects strong  competitive pressures from prices of imported goods  However, historical experience  suggests that the profit share won’t stay this low forever  Thus, we face the risk that  over the next two years firms may begin increasing prices in an attempt to rebuild  profit margins  Karen will now continue our presentation    Yes This is our industrial production index, which is actually   constructed by looking at production on a chip-by-chip basis—at that level of detail  So by   doing that we are accounting for changes in quality over time   Well, there are two things going on  One, in the very short term   D-RAM prices actually have shot way up, as you know, apparently because of demand  But   over the longer haul, we expect a return—because of technological improvement—to the rapid   rates of decline that we saw over the course of the 1990s, which would be on the order of 25 to   30 percent   That’s certainly a possibility  But I’m not aware that we were hearing a   great number of stories along those lines from our business contacts    If anything, I think that was the kind of report that we were hearing   from our business contacts as well   When we do our current-quarter estimate for consumption—2002Q1   being the current quarter now—it pretty much is not model driven    It’s based on a several factors  One is the pattern of the monthly data   as we move into the quarter  In part the PCE projection is driven by what we think we know   about auto sales even in January, which plays a role there  So we’re thinking about those kinds   of things much more than any consumption model   An important consideration in our minds as we look beyond the current   quarter or so is some notion of a target inventory-sales ratio  We think these target ratios have   been on a downtrend for at least the past decade and maybe longer  In order to get a forecast that   has a target inventory-sales ratio that behaves the way we think it should, we basically need to   have businesses get rid of the excess inventory that built up in late 2000 through 2001—a   process that is going on now We think those inventory-sales ratios are generally in a range that   is close to the target levels  So, after firms get rid of their excess inventories, they have   production and final sales growing in line with each other, as the panel at the bottom of chart 7   shows, in order to keep those ratios from going back up again That’s the logic behind our   forecast You can quibble about the exact numbers, but that’s the basic philosophy that we use        January 29-30, 2002 Page 62 of 194 "
7204,2003-01-28,"3  Before we start the chart show itself, I want to give you an  update on the data released yesterday on orders, shipments, and inventories  These  are on the separate sheet inserted in the chart show package  As shown on line 1, new  orders for nondefense capital goods rose 28 percent last month—about in line with  our expectation  In addition, the November number was revised up reflecting, in part,  a whopping revision to aircraft orders  The shipments numbers, lines 6 through 10,  were weaker than expected and, all else being equal, would shave 01 percentage  point off fourth-quarter GDP and put us on a slightly lower trajectory going into the  first quarter  However, inventories at manufacturers of durable goods, line 11, are  reported to have soared at an annual rate of nearly $30 billion last month, with almost  all of the accumulation in the aircraft industry (line 12)  Given what we know from  Boeing about their production and deliveries last month, we’re puzzled by the size of  this number  Nevertheless, taking the figure at face value, it would add about  04 percentage point to fourth-quarter GDP     Let me turn now to the chart show  In putting together the Greenbook, two of the   questions we asked ourselves were, “What the heck happened to the economy in the  fourth quarter?” and “How do we get from an economy that appeared to be dead in  the water late last year to one that’s growing at a 4½ percent rate in the second half of  this year?”  Many of you may well have asked yourselves the same questions     So, what happened in the latter part of 2002?  Two different factors seemed to   have been at work  First was the return of the production of motor vehicles to a more  sustainable pace in the fourth quarter (the red dot in the top left panel) from the  elevated third-quarter rate  We estimate that the drop in assemblies deducted about  1 percentage point from fourth-quarter GDP growth  But as shown by the open dot,  we expect this sector to be essentially neutral for GDP growth in the first quarter  As  shown in the top right panel, the other factor helping to explain the pause of GDP  growth during the fourth quarter was a resumption of inventory liquidation outside  the motor vehicle sector following the modest accumulation in the preceding quarter      The remaining panels of this exhibit trace out the main elements of the   production, demand, and inventory story in the second half of last year  The high- frequency data in these panels and the anecdotal reports in the Beige Book and from  our business contacts highlight a feature of last year’s economic performance that is  obscured by the arithmetic of quarterly averaging—namely, the abrupt halt in the  growth of non-auto factory output that occurred in middle of last year (the middle left  panel)  The retrenchment doubtless was related in part, as one contact put it, to a                                                     3 The materials used by Mr Slifman, Mr Struckmeyer, and Ms Johnson are appended to this transcript (appendix  3)   January 28-29, 2003 70 of 195    “complete loss of business confidence in the wake of the corporate governance  scandals”  Despite some retrenchment of production, final sales excluding motor  vehicles continued to expand  As shown in the middle right panel, consumer  spending (line 1) and housing activity (lines 2 and 3) were both well maintained  through the end of the year, although business spending (line 4) remained sluggish   The shortfall of production from demand outside the auto sector had as its  tautological counterpart a reduction in inventories, especially for consumer goods and  business equipment  As we noted in the Greenbook, because final sales have  continued to increase, we are not viewing last quarter’s liquidation as signaling a  major problem with unwanted stocks that could cumulate into even deeper production  cuts  The days’ supply of inventories, illustrated in the bottom left panel, does not  suggest any serious imbalances, nor do the reports from purchasing managers on their  customers’ inventories (the bottom right panel)  In GDP terms, we expect non-auto  inventories to be a neutral factor in the current quarter after subtracting a percentage  point from growth last quarter     Your next exhibit begins to lay out our answer to the second question I raised   initially “How do we get from here to there?”  In the first half of 2003, when GDP is  projected to rise at a 2¾ percent rate, the answer is essentially the mirror image of the  one for the fourth quarter of this year—an absence of drag from motor vehicles and  inventories coupled with continued gains in final demand  Indeed, we already may be  seeing the start of this outcome  Factory production excluding motor vehicles ticked  up in December, and most reports from purchasing managers have been upbeat of  late  In our projection, activity steps up sharply after midyear and remains well above  the growth rate of potential through the end of the forecast period  With output  increasing faster than potential, the unemployment rate begins to fall later this year   Even so, enough slack remains in the economy to result in a further deceleration in  consumer prices  The acceleration of GDP after midyear reflects several factors,  some of which are highlighted in the middle panel  As shown in the first bullet, we  assume that the cloud of uncertainty and pessimism hanging over the business sector  will begin to lift as we go through the year  In addition, strong gains in structural  productivity boost real incomes and spending  As regards monetary policy, the  stimulus associated with past easings, as well as an assumed accommodative policy in  the projection period, provides significant forward momentum  Finally, we expect  new doses of fiscal stimulus to be injected into the economy in mid-2003 and the  beginning of next year     The fiscal package we’ve assumed involves bringing forward in time several tax   cuts that currently are scheduled to be phased in between 2004 and 2010— specifically, an increase in the child tax credit, an expansion of the 10 percent tax  bracket, marginal rate reductions, and marriage penalty relief  We have not included  the Administration’s dividend exclusion proposal in our baseline assumptions  The  bottom left panel shows our fiscal impetus indicator, which is a measure of the initial  impulse to aggregate demand arising from discretionary changes in federal spending  and taxes  The red line shows the amount of fiscal stimulus in the pipeline under  current tax law  The shaded area illustrates the extra stimulus that results from our   January 28-29, 2003 71 of 195    assumption that future tax cuts will be accelerated  The panel on the bottom right  uses simulations of the FRB/US model to estimate the direct and indirect effects of  our fiscal assumption on the growth rate of GDP as well as the effects of adding in  the dividend exclusion proposal  The solid gray portion of the bars indicates our  estimate of what GDP growth would be if the Congress made no changes to current  tax law  This corresponds to the “political gridlock” scenario shown in the  Greenbook  As you can see, even in the absence of another shot of fiscal stimulus,  we would still expect the economy to grow smartly in 2003 and 2004  The red  shaded area highlights the effects of our assumed acceleration of future tax cuts,  while the yellow portion adds in an estimate of the effects of adopting the dividend  exclusion proposal  As discussed in the memo sent to the Committee last Friday,  there are a number of very thorny issues related to the economic effects of cutting the  tax on dividends that are not settled in the economics literature  Accordingly, the  simulation results have a very wide confidence band     Much of the stimulus from monetary and fiscal policy manifests itself in the   household sector, the subject of your next exhibit  Consumer spending (the blue bars  in the top left panel) was well maintained last year, spurred in part by low interest  rates and the tax-cut-related jump in real disposable income (the yellow bars)   Looking forward, we expect that the strong gains in structural productivity and the tax  cuts assumed to come on line this year and next will support DPI growth through the  projection period  In addition, we assume that there will be no further deterioration in  net worth relative to income over the projection period, as shown in the panel to the  right  The middle left table provides a parsing of these effects on the growth rate of  real PCE  A step-up in the growth of structural productivity boosts the contribution  from potential GDP (line 2); this is augmented by the stimulative influence of the tax  cuts (line 3) and some waning of the negative wealth effects (line 4)  One risk to the  outlook for consumer spending that has been raised by some analysts is the possibility  that households are overextended and are unusually vulnerable to unanticipated  disruptions to income  As shown in the insert in the middle right panel, household  debt growth is projected to step down from the rapid pace in 2002, reflecting a  moderation in the pace of mortgage borrowing (the yellow bars)     Nonetheless, the growth of household debt continues to exceed the rise in nominal   income, continuing the upward trend in the overall debt–income ratio (line 1 in the  bottom left table)  However, we don’t see this increase in debt burden as likely to  impose serious restraint on consumer spending  In part this is because the rise in debt  burdens is heavily concentrated at the upper decile of the income distribution— households with incomes above $108,000 in 2001, according to the Survey of  Consumer Finances  As shown on line 2, the staff estimates that between 1995 and  2002 the debt–income ratio for the lower 90 percent rose 9 points, compared with the  30 point increase for the top decile (line 3)  Thus the bulk of the rise in debt ratios  has been concentrated among households with the means to service these obligations   Moreover, as shown in the bottom right panel, low interest rates have helped keep  required consumer payments broadly defined—that is, mortgage debt service as well   January 28-29, 2003 72 of 195    as required household payments for property taxes, home insurance, tenant rent,  motor vehicle leases and consumer credit—below previous peaks     Your next exhibit focuses on the business sector  As shown in the top left panel,   we expect real investment in high-tech equipment and software to accelerate over the  projection period, with an increase of more than 20 percent during 2004—about in  line with the gains observed during the last half of the 1990s  The recovery in  spending for other equipment, excluding transportation, shown in the top right panel,  is more drawn out; but we think that eventually it, too, will begin posting robust  gains, boosted in part by the partial-expensing provision enacted last spring  More  generally, the pickups for both high-tech and other equipment reflect our assumed  lifting of business gloom as well as the direct and indirect effects of monetary and  fiscal policy     In light of the dismal performance of the equipment sector in recent years, you   would be justified in being somewhat skeptical that such a strong recovery will occur  any time soon—even with the favorable cost of capital and tax incentives  The  middle two panels will, I hope, go some way toward persuading you of the  reasonableness of our forecast  The charts translate the level of real gross investment  into the growth rate of the net capital stock using the same depreciation rates that the  BEA uses in constructing the national accounts  You can see that, even though gross  investment is rising rapidly, projected capital stock growth is rather conservative by  historical standards  Not only do we think that the investment forecast in reasonable,  we also think that, in the current financial environment, it is achievable  As shown in  the bottom left panel, firms have taken advantage of low interest rates to restructure  their balance sheets away from short-term debt, lightening their current repayment  obligations  Moreover, as was discussed yesterday, corporate bond spreads have  come in recently (the bottom right panel), and bank financing (not shown) appears to  be readily available for creditworthy firms     As I said near the beginning of my remarks, a key element in helping the   economy get from here to there is the strong growth of structural productivity that we  continue to assume, which Sandy will now discuss      The final chart presents your forecasts for 2003  You have   revised down your projection for the growth of real GDP and raised your forecast of  the unemployment rate  Your projection for PCE prices this year has been lowered a  touch  That concludes our prepared remarks, Mr Chairman  We’d be happy to take  any questions      It’s in there through the way we calculate the capital services part of the   capital deepening      Well, I think that was many years ago, and that’s because we used   capital stock growth rather than capital services and we would then make the adjustment for   changes in composition  But when we shifted over to using capital services, which incorporates   that effect, we no longer showed that separately    Yes, we may have to send something to you on that later   January 28-29, 2003 84 of 195     Well, the simplest answer is that empirically we’ve never actually been   able to find a relationship between debt burdens and consumer spending at the aggregate level    January 28-29, 2003 96 of 195    We attempt to look at some of these data at a more disaggregated level, and the bottom left panel   is one way of trying to do that  As I pointed out earlier, the debt burden levels are far higher for   the upper-income consumer; much of the action has occurred in the upper decile, where we think   there’s a large cushion to protect against income disruptions   We also looked at the Survey of Consumer Finances to see, for example, if there had   been any changes between the 1998 survey and the 2001 survey in the data on the households   that are late making their payments  At the aggregate level we didn’t see any real change in   payment problems  We did see an increase, however—and this perhaps goes to your question—  in difficulties in making payments for the lower-income, low-wealth, younger households  I   think the category was those under the age of 35, which to me is quite young So, there are   clearly households for which this is a problem, but we don’t have the sense that it is going to be a   widespread problem  As I said, empirically we don’t see evidence—in the aggregate anyway—  that debt burden matters for PCE  It may well be that it does  We just can’t find a relationship    I’ll start, and others can join in  First, let me make a brief comment on   our forecast versus those of many outsiders  It’s hard to know exactly, but I think one of the   main differences between our forecast and many of the outside forecasts—especially when we’re   talking about 2004—is our productivity assumption  We clearly have a stronger assumption and   that feeds through in a variety of ways      Let me go through a couple of the other issues you raised and try to   address some of them  The main question you asked was, in effect, where are the upside risks in   this forecast  If I were to go through the upside risks, an important one would be capital   January 28-29, 2003 100 of 195    spending  The point of chart 4 on capital spending was to show that it would actually by itself be   considered fairly conservative in terms of what we have the growth of capital stock doing  There   is a lot of potential there on the upside if businesses really were to become convinced that a   strong recovery was in place and they felt comfortable about the outlook going forward  The   rates of return on investment seem to be high; certainly that’s consistent with our productivity   forecast being very high  They’re related, but my point is that it doesn’t require just that   productivity assumption to get the possibility of a strong upside on capital spending if this   pessimism lifts    Granted  But you’re asking for the upside risks, and I’m just saying   that I think there is some upside risk there     It certainly could be stronger, and that would be an important risk I   would point to  Is there a possibility that we’ve been low-balling productivity growth?  Perhaps    I wouldn’t put a lot of weight on that one  As for the stimulus associated with past changes in   monetary policy, we still have some stimulus in train  I forget the exact numbers, but I think it’s   in the range of something like ½ percentage point increments going forward for a while before it   finally peters out  As you know, our fiscal policy assumption is just that—an assumption  I   don’t know what more to say about that in terms of upside or downside risks    Now, let me briefly comment on the state and local government situation, if I may  That   clearly is a possible source of restraint in the forecast, and we have built fiscal restraint into this   forecast from the state and local sector  We’ve built it in both by lowering the growth of state   January 28-29, 2003 101 of 195    and local government spending to the levels we were seeing in the 1990s—the last time they   went through difficulties—and by making adjustments on the tax side as well in their revenue   streams  So we’ve actually put in a dose of fiscal restraint from that sector, recognizing exactly   the problems that you’ve highlighted  I think Dave Stockton has some comments that he wanted   to make as well    "
7307,2003-05-06,"  I don’t think so  We’ll look into that issue      I don’t have a good answer for you  We’ll have to look into it   May 6, 2003 23 of 115   "
7482,2004-01-27,"4   We’ll have an upward revision to Q1 and probably a downward   revision to Q4    Well, the one other thing that I would note, as we pointed out in the   Greenbook as well, is that the level of new orders has been running above the level of shipments,   implying an increase in unfilled orders for some time now for the “all other” category  So, again,   we take that to be a favorable sign  Shall we get started with the chart show now?  5       For the chart show, Sandy Struckmeyer, Steve Kamin, and I  will be referring to the packet of materials that was distributed to you  While putting  together the Greenbook, two of the questions we asked ourselves were, first, “Where  is the economy now?” and, second, “What are the forces that should sustain above- potential growth over the next two years?”   With regard to what is sometimes called “forecasting the present,” your first  exhibit shows a variety of indicators that have informed our judgments  The top left  panel plots average monthly changes in private payrolls  Like most observers, we  were disappointed by the payroll employment report for December  However, that  reading came on the heels of more-favorable reports for the preceding two months   Averaging through the monthly ups and downs, as I’ve done in the bars on your chart,  you can see that, after a protracted period of job losses, employment has been on an  uptrend since midyear, albeit a weaker one than is typical for this stage of the  business cycle     In contrast to the payroll numbers, most indicators of final demand have been   quite favorable  Sales of autos and light trucks (the top right panel) and other  consumer goods (the middle left panel) point to continued strength of household  demand, while the orders and shipments figures (the middle right panel), which here  are plotted only through November, tell a similar story for business demand  And as I   5 The materials used by Messrs Slifman, Struckmeyer, and Kamin are appended to this transcript (appendix 5)   January 27-28, 2004 94 of 238    mentioned earlier, this morning’s orders and shipments release provided further  confirmation of an ongoing pickup in business spending     Thus, in putting together our near-term GDP forecast, we once again were faced   with a tension between lackluster payroll employment numbers and pretty stellar  incoming data for final sales and production  And, once again, we’ve resolved that  tension by writing down sizable increases in productivity (the bottom left panel)   Sandy will be discussing productivity in greater detail later  The table at the bottom  right adds it all up  We now estimate that real GDP grew at a 48 percent annual rate  in the fourth quarter of 2003 and will expand at a 5 percent pace in the current  quarter  The bulk of the increase in GDP over this two-quarter period comes from  robust gains in final sales; but with stock–sales ratios so low, inventory investment is  expected to make a noticeable contribution as well  Let me note that this exhibit  reflects the figures that were in the Greenbook—before we got the data on shipments  and orders this morning  So perhaps we might take a tenth or two off Q4 and add a  tenth or two to Q1      Turning to the outlook for the next two years, the subject of exhibit 2, the   question is, “Will the current rapid growth be sustained and why?”  As you can see  from the top panel, we think that economic growth will be sustained at rates faster  than potential through the end of 2005  The remaining panels highlight some of the  key contributing forces  Fiscal policy has been quite expansionary in recent years,  and as can be seen in the middle left panel, we expect it to provide additional impetus  to growth through the end of this year  However, on our assumptions, fiscal policy  swings to slight restraint in 2005 as the partial-expensing provision expires and the  growth of defense spending slows  Monetary policy also has been quite supportive of  growth over the past few years  And with the funds rates projected to remain  relatively low over the forecast period, it will continue to be so  Another factor with  favorable implications for growth is the ongoing strength of productivity gains, which  should influence household perceptions of permanent income and business  perceptions of profitability  Given the surge of earnings lately, firms have been able  to finance their desired spending while keeping a tight lid on their borrowing  Indeed,  as shown in the bottom left panel, debt ratios have fallen sharply in recent years and  are now either at or near the lowest levels in the past two decades  With the marked  improvement in business financial conditions, risk spreads—as Dino noted  yesterday—have dropped dramatically on both investment-grade and junk bonds   Returning to the top right panel, the stock market is assumed to rise at a 6¼ percent  annual rate over the projection period—maintaining risk-adjusted parity with the  projected yield on long-term Treasury securities  In our forecast, we see the higher  stock market as providing some support to household spending after several years in  which it was a considerable drag     Your next exhibit focuses in greater detail on the household sector  Personal   income (the dark bars in the top left panel) is expected to rise smartly over the next  two years, supported in part, as I mentioned earlier, by the strength of productivity   The strong income growth provides a considerable lift to consumption outlays (the   January 27-28, 2004 95 of 238    yellow bars)  In addition, last year’s tax cut continues to boost spending in 2004   The top right panel shows the implications of the PCE and income projections for the  saving rate  As indicated by the thick line, the BEA currently estimates that the  saving rate was only 23 percent in the third quarter of last year, and we think it fell  another ½ percentage point in the fourth quarter  In our forecast, the saving rate  climbs about a percentage point over the projection period     One risk to the household sector forecast is that the saving rate might rise more   than we have allowed for in the baseline  The bullets in the middle panel present our  thinking on this issue  The first thing to note is that the BEA, in effect, shifted the  goal posts in its most recent comprehensive revision, by taking the level of the saving  rate down on average over the past decade about a percentage point  This suggested  to us that we ought to revise down our thinking about what constitutes a “normal” or  “target” saving rate by a like amount  Considerable econometric work suggested the  same  That said, the current saving rate still is well below the level that many  observers often think of as a more normal rate  It’s important to keep in mind,  however, that the target saving rate is a moving target  It varies over time as the  fundamental determinants, such as the wealth–income ratio, the composition of  income, and real interest rates, change  Indeed, we read the current settings of those  fundamentals as pointing to a target saving rate for the next year or two in the  neighborhood of 3 percent  In our projection, the saving rate rises to 28 percent by  the fourth quarter of 2005, eliminating the bulk—but not all—of the gap between  actual and target saving  We’re not sure what accounts for the gap that we’re seeing  currently, but departures from our saving models of this magnitude are not unusual   Historically, disequilibriums like this have been worked off fairly gradually, but a  more sudden and complete adjustment, and a consequent drag on aggregate demand,  certainly is a risk     The forecast for housing starts is presented in the bottom left panel  The pace of   homebuilding, fueled by low mortgage rates and robust income growth, is anticipated  to remain strong over the projection period, edging down only a bit from the current  elevated pace as mortgage rates drift up a bit  The bottom right panel shows our  projection of house prices  In our forecast, house prices slow from the 7 to 8 percent  gains posted in recent years, to about 2½ percent during 2005  The downtilt primarily  reflects the current disparity between rapid house-price inflation and much smaller  increases in the data for rents  The econometric evidence suggests that such a  disparity typically is closed by house-price increases moving into alignment with  rents  Of course, there is a wide band of uncertainty around this forecast, which  imparts a wide band of uncertainty—both upside and downside—to movements in  household net worth over the next two years, with consequent implications for  household spending     Turning to the business sector, exhibit 4, we expect real outlays for equipment   and software—both the high-tech component and the “other” component—to rise  rapidly this year, spurred in part by the temporary tax incentive  Indeed, the partial- expensing provision adds about 2½ percentage points to overall E&S growth this year   January 27-28, 2004 96 of 238    and subtracts close to 6 percentage points next year  The basic contour of the forecast  is consistent with the information given recently to the Reserve Banks by businesses  in their Districts  As shown in the middle left panel, slightly more than half of the  respondents plan to boost their capital spending in 2004—the responses are  appreciably more upbeat than those in June  Although the usual accelerator effects  were the primary reason given for the improvement, a sizable fraction of respondents  also pointed to replacement needs as an important consideration  Moreover, partial  expensing finally appears to be on the radar screens of at least some firms  A quarter  of the respondents also cited improved cash flow or balance sheet positions, reflecting  no doubt strong profits and, presumably, the expected profitability of new  investments  As shown to the right, in our forecast the profit share continues to rise  through mid-2004 before drifting down as labor costs accelerate and competition puts  pressure on margins  Nonetheless, even through the end of next year, profits are still  elevated by historical standards     An important element of our capital spending forecast is strong demand for   computers  In part, our forecast for computer spending has been informed by the  projections of industry analysts for unit sales of PCs—both so-called desktop boxes  (which typically sit on the floor) and laptops (which often sit on desks)  [Laughter]   The bottom left panel shows one such forecast from a leading consulting group  As  you can see, unit sales are expected to rise sharply throughout the projection period,  driven by the need to replace machines that have become physically or  technologically obsolete  After adding in the effects of quality change, these unit  sales translate into real spending increases on the order of 40 percent annually over  the next two years—roughly in line with the increases posted during the second half  of the 1990s  One concern that has been raised in many circles is the implication for  the domestic economy of outsourcing computer production—that is, whether today’s  boxes contain considerably less domestic content than the boxes sold a few years ago   The bottom right panel addresses this question  It uses cost shares to measure the  domestic content of PCs sold in the United States  Most of the domestic value-added  in a PC is for the micro-processing unit—the Pentium or similar chip that lies at the  heart of our PCs  This is shown by the black shaded portion of the bars; smaller  contributions come from the production of specialized chips that provide basic logic  or act like traffic managers inside your PC and, to a lesser extent, from integration  and final shipment  The bulk of the foreign value-added is for such things as printed  circuit boards, storage devices, and peripherals  The point is that the United States is  still the world leader in designing leading-edge chips (a very high value-added  activity) and fabricating them (also a high value-added activity)  As a result, the  domestic content of PCs has changed relatively little over the past few years   Accordingly, the sharp rise in PC sales that we are forecasting should translate into  domestic production at about the same rate as in recent years  Steve will now turn the  discussion from domestic content to foreign content      I don’t think we have a conclusion on that  Accuracy has to be defined   as relative to what?      I understand, but I don’t have any third source of the real world against   which to compare the other two  The one thing we can perhaps do is to ask ourselves which of   the two measures, in terms of the econometrics, helps us best in transforming the data into an   understanding of consumption behavior or household behavior  Once again, I don’t think there   is a firm conclusion    Yes, and we can’t definitively say which has won over the other  In all   of our work we stay with the NIPA measure because then we are working with a consistently   measured system      Right  So that’s why we do all of our work using the NIPA data   Obviously we do look at what’s happening to household balance sheets, and the flow of funds   saving rate is a part of that household balance sheet system     It’s the flow of funds saving rate      Right    They’ve started to fall  Rather, the rate of increase is coming down     I will agree with you  [Laughter]  It is true that in our baseline forecast   we don’t see any bubbles  We’ve tried to lay out the possibility of risks and point out to you   where, if we are wrong in that judgment, bubbles could occur  For example, by our forecast   there isn’t a bubble in house prices; but if there were, we have tried to point out that that could be   a risk  So if that sector were to collapse suddenly, we have indicated the implications of that for   household balance sheets  But you are correct that in our baseline we do not have a bubble    Let me be perfectly clear about one thing  We have a couple of   different ways in which we try to make an assessment about what is happening to house prices    One of those doesn’t take into account the arbitrage condition, as it were, between house prices   January 27-28, 2004 115 of 238    and rents; it basically looks at interest rates and cyclical variables  On that basis, the expectation   would be that house prices would continue to rise quite rapidly  When one takes into account the   gap between house prices and changes in rents, that model would actually have house prices, as   Dave indicated, essentially having to flatten out and the gap coming down to zero  So what we   have done in the baseline forecast is to take a position about midway between, moving only part   of the way toward that flattening-out view of the world  And the point Dave was making is that   the flattening-out model could be the right one, so there is a chance that we could see more   house-price deceleration than we’ve forecast  We could see the change in house prices actually   flattening out for a while or perhaps—though it would be unusual—even turning negative      Yes, that model suggests that house prices could rise faster than what   we’ve put into our baseline  So we’ve tried to take a position somewhere between those two    I’m just looking at my chart, and I think it may be misplotted    Mr Chairman, unfortunately there is a charting error on chart 1in the   exhibit on nonfarm business productivity at the bottom left  I just want to point it out so that no   one is confused  Rather than plotting the quarter-to-quarter percent changes in those bars we   inadvertently plotted the percent change from four quarters earlier  So the correct numbers   should be 94 percent for the third quarter, 33 percent for the fourth quarter, and 37 percent for   the first quarter of 2004    I was using what I thought was constructive ambiguity there   [Laughter]  I’m not sure what most observers think of as the normal rate, but when one reads   Wall Street newsletters and things like that, one often sees numbers like 6 or 7 percent  I prefer   the term “target” because I think it implies what we think is actually going on in terms of our   models of consumption—that households have a target saving rate that is based on things such as   those I noted here, including the wealth ratio and real interest rates  And then it is affected by   the composition of income and, in particular, the role of transfer payments  So I prefer the target   concept; and by our reckoning, that would currently be something on the order of 3 percent or so    That is the number that I think we should be focusing on      In the extended Greenbook simulations that are presented in the   Bluebook, we have real interest rates rising out to 2010  Consistent with the baseline of that   extended forecast in the Bluebook, we would have by 2010 a target saving rate on the order of   6 percent  But that’s not what we should be thinking about for 2004-05    Absolutely  And as I pointed out, that 28 percent saving rate that   we’ve written down for the end of 2005 still is a bit below target, so we could clearly get a more   complete correction to target and maybe even some movement above that target  "
7689,2005-02-01,"3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  We’ll be referring to the package of materials  entitled “Staff Presentation on the Economic Outlook”   As you know from reading the Greenbook, the only material change in our  forecast since the December FOMC meeting concerns prospects for the near term   So, after briefly reviewing some of the recent high-frequency indicators, I’ll focus  my discussion on the fundamental forces that we see driving economic activity over  the next two years   With regard to the very near-term outlook, your first chart shows a variety of  data series that have informed our judgments  The upper panels highlight two  “production side” indicators As illustrated in the upper left, private nonfarm payroll  employment rose 181,000 per month, on average, in the fourth quarter, a noticeable  pickup from the third-quarter pace  In addition, the Board’s index of industrial  production continued to show above-trend gains in manufacturing sector activity   Most forward-looking indicators of production, such as the regional business surveys  conducted by the Reserve Banks and the ISM [Institute for Supply Management]  manufacturing report that was released yesterday, also point to continued near-term  gains, although perhaps not as robust as late last year   The data on private final sales also look quite favorable Real PCE excluding  motor vehicles (the middle left panel) rose rapidly in the fourth quarter, and motor  vehicles (the panel to the right) continue to sell at a brisk pace After the Greenbook  was published, we received information on orders and shipments for nondefense  capital goods As shown by the inset box in the lower left panel, shipments  excluding aircraft rose 22 percent and orders advanced 18 percent in December   These figures were about in line with our expectations All told, our estimate of  fourth-quarter real GDP growth, shown on line 1 of the table, was fairly close to  BEA’s [Bureau of Economic Analysis]—especially after BEA factors in an error in  the Canadian trade statistics that apparently depressed estimated US exports  Karen  will have more to say about the Canadian numbers shortly  In any event, we see no  reason to alter our first-quarter forecast as a result of the BEA’s fourth-quarter GDP  estimate   Your next chart presents an overview of the forecast As described in the  first bullet of the upper panel, our forecast is predicated on a continuing withdrawal   3 The materials used by Messrs Slifman and Struckmeyer, and Ms Johnson are appended to this transcript  (appendix 3)                          February 1-2, 2005 69 of 177  of monetary accommodation over the next two years, with the federal funds rate  reaching 3 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and 3½ percent in the latter part  of 2006—a path quite similar to that implied by futures quotes  Regarding fiscal  policy, we’ve reduced our deficit projection for fiscal year 2005 more than $20  billion, primarily reflecting stronger incoming data on corporate tax receipts; the  deficit in 2006 is unchanged from the previous Greenbook  But the change to our  deficit estimate has virtually no effect on our preferred indicator of fiscal stimulus,  FI, which is designed to capture the macroeconomic effects of exogenous policy  changes FI is expected to be neutral in 2005 and to provide only a small positive  impetus to GDP growth in 2006   Although oil prices have moved higher in recent weeks, the futures market  continues to see the likely path as pointing downward from here forward, and, as  usual, we have conditioned the forecast on their views Karen and I will both have  more to say about oil prices  And, as Karen will discuss, the staff expects the foreign  exchange value of the dollar to drift down As for asset values, stock prices are  assumed to rise 6½ percent this year and next, which would roughly maintain risk- adjusted parity with the yield on long-term bonds, while the rate of increase in house  prices is expected to slow considerably from last year’s torrid pace   As shown in the bottom panel, real GDP is projected to rise at a 3¾ percent  rate, on average, over the projection period, about half a percentage point faster than  our estimate of potential GDP growth  Spending on private consumption and fixed  investment (line 2) is the main contributor to GDP growth, although some of the  growth in that demand is expected to be satisfied by foreign producers (line 3)   Domestic production is also boosted by export demand and government purchases  (lines 4 and 5), while inventory investment is roughly neutral   Exhibit 3 examines the forces that we think will be working to produce two  more years of above-potential growth  Monetary policy continues to be an important  factor As shown in the middle left panel, even with the assumed policy tightening  over the next two years, the real funds rate is projected to remain below its long-run  average and on the stimulative side of the short-run measures of r* shown in the  Bluebook   Returning to the bullets, other financial market conditions also are expected  to be supportive Nominal long-term rates (not plotted) have been well-anchored and  are projected to be little changed over the projection period, despite the assumed rise  in short-term rates  Moreover, corporate balance sheets are quite strong Cash is  abundant, and the combination of aggressive deleveraging, debt restructuring, and  low interest rates has brought interest expenses relative to cash flow (the middle right  panel) down to very low levels Reflecting these developments, defaults,  delinquencies, and risk spreads are quite low, and, as shown in the lower left panel,  banks continue to ease lending standards                            February 1-2, 2005 70 of 177  As I noted earlier, after the rapid run-up last year, we expect oil prices to drift  down over the next two years, which should be a small plus for domestic spending  power and GDP growth Turning to the final bullet in the upper panel, we estimate  that the higher oil prices in 2004 reduced GDP growth by three-fourths of a  percentage point last year In our forecast, the negative effects wane to a quarter of a  percentage point in 2005 as oil prices begin to recede; the projected decline in oil  prices then boosts GDP growth a couple of tenths in 2006   Exhibit 4 focuses on the household sector Consumption outlays (the blue  bars in the upper left panel) grow at a 3¾ percent rate this year and next, a shade less  than in 2004 We expect income growth (the red bars) to step up as the labor market  strengthens Moreover, household financial positions—as summarized by the  financial obligations ratio, to the right—seem solid  However, the downdrift in  household net worth relative to income that we project in the baseline forecast, and  depicted by the black line in the middle left panel, imparts a slight drag on spending  In addition, the strength of consumer spending last year pushed the saving rate (not  shown) to an unusually low level, and, as a consequence, consumer spending also is  expected to be restrained a bit during the forecast period by a desire on the part of  households to rebuild savings   One risk to the forecast that we discussed in the Greenbook is the possibility  of a real estate slump  In the Greenbook alternative simulation, depicted by the red  line in the middle right panel, we assumed that house prices fall a little more than 10  percent cumulatively over the next two years, leaving the level 20 percent below the  baseline Such an outcome, especially if accompanied by a drop in consumer  confidence, would restrain PCE and GDP growth appreciably over the next two  years But, even with the implied loss of household wealth, the ratio of net worth to  income that comes out of the alternative simulation (the red line in the middle left  panel) is still quite high by historical standards Accordingly, we don’t see this  scenario as causing a serious debilitation of household sector financial health, on the  whole   In the housing market, the lower panels, annual single-family starts are  projected to remain close to the 16 million unit mark over the next two years   Favorable mortgage rates are expected to provide ongoing support to housing  activity in our forecast And, as with consumer spending, solid income gains also  support housing demand   Your next chart looks at business investment  Outlays for high-tech  equipment, the red bars in the upper left, are the major source of growth in this  sector, reflecting an ongoing need by firms to replace and upgrade their equipment  and software Spending on non-high-tech equipment, the blue bars, grew briskly in  2004, spurred, in part, we think by partial expensing After the anticipated “pothole”  in the first quarter of this year, we expect that real outlays for non-high-tech  equipment will increase at around a 4½ percent rate—roughly in line with their                          February 1-2, 2005 71 of 177  longer-run average Demand is supported, in part, by a shrinking margin of unused  capacity over the next two years, as depicted in the panel to the right However, as  shown in the middle left panel, the rate of return on capital is projected to ebb over  the next two years, which tempers our forecast slightly   We interpret the results of the special questions on capital spending asked by  the staffs at the Reserve Banks—summarized in the table to the right—as being  broadly consistent with our view that this will be a pretty good year, on balance, for  business equipment investment, although probably not quite as brisk as in 2004  The  usual accelerator effects were the primary reason given by survey respondents for  boosting capital spending this year; additionally, a sizable fraction of respondents  pointed to replacement needs as an important consideration   The remainder of the chart highlights two of the risks to the forecast for  equipment spending  An upside risk that we highlighted in the Greenbook is the  possibility that we have been wrong about the effects of partial expensing If so, the  alternative simulation of FRB/US, shown by the blue bars in the lower left panel,   suggests that equipment and software spending could increase considerably faster  than in the baseline   One downside risk to the forecast for high-tech equipment, which Governor  Ferguson noted in a speech recently, is the possibility that the pace of technical  advancement in computers is slowing  As you know, the speed at which quality- adjusted computer prices fall is a rough indicator of the pace of technological  progress for that equipment  The constant-quality price index for desktop computers  that we use for constructing industrial production is shown in the lower right panel  The price declines are decomposed into declines that we attribute to improvements in  production processes—for example, Michael Dell figuring out better ways to  assemble boxes—and the price declines that we attribute to technological  improvements—for instance, Intel designing better chips to go inside the boxes  As  you can see from the red portion of the bars, this decomposition suggests that the rate  of technological improvement for computers has slowed appreciably  A further  slowing in the pace of innovation going forward would imply less spending for  upgrades than is implicit in our forecast  However, recent announcements by Intel  and AMD regarding introduction schedules for their next-generation chips give a  hint that a return to a faster pace of technological improvements may be in train  If  this speed-up in planned improvements to semiconductors is, in fact, realized, that  should translate into faster technological progress for computers   Sandy will now continue our presentation  "
7956,2006-06-28,"2       Thank you, Mr Chairman  Many of the spending indicators  that we’ve received over the past few weeks have been coming in to the weak side of  our expectations  As you can see by comparing the red and blue striped bars in the  top left panel of exhibit 1, in the Greenbook we responded to the weaker numbers by  revising down our projection for second-quarter growth of real GDP to a 2 percent  annual rate, about 1¾ percentage points less than in the May Greenbook  We  interpreted some of the unexpected softness as reflecting weaker underlying demand,  and we let that part feed through beyond the current quarter as well  But as I’ll  discuss shortly, the softness of the spending data wasn’t the only factor leading us to  temper our forecast for the out quarters    A key component of the downward revision to the current quarter has been a  slower-than-anticipated pace of consumer spending—the panel to the right  Based  largely on the available data for retail sales, motor vehicles, and the CPI, we estimate  that real PCE in the second quarter rose at an annual rate of only 22 percent  The  slowing reflects a step-down in purchases of light motor vehicles as well as  essentially flat real outlays for goods other than motor vehicles in the first two months  of the quarter       The other big surprise in the recent data is the sharper-than-expected drop-off in  housing activity, as illustrated in the middle left panel  Despite the May uptick in   2 The materials used by Messrs Slifman, Wilcox, and Kamin are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   June 28-29, 2006 9 of 177    housing starts, the levels of both starts and permits are well below where we thought  they would be at the time of the last Greenbook     In contrast to the household sector, the business sector indicators generally have  been favorable  For example, orders and shipments for nondefense capital goods,  plotted to the right, continue to point to strengthening demand  In addition, business  spending for new structures, not shown, appears to have posted another sizable gain  this quarter  The scant data available for June do not suggest that the slowdown in  spending earlier in the quarter has been cumulating  As shown in the bottom left,  initial claims for unemployment insurance, after retracing the rise that was associated  with the effects of the temporary government shutdown in Puerto Rico, have  remained in a range consistent with further moderate employment increases   Meanwhile, as shown to the right, the Empire State and Philadelphia business  surveys, which were less favorable in April and May, were considerably more  positive this month     Thus, while many of the indicators of activity have lately been to the downside of  our expectations, the news has not been entirely negative  All told, we still see  economic growth as being in a transition—to a pace somewhat below that of  potential  This can be seen in exhibit 2, which presents the longer-run outlook  We  now think that real GDP, as shown by the striped blue bars in the top left panel, will  increase at a 2¾ percent rate in the second half of this year and through 2007     As I mentioned earlier, several developments besides the incoming spending  indicators influenced our thinking about the economic outlook  First, revised data  from the BEA now put the 2005Q4 change in wage and salary disbursements, plotted  by the black line in the top right panel, considerably below the figure published at the  time of the last Greenbook, the red dashed line  The reduction in labor income  suggests less consumption going forward  Regarding our assumption for monetary  policy, the funds rate is assumed to be increased to 5¼ percent at this meeting and to  remain there through the end of 2007  As shown in the middle right panel, the  Wilshire 5000 stock market index is about 7 percent below the level we had assumed  in the May Greenbook  We assume that equity prices will rise at a 6½ percent annual  rate going forward—a pace that roughly maintains risk-adjusted parity with the  returns on Treasury securities  The latest reading on house prices from the OFHEO  index, illustrated in the bottom left panel, was in line with our expectations  We  continue to expect an appreciable deceleration in house prices over the projection  period  Finally, after several Greenbooks in which we revised up our forecast of  crude oil prices, this round we revised down our forecast  When we prepared the  Greenbook, the spot price of WTI was just under $70 per barrel, about $5 less than at  the time of the May Greenbook  And with futures prices also lower, we reduced the  path of crude oil prices throughout the projection period     Exhibit 3 presents some details of the outlook for business fixed investment  As  illustrated in the top left panel, total real outlays for equipment and software,  excluding the volatile transportation equipment component, are projected to increase   June 28-29, 2006 10 of 177    7½ percent over the four quarters of 2006 and to grow nearly as fast in 2007  You  can see from the red portion that the bulk of the support comes from spending for  high-tech equipment     Much of the recent strength in the high-tech sector has reflected a spurt in capital  spending for communications equipment by telecom service providers, whereas  demand for servers and PCs, the top right panel, has faltered  However, our forecast  calls for real outlays for computing equipment to pick up later this year and to be  sustained in 2007  Industry analysts cite several upcoming technological  developments that should boost demand for new servers and PCs  These are  summarized in the middle left panel  With regard to servers, several manufacturers  plan to offer new generations of servers this autumn that offer significantly faster  computing power and, just as important, lower electricity consumption  In addition to  ongoing demand for large-scale servers from financial services companies, demand  for clusters of small-scale servers—so-called server farms—by Internet content  providers, for example, also appears to be robust  With regard to PCs, Intel will be  introducing a fundamentally new chip design in the second half of this year that  reportedly will increase performance and significantly reduce power consumption   With the new generation of chips on the horizon, prices on old chips have been  plummeting  We project that demand for PCs should step up later this year, spurred  by the combination of the new generation of chips for high-end users and falling  prices on old chips for middle- and low-end users     The table to the right presents our forecast for real spending on nonresidential  structures  As shown in line 2, outlays for drilling and mining have been growing  briskly  Reflecting the sharp increases in prices of oil and natural gas over the past  few years, the number of drilling rigs in operation, the bottom left panel, has been  climbing steadily, with much of the increase for the natural gas component  We see  the growth of activity slowing somewhat next year as the prices of natural gas and  crude oil begin to flatten  Outside drilling and mining, investment in new buildings  has strengthened recently, as vacancy rates (illustrated for office buildings by the  black line in the bottom right panel) have been trending down and rents received by  building owners (the red line) have been climbing  That said, we think the current  rate of investment growth is unsustainable, given our projection of decelerating  employment and business sales, and consequently the growth rate of construction  spending slows in our forecast     Turning now to the household sector, the subject of exhibit 4, we expect real PCE,  the red bars in the top left panel, to increase at a rate of about 3 percent in the second  half of this year and to stay close to that pace in 2007  The forecast reflects two  important crosscurrents  On the one hand, real income growth, the blue bars, is  projected to be robust reflecting, in part, a waning drag from higher energy prices   On the other hand, the wealth-to-income ratio, plotted by the black line in the top  right panel, falls in our forecast as house prices decelerate  With slower gains in  wealth and rising interest rates, we expect that spending will be restrained relative to  income and, accordingly, the saving rate will rise  The remainder of the exhibit   June 28-29, 2006 11 of 177    examines the housing market  Looking through the monthly volatility, you can see  that sales of new homes and existing homes, the middle left panel, are well off their  peaks, whereas backlogs of unsold homes, the panel to the right, have increased  significantly  In putting together the forecast, we factored in the recent data on starts,  sales, and inventories, which led us to mark down the profile of activity throughout  the forecast period  All told, as shown in the bottom left panel, we expect that real  residential investment spending will drop 5¼ percent this year and fall another 1¾  percent next year     Widespread anecdotal reports suggest that the drop in demand is being driven  partly by a withdrawal from the market by investors and purchasers of second homes   Data on mortgage originations by investors and those purchasing second homes,  which begin on a monthly basis in mid-2003 and are available only through March,  are plotted to the right  The first thing to note is that these groups are a relatively  small part of the overall market  Moreover, although the data are quite noisy, neither  group, at least through March, was leaving the housing market in droves  Nevertheless, the recent spate of reports and a jump in the rate of contract  cancellations for new homes, which homebuilders attribute largely to a retreat by  investors, pose a downside risk to the housing outlook     Another risk to the forecast is the possibility of a pronounced deterioration in the  financial conditions of some vulnerable households, which could cause them to  retrench significantly on spending  As shown in exhibit 5 in the top left panel, the  financial obligations ratio for homeowners has risen sharply over the past year or so   It reached a record high in the second half of last year, and we estimate that it rose  further in the first quarter of this year  (As an aside, the rate for renters has actually  been falling since mid-2001, though that could be changing)  Some analysts have  expressed concern about the high level of the financial obligations ratio—especially  in light of the potential for further increases in obligations related to variable-payment  mortgages, which represent more than one-fifth of all outstanding first-lien  mortgages  Nowadays, variable-payment mortgages typically carry a fixed interest  rate for a few years before converting to floating-rate, and most aren’t scheduled for a  payment change for some time  The top right table presents some evidence As you  can see in the last column, the bulk of variable-rate mortgages—both ARMs and  interest-only—that have yet to reprice won’t begin to reprice until after 2007   Moreover, the end of the interest-only term for nearly all I-O mortgages that are  awaiting the end of the I-O term is well in the future—line 3 of the table     Given these patterns, scheduled mortgage payment changes should have only a  limited effect on the aggregate mortgage burden—adding just a few tenths to the  homeowners’ financial obligations ratio this year and next  As a result, we have not  seen—and don’t expect—a broad deterioration in mortgage credit quality  For  example, as shown in the middle left panel, delinquency rates for prime borrowers,  who account for 85 percent of the mortgage market, have been relatively flat for some  time—as illustrated by the black line     June 28-29, 2006 12 of 177     That said, there are some indications of stress among subprime borrowers  This  group presumably is at greater potential risk for financial stress generally  Note the  higher levels of their delinquency rates, the red line, compared with the prime market   In particular, we are seeing a deterioration among subprime borrowers with  variable-rate mortgages—the red line in the panel to the right  This type of loan is far  more prevalent in the subprime market, representing about two-thirds of all subprime  mortgages  The fixed-rate period for subprime variable-rate loans is considerably  shorter than that for prime loans—typically one or two years versus five to seven  years—so more subprime borrowers with variable-rate mortgages are likely to see  their monthly payments rise over the projection period  And the increases for those  subprime borrowers experiencing resets could be striking  We estimate increases of  something like 25 to 30 percent of their original payment     More generally, households that are likely to be more financially vulnerable  appear to have become decidedly more pessimistic  The bottom left panel plots the  Michigan consumer sentiment index stratified by income  Consumer sentiment for  both upper- and lower-income groups plunged last autumn  Currently, both groups  appear more concerned than they had been before mid-2005, but the lower third  appears especially nervous  Our baseline projection for the household sector  incorporates these developments  Nevertheless, the greater stress evident among the  most financially vulnerable segment of the household sector presents a downside risk  to the forecast  David will now continue our presentation      The final exhibit presents your forecasts for 2006 and 2007    Compared with February, you have edged down your projections for the growth of  real GDP in both years and raised your forecast of core inflation  The forecast for the  unemployment rate is essentially unchanged  That concludes our presentation, and  we will be happy to answer any of your questions       Let me start, and then Dave may want to add a few comments as well    Clearly, we did revise down the forecast  The downward revision was based in part, as I said in my   briefing, not only on the incoming data but also on some of the other factors that I highlighted in   exhibit 2  But I also want to emphasize that the news wasn’t uniformly bad as it came in  Some   good news came in as well, which I tried to point out  What we have done is to take down the rate   of growth roughly ½ percentage point beginning in the third quarter and moving to the end of the   projection period, in large part, I’d say, because of the disappointing developments in the housing   sector but because of other things, such as weaker consumption news, as well  I would also say that   we don’t see this cumulating  We’ve weakened the forecast, but we don’t see the economy falling   apart  We continue to see an economy that, as I said, was in a transition to a rate of growth that will   be below potential  We just marked it down further below potential than we had in the last   Greenbook  But I don’t think that there’s a disconnect between what we’ve done and the news that   we have received  I do not know, Dave, if you have additional comments   "
8083,2007-01-30,"2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll wait for my colleagues to come  to the table  We’ll be using the chart package that you all should have on the  economic outlook  Separating the signal from the noise in the recent economic data  has not been easy—what with the motor vehicle anomaly, the defense spending pull- forward, and the transitory swings in oil imports  We tried to cut through the clutter  by highlighting in the Greenbook real private domestic final purchases, or PDFP— that is, the sum of consumption, residential investment, and business fixed                                                     2 Material used by Mr Slifman, Mr Wascher, and Mr Gagnon is appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   January 30-31, 2007 11 of 255    investment  We think this aggregation, which is shown on line 3 of the table in  exhibit 1, currently is giving a fair representation of the thrust of aggregate demand   The data that we have received since the December meeting have been stronger than  expected  As a result, we have revised up our estimates of the growth of PDFP in  both the fourth and the first quarters to annual rates of about 2 percent—roughly the  same rates as those in the middle two quarters of 2006     The remaining panels of exhibit 1 highlight some of the indicators that have   informed our judgment about the current pace of activity  Starting with the labor  market, the middle left panel, increases in private payroll employment averaged  119,000 in the fourth quarter, close to the average pace in the preceding two quarters   As you may remember, at the last FOMC meeting we commented on the stronger  signal for activity coming from the labor market compared with the spending data   That tension seems to have been largely resolved, not because of weaker employment  but because of stronger spending—especially consumption  Retail sales increased  briskly in November and December; accordingly, in this Greenbook, we boosted our  estimate of fourth-quarter real PCE growth, the middle right panel, to an annual rate  of about 4½ percent  The fundamentals for consumption remain quite solid  steady  employment gains, recent declines in energy prices that have raised real income, well- maintained consumer sentiment, and further increases in stock market wealth  That  said, at least according to some of our models, the fourth-quarter pace of consumer  spending was stronger than would have been consistent with those fundamentals   Our forecast for the growth of real PCE in the first quarter, at 36 percent, reflects a  bet that some of the surprising fourth-quarter strength will carry forward for a while   Turning to housing, sales of new and existing homes—which are not shown in the  exhibit—appear to have stabilized in recent months, and the ratio of new home  inventories to sales has moved down a bit  As shown in the bottom left panel, the  apparent stabilization of housing demand may now be starting to show through to  permits and starts for single-family homes  Of course, the unusually warm weather in  December makes a definitive assessment at this time particularly difficult  In the  business sector, investment spending slowed appreciably in the fourth quarter  In  particular, shipments of nondefense capital goods, the red line in the panel to the  right, have been unexpectedly soft recently, including the December figure that we  received after publishing the Greenbook  Part of the recent weakness in this category  appears to be for purchases of equipment related to construction and motor vehicle  manufacturing  With orders remaining above shipments, we expect real equipment  spending to rise modestly in the first quarter     Exhibit 2 takes a closer look at some recent developments, starting with an   examination of the effects on the industrial sector coming from the recent sharp  declines in the production of light motor vehicles and residential investment  By our  reckoning, production of light motor vehicles, the top left panel, tumbled nearly  20 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter of 2006 and dropped further in the  fourth quarter  Meanwhile, we estimate that residential investment, shown to the  right, plunged at an annual rate of about 20 percent in both the third and the fourth  quarters  In thinking about the effects of these developments on industrial   January 30-31, 2007 12 of 255    production, we need to keep in mind the upstream effects  As noted in the bulleted  items in the middle left panel, the drop in production of light motor vehicles affects IP  not only through its direct effect on light motor vehicle manufacturing but also  indirectly through its influence on production in upstream industries such as primary  metals, tires, and, nowadays, semiconductors  In the case of construction, of course,  all the IP effect comes through the influence on upstream industries—lumber,  concrete, plumbing fixtures, and so forth  The table to the right shows the estimated  effects on IP growth, including upstream effects, associated with the declines in the  production of light motor vehicles and residential construction illustrated in the top  panels  We have used input-output relationships to estimate the direct and upstream  effects and then translated these effects into their IP contributions  Lines 2 and 3  show that, after we account for upstream influences, motor vehicles and residential  construction were sizable drags on IP in the third and fourth quarters  Yet, as shown  in line 4, the drag from those two sectors was not the whole story  Even so, we think  the more likely track from here forward involves modest growth rather than a  cumulative weakening of industrial activity, in part because we think that most  producers have been moving reasonably promptly to address any emerging inventory  problems     The bottom panels widen the scope from the industrial sector to the economy as a   whole and address the question of whether developments in less-cyclical industries  have been helping support economic activity  My colleague Stephanie Aaronson  divided the establishment survey employment data into three categories—highly  cyclical industries, moderately cyclical industries, and acyclical industries—based on  the correlation of individual industry employment changes with the GDP gap  The  bottom left panel presents some history, with the highly cyclical grouping plotted by  the black line and the moderately cyclical plotted in red  To keep the chart easier to  read, the acyclical group is not plotted  The chart shows what you might have  expected ex ante  Fluctuations in both series are highly correlated, but the amplitude  of swings in the moderately cyclical is more damped  The panel to the right puts a  microscope on the past few years—note the change in scale  As you can see, despite  the step-down of employment gains in the highly cyclical industries, employment in  the moderately cyclical industries has continued to grow apace  This suggests that the  softness we’ve seen lately in residential construction and some parts of manufacturing  has not spilled over to other parts of the economy     That conclusion is an important factor that has shaped our view about the longer-  run outlook for the economy—the subject of exhibit 3  As shown in line 1 of the  table in the top panel, later this year the growth rate of real GDP is expected to move  back up toward our estimate of the growth rate of potential, and it stays there in 2008   This basic pattern is unchanged from the last Greenbook  The bullets in the middle  panel highlight some of the major forces shaping this projection  The most important  is our forecast that the restraint from housing will diminish this year and that its  contribution to GDP growth will turn slightly positive next year  Second, the recent  declines in oil prices, plotted in the bottom left panel, have raised real income; we  believe that the drag from the earlier increases in oil prices should dissipate in the   January 30-31, 2007 13 of 255    near term, and over time the stimulus from the recent price declines should begin to  predominate  Third, federal fiscal policy, the bottom right panel, also is a bit  stimulative, although the impetus is projected to ebb over the next two years  Finally,  given our conditioning factors, the assumed path of the nominal federal funds rate is  consistent with a real funds rate that closes the output gap over time     Exhibit 4 focuses on the components of PDFP  As I noted earlier, the leveling-off   of home sales, the uptrend in mortgage applications, and the improvement in  homebuying attitudes suggest that housing demand may be leveling off  The top  panel shows the historical relationship between housing demand, as measured here by  sales of new homes (the red line), and housing construction, shown here by single- family housing starts (the black line)  The shaded areas highlight previous housing  downturns as well as the current situation  As you can see, cyclical recoveries in  sales and starts have generally been fairly coincident historically  You’ll have to take  my word for it, but this has been the case even when the inventory of unsold homes  has been high  Accordingly, we think that the recent stabilization of sales should be  accompanied soon by a stabilization of starts  Then, as sales move up, so should  starts  The middle panels focus on the consumption forecast  We expect real PCE,  the red bars in the left panel, to increase 2¾ percent this year and next  The forecast  reflects two main crosscurrents  On the one hand, real income growth, the blue bars,  is projected to be robust, reflecting, in part, continued increases in real wages as well  as further employment gains  On the other hand, the wealth-income ratio, plotted by  the black line in the panel to the right, falls in our forecast as house prices appreciate  only about 1 percent per year  With slower gains in wealth, and spending gradually  coming back into line with fundamentals after the current period of unexplained  strength, the saving rate should rise     The bottom panels present some details on the outlook for business fixed   investment  As illustrated in the bottom left panel, total real outlays for equipment  and software, excluding the volatile transportation equipment component, are  projected to increase about 6 percent both this year and next  You can see from the  red portion of the bars that the bulk of the support comes from spending for high-tech  equipment as telecommunications service providers further expand their fiber optic  networks and as businesses continue to invest in information technology equipment  and software  We expect the contribution from the other equipment category (the  blue portion) to narrow this year and then to edge up in 2008, largely reflecting the  pattern of changes in the growth of business output  The bottom right panel shows  our forecast for nonresidential structures excluding drilling and mining  The  incoming information on construction outlays for nonresidential buildings and the  forward-looking indicators that we monitor suggest that spending growth has  downshifted  Accordingly, after rising 12¾ percent in 2006, real outlays for this  component of nonresidential structures are expected to decelerate to a pace of 5½  percent this year  Our projection for 2008 brings growth in this component of  nonresidential structures down to its long-run average  Bill will now continue our  presentation      January 30-31, 2007 14 of 255     The final exhibit presents your forecasts for 2007 and 2008  I’ll   be mercifully brief  The central tendency shows real GDP increasing 2½ to 3 percent  this year and roughly the same next year, with the unemployment rate holding in the  range of 4½ to 4¾ percent during both years  The central tendency of your  projections sees the core inflation rate falling ¼ percentage point over the next two  years  That concludes our prepared remarks, Mr Chairman  I’ll be happy to take  your questions       Let me first comment specifically on our consumption forecast and the   larger question that we raised  Dave may want to add some comments  With regard to our   consumption forecast, as I had mentioned and as we suggested by the alternative simulation that we   showed in Part 1 of the Greenbook, clearly the unexplained strength that we’ve been seeing in   consumption spending in the second, third, and fourth quarters is an upside risk to the forecast    We’ve carried some of that through into 2007, as we noted in the Greenbook and I noted in my   briefing, and we think that it will eventually correct  We base that forecast just on the historical   patterns in the data  In the past when spending had gotten out of line with what we think of as being   the fundamentals for consumption, it eventually corrected over time  There are a couple of   possibilities  One is that we’ve got the timing wrong and that the correction is going to take longer,   in which case there would be more consumption  Another possibility—and this goes back to the   point Bill made—is that we could be wrong with regard to income growth  That might be revised   up, and we will find that a lot more income growth is out there  Now, taking our forecast rather   than the alternative simulations at face value—yes, we are slower than the FOMC  I suspect that   part of the reason may be that the staff has a lower estimate of potential output growth than most   members of the Committee probably have in their minds; we can’t know for sure, but I suspect that   it probably goes a good way toward explaining the difference    We were busy    I don’t think so  Personally, I could think of equally plausible reasons that   we could get stronger aggregate demand growth or somewhat weaker aggregate demand growth   over the next year  We highlighted one possibility in the Greenbook with regard to the weaker   investment scenario  Another could be the housing forecast  Housing could turn out to be weaker   than we’re forecasting  So, on the aggregate demand side, I’d give them equal weighting  With   regard to the aggregate supply side, I suspect there, too, the weighting probably is equal  It’s a little   harder for me to judge  I don’t know whether Bill wants to add something  "
8463,2008-06-24,"  Last week, the Washington Post ran a front page story with the   headline, “Why We’re Gloomier than the Economy”  Like the author of the Post  article, we too have noticed the difference between what people are saying about the  economy in surveys and what they apparently are producing and spending       Starting first with the survey indicators, the top left panel of exhibit 6 plots the   plunge in the Michigan index of consumer sentiment, which is far deeper than can be  explained by its usual predictors such as labor market conditions, inflation, and the  stock market  The panel to the right plots two of the most timely surveys of business  attitudes, which continue to suggest that the respondents are pessimistic about overall  business conditions  Meanwhile, as shown in the middle left panel, although private  payrolls continue to shrink, the declines have been much smaller than we were  expecting and, as you can see from the shaded area (if you look very closely),  [laughter] much smaller than the ones that occurred during the last recession  In  terms of spending data, the most striking piece of news was the upward revision to  earlier retail sales figures  At the time of the April Greenbook, real outlays for  consumer goods other than motor vehicles appeared to be moving sideways (the red  line in the middle right panel)  However, the black line shows that according to the  latest estimates—which, of course, are still subject to additional revisions—spending  rose rapidly in March and April and climbed further in May  With these numbers, we  revised up appreciably our near-term estimates of the growth rate of real PCE goods  other than motor vehicles (the inset box)      On the business side, the bottom left table, shipments of nondefense capital   goods, excluding transportation, rose further in April, and new orders jumped  In  addition, outlays for construction of nonresidential buildings, the bottom line of the  table, continued to climb in April  All told, these indicators suggest stronger business  spending than we had anticipated in our April forecast  A potentially important  downside development may be emerging in the motor vehicles sector—the bottom  right panel—where, according to our industry contacts, sales of light vehicles appear  to be plummeting in June  Whether this is just a reaction to the surge in oil prices that  will be contained within the auto sector or whether it’s a canary in the coal mine  pointing to something far more serious for the entire economy remains to be seen   But it certainly has grabbed our attention and highlights a downside risk to our  projection      Exhibit 7 focuses on the overall GDP forecast through 2009 and some of the key   factors that informed our thinking about the outlook  We had a lot of moving parts to  deal with this round, and the upper panel summarizes how we put them together   First, in light of the incoming information, we revised up our forecast for the first two  quarters of this year, especially the second quarter  We now think that real GDP  growth came in at an annual rate of 11 percent in the first quarter and picked up to a  17 percent pace in the second quarter  As you know, earlier this year we put in some   June 24–25, 2008 15 of 253    judgmental adjustments to the forecast, which reflected a combination of the tendency  for negative model residuals to be correlated during cyclical downturns as well as the  macro effects of financial turmoil and uncertainty that are not well captured by our  models  We have interpreted some of the recent spending surprise as suggesting that  we went too heavy on such effects in the April Greenbook, and so we have tempered  them in this projection  That said, we still anticipate that some of these influences  will show through to spending, especially in the household sector, and we expect the  economy to be on a very subdued growth path for the next few quarters      As I will discuss shortly, residential investment is still projected to be a drag on   economic growth well into next year  Moreover, with house prices expected to fall  through the end of next year, the ratio of household net worth to income remains on a  downward trajectory, reducing some of the wherewithal for consumer spending   Household purchasing power also is being held down by the surge in oil prices that  Nathan discussed (the middle left panel)  As shown in the inset box, by our  reckoning the increases in the spot and futures prices of WTI since the April  Greenbook subtract about ¼ percentage point from real GDP growth in both 2008 and  2009, with much of the effect working through PCE  Despite these negative  influences, if the story ended here, the economy still would be operating with a  somewhat higher utilization rate—that is, a smaller GDP gap—than in the April  Greenbook  In light of this consideration, as well as the less favorable outlook for  inflation that Bill will discuss, we have conditioned this forecast on a tighter path for  monetary policy than the one in the previous Greenbook  As you can see in the  middle right panel, by the end of next year the federal funds rate is 100 basis points  higher than in the April Greenbook  I should note here that we also have raised our  estimate of the growth rate of potential GDP, which Bill will discuss shortly   Because we view our revised estimate of potential as merely the staff’s catching up  with what individuals and firms were already expecting, these revisions result in  corresponding adjustments to the growth rate of real GDP going forward      All told, as illustrated in the bottom left panel, after increasing substantially faster   in the first half of the year, real GDP is now projected to grow at an annual rate of  ¾ percent in the second half of 2008, a bit less than in our previous projection  In  2009, real GDP is expected to increase 24 percent, about ½ percentage point less  than in the April Greenbook  The bottom line of the forecast is perhaps most easily  seen by the path of the GDP gap  As shown in the bottom right panel, the gap starts  out the projection period being much narrower than in the April forecast  By the  fourth quarter of 2009, however, the gap is essentially the same as in the April  Greenbook     After that high-altitude flyover of the projection, the next two exhibits swoop   down for a closer look at some of the details  Exhibit 8 focuses on the housing sector   With demand weak, the overhang of unsold new and existing single-family homes— the vacancy rate—has soared, putting downward pressure on prices  As shown to the  right, the OFHEO purchase-only index of house prices fell at an annual  of 67   June 24–25, 2008 16 of 253    percent in the first quarter of 2008, and we expect home prices to continue declining  around this pace into next year     Anecdotes and common sense suggest that many prospective homebuyers, leery   of purchasing an asset whose value is falling, are waiting for house prices to bottom  out before entering the market  This behavior further saps already sagging housing  demand  We don’t have direct survey evidence for this supposition; however, the  middle panels present some suggestive numbers taken from the Michigan survey   First, as shown by the black line in the panel to the left, the share of current  homeowners who think the price of their home fell over the past 12 months jumped  dramatically through early this year and remains elevated  In addition, the share that  thinks the price will fall over the next 12 months also has drifted up  The panel on the  right, which is based on work by my colleague Claudia Sahm, looks at the views of  renters  Here the blue bars show the percentage of renters in the Michigan survey  who say that now is a bad time to buy a house  The red line plots an estimate of  house price overvaluation derived from a price–rent model that we follow  As you  can see, as houses became increasingly overvalued, more and more renters became  pessimistic about homebuying—apparently for affordability reasons  Of course,  relative prices are not the only influence on affordability  General macroeconomic  and credit market conditions also are important  Thus, even though the extent of  overvaluation has diminished so far this year, renters, at least thus far, remain quite  pessimistic about homebuying conditions     So what brings us out of this seeming death spiral?  If house prices follow the   expected trajectory, we estimate that they will move into rough alignment with their  long-run relationship with rents early next year and then, as typically happens,  overshoot somewhat  As the market returns to something closer to equilibrium,  prospective homebuyers who had been waiting out the price bubble in rental quarters  should begin to see housing as more affordable and be more willing to buy into  owner-occupied housing  As that happens, the rate of decline in house prices should  slow, and sales of single-family homes (the bottom left panel) should start to  improve  With demand improving and the inventory overhang being worked off, we  expect housing starts to level out and then begin to gain altitude slowly in 2009     Exhibit 9 presents the medium-term outlook for consumer spending and business   investment  Starting with PCE, real spending is projected to fall, on balance, in the  second half of this year  Tax rebates push up the third quarter and create a pothole in  the fourth quarter as rebate-related spending drops off  More fundamentally,  spending is held back by the effects of higher oil prices on household purchasing  power, the ongoing hit to household wealth from falling home prices and earlier  declines in equity prices, and the restraining effects of financial turmoil and unusually  pessimistic consumer sentiment  In 2009, spending picks up as many of these factors  begin to improve; but at 1½ percent, the increase is still rather tepid     The middle panels focus on business outlays for equipment and software  Real   spending on the high-tech component (the green bars) has slowed sharply this year   June 24–25, 2008 17 of 253    and is expected to remain relatively soft throughout the projection period  The major  US computer manufacturers—such as HP, Dell, and Sun—have expressed caution  about the outlook for sales  Meanwhile, capital spending guidance from  telecommunications service providers points to a slowing in their outlays for  communications equipment  As shown by the blue bars, investment outside the high- tech segment has been declining at a modest pace since late last year, and we expect it  to contract further over the next year and a half  Spending is held back by normal  accelerator effects, tight lending standards, and gloomy business sentiment      For nonresidential structures, the lower panels, the BEA reported that outlays in   the drilling and mining component (the green bars) dipped in the first quarter   Anecdotal reports suggest that this may have reflected bottlenecks stemming from  shortages of skilled labor and supplies  However, recent data on footage drilled and  the number of drilling rigs in operation have picked up, signaling a near-term rise in  spending  Looking forward, escalating energy prices are likely to spur continued  increases in investment  In contrast, as shown by the blue bars, real construction  spending for buildings is projected to be very weak following sizable increases in  2006 and 2007  The evolving supply-and-demand factors for this sector are almost  uniformly downbeat  Vacancy rates are moving up; sales and prices of existing  properties are sagging; and financing conditions are tight for new projects  Because  of these developments, we expect outlays in this category to fall throughout the  projection period  Bill will now continue our presentation       We expect foreclosures to rise—and to rise appreciably  One thing we   have done in thinking about house prices is, in effect, to build in some extra house-price   depreciation, above and beyond what our price–rent model would want to say, to reflect the   kinds of factors that you are talking about—the foreclosures, what that means then for the   vacancy rate, and what that does to house prices, particularly in certain parts of the country  I   see President Yellen nodding her head because California, for sure, is one place where that could   clearly be an important factor     It’s hard for me to think of it in these probabilistic terms  I would say that   we still think that the economy is going to have these negative effects that are associated with   periods of low growth  Now, whether that is precisely a recession or simply just a low-growth   period, it’s hard for me to distinguish    Yes  The way to think about it is that we switched into a low-growth   period  Whether it is precisely a recession or just simply a low-growth period shouldn’t be the   demarcation point  We still think that the economy is operating in a low-growth period  There is   probably not as much severity to that low-growth period, but we still think that is where it’s   operating    Just as a factoid to throw out here, one of my colleagues on the Board   staff, Jeremy Nalewaik, has estimated some of these models looking at switching between high-  growth periods and low-growth periods, where a low-growth period does not necessarily have to be   a recession  Using the GDP data through the first quarter plus our forecast for second-quarter GDP,   which is now at an annual rate of 17 percent, his model still would suggest that there’s an   84 percent probability that the economy is operating in a low-growth state  So I think that it was a   fair thing for us to continue to have the judgmental adjustments, which by the way aren’t just   June 24–25, 2008 29 of 253    recession-like effects  They also include financial turmoil effects and some uncertainty things  I   think it’s a fair thing for us to have included those, but as I say, we’ve tempered them  "
8569,2008-10-07,"  Let me first talk a bit about the near-term outlook  Most of the  economic data that we’ve gotten since the September Greenbook have come in to the  soft side of our expectations  The PCE number for August was surprisingly weak  Auto  sales dropped sharply in September  Shipments and orders for nondefense capital goods  fell in August, and in the labor market, as you know, private payrolls fell about 168,000  in September  In addition, the Boeing strike is going to last longer than we thought at  the time of the September Greenbook, and the hurricane effects from Hurricanes Gustaf  and Ike appear to be more substantial in terms of the production adjustments than we  had been thinking at the time of the September Greenbook  So all told, we now expect  GDP to be about unchanged in the second half of the year, and that’s down about ¾  percentage point since the last Greenbook     In terms of the medium-term outlook, 2009-10, we’ve had important changes in   some of the conditioning assumptions that we see as working through so-called  conventional channels  As of this afternoon’s close, the stock market is down about  20 percent since the September Greenbook  Corporate bond rates are up about 90 basis  points, and the dollar is up about 3 percent since the last Greenbook  One good bit of  news is that oil prices are down about $13 per barrel since we put the September  Greenbook to bed  Of course, financial stress has greatly intensified  Using our usual  method, which we described in the box in Part 1 of the Greenbook, we now think that  the intensification of financial stress since the September Greenbook would subtract  nearly 1 percentage point from real GDP growth in 2009  The stock market has clearly  been a moving target for us as we’ve been trying to put this all together and assess the  outlook for next year and 2010  But using this afternoon’s close as the starting point,  real GDP now is projected to rise only about ½ percent over the four quarters of 2009  and then to pick up to an increase of about 2½ percent in 2010  With that growth rate,  we would have the unemployment rate rising to about 7¼ percent by the end of 2009,  and we would expect it to remain at about that level through 2010     In terms of inflation, the recent data on core inflation pushed up our estimate of core   PCE price inflation in the third quarter to more than 3 percent  That’s about 02  percentage point higher than in the September Greenbook, but we expect that to ease  back off in the fourth quarter and come down to a rate of about 2½ percent  For the  medium term, core inflation is expected to slow over the remainder of the forecast  period  We think that the pass-through from import and energy prices will abate, and of  course, the additional slack that we now have in the forecast also could relieve some  pressure on inflation  In terms of the overall inflation rate, we expect energy and food  price increases to taper off, and so we would see PCE price inflation slowing to about  the same rate as core inflation  Specifically, we would see inflation at about 2 percent in  2009 and about 17 percent in 2010  Nathan now has a few comments he wants to add      We maintained the same path as in the September Greenbook  "
8805,2009-08-11," Thank you, Mr Chairman  If I may paraphrase Garrison  Keillor, it’s been a relatively quiet few weeks for macro forecasters  For the most  part, the high-frequency data on activity that we have received since the June FOMC  meeting have come in either in line with our expectations or a bit better, and the  numbers continue to remain consistent with the hypothesis that economic activity is  stabilizing At the same time, as Brian has already described, financial conditions  have continued to improve   Before I discuss some of the details of the forecast, let me briefly cover two other  matters  last Friday’s labor market report and the comprehensive revision to the  national income and product accounts  First, regarding the labor market, the BLS  reported that private nonfarm payroll employment fell 254,000 in July, and the  declines in May and June are now estimated to have been a little smaller than  previously thought The net result is that the level of private employment in July was  about 85,000 higher than we were expecting when we published the Greenbook  In  addition, the unemployment rate ticked down to 94 percent—we had been expecting  a small increase  Although we would not be inclined to make any changes to our  GDP projection as a result of this more favorable labor market news, it does help  reinforce our view that a gradual turnaround in economic activity will begin in the  second half of the year   As regards the NIPA revision, I would emphasize two elements  First, as you  know, real GDP was revised down considerably in 2008 and the first quarter of 2009   This downward revision reduced some of the tension between our estimates of the  output gap and the unemployment rate gap but did not eliminate it  During the next  several weeks, we plan to reassess all of our supply-side estimates, but at this point  we don’t anticipate any major changes  The second important element of the NIPA  revision was a sequence of sizable downward revisions to real disposable personal  income beginning in early 2007  The cumulative effect of the revisions was to put  DPI on a significantly weaker trajectory through the middle of 2009, which was an  important ingredient in our thinking about the outlook for consumer spending   One other data revision, which we learned with the release of the June figures for  personal income and outlays, was a downward revision to personal consumption  expenditures in the first half of 2009 Prior to the revision, it appeared that consumer  spending was edging higher during the first half of the year  However, the new data,  instead, now show consumption to have been drifting down over much of the period   Nevertheless, we still expect a gradual turnaround in consumer spending in the  second half of the year—based in part on a further boost from fiscal stimulus as well  as less-pronounced employment declines and improving financial conditions     Outside the consumer sector, the latest readings on housing starts and orders for  capital goods point to a lessening in the declines for residential construction and  equipment spending  Moreover, with final demand stabilizing and inventory  positions considerably improved from earlier in the year, we think that over the next  several months firms will slowly begin to move production back up toward the level                   August 11–12, 2009 51 of 165  of sales Indeed, a number of indicators of near-term movements in factory output—  such as weekly steel production, durable goods orders, and various business  surveys—suggest that such an adjustment may already be in process   For next year, we continue to expect the growth rate of real GDP to pick up   Importantly, continued financial healing, supported by accommodative monetary  policy, sets the stage for further improvements in household and business sentiment  and an acceleration in final demand  All told, real GDP is projected to rise about  3 percent over the four quarters of 2010, close to the projection in the June  Greenbook Nevertheless, the rate of increase in GDP next year—while still faster  than the rise in potential—is relatively tepid for an economic recovery, only enough  to reduce the unemployment rate to 9½ percent     Our forecast reflects a balancing of a number of forces  A negative factor was the  lower trajectory for disposable income that I previously mentioned; given the typical  lags between income and spending, this acts as a drag on consumption in coming  quarters On the plus side of the ledger, as Brian noted earlier, equity prices are up  appreciably since the last Greenbook, whereas corporate bond yields and spreads are  down In addition, as Nathan will discuss, the foreign exchange value of the dollar is  down, and the forecast for foreign growth is stronger   As for the components of real GDP next year, the basic stories haven’t changed in  any important ways  In the household sector, we expect consumer spending to  strengthen and the saving rate to drift down a bit as prospects for jobs and incomes  brighten, negative wealth effects wane, and the availability of consumer credit  improves  Meanwhile, housing demand and construction, which appear to have  reached their bottoms this summer, are expected to strengthen as income picks up and  low mortgage rates and lower real estate prices enhance affordability  In the business  sector, we think that the usual accelerator mechanism should spur outlays for  equipment and software, augmented by some easing of financial constraints and by  some extra demand as a result of replacement spending that had been deferred during  the recession In contrast, business outlays for structures such as office and  commercial buildings are expected to continue to contract throughout 2010 in the  presence of extremely tight credit conditions and falling property values   Turning to the outlook for inflation, the NIPA revision incorporated new  information on nonmarket prices, which now show a sharp deceleration in the first  half of the year But we don’t take any signal from this; and when all is said and  done, it looks as though the underlying pace of core inflation has been running a little  higher than we had anticipated In addition, survey-based measures of longer-run  inflation expectations have remained relatively stable  In contrast, the incoming data  on hourly compensation have decelerated sharply this year  The employment cost  index increased at an annual rate of only ¾ percent in the first half of 2009, whereas  the Labor Department reported this morning that the productivity and cost measure of  hourly compensation declined at a rate of about 1 percent  These low readings  suggest that economic slack already is weighing heavily on labor costs  We continue                       August 11–12, 2009 52 of 165  to expect that the low level of resource utilization will hold down price inflation as  well over the projection period, with core PCE prices rising about 1½ percent this  year and 1 percent next year   In the Greenbook, we highlighted several risks to our output and inflation  forecasts On the downside for output, we noted the possibility that the improvement  in financial conditions observed since the spring could prove to be short-lived and the  financial system could suffer a relapse rather than recuperate  We also highlighted  the possibility that, in the wake of the financial and economic turmoil of the past two  years, households could raise by a significant amount their desired saving relative to  the baseline  According to the policy rule we use, either outcome would noticeably  delay the eventual liftoff of the funds rate from the zero lower bound  That said, we  also recognize the possibility that financial healing could occur more rapidly than we  anticipate Such a development would lead to a more robust recovery of economic  activity and less unemployment  Under those circumstances, the federal funds rate  lifts off from zero a year earlier than in the baseline   The funds rate also would be expected to lift off sooner under our assumed policy  rule if the inflation outlook were to take a decisive turn upward  This might occur,  for example, if the public’s concerns about the expansion of our balance sheet were to  manifest themselves in an appreciable increase in inflation expectations  We  examined this possibility in an alternative Greenbook scenario in which we assumed  that long-run inflation expectations rise about 1 percentage point over the next several  months In that scenario, core PCE inflation climbs steadily over the projection  period, reaching 2½ percent by 2013 That development in turn brings forward the  liftoff in the federal funds rate by three quarters   So, what does this all mean?  Well, while it’s been a quiet few weeks for macro  forecasters, the risks to the economic outlook are still all above average  Nathan will  now continue our presentation   We don’t know for sure, but our speculation is that some of this had to   do with bonus payments—that there are just a lot fewer bonus payments being made now than   had been made in 2008, 2007, and so on  So we think that that might have been part of what is   going on; that is, taking the bonuses out lowers the level of compensation  But the broader point   is that we think that labor market slack is having an effect on wage determination; probably there   is less nominal wage stickiness in the economy than there was 20 or 30 years ago  And as I said,   with the unemployment rate up in the 9½ percent range, that is putting a lot of downward   pressure on wage determination   Absolutely So while we have not built in further outright declines in   hourly compensation in the forecast, we do have very slow rates of increase in hourly   compensation in the forecast   In a mechanical sense, the way we have implemented this in the   forecast for much of 2008–09 is to take what our models would want to forecast and then put in   negative add factors to take account of the financial turmoil as well as a regime switching that   you would get in a normal recession In 2010, we are not getting rid of them, but we are   diminishing the size of those negative add factors as we think the financial system recuperates   and as we move out of recession and into a recovery period  But that said, it is important to keep   in mind that this recovery is still quite tepid by historical standards  Typically, the economy goes   back to its previous peak level of real GDP in two to three quarters  In our projection, it takes   seven quarters for that to occur; so these things are still, in our view, weighing heavily on the   economy  "
9039,2010-08-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  For the most part, the economic   data that we have received since the June FOMC meeting have come in to the   downside of our expectations  Among the softer numbers, I would highlight the   disappointing labor market report for June and the persistently high level of   unemployment insurance claims, as well as sluggish retail sales, more downbeat   consumer confidence, weaker than anticipated housing activity, and less optimistic   readings on business sentiment  Reflecting this news, we estimate that real GDP rose   at around a 2 percent annual rate in the second quarter—somewhat less than the   BEA’s currently published figure, and 1½ percentage points less than we wrote in the   June Tealbook   Before I discuss the details of the forecast, let me briefly cover two other matters   last Friday’s labor market report and the comprehensive revision to the national   income and product accounts  Regarding the labor market in July, we view the report   as broadly consistent with our projection in the Tealbook  The unemployment rate   held steady at 95 percent last month  And, although private employment rose only   70,000—a little less than we were expecting—the workweek moved up a little more   we were forecasting  This combination reinforces the notion that businesses remain   cautious about taking on the costs of adding new workers and instead are trying to   meet their output goals by using their current workforces more intensively  One piece   of good news in the report was that manufacturing employment rose 36,000 in July,   following gains that averaged 25,000 per month in the first half of the year, and the   factory workweek moved up a tenth of an hour   As regards the NIPA revision, I would emphasize two elements  First, as you   know, real GDP was revised down in the 2007 to 2009 period  As a result of the   revisions to actual GDP, we made a modest downward adjustment to our estimate of   the level of potential GDP  As we described in the Tealbook, we calibrated this   adjustment to roughly eliminate the tension between our estimates of the output gap   and the unemployment rate gap in the first half of 2010, and we implemented it by   slightly reducing the growth rates of potential in 2008 and 2009  We did not,   August 10, 2010 12 of 160             however, materially change our assumption about the growth rate of potential GDP   going forward   In terms of our projection, the second important element of the NIPA revision was   the sizable upward revision to the saving rate  In thinking about the forecast   implications of this revision, we had to weigh two offsetting forces  On the one hand,   the larger “shortfall” in consumer spending suggested by the revised data could mean   that once hiring picks up more substantially and confidence about the economic   outlook increases, households will feel that they have the wherewithal to step up   spending that had been deferred during the recession  On the other hand, the shortfall   in PCE might reflect an ongoing transition to an even higher saving rate that   continues through 2011, as households further repair their balance sheets and rely less   on credit than we had previously anticipated  Our forecast gives equal weight to   these forces, and the personal saving rate is projected to be about flat at its current   level through the end of next year  In effect, we assumed that households raised their   saving rate in the wake of the financial crisis—probably for precautionary reasons—  to a level that they will want to maintain during the medium term  Needless to say,   however, a very wide confidence band surrounds this aspect of our projection   Let me now return to the issue I raised at the beginning of my remarks, namely,   the soft tone of the incoming data  From a purely accounting point of view, the   weaker than expected numbers put us on a lower GDP trajectory going into the third   quarter, and we’ve reduced our current-quarter growth projection by ¼ percentage   point to a 2½ percent rate  From an economic point of view, the softer readings on   activity could reflect heightened concerns among households and businesses about   the strength and durability of the recovery  The recent declines in consumer   confidence and business sentiment are certainly consistent with that interpretation, as   are the results of the recent capital spending inquiries conducted by the Reserve   Banks  On the other hand, the recent softness in the data could simply be noise—a   head fake, so to speak   In the baseline projection, we assume that it’s not a head fake, and we anticipate   that the fourth-quarter increase in real GDP will be about the same as the third-quarter   gain   By next year, however, we expect that the fundamental forces driving the   recovery—accommodative monetary policy, more supportive financial conditions, a   gradual easing in credit constraints, and improvements in household and business   confidence—will firmly reassert themselves, and real GDP is projected to increase   36 percent over the four quarters of 2011   With output increasing faster than potential, the unemployment rate is expected to   move down slowly to 89 percent by the end of next year  However, by our   reckoning, resource slack still will be substantial   A high degree of slack, in turn, should continue to put downward pressure on   inflation in coming quarters  Even so, with inflation expectations stable and expected   August 10, 2010 13 of 160             to remain so, core PCE inflation is projected to hold steady at a bit below 1 percent   over the forecast period, and total PCE inflation is projected to average slightly more   than 1 percent   In the remainder of my remarks, I want to highlight some of the risks to the   forecast that we considered in the Tealbook  One risk is that the recovery could turn   out to be markedly weaker than we are projecting  In the “weaker recovery”   alternative simulation, we assumed that the expected improvements in the labor   market, confidence, and credit conditions underlying our baseline projection are slow   to materialize, leading households and firms to hold back on spending through next   year  In addition, the sluggish pace of recovery causes equity prices to fall short of   the baseline path, which further depresses spending  In this environment, real GDP   expands at an average annual rate of only 1½ percent until mid-2011, the   unemployment rate remains above 9½ percent until the end of next year, and liftoff of   the federal funds rate from its effective lower bound is delayed by two quarters until   mid-2013   An opposing risk is that, in putting together the baseline projection, we may have   overreacted to the soft incoming numbers  During the past half century, the economy   has gone through several soft patches in the midst of a cyclical recovery that were   followed by a resumption of substantial growth  Late 2002 is the most recent   example  All economic recoveries are different, of course, and for each of the   previous soft patches one could probably tell a special story as to why that incident is   not relevant today  Nonetheless, such transitory slowdowns during an economic   recovery do occur frequently enough that I think that such a possibility can’t be ruled   out for the current situation  One, admittedly tenuous, data point that is consistent   with this interpretation was the sizable increase in manufacturing employment in July   that is pointing to a brisk rise in factory production for that month   In the Tealbook, the “virtuous circle” alternative simulation addresses the   possibility that we were too pessimistic in the baseline and that, instead, the recent   softness in the data is masking an already building momentum in the economy  This   leads to a stronger bounceback in spending on consumer durables than in the baseline   and an even more marked acceleration in capital expenditures, reflecting a mutually   reinforcing cycle of improved optimism, higher spending, greater hiring, and   increasing credit availability  The strong activity, in turn, reinforces optimism in   financial markets, which boosts equity prices  This virtuous circle causes real GDP to   expand at an annual rate of 5¼ percent, on average, in 2011 and 2012, pushing the   unemployment rate down rapidly   I want to end with a few comments on the risks to our inflation projection  In the   June Tealbook we characterized the risks as elevated but roughly balanced  I think   that is still the case in our current forecast  On the downside, with the economy   recovering slowly and the margin of slack very wide, inflation expectations could   prove less stable than we expect and fall significantly  We explored such a possibility   in the Tealbook   August 10, 2010 14 of 160             That said, many outside forecasters anticipate higher inflation than in the staff   projection despite similar or more pessimistic outlooks for the real economy  Indeed,   according to this morning’s release of the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, the staff   inflation outlook still is similar to that held by the ten respondents with the lowest   forecasts for inflation  Of course, given the historical track record of inflation   forecasts, we wouldn’t be surprised if inflation next year came in as high as most   Blue Chip forecasters predict, and they shouldn’t be surprised if it comes in as low as   we project  Nathan will now continue our presentation    Quite frankly, these are all really rough guesstimates based on what   we’ve seen in history, so I don’t think we want to pin ourselves down that closely    Okay    I’m not quite clear  What is it that you have in mind?    Yes, I would say so  I think that many of the things that Brian pointed   to in his briefing certainly are consistent with that statement    I wish I could point to a specific model result that would be able to give   you a satisfactory answer  Let me take a step back to explain the problem  Prior to the NIPA   revision, it looked like consumption was just following the same old path that one might have   expected based on looking at wealth, income, interest rates, transfer payments, and so on  And   that seemed a little odd to us in some ways, because one would have thought that the financial   crisis should have led to some abnormally low consumption relative to these standard sorts of   determinants  Now, with the revised data, we’re actually seeing the error in our consumption   functions that we thought we should have been getting all along  So, in some ways, the fact that   August 10, 2010 19 of 160             we do have this residual is a bit more satisfying, in the sense that it makes everything hang   together a little bit better   But here’s why we have trouble answering your question directly  When you have a   residual, you have to make a decision about how fast it’s going to close  In making that decision,   we didn’t just say, “Oh, the saving rate could be here, or it could be here,” and then just go down   the middle of a bimodal distribution and take the mean  Rather, as we described in the Tealbook,   we see households as having different forces weighing on them, and these are behavioral issues    In other words, households themselves are going to have to weigh these various forces as they   make their plans about consumption over the coming year and a half  And, as we described in   the Tealbook, we could see forces that would lead them to want to boost their spending—pent-up   demand kinds of forces—or we could see the caution that they have exhibited so far continuing   and intensifying to some extent  Our view is that, in making their decisions, households would   probably choose to have their consumption rise roughly in line with their income—neither faster   nor slower, but roughly in line  With that said, we admit that there’s a huge, huge range of   uncertainty around that  "
9239,2011-06-21,"4  While we’re changing players, the materials we’ll be using are  titled “Material for Staff Presentation on the Economic Outlook”  As we highlighted  in the Tealbook, the economic news that we’ve received since late April has been  almost uniformly to the downside of our expectations  At the time of the last  Tealbook, we were seeing signs of softness in many of the key spending indicators   But we discounted those indications in light of what appeared to be ongoing  improvements in the labor market and factory output  One data point that affected  our thinking in the current Tealbook was the May employment report  As shown by  the red line in the upper-left panel of the first exhibit, private payroll employment is  estimated to have increased only 83,000 in May   Another key data point was the downward revision to manufacturing IP in the  first quarter and the tepid pace of expansion so far in the second quarter   Meanwhile, as highlighted in the middle-left panel, the news for consumer outlays  has been disappointing  Moreover, the BEA revised down the historical estimates of  real DPI, leaving the published first-quarter level nearly $70 billion lower than we  had anticipated in the April Tealbook  In addition, consumer sentiment remains at a  low level  Accordingly, we project that real PCE will rise at only a 1½ percent rate in  the second quarter, compared with the 3 percent pace that we wrote down in the April  Tealbook                                                     4 The materials used by Mr Slifman, Ms Wilson, Mr Reeve, and Mr Covitz are appended to this transcript  (appendix 4)   June 21–22, 2011 72 of 282              As shown in the panel to the right, most national and regional survey indicators of  business conditions have dropped noticeably, and spending for equipment and  software (not shown) appears to be rising less rapidly in the second quarter than we  previously projected   As noted in the lower-left panel, we think that part of the recent weakness in  activity reflects transitory effects of the disasters in Japan on US production of  motor vehicles and parts  The higher price of imported oil and a temporary drop in  defense purchases also appear to have played a role   All told, we projected in the Tealbook that real GDP would increase at a  19 percent annual rate in the second quarter—line 1 of the table to the right—down  appreciably from our forecast in the previous Tealbook  Activity should receive a  temporary boost next quarter from the alleviation of supply chain disruptions in the  motor vehicle industry  But, as you can see from a comparison of lines 3 and 4,  underlying our GDP forecast for both the second and third quarters is a substantially  more guarded assessment of the economy even after excluding earthquake-related  effects   The loss of momentum in economic activity recently has brought to the fore the  question  Why isn’t the recovery gaining traction?  This is the subject of your next  exhibit   The upper-left panel illustrates two ways to think about this question—compared  with previous business cycles and compared with our own previous forecasts  The  blue and green lines are for two earlier deep recessions—the one beginning in late  1973 and the one that started in mid-1981, while the black line is the current recession  and recovery  For each recession, the data are indexed with the value of real GDP in  the peak quarter set equal to 100  The time scale across the bottom shows the number  of quarters after the peak, with 16 quarters equivalent to the fourth quarter of 2011 for  the current cycle  Finally, the red dashed line shows our GDP projection from a year  and a half ago, in January 2010—after the start of the recovery had become apparent  to us but before the European debt crisis had gained prominence and before the run- up in oil prices  The two takeaway points from this panel are pretty obvious  The  current recovery has been far slower than previous recoveries from deep recessions,  and it has been noticeably slower than we expected a year and a half ago   The next three panels lay out the data in a similar manner for three key  components of GDP—namely, PCE, residential construction, and equipment and  software  Clearly, the bulk of the shortfall—either compared with previous cycles or  with the January 2010 forecast—can be attributed to residential construction and  PCE  But, because of the relative size of consumption in overall GDP—about  70 percent compared with only 2 percent currently for housing—arithmetically, the  contribution from the shortfall in PCE is the most important factor for overall GDP,  especially in comparison with the two previous deep recessions   June 21–22, 2011 73 of 282              So, why has consumer spending been so sluggish?  Before addressing that  question, let me digress for a moment  Earlier this morning, the Chairman noted that  this is Dave Stockton’s last meeting  Over the years, among Dave’s many  extraordinarily valuable qualities, one of the most useful for the staff—and, I would  imagine, for the Committee as well—has been his openness about the limits of our  knowledge  Many has been the time that he has offered some plausible hypotheses,  but in the end admitted, “We just don’t know”  I should note that privately with the  staff, the phrase “we just don’t know” is typically expressed in much more colorful  language  It is in that spirit, then, that the lower-left panel offers some hypotheses,  with the caveat that we just don’t know for sure   Unlike the recessions of the mid-1970s and the early 1980s, this recession was  sparked by the collapse of a housing bubble and subsequent financial crisis whose  aftereffects are proving to be quite persistent  One result of the bursting of the  bubble, of course, has been the drop in house prices, which are now down by about  40 percent in real terms from their peak  As a result, currently, more than one out of  every four mortgage borrowers is underwater  With no home equity to tap, unable to  refinance and take advantage of low interest rates, and access to credit card debt still  restricted, these households likely have few, if any, resources available to smooth  their consumption through income losses from unemployment or other economic  misfortunes   Reduced income expectations doubtless are also playing a role  The panel to the  right shows the median year-ahead expected change in family income from the  Michigan survey  As you can see, expected income plummeted during the recession   But what is more remarkable is that these expectations have not recovered a bit  So a  plausible possibility is that household concerns about expected income—exacerbated  perhaps by such things as fears of further declines in house prices, concerns about job  loss, and geopolitical uncertainty—have led to a heightened desire to build  precautionary savings by those with the wherewithal to do so  But I end where I  began, with a note of uncertainty  We can’t be sure about the magnitude of these  effects or how persistent they will be   The next exhibit presents the medium-term forecast  As shown in the upper-left  panel, with underlying momentum in the recovery weaker than previously thought,  we marked down our projection of output growth significantly in the second half of  this year and in 2012  Excluding Japan effects, we now expect real GDP to increase  3 percent over the second half of this year and 3½ percent in 2012, both down about  ¾ percentage point from the April Tealbook  In addition, I should note that in light of  what appears to be the greater fragility of the recovery and the risks posed by a  number of factors, including the fiscal situations in both Europe and at home, we now  think that the risks to our growth projection are skewed to the downside   Reflecting the slower pace of overall economic activity, we expect that the  recovery in the labor market to be slower as well  As shown in the upper-right panel,  in the current forecast, the unemployment rate still is slightly above 8 percent at the  end of 2012, nearly ½ percentage point higher than in the April Tealbook   June 21–22, 2011 74 of 282              The middle-left panel highlights some of the key influences on the contour of the  forecast  As in previous Tealbooks, we expect that accommodative monetary policy,  a lower foreign exchange value of the dollar, increasing credit availability, and the  waning effects of earlier declines in wealth should all be supportive of a modest  pickup in the pace of the recovery  And, as those influences gain greater steam, we  expect household and business confidence to recuperate  That said, the recent data  suggest that the impetus provided by these factors may be smaller than previously  thought   The remaining panels focus on the three main components of private domestic  purchases  An important element underpinning our forecast of a gradual pickup in  economic growth is the continuation of sizable increases that we expect for business  capital spending  As shown in the middle-right panel, growth in the stock of E&S  capital currently remains low, both relative to historical trends and given current  levels of profitability  Over the medium term, we expect that the growth rate of the  E&S capital stock will return to more normal levels   In addition to adding more capital, firms should eventually become more  aggressive in adding more workers  As job growth picks up and the effects of energy  price increases earlier this year fade, household incomes and confidence should rise,  driving a modest acceleration in consumption—the lower-left panel—albeit  considerably less than in the April Tealbook   In the housing sector, the panel to the right, single-family construction will likely  be restrained by fears of purchasing into a falling market, the large stock of vacant  unsold homes currently hanging over the market, and tight credit conditions for  builders and for many potential homebuyers  As a result, we see starts going  essentially nowhere over the next 18 months   Exhibit 4 focuses on wages and prices  At recent meetings, several of you noted  that some of your business contacts have raised concerns about skill shortages and  their implications for upward pressures on wage costs  As part of the Beige Book  process, we asked the staffs at the Reserve Banks to make inquiries on several  questions related to hiring plans and wages  Some key results are summarized in the  upper-left panel  As shown on the first line, 45 percent of respondents indicate that  they plan to increase employment over the next 12 months  Among all respondents— those planning to hire and those not planning to hire—about 20 percent felt that skill  shortages were an important factor restraining their hiring  Despite this, however,  very few respondents anticipate raising starting pay as a recruiting tool  With regard  to pay for current workers, a majority of respondents expect that wages per employee  will change less than 2½ percent this year compared with 2010   All told, the results suggest that upward wage pressures over the next 12 months  are likely to be subdued  As shown in the panel in the upper right, the staff forecast  takes a similar view  We project compensation per hour will rise 21 percent this year  and 26 percent next year   June 21–22, 2011 75 of 282              The middle-left panel presents our price forecast  The incoming data on prices  have been above our expectations, and we have taken some signal for the inflation  path going forward  Nevertheless, we continue to expect that the rate of headline  inflation will step down significantly in the second half of this year, primarily  reflecting a drop in consumer energy prices (line 4)  As illustrated in the panel to the  right, retail gasoline prices have already retreated about 30 cents per gallon from their  recent peak, and we expect some further declines in the next few weeks before prices  level out  Returning to line 5 of the table, we anticipate a near-term deceleration in  prices excluding food and energy as well  As Trevor will discuss, non-oil commodity  price pressures have begun to ease, and we expect that this, along with some slowing  of dollar depreciation and foreign inflation, will be translated into much smaller  increases in the prices of imported goods   More importantly, we anticipate that the substantial slack in the labor market (the  lower-left panel) will continue to put downward pressure on inflation  At the same  time, longer-run inflation expectations, the red line in the panel to the right, are  projected to remain stable  All told, we expect headline inflation to increase  1½ percent next year, ¼ percentage point higher than in the April Tealbook  Beth  Anne will now continue our presentation    I did not actually do that cyclical comparison  I am going to put that on   my to-do list, however, because I think it’s a good point  But without having the actual facts in   front of me, I would suspect that your hypothesis has a lot of plausibility to it   June 21–22, 2011 89 of 282               Obviously, the comparisons you’re talking about are ones where you,   in effect, index them from the trough rather than from the peak, and the charts do look different   if you were to do that  It’s all in the eye of the beholder, but it would seem to me that the more   relevant comparisons were to start at the peak, so that one could take in the extraordinary depth   of this recession  And it was for that reason, then, that it seemed the right thing to do, to   compare it with other deep recessions  But I grant you that, in some sense, it depends on the   question that you are trying to address    Another thing we did was to look, for example, at the residuals in   spending equations at different points in the recovery  Typically at this point in a recovery, you   would expect, for example, that, because of pent-up demand and deferred purchases that   occurred during the recession, consumer spending would be higher than one might expect based   simply on income and wealth and the usual other kinds of right-hand-side determinants, whereas   now it’s just the opposite  Consumption is far below what might be expected  The facts that you   present are the facts, but in terms of trying to get some purchase on why this recovery just   doesn’t seem to be getting any traction, I think that focusing on these problems in the household   sector provides some insight    Could I add one more comment?  This is related to the point that   President Hoenig was raising as well, and that is, we have seen in the United States other times   when, regionally, there have been sizable declines in house prices  It happened in California in   June 21–22, 2011 93 of 282              the early 1990s, for example  The big difference was that, even though we had sizable declines   in house prices, we did not see a spike in households having negative equity because in those   days, you had to put 20 percent down  But when you put zero down and house prices fall, that’s   a big change  I think that’s an important difference between the situation that we faced in the   latter half of the past decade and previous periods of past declines    When you give a briefing, you have to give things linearly,   sequentially  But obviously these things are all endogenous, and there are interactions among all   of them  I think I tried to stress in my remarks that low expected income interacts with fears   June 21–22, 2011 95 of 282              about future job loss, concerns about further house price declines, and concerns about   geopolitical situations—that all of these things interact with each other to affect short-term   spending decisions  Yes, there is some longer-term spending path that we would expect   households to converge to over time, but in the current situation, over the period that’s relevant   for us, I think that, for a variety of reasons, households can get thrown off those paths or choose   to go off those paths for a while    Absolutely  Part of your consumption plan is going to be related to   income, which is going to be, of course, related to labor market conditions  "
9314,2011-09-20,"3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be using this single chart  I  tricked Steve, and he doesn’t have any  [Laughter]  In putting together the projection  this round, we faced two major issues  First, although the incoming spending data  over the intermeeting period were largely in line with our expectations, much of the  nonspending data that influence our projection came in well short of our expectations   So the question was, how aggressively should we respond to those data in revising the  projection?  Second, as we noted in the Tealbook, some of our statistical models  based on high-frequency data suggest that the economy may be in the process of  slipping into recession  Thus, with a weaker baseline forecast, our statistical filtering  models pointing to a sizable probability of recession, and downside risks looming  even larger than before, we faced the question, should we build a recession into the  baseline forecast?  In the remainder of my remarks, I’ll talk about how we reacted to  the news we received over the intermeeting period and then address the issue of why  we think the most likely outcome is for a continued gradual recovery of economic  activity   The upper-left panel of the exhibit shows our GDP projection  The disappointing  performance recently of many labor market indicators, the dramatic worsening of  consumer and business sentiment, and the sharp drop in stock prices led us to revise  down our forecast of real GDP growth in the second half of 2011 to an annual rate of  2¼ percent, about ½ percentage point less than in our previous projection  We also  lowered our projection for economic growth in the medium term, largely in response  to changes in financial conditions—in particular, the lower stock market and the                                                     3 The materials used by Mr Slifman are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   September 20–21, 2011 114 of 290              higher dollar  We now expect real GDP to rise about 2½ percent next year, nearly  ½ percentage point less than our previous forecast  Economic activity then  accelerates gradually during 2013 and beyond  As shown in the upper-right panel,  even as the economy continues to recover over the projection period, the gains are not  large enough to take up much resource slack, and the unemployment rate is projected  to still be above 8 percent at the end of 2013   The outlook for inflation—the middle-left panel—is similar to that in the August  Tealbook  As anticipated, commodity prices have come off their recent peaks, and  import price inflation is slowing  Accordingly, with long-run inflation expectations  well anchored, and considerable slack remaining in labor and product markets, we  expect overall PCE prices to rise 1¼ percent in each of the next two years after  increasing about 2½ percent in 2011   As a result of the staff’s weaker outlook for real GDP growth and labor market  conditions, and with little change to our inflation forecast, we now assume that the  FOMC will hold the target federal funds rate—the panel to the right—in the current  range of 0 to ¼ percent until the third quarter of 2014, four quarters later than in the  August Tealbook   In the large, the contour of our projection for economic activity is shaped by three  important elements  The first element is the conditioning assumptions underlying our  forecast  As I’ve already noted, we continue to assume that monetary policy will  remain highly accommodative  Moreover, as Steve will discuss shortly, we assume  in the baseline that Europe will work through its current problems without suffering a  financial meltdown  With no additional significant shocks hitting the economy and  the effects of earlier adverse shocks waning, we assume that household and business  sentiment will improve from their extremely low levels  Of course, as we illustrated  in one of the alternative scenarios, the destructive potential of the European situation  looms rather large in our thinking   The second major element helping to shape the contour of the forecast is the  current and prospective lessening of some of the headwinds that have been restraining  the pace of recovery  To be sure, construction is moribund, and fiscal policy remains  tight at all levels of government  Nonetheless, households in the aggregate are in  better financial shape than they were a couple of years ago, as is the corporate sector;  access to credit has improved; and the rate of decline in house prices has been  slowing  In addition, with oil prices down appreciably from the levels seen earlier  this year, the drag on economic activity from the previous run-up has begun to ebb   The third element in our story is the role played by the economy’s usual self- correcting mechanisms  Although still attenuated, those mechanisms should gain  greater traction over the next two years as the restraint from the headwinds continues  to diminish and monetary policy remains accommodative   In the household sector, as the negative effects of earlier declines in wealth fade,  spending should be supported by the natural tendency over time for consumption to   September 20–21, 2011 115 of 290              move back into closer alignment with the level of permanent income that is consistent  with potential output  In addition, pent-up demand for consumer durables should  shore up spending over the next couple of years  This is perhaps most evident for  autos and light trucks, where sales, even after taking account of supply chain  disruptions to dealers’ inventories, have for some time been running far below our  estimate of trend demand, which is based on demographics and scrappage rates   In the business sector, the growth rate of the E&S capital stock currently is well  below its historical average, as the level of investment has been only a little higher  than what is needed to replace depreciating equipment  Of course, estimates of the  “target” capital stock have a wide band of uncertainty  Still, if concerns about  prospects for US and global economic performance lessen and business sentiment  improves over time, as we assume, firms should begin to undertake more substantial  increases in their productive capacity and, with that, add more workers   As I noted earlier, although we continue to expect the pace of economic growth to  gradually firm over the next two years, some of the statistical models that we monitor  suggest that the economy may be in the process of slipping into recession  The  lower-left panel summarizes the forecasts generated by a suite of 45 factor models  that we maintain  These models use a data set with 124 series including measures of  economic activity, household and business surveys, labor market indicators, and data  from financial markets  As you can see, currently the mean forecast from these  models is for real GDP growth to fall in the fourth quarter and be little changed in the  first quarter   The lower-right panel presents a variation on a theme introduced by David  Wilcox at the August FOMC meeting  David showed the estimated probability that  the economy currently is in a recession state based on a simple three-state Markov  switching model  The panel shown here broadens the scope to include the probability  that the economy currently is in either a recession or a so-called stall state, which in  the model’s view inevitably leads to a recession  As you can see, the combined  probability currently is about 1 in 3   One interpretation of the results from these statistical exercises is that the  distribution of outcomes for economic performance over the next few quarters has  two peaks, with one centered on a resumption of recovery and the other centered on a  period of stagnation ending in a recession  The recovery peak has a higher  probability than the recession peak  Still, as discussed in the “Alternative Scenarios”  section of the Tealbook, Book A, if the economy were to slip into a recession, the  effects could be magnified, compared with the typical historical experience, by the  impaired capacity of both the private sector and public policymakers to buffer any  further shocks   Nevertheless, the bottom-line message of our forecast is that although the risks of  a recession have become more palpable over the past couple of months, we still do  not see that as the most likely outcome  Steve will now continue our presentation   September 20–21, 2011 116 of 290               Well, we explored that in one of the alternative simulations in the   Tealbook    It could be even more negative  The one thing I would point out is that   the factor models that I showed on the lower left have sentiment indicators as one of the many   variables in those models  So to the extent that that sentiment currently is being held down,   among other things, by the situation in Europe, then that would be captured by the factor models    But I think the more general point is that we did try to think about what would happen if things   got a lot worse in Europe, and as we showed in the Tealbook, that would have adverse   consequences  It would throw us into a recession    Steve can talk more to it, but the alternative simulation incorporates   some of that  "
