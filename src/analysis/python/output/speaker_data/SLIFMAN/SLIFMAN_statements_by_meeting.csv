974,1989-08-22," What the Chairman said is correct There is the issue of whether or not the claim is accepted; then it shows up in the ongoing benefits But the BLS in most instances knows who's filing the claim, so they can sort of monitor these things since it's an administrative count And they normally will note it, as the Chairman has said   Clearly, if that were the case, under those circumstances we would have to do something that was a combination of a [net] change for all other items and then worry about the level of inventory investment It turns out, however, that in this instance that's not really the case   So it's not a problem this time "
1092,1989-11-14," Governor Angell, let me just say in answer to your question that once we take account of our assumption about Boeing then we would have, in fact, a rather smooth deceleration in PDE growth over the near term "
1159,1989-12-18," Well, on Exhibit 10 the chart in the lower panel shows the simulation in the wage and price sector taken together So, it has the Phillips curve and then also the mark-up To be sure, you can see that in 1984, as I said, there was a substantial error; but it had dissipated over the subsequent year and a half And in the most recent period, this dynamic simulation of the wage and price sector together measured on the price variable has been pretty much right on track Now, we also did some simulations of the wage equation alone Again, it is true that there was a period where the model was tending to overpredict the actual experience--that actual wages were falling faster than the model would have predicted So, between '81 and roughly '85 there was a period of overprediction in measured growth rate terms But since about the middle of 1985, again measured in growth rate terms, the model has been pretty much right on track   This is sort of estimating it up through--   '79 and then--   Right, correct   Well, it's not so much a matter of what we would expect; it's really a question of what policy actions would be taken at that point We expect that the policy action that would be taken at that point would be to ease monetary policy further to bring down real interest rates as a way of trying to continue to support real GNP and bring that unemployment rate down closer to the natural rate So, the point that I'm trying to make is that you end this period with an unemployment rate, in this model, that is still substantially above the natural rate It does [pose] this continuous strategic problem because, with the unemployment rate above the natural rate at that point and with essentially no inflation, the model then would want to produce an outright deflation, at least for some time That's really the point I was trying to make   Well, that downward slope--and maybe it's a problem of the way we charted this--the rate is only going from 72 percent down to 70 percent So it's--   That is correct  -10-    12/18-19/89   Let me also just reemphasize the point that this model does not incorporate any credibility effects It seems likely, if one were successful in bringing down inflation the way that this particular simulation shows, that probably over time the credibility effects would begin to build So the final result in terms of the costs probably would not be as high as this simple simulation of the model itself wants to produce   In this particular model, to a first approximation the model is linear in regard to these sacrifice ratio calculations So, if that were to be stretched out over a longer period of time it would still require the same cumulative excess amount of unemployment; it would just be stretched out further--if, of course, the amount of disinflation were the same   That's the first approximation; it is not precise "
1714,1991-02-05," First, it turns out that in the second quarter itself we still actually have some liquidation going on but the rate of liquidation is slower than in the first quarter, so in a GNP accounting sense it shows up as a positive number here We do, however, start to get some accumulation beginning in the second half of the year But the amounts of accumulation are very, very small in dollar terms Again, it's because of these swings from rapid liquidation to slower liquidation to a small accumulation that in GNP terms that winds up adding to real GNP That is really what I was trying to show on the preceding chart, Chart 12, where you can see that even during part of that projection period we still have GNP below final sales and then it rises just very gradually We think it's a very modest amount of inventory accumulation that takes place; in fact, the inventory/sales ratio that's consistent with this actually falls for a while and then basically just flattens out at these historically low levels   Actually, it's a very small amount, as you can see In terms of our forecast we see it basically all coming from state and local purchases But they're very small; they're growing 03 percent, which is a very small number The federal net real purchases are falling What we really have in terms of the state and local sector is some construction going on but not very much   Right And it turns out that that also happens to be the growth rate as well   They happen to match up in that one instance "
1817,1991-05-14," Relative to what is happening to GNP, this is not atypical In other words--    5/14/91   The falloff in GNP, assuming our forecast is right, would be about half the typical peak-to-trough decline in GNP But if you look at the ratio, say, of personal income to GNP, that ratio has its own cyclical pattern "
2626,1993-02-02," Well, I think the main [effect] would be on those households that might feel their liquidity is constrained That is to say, the wealth is there but the [increased] ability of such households to liquify that wealth could boost consumption The other point is that in the case of turnover of the [housing] stock, some would argue that when capital gains are realized we do see evidence that some of those realized capital gains are not plowed back into the housing industry One can see that from the mortgage debt data So we have a feeling that some of [the capital gains] are being used to support consumption We also note from the refinancing data that a fair amount of cash is being taken out there, too There is no direct econometric evidence, but other kinds of ancillary information seem to suggest that this is going on   Well, it's true, as my other chart shows, that we have this shifting of the baby boomers into peak life cycle saving years and that demographic factor [tends to raise] the saving rate But, as I suggested, working the other way are economic factors, primarily the fact that net worth positions are a bit stronger and that household perceptions of income and job prospects seem to be improving substantially Both of those would tend to give you a lower saving rate Finally, though, there is the statistical question of who knows what the real level [of savings] is anyway!   Yes It is true that in some longer-run sense, all other things equal, we would expect the demographics to work toward a higher saving rate "
2806,1993-07-06," Even within consumption, [for] their PCE, there are some places where Commerce does not use the CPI For example, I think for air fares, which as you know has been a player in this  -16-    7/6-7/93  seasonality problem, they use independent information rather than CPI information "
3758,1995-07-05, [Statement--see Appendix] 
3811,1995-08-22," Let me add just one other comment that works in the other direction There are other changes that BEA is considering implementing over the next several years One in particular that would work the other way would be the inclusion of software as final output At present, when software is not bundled with the computer, it is counted as an intermediate product If output of software has been growing faster than other output, that would push up ""true"" output growth There are some other things that are service-related where BEA is planning to implement new procedures to try to get a better handle on service output, such as this issue with software Those things won't be reflected in the next benchmark this December, but they will be reflected in the following benchmark revision In fact, it may well be that productivity is growing faster and that we just are not measuring output properly   Only in the most recent quarters The statistical discrepancy doesn't have a particular trend to it   In the most recent couple of quarters   I don't think that's a trend phenomenon "
4041,1996-01-30, [Statement--see Appendix] 
4640,1997-07-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman We will be referring to the packet of  material titled ""Staff Presentation to the Federal Open Market Committee"" Dave Stockton, Ted  Truman, and I will jointly share the honors this afternoon [Statements--see Appendix]   I think they purposely have chosen to stretch out deliveries, as they  have done in the past, because they know a bust will inevitably follow the boom   We have not quantified it, as I suggested in my remarks, but we  think it will have a relatively modest negative effect with a lag on consumer spending in 1998   No We anticipate that the slowing of activity will result primarily  from some stock adjustments following the large increases in investment spending in recent  years   Right, in both consumer spending and business investment "
5952,2000-06-27,"  Your next chart presents our   productivity forecast  The upper left panel provides some longer- run perspective, while the upper right panel magnifies the current  situation  We are projecting that the rate of growth of structural  productivity in 2000 and 2001 will be a bit higher than it was in  the preceding two years   Indeed, at a 32 percent annual rate this  year and next, our projection is clearly at the high end of the range  of outside estimates     The acceleration of structural productivity evident since   1995 reflects both a quickening in the pace of capital deepening  and a pickup in the growth of multifactor productivity  The  middle panels address the capital deepening issue  Capital input,  shown on the left, measures the services derived from the stock of  physical assets  As you can see, the index of capital services from  information technology equipment and software (the red bars) has  been accelerating since 1973, while the growth of other capital  inputs (the gray bars) has remained close to the 2 percent annual  rate observed over the past quarter century  Of course, to go from  capital input growth to capital deepening, the trend growth in  hours of work--currently about 1 percent annually--must be  subtracted off     In calculating the contribution of capital deepening to   productivity growth, changes in capital-labor ratios are weighted  by capital income shares  The middle right panel shows the  capital income share of information technology equipment and  software  The steep advance of this share, combined with the  acceleration of IT capital input, has been the primary source of the  pronounced pickup in the contribution of capital deepening to  structural productivity growth--line 2 of the table  Between 1973           19  and 1995 (the first column), capital deepening added seven-tenths  of a percentage point per year to productivity growth, compared  with 16 percentage points in the late 1990s (the third column)   Multifactor productivity growth--line 4--which reflects the effects  of such things as new technology, economies of scale,  improvements in managerial skill, and changes in the organization  of production, picked up nearly half a percentage point over the  same period  Going forward, our investment forecast is consistent  with more capital deepening, while ongoing improvements to how  business is conducted will show through to even faster growth of  multifactor productivity     Despite the favorable productivity performance, we still   are forecasting a build-up of inflation pressures   Focusing on the  upper panels of chart 12, you can see that both core CPI and core  PCE prices have accelerated recently, measured at either the  three-month, six-month, or twelve-month frequencies--the red,  blue, and black lines respectively  In the case of the so-called  “pipeline” inflation indicators, presented in the middle panels,  twelve-month changes in both the core intermediate goods PPI  and the core crude goods index have moved up distinctly over the  past year or so  Similarly, the index of prices paid in the NAPM  manufacturing survey shows that since late last year a sizable  number of firms have reported paying higher prices for their  materials and supplies  It should be noted, however, that  industrial commodity prices and the NAPM index have softened  of late, as manufacturing output has moderated     During the last two periods of rising inflation pressures--  1988-89 and 1994-95--widespread bottlenecks and shortages were  reported as firms in a number of industries--for example, primary  metals, textiles, paper, and plastics--were operating at very high  utilization rates  Currently, however, capacity utilization is well  below the levels reached in those episodes, and bottlenecks and  shortages seem to be few, apparently reflecting the rapid growth  of capacity during recent years     To illustrate the point, in the lower panel I have listed a   sample of the items that purchasing managers reported to be in  short supply during the two previous periods of rising inflation as  well as the complete list shown in the most recent NAPM survey   Consistent with the numerous press stories on the subject, the  purchasing managers do report shortages of one critical group of  products--electronic components; and, as noted in the Greenbook,  those shortages are having an effect on computer prices  But  that’s pretty much it  There are no reports of shortages for such  basic materials as aluminum, steel, or industrial chemicals           20    So, where does that leave us in terms of the outlook for   inflation?  Chart 13 presents part of the staff’s view  The first part  of our story has to do with sustainability--or lack of it, to be more  precise  One way of demonstrating this point is illustrated in the  upper panel  The idea behind the picture is one that the Chairman  has discussed many times and is based on a modification of the  growth accounting identity  That is, arithmetically the growth of  domestic demand equals the sum of the growth of productivity,  population, the participation rate, and one minus the  unemployment rate, plus the contribution of net imports  The  chart shows the role of three of those items  falling  unemployment and rising participation--that is, a shrinking pool  of available workers--as well as the widening trade deficit  So,  for example, during the four quarters ending in 2000Q1,  domestic demand rose 57 percent, of which 1-1/2 percentage  points was met by the factors shown on the chart     In terms of the sustainability issue, there are two ways to   satisfy above-trend growth of domestic demand We can make the  goods here or foreigners can make them for us  If we make them  here, we can do it by drawing more people into the workforce or  by increasing productivity  But the pool of available workers  can’t be drawn down forever; likewise, the trade deficit can’t  widen forever  The upper panel is one way of scaling the extent  to which we have been relying on these two “safety valves” to  maintain demand growth     By this measure, the growth of domestic demand has been   relying on these unsustainable sources for most of the past seven  years, which has contributed to a widening GDP gap--the middle  panel  Indeed, currently we estimate that the level of actual GDP  is about 3 percent above the level of potential     The lower panel shows the historical relationship between   the GDP gap and price acceleration, as well as the staff  projection  The horizontal axis plots the GDP gap measured at  the end of year “t-1” and the vertical axis is the acceleration in  core PCE prices during year “t”  Although there are one or two  obvious outliers, for the most part the points cluster around the  fitted regression line, plotted in blue  The regression suggests that  a 3 percent imbalance between aggregate demand and aggregate  supply at the end of last year is likely to be associated with a 06  percentage point step-up in inflation this year  Although the  approach we actually use for projecting inflation is more complex  than this simple bivariate relationship, the forecast suggested by           21  the regression is reasonably in line with what we’ve written down  in the Greenbook for the average acceleration in core PCE prices  during 2000 and 2001--the red dots on the chart     An alternative, but certainly not independent, way of   thinking about the inflation process is presented in Chart 14  Here  I show a cost accounting of inflation for the nonfinancial  corporate sector  This is just an extension of the tables I send the  Committee shortly before each meeting  The logic of this  approach is based on the identity that relates inflation to changes  in unit labor costs, unit nonlabor costs, and unit profits, where  output is measured in value-added terms from the income side   The upper panel shows fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter increases  in compensation per hour and productivity--the components of  unit labor costs  As you can see, with aggregate demand growing  more quickly than supply and with labor markets extremely tight  over the forecast period, we expect hourly compensation growth  to pick up  At the same time, we think that productivity growth is  likely to slow, as employers catch up on some hiring while output  is slowing  The result is an acceleration in unit labor costs for the  nonfinancial corporate sector over the next two years     The middle panels show the other two components of the   identity  We are projecting a continuation of the modest increase  in nonlabor costs posted over the past year or so, primarily  reflecting higher interest costs  Finally, unit profits, which  climbed sharply earlier in the expansion, are projected to drop  back somewhat over the next year and a half, as a competitive  business environment makes it difficult for firms to fully pass on  higher unit costs     The bottom panel illustrates how this all adds up for the   nonfinancial corporate deflator  Note that because this is a sector- wide price index, it includes energy and food  The jump in unit  labor costs expected this year leads to a pickup in inflation from  about 1/2 percent during 1999 to 1-1/4 percent over the four  quarters of 2000  In 2001, however, the further acceleration of  unit labor costs is offset by the projected drop in profitability, and  price increases slow a bit  This contour is roughly similar to the  one shown for total PCE prices in the bottom panel of Dave’s first  chart        As for how sure we are, the answer is our usual answer There is a   wide range of uncertainty  The model that we use, as you probably know, is the so-called stock   adjustment model for the demand for labor  So our view, as I noted and as we said in the   Greenbook, is that even though output growth decelerates, hiring will continue, as firms that   right now are running with very stretched work forces try to get their work forces to more   preferred operating levels  That is the underlying logic  How confident are we that that’s what   is going to happen?  Well, obviously, there is a wide range of uncertainty around this cyclical           37  component of our productivity projection  It could also be the case that we're too pessimistic   about underlying structural productivity growth, particularly total factor productivity, which   could give us some additional boost to overall labor productivity     Yes     Yes  The slowing in overall labor productivity is all happening, in   an accounting sense, as a slowing in total factor productivity  The capital deepening component   is still surging ahead because we are at such high levels of investment  "
6203,2001-01-30,"  We will be referring to the package of materials you've   received, entitled “Staff Presentation on the Economic Outlook”  2/   As you know from the Greenbook, we are expecting a sharp  deceleration of production in the first half of 2001, as shown in line  1 of the table in your first exhibit  This pattern reflects, in part, a  pronounced drag on real GDP from inventory investment (line 5) as  firms seek to bring their stocks into better alignment with sales  But  it also reflects a notable slowing in the pace of final demand  In  particular, as shown on line 2 of the table, private domestic final  purchases are projected to rise at only a 14 percent pace in the first  half of this year, with both consumption (line 3) and business  investment in equipment and software (line 4) relatively weak     A number of forces seemed to come together in the latter part   of last year to damp the growth of aggregate demand  Among these  were the rise in energy prices, waning wealth effects, and the earlier  tightening of monetary policy  In addition, domestic production was  curbed by the strength of the dollar  As I will discuss shortly, many  of these restraining influences turn more favorable fairly soon in our  projection and begin to provide support to economic activity   Moreover, the drag from the inventory adjustment abates after  midyear  Reflecting these influences, real GDP growth is expected  to pick up in the second half of this year and to grow at close to  potential next year     With real GDP rising at a rate slower than that of potential--  especially this year--the unemployment rate rises  By the end of  2001, the jobless rate is projected to reach 52 percent and  unemployment then rises a bit further in 2002  The widening slack      ______________________  2/  A copy of “Materials for Staff Presentation on the Economic Outlook”   is appended to this transcript  (Appendix 2)       1/30-31/01 100  in labor and product markets and a drop-off in energy prices reduce  inflation this year and next to around 1-3/4 percent, when measured  in terms of the PCE price index     Your next chart summarizes some of the key background   factors of our forecast  For our baseline projection, we have  assumed a 25 basis point cut in the funds rate at this meeting and  then a flat funds rate through 2002  Our other financial assumptions  include a near-term decline in the stock market with a leveling out  thereafter  This implies a falling wealth-income ratio through the  end of the projection period  Long-term corporate interest rates  remain near current levels and risk spreads on corporate bonds,  which already are high by historical standards, stay elevated   Reflecting our financial assumptions and the projection for activity  here and abroad, we expect the foreign exchange value of the dollar  to decline moderately  Fiscal policy also is assumed to be  stimulative next year  And finally, prices of oil and natural gas are  expected to recede over the next two years, consistent with quotes in  the futures markets     The next chart looks at the question  What has been happening   to some of the high frequency indicators of activity, and how does  their current behavior compare with the 1990-91 recession?  As you  can see, many of the high frequency data series that we follow have  turned sour recently  The process seems to have been kicked off by  a weakening demand for consumer durable goods--autos as well as  other big-ticket items--and for capital goods (the upper two panels of  the chart)  Comparing the recent experience with the shaded areas,  the declines in the consumer sector are on a par with those seen in  1990-91, while the drop in capital goods orders is steeper  The  resulting cutbacks in production have been widespread  The middle  left panel shows a diffusion index of three-month changes in  manufacturing industrial production  You can see that since the  middle of last year the preponderance of manufacturing industries  have been cutting production  Indeed, the recent pattern of this  index looks increasingly similar to what happened in 1990   Accompanying the reduction in production has been a spate of  layoffs and an upward climb in initial claims for unemployment  insurance  The actual layoffs that have occurred, and the fear of  more to come, have taken a dramatic toll on consumer confidence   The lower left panel shows the Michigan survey’s index of consumer  sentiment  And, as you can see on the table we distributed at the  lunch break, the Conference Board’s expectations index, which was  released this morning, also fell sharply in January        1/30-31/01 101  One bright spot in all of this gloom is the housing sector, where  activity measures such as permits for single-family units, after  receding in early 2000, have stabilized more or less in recent months  at a fairly high level; this stands in sharp contrast to the plunge  during 1990  In addition, anecdotal reports on consumer activity in  January suggest that spending steadied or perhaps turned up     Your next chart addresses the question  What are the near-term   dynamics of our forecast?  It is clear that the extent of the weakness  in final demand that emerged in the latter part of 2000 came as a  surprise to many businesses  As a result, buildups of inventories  were widespread across manufacturing  The most well-publicized  has been the accumulation of light motor vehicles, and the  production adjustments in that sector recently have been quite deep-- the upper two panels  A similar story of excess inventories can be  told for other manufacturers as well--the middle left panel   Businesses in some industries, such as construction supplies and  industrial materials, already have cut production dramatically, and  their inventories should be brought into better balance fairly soon   However, the reductions in output for many of the industries within  the machinery and equipment categories have been relatively small  thus far, and further declines in the next few months are likely before  the overall factory stock overhang is worked off     So, what keeps things from building on themselves and the   economy from collapsing into recession?   As I will discuss shortly,  we think the fundamental determinants of final demand are sound   Consequently, we see the current situation as one in which  production is fluctuating around a comparatively well-maintained  final sales path in order to bring actual and desired inventories into  better balance  In our forecast this adjustment occurs very promptly   We expect manufacturers to slash production at a 7-1/2 percent  annual rate in the current quarter, and factory output is projected to  edge up only slightly next quarter  As shown on line 2 of the table at  the lower left, the sharp drop in factory production accounts for the  bulk of the near-term movements in real GDP     The lower right panel translates this into more familiar NIPA   terms  The dark bars show the growth rate of final sales and the red  bars show the growth rate of the stock of inventories  In our  projection, the stock of nonfarm inventories is virtually unchanged  during the first half of this year, while final sales grow moderately   As a result, we expect the bulk of the inventory overhangs to be  worked off by the middle of this year  It is this rapid response by  manufacturers that helps check a broader and deeper unwinding of  activity  But an important risk to the forecast, and one that we     1/30-31/01 102  explored in the “recession” alternative in Part 1 of the Greenbook, is  that the abruptness of the production cuts and the recent torrent of  layoff announcements--such as yesterday’s from Daimler Chrysler--  might lead to a severe break in consumer and business confidence   That in turn could cause a sizable contraction of final sales, with all  the attendant multiplier and accelerator effects on GDP     In the context of our baseline forecast, however, one might ask    What are the fundamental forces supporting the expected  reacceleration of aggregate demand?  That question is addressed in  chart 5  The first fundamental is monetary policy  The upper left  panel shows the effects of changes in the real funds rate on GDP  growth since the third quarter of 1998, as estimated by the Board’s  FRB/US econometric model  As you can see, the model suggests  that the rate hikes initiated in mid-1999 damped GDP growth  considerably during 2000  The move taken on January 3 of this  year, along with the further easing action assumed in our forecast,  should begin to ease some of the earlier restraint in the next few  months  The degree of restraint progressively lessens through most  of 2002  The assumed changes in discretionary fiscal policy, as  measured by our fiscal impetus indicator, also are projected to boost  aggregate demand, adding about a quarter of a percentage point to  GDP growth next year, according to the FRB/US model     In terms of the components of GDP, we think the fundamentals   for both business investment and consumer spending will be  supportive  Looking at investment first, the actual and assumed  easing of monetary policy and the ongoing descent in the relative  prices of business equipment are expected to lead to further declines  in the user cost of capital--the middle left panel  Moreover, the  banking system is vastly more sound than it was a decade ago, and  we don’t see much in the way of financial headwinds that would  impede funding for worthy projects  Consequently, we are  projecting an acceleration in capital spending later this year and  another sizable pickup next year     For the consumer sector, activity should be boosted by the   projected drop in energy prices  The lower left panel shows a rough  back-of-the-envelope estimate of the direct effects of changes in oil  and natural gas prices on the growth rate of real PCE  As you can  see, after the first quarter of 2001, the depressing effects of last  year’s energy spike begin to unwind and the expected declines in  those prices then contribute to PCE growth     Last, but certainly not least, a critical fundamental factor   supporting activity is our belief that multifactor productivity and     1/30-31/01 103  overall structural labor productivity are still growing rapidly  Dave  will talk about our productivity projection shortly  Suffice it to say,  however, that the effects of this assumption permeate the forecast   For one, the rapid growth of structural productivity is reflected in a  strong expansion of permanent income, and, after the economy  passes through the current inventory correction, in actual income as  well  Indeed, as you can see in the lower right panel, we expect  before-tax real personal income to rise 3-1/2 percent next year-- about the same as in 1999 and 2000  This, of course, is an important  force supporting consumption growth throughout the projection  period     Dave will now continue our presentation      It’s probably on about the same scale relative to what’s going   on in terms of final demand and so on  It’s a touch sharper and faster than historically;   there’s no doubt about that  And that is based on our judgment that there have been   changes in the flexibility of businesses, both in terms of their labor inputs and their   supply chain management systems, to adapt to unexpected changes in final demand that   lead to these excess inventories  So, yes, we have factored in some change in the speed   of the adjustment It’s not a massive change, but it has been informing our decisions     Well, let me talk a little about what we know  We know that   much of the inventory overhang initially began in domestically produced autos  We   know the physical size of that overhang  So, that clearly is one sector where we could   say that the excess inventory has been in domestically produced goods and where we can   set aside the import issue  Another place where we have seen major imbalances   beginning to develop and adjustments taking place is in construction materials and   supplies, much of which is domestically produced although not entirely so  We   obviously import some lumber and other construction supplies  But a great deal of that   adjustment also--and we can tell that from industrial production--has been in domestic     1/30-31/01 117  industries  Another area where we’ve seen overhangs is in materials  Those goods have   a broader range of sources of supply  Clearly, some of the overhang in steel has been in   imported steel  But we know also that a lot of it must have been domestically produced   because we can see the production adjustments taking place; for example, this morning’s   data on the most recent weekly numbers for steel production indicated that it was down   again this past week  So we know that a lot of it has been on the domestic side  I’ll defer   to Karen to speak about what we know from the import side     That's a good question  I can see how the confidence   surveys--because the questions are asked in terms of one’s expectations about what will   happen to the economy--could be plunging and yet people’s views with regard to their   own personal situations and their individual longer-run income prospects could be well   maintained  So implicit in our thinking, although we don’t write it down this way   explicitly, is the view that once we get past this inventory correction--and the layoff   announcements slow down and so forth--people’s expectations about the longer-run   prospects for the economy will start to go back up again  We don’t envision a severe   confidence break that is long lasting  But that’s clearly a risk to the forecast, and it’s the   reason we included an alternative simulation in Part I of the Greenbook with a greater   near-term loss of confidence     Actually Jeff Fuhrer, who is here today, has done a lot of the   staff’s work on this  As we’ve noted many times before, the one series that seems to   have a bit of predictive power is the one about unemployment expectations       1/30-31/01 121 "
6353,2001-06-26," It may be the data packets that are being transmitted across the fiber   optic network We get those estimates from a major consulting firm that we have an arrangement   with    I suspect it’s semi-occasional, but I’m not sure  [Laughter]   SPEAKER(?)  Whenever they have a contract that pays them to do it!  "
6606,2002-01-29," Let me turn now from the broad contours of our projection to  some of the details  Chart 6 shows a few of the high-frequency production indicators  that have influenced our judgments about the current state of the economy  One  important indicator that has informed our thinking is private payroll employment (the  upper left panel) As you can see, the rate of decline began to slow at the end of last  year More recently, initial claims for unemployment insurance—shown to the  right—have continued to fall, on balance, and are now reaching a level that typically  is consistent with stable employment  In terms of production itself, assemblies of  motor vehicles (the middle left panel) have been moving in a sawtooth pattern during  the past few months but at a fairly high level on average  And as shown by the              January 29-30, 2002 Page 48 of 194  dashed line, automakers plan to maintain output at close to the recent pace  However,  elsewhere in manufacturing—the middle right panel—we estimate that production  continued to contract at a substantial pace through December  Even here, though, the  very recent news is promising  For one thing, an index of selected weekly physical  product data, excluding motor vehicles and electricity generation, which is  constructed by the staff, appears to have stabilized during January The weekly index  is illustrated in the black line of the lower left panel, while the bars show the monthly  averages Although this index represents only about 8 percent of industrial  production, the fact that it seems to have stabilized is certainly a good sign   Moreover, the ISM—formerly known as the NAPM—new orders diffusion index  turned up sharply in November and December  Based on historical relationships,  these increases, if maintained, suggest that the contraction in the IP sub-component  shown in the panel above should come to an end in the not too distant future   Turning from production to sales, the table at the top of chart 7 shows some key  near-term indicators of private domestic final purchases  By now, the story for sales  of motor vehicles—line 1 of the table—is quite familiar  The only point I would  make is that, even with the phasing down of the zero percent financing incentives,  sales are still relatively buoyant More broadly, real consumer spending for goods  other than motor vehicles (line 2) rebounded in October from a depressed September  reading, and sizable gains were maintained in November and December  Moreover,  for what it’s worth, the weekly readings on chain store sales (not shown) suggest that  spending held up reasonably well in the first four weeks of January  Activity in the  housing sector—line 3—also has held up quite well  The outlook for business  investment, however, is more mixed  I’ll talk about the information technology  sector in a few moments  Let me note here that outside of IT, shipments of  nondefense capital goods—line 4—have yet to show a sustained pickup  But the  orders data we received this morning—line 5 of the table—were encouraging and  could contain the first hints of a turnaround in this sector   The near-term path for production is being influenced importantly by the  dynamics of the inventory cycle  The middle two panels show measures of the days’  supply of inventories These measures are based on a system that uses industrial  production and other indicators to trace the flow of goods and materials through the  economy  The left panel shows the huge overhang of semiconductors and other items  related to the IT sector that developed during late 2000 and the first part of 2001   While severe overhangs still plague producers of communications equipment, stocks  of semiconductors and computers have been brought down to more manageable  levels, and the days’ supply for the entire sector has retraced a good part of its earlier  run-up Outside the IT sector (the right panel), progress has been more uneven, and  inventories in several industries—notably, paper, electrical machinery, furniture and  apparel—remain excessive  Accordingly, we expect production in many of these  industries to remain subdued a while longer   The bottom panel shows how we see the near-term inventory dynamics playing  out The solid black line shows the level of GDP excluding motor vehicles, while the                 January 29-30, 2002 Page 49 of 194  dashed line shows final sales excluding motor vehicles  When the level of GDP  exceeds the level of final sales, the gap is shaded green and reflects the extent of  inventory accumulation  Similarly, the red-shaded area is a period when production  is below sales and inventories are being liquidated  In our projection, the maximum  amount of non-motor-vehicle liquidation is estimated to have occurred in the fourth  quarter of 2001 We expect the pace of liquidation to diminish over the next couple  of quarters as businesses boost the level of production up to the level of final sales,  providing a considerable fillip to near-term GDP growth   The next exhibit focuses on the outlook for two key components of GDP—  business and household spending As shown on line 3 of the table, the prime mover  of business investment this year in our forecast is a revival in spending for computers  and peripherals, which we think is already under way  Indeed, with the growth of real  computer shipments surging well into positive territory lately—the right panel—we  estimate that investment outlays increased at an annual rate of 30 percent in the fourth  quarter of 2001 The question, of course, is whether this is just a short-lived burst or  the start of a sustained upswing The anecdotal reports have been increasingly  favorable, with stories of a pickup in the demand for high-end servers near the end of  last year and the likelihood of an “upgrade cycle” for PCs beginning during 2002  In  terms of hard data, one encouraging indicator is the series from our IP system on  production of semiconductors (the middle left panel), which we have found to be  useful in predicting computer investment for up to two quarters ahead  As you can  see, this series has recorded solid gains in recent months  As firms step up the pace  of spending for new computers, we expect that they will want to upgrade their  software as well—line 4 of the table In contrast to computers and software, the  outlook for communications equipment—line 5—remains negative  Both our near- term indicators, such as production and new orders, and the anecdotal information  suggest that a substantial capital overhang is still weighing heavily on this segment of  the market  At best, we don’t expect the situation to stabilize until sometime this  summer Business spending for other equipment (line 6) is also projected to be quite  soft A sizable portion of the spending for this category, which includes such things  as metalworking and industrial machinery, comes from manufacturing firms  But as  shown in the middle right, manufacturing capacity utilization currently is quite low,  and it stays relatively low throughout the projection period, providing little incentive  for many manufacturers to boost spending on new equipment   The lower panels examine our consumption forecast  In light of the robust  performance of PCE last year, especially given the rise in unemployment and the  slump in the stock market, one might be tempted to ask whether our wealth effect  story has been failing us One crude way to answer the question is to compare the  behavior of the wealth-income ratio (the black line in the left panel) with the ratio of  PCE to income, essentially 1 minus the saving rate, which is shown by the red line   As you can see, over time these two series track each other fairly well, and they have  been well aligned recently  Moreover, our more-elaborate econometric models of  consumption that include wealth have not been making persistent errors  One reason  that consumption growth has been as strong as it has is that real income growth—the                 January 29-30, 2002 Page 50 of 194  yellow bars in the lower right panel—also has been relatively well maintained   Looking forward, consumption spending is held up in part by the strong growth of  real disposable income that we expect in 2002, with a chunk of that gain coming from  the cut in tax rates that went into effect on January 1   The upper left panel of chart 9 shows our projection for core PCE price inflation   As David pointed out earlier, we expect core PCE inflation to slow by ½ percentage  point over the next two years The projected deceleration of core inflation reflects, in  part, the indirect effects of declining energy prices  As shown in the middle right  panel, according to staff estimates, energy input prices faced by nonfinancial  corporations other than energy producers have reversed all of their 2000 spurt,  dropping rapidly since early 2001  Of course, changes in energy input prices are not  necessarily fully, nor immediately, passed through to final purchasers  But over the  next year, we expect lower energy input costs to reduce the rate of core inflation  about 02 percentage point—essentially offsetting last year’s boost  Another  important factor leading to a deceleration of inflation over the next two years is the  low rate of resource utilization that we anticipate  As shown in the middle left panel,  we expect actual GDP to be below the estimated level of potential GDP throughout  the projection period, albeit with the gap narrowing somewhat; and, as David  mentioned earlier, the unemployment rate remains in the vicinity of 6 percent  The  slack in labor markets is likely to be a damping influence on the growth rate of unit  labor costs over the projection period judged relative to either actual productivity (as  illustrated by the bars in the middle right panel) or structural productivity (the line)   That said, the bottom panel highlights one upside risk to the inflation forecast, which  we discussed in the alternative simulation section of the Greenbook—namely,  extremely narrow profit margins  As you can see, the profit share dropped sharply  between 1997 and 2001, and we expect it to remain low  In part, this reflects strong  competitive pressures from prices of imported goods  However, historical experience  suggests that the profit share won’t stay this low forever  Thus, we face the risk that  over the next two years firms may begin increasing prices in an attempt to rebuild  profit margins  Karen will now continue our presentation     Yes This is our industrial production index, which is actually   constructed by looking at production on a chip-by-chip basis—at that level of detail  So by   doing that we are accounting for changes in quality over time    Well, there are two things going on  One, in the very short term   D-RAM prices actually have shot way up, as you know, apparently because of demand  But   over the longer haul, we expect a return—because of technological improvement—to the rapid   rates of decline that we saw over the course of the 1990s, which would be on the order of 25 to   30 percent    That’s certainly a possibility  But I’m not aware that we were hearing a   great number of stories along those lines from our business contacts     If anything, I think that was the kind of report that we were hearing   from our business contacts as well    When we do our current-quarter estimate for consumption—2002Q1   being the current quarter now—it pretty much is not model driven     It’s based on a several factors  One is the pattern of the monthly data   as we move into the quarter  In part the PCE projection is driven by what we think we know   about auto sales even in January, which plays a role there  So we’re thinking about those kinds   of things much more than any consumption model    An important consideration in our minds as we look beyond the current   quarter or so is some notion of a target inventory-sales ratio  We think these target ratios have   been on a downtrend for at least the past decade and maybe longer  In order to get a forecast that   has a target inventory-sales ratio that behaves the way we think it should, we basically need to   have businesses get rid of the excess inventory that built up in late 2000 through 2001—a   process that is going on now We think those inventory-sales ratios are generally in a range that   is close to the target levels  So, after firms get rid of their excess inventories, they have   production and final sales growing in line with each other, as the panel at the bottom of chart 7   shows, in order to keep those ratios from going back up again That’s the logic behind our   forecast You can quibble about the exact numbers, but that’s the basic philosophy that we use        January 29-30, 2002 Page 62 of 194 "
7047,2003-01-28,"3  Before we start the chart show itself, I want to give you an  update on the data released yesterday on orders, shipments, and inventories  These  are on the separate sheet inserted in the chart show package  As shown on line 1, new  orders for nondefense capital goods rose 28 percent last month—about in line with  our expectation  In addition, the November number was revised up reflecting, in part,  a whopping revision to aircraft orders  The shipments numbers, lines 6 through 10,  were weaker than expected and, all else being equal, would shave 01 percentage  point off fourth-quarter GDP and put us on a slightly lower trajectory going into the  first quarter  However, inventories at manufacturers of durable goods, line 11, are  reported to have soared at an annual rate of nearly $30 billion last month, with almost  all of the accumulation in the aircraft industry (line 12)  Given what we know from  Boeing about their production and deliveries last month, we’re puzzled by the size of  this number  Nevertheless, taking the figure at face value, it would add about  04 percentage point to fourth-quarter GDP     Let me turn now to the chart show  In putting together the Greenbook, two of the   questions we asked ourselves were, “What the heck happened to the economy in the  fourth quarter?” and “How do we get from an economy that appeared to be dead in  the water late last year to one that’s growing at a 4½ percent rate in the second half of  this year?”  Many of you may well have asked yourselves the same questions     So, what happened in the latter part of 2002?  Two different factors seemed to   have been at work  First was the return of the production of motor vehicles to a more  sustainable pace in the fourth quarter (the red dot in the top left panel) from the  elevated third-quarter rate  We estimate that the drop in assemblies deducted about  1 percentage point from fourth-quarter GDP growth  But as shown by the open dot,  we expect this sector to be essentially neutral for GDP growth in the first quarter  As  shown in the top right panel, the other factor helping to explain the pause of GDP  growth during the fourth quarter was a resumption of inventory liquidation outside  the motor vehicle sector following the modest accumulation in the preceding quarter      The remaining panels of this exhibit trace out the main elements of the   production, demand, and inventory story in the second half of last year  The high- frequency data in these panels and the anecdotal reports in the Beige Book and from  our business contacts highlight a feature of last year’s economic performance that is  obscured by the arithmetic of quarterly averaging—namely, the abrupt halt in the  growth of non-auto factory output that occurred in middle of last year (the middle left  panel)  The retrenchment doubtless was related in part, as one contact put it, to a                                                     3 The materials used by Mr Slifman, Mr Struckmeyer, and Ms Johnson are appended to this transcript (appendix  3)   January 28-29, 2003 70 of 195    “complete loss of business confidence in the wake of the corporate governance  scandals”  Despite some retrenchment of production, final sales excluding motor  vehicles continued to expand  As shown in the middle right panel, consumer  spending (line 1) and housing activity (lines 2 and 3) were both well maintained  through the end of the year, although business spending (line 4) remained sluggish   The shortfall of production from demand outside the auto sector had as its  tautological counterpart a reduction in inventories, especially for consumer goods and  business equipment  As we noted in the Greenbook, because final sales have  continued to increase, we are not viewing last quarter’s liquidation as signaling a  major problem with unwanted stocks that could cumulate into even deeper production  cuts  The days’ supply of inventories, illustrated in the bottom left panel, does not  suggest any serious imbalances, nor do the reports from purchasing managers on their  customers’ inventories (the bottom right panel)  In GDP terms, we expect non-auto  inventories to be a neutral factor in the current quarter after subtracting a percentage  point from growth last quarter     Your next exhibit begins to lay out our answer to the second question I raised   initially “How do we get from here to there?”  In the first half of 2003, when GDP is  projected to rise at a 2¾ percent rate, the answer is essentially the mirror image of the  one for the fourth quarter of this year—an absence of drag from motor vehicles and  inventories coupled with continued gains in final demand  Indeed, we already may be  seeing the start of this outcome  Factory production excluding motor vehicles ticked  up in December, and most reports from purchasing managers have been upbeat of  late  In our projection, activity steps up sharply after midyear and remains well above  the growth rate of potential through the end of the forecast period  With output  increasing faster than potential, the unemployment rate begins to fall later this year   Even so, enough slack remains in the economy to result in a further deceleration in  consumer prices  The acceleration of GDP after midyear reflects several factors,  some of which are highlighted in the middle panel  As shown in the first bullet, we  assume that the cloud of uncertainty and pessimism hanging over the business sector  will begin to lift as we go through the year  In addition, strong gains in structural  productivity boost real incomes and spending  As regards monetary policy, the  stimulus associated with past easings, as well as an assumed accommodative policy in  the projection period, provides significant forward momentum  Finally, we expect  new doses of fiscal stimulus to be injected into the economy in mid-2003 and the  beginning of next year     The fiscal package we’ve assumed involves bringing forward in time several tax   cuts that currently are scheduled to be phased in between 2004 and 2010— specifically, an increase in the child tax credit, an expansion of the 10 percent tax  bracket, marginal rate reductions, and marriage penalty relief  We have not included  the Administration’s dividend exclusion proposal in our baseline assumptions  The  bottom left panel shows our fiscal impetus indicator, which is a measure of the initial  impulse to aggregate demand arising from discretionary changes in federal spending  and taxes  The red line shows the amount of fiscal stimulus in the pipeline under  current tax law  The shaded area illustrates the extra stimulus that results from our   January 28-29, 2003 71 of 195    assumption that future tax cuts will be accelerated  The panel on the bottom right  uses simulations of the FRB/US model to estimate the direct and indirect effects of  our fiscal assumption on the growth rate of GDP as well as the effects of adding in  the dividend exclusion proposal  The solid gray portion of the bars indicates our  estimate of what GDP growth would be if the Congress made no changes to current  tax law  This corresponds to the “political gridlock” scenario shown in the  Greenbook  As you can see, even in the absence of another shot of fiscal stimulus,  we would still expect the economy to grow smartly in 2003 and 2004  The red  shaded area highlights the effects of our assumed acceleration of future tax cuts,  while the yellow portion adds in an estimate of the effects of adopting the dividend  exclusion proposal  As discussed in the memo sent to the Committee last Friday,  there are a number of very thorny issues related to the economic effects of cutting the  tax on dividends that are not settled in the economics literature  Accordingly, the  simulation results have a very wide confidence band     Much of the stimulus from monetary and fiscal policy manifests itself in the   household sector, the subject of your next exhibit  Consumer spending (the blue bars  in the top left panel) was well maintained last year, spurred in part by low interest  rates and the tax-cut-related jump in real disposable income (the yellow bars)   Looking forward, we expect that the strong gains in structural productivity and the tax  cuts assumed to come on line this year and next will support DPI growth through the  projection period  In addition, we assume that there will be no further deterioration in  net worth relative to income over the projection period, as shown in the panel to the  right  The middle left table provides a parsing of these effects on the growth rate of  real PCE  A step-up in the growth of structural productivity boosts the contribution  from potential GDP (line 2); this is augmented by the stimulative influence of the tax  cuts (line 3) and some waning of the negative wealth effects (line 4)  One risk to the  outlook for consumer spending that has been raised by some analysts is the possibility  that households are overextended and are unusually vulnerable to unanticipated  disruptions to income  As shown in the insert in the middle right panel, household  debt growth is projected to step down from the rapid pace in 2002, reflecting a  moderation in the pace of mortgage borrowing (the yellow bars)     Nonetheless, the growth of household debt continues to exceed the rise in nominal   income, continuing the upward trend in the overall debt–income ratio (line 1 in the  bottom left table)  However, we don’t see this increase in debt burden as likely to  impose serious restraint on consumer spending  In part this is because the rise in debt  burdens is heavily concentrated at the upper decile of the income distribution— households with incomes above $108,000 in 2001, according to the Survey of  Consumer Finances  As shown on line 2, the staff estimates that between 1995 and  2002 the debt–income ratio for the lower 90 percent rose 9 points, compared with the  30 point increase for the top decile (line 3)  Thus the bulk of the rise in debt ratios  has been concentrated among households with the means to service these obligations   Moreover, as shown in the bottom right panel, low interest rates have helped keep  required consumer payments broadly defined—that is, mortgage debt service as well   January 28-29, 2003 72 of 195    as required household payments for property taxes, home insurance, tenant rent,  motor vehicle leases and consumer credit—below previous peaks     Your next exhibit focuses on the business sector  As shown in the top left panel,   we expect real investment in high-tech equipment and software to accelerate over the  projection period, with an increase of more than 20 percent during 2004—about in  line with the gains observed during the last half of the 1990s  The recovery in  spending for other equipment, excluding transportation, shown in the top right panel,  is more drawn out; but we think that eventually it, too, will begin posting robust  gains, boosted in part by the partial-expensing provision enacted last spring  More  generally, the pickups for both high-tech and other equipment reflect our assumed  lifting of business gloom as well as the direct and indirect effects of monetary and  fiscal policy     In light of the dismal performance of the equipment sector in recent years, you   would be justified in being somewhat skeptical that such a strong recovery will occur  any time soon—even with the favorable cost of capital and tax incentives  The  middle two panels will, I hope, go some way toward persuading you of the  reasonableness of our forecast  The charts translate the level of real gross investment  into the growth rate of the net capital stock using the same depreciation rates that the  BEA uses in constructing the national accounts  You can see that, even though gross  investment is rising rapidly, projected capital stock growth is rather conservative by  historical standards  Not only do we think that the investment forecast in reasonable,  we also think that, in the current financial environment, it is achievable  As shown in  the bottom left panel, firms have taken advantage of low interest rates to restructure  their balance sheets away from short-term debt, lightening their current repayment  obligations  Moreover, as was discussed yesterday, corporate bond spreads have  come in recently (the bottom right panel), and bank financing (not shown) appears to  be readily available for creditworthy firms     As I said near the beginning of my remarks, a key element in helping the   economy get from here to there is the strong growth of structural productivity that we  continue to assume, which Sandy will now discuss       The final chart presents your forecasts for 2003  You have   revised down your projection for the growth of real GDP and raised your forecast of  the unemployment rate  Your projection for PCE prices this year has been lowered a  touch  That concludes our prepared remarks, Mr Chairman  We’d be happy to take  any questions       It’s in there through the way we calculate the capital services part of the   capital deepening       Well, I think that was many years ago, and that’s because we used   capital stock growth rather than capital services and we would then make the adjustment for   changes in composition  But when we shifted over to using capital services, which incorporates   that effect, we no longer showed that separately     Yes, we may have to send something to you on that later   January 28-29, 2003 84 of 195      Well, the simplest answer is that empirically we’ve never actually been   able to find a relationship between debt burdens and consumer spending at the aggregate level    January 28-29, 2003 96 of 195    We attempt to look at some of these data at a more disaggregated level, and the bottom left panel   is one way of trying to do that  As I pointed out earlier, the debt burden levels are far higher for   the upper-income consumer; much of the action has occurred in the upper decile, where we think   there’s a large cushion to protect against income disruptions   We also looked at the Survey of Consumer Finances to see, for example, if there had   been any changes between the 1998 survey and the 2001 survey in the data on the households   that are late making their payments  At the aggregate level we didn’t see any real change in   payment problems  We did see an increase, however—and this perhaps goes to your question—  in difficulties in making payments for the lower-income, low-wealth, younger households  I   think the category was those under the age of 35, which to me is quite young So, there are   clearly households for which this is a problem, but we don’t have the sense that it is going to be a   widespread problem  As I said, empirically we don’t see evidence—in the aggregate anyway—  that debt burden matters for PCE  It may well be that it does  We just can’t find a relationship     I’ll start, and others can join in  First, let me make a brief comment on   our forecast versus those of many outsiders  It’s hard to know exactly, but I think one of the   main differences between our forecast and many of the outside forecasts—especially when we’re   talking about 2004—is our productivity assumption  We clearly have a stronger assumption and   that feeds through in a variety of ways       Let me go through a couple of the other issues you raised and try to   address some of them  The main question you asked was, in effect, where are the upside risks in   this forecast  If I were to go through the upside risks, an important one would be capital   January 28-29, 2003 100 of 195    spending  The point of chart 4 on capital spending was to show that it would actually by itself be   considered fairly conservative in terms of what we have the growth of capital stock doing  There   is a lot of potential there on the upside if businesses really were to become convinced that a   strong recovery was in place and they felt comfortable about the outlook going forward  The   rates of return on investment seem to be high; certainly that’s consistent with our productivity   forecast being very high  They’re related, but my point is that it doesn’t require just that   productivity assumption to get the possibility of a strong upside on capital spending if this   pessimism lifts     Granted  But you’re asking for the upside risks, and I’m just saying   that I think there is some upside risk there      It certainly could be stronger, and that would be an important risk I   would point to  Is there a possibility that we’ve been low-balling productivity growth?  Perhaps    I wouldn’t put a lot of weight on that one  As for the stimulus associated with past changes in   monetary policy, we still have some stimulus in train  I forget the exact numbers, but I think it’s   in the range of something like ½ percentage point increments going forward for a while before it   finally peters out  As you know, our fiscal policy assumption is just that—an assumption  I   don’t know what more to say about that in terms of upside or downside risks    Now, let me briefly comment on the state and local government situation, if I may  That   clearly is a possible source of restraint in the forecast, and we have built fiscal restraint into this   forecast from the state and local sector  We’ve built it in both by lowering the growth of state   January 28-29, 2003 101 of 195    and local government spending to the levels we were seeing in the 1990s—the last time they   went through difficulties—and by making adjustments on the tax side as well in their revenue   streams  So we’ve actually put in a dose of fiscal restraint from that sector, recognizing exactly   the problems that you’ve highlighted  I think Dave Stockton has some comments that he wanted   to make as well    "
7151,2003-05-06,"  I don’t think so  We’ll look into that issue       I don’t have a good answer for you  We’ll have to look into it   May 6, 2003 23 of 115   "
7537,2004-01-27,"4    We’ll have an upward revision to Q1 and probably a downward   revision to Q4     Well, the one other thing that I would note, as we pointed out in the   Greenbook as well, is that the level of new orders has been running above the level of shipments,   implying an increase in unfilled orders for some time now for the “all other” category  So, again,   we take that to be a favorable sign  Shall we get started with the chart show now?   5       For the chart show, Sandy Struckmeyer, Steve Kamin, and I  will be referring to the packet of materials that was distributed to you  While putting  together the Greenbook, two of the questions we asked ourselves were, first, “Where  is the economy now?” and, second, “What are the forces that should sustain above- potential growth over the next two years?”   With regard to what is sometimes called “forecasting the present,” your first  exhibit shows a variety of indicators that have informed our judgments  The top left  panel plots average monthly changes in private payrolls  Like most observers, we  were disappointed by the payroll employment report for December  However, that  reading came on the heels of more-favorable reports for the preceding two months   Averaging through the monthly ups and downs, as I’ve done in the bars on your chart,  you can see that, after a protracted period of job losses, employment has been on an  uptrend since midyear, albeit a weaker one than is typical for this stage of the  business cycle     In contrast to the payroll numbers, most indicators of final demand have been   quite favorable  Sales of autos and light trucks (the top right panel) and other  consumer goods (the middle left panel) point to continued strength of household  demand, while the orders and shipments figures (the middle right panel), which here  are plotted only through November, tell a similar story for business demand  And as I   5 The materials used by Messrs Slifman, Struckmeyer, and Kamin are appended to this transcript (appendix 5)   January 27-28, 2004 94 of 238    mentioned earlier, this morning’s orders and shipments release provided further  confirmation of an ongoing pickup in business spending     Thus, in putting together our near-term GDP forecast, we once again were faced   with a tension between lackluster payroll employment numbers and pretty stellar  incoming data for final sales and production  And, once again, we’ve resolved that  tension by writing down sizable increases in productivity (the bottom left panel)   Sandy will be discussing productivity in greater detail later  The table at the bottom  right adds it all up  We now estimate that real GDP grew at a 48 percent annual rate  in the fourth quarter of 2003 and will expand at a 5 percent pace in the current  quarter  The bulk of the increase in GDP over this two-quarter period comes from  robust gains in final sales; but with stock–sales ratios so low, inventory investment is  expected to make a noticeable contribution as well  Let me note that this exhibit  reflects the figures that were in the Greenbook—before we got the data on shipments  and orders this morning  So perhaps we might take a tenth or two off Q4 and add a  tenth or two to Q1      Turning to the outlook for the next two years, the subject of exhibit 2, the   question is, “Will the current rapid growth be sustained and why?”  As you can see  from the top panel, we think that economic growth will be sustained at rates faster  than potential through the end of 2005  The remaining panels highlight some of the  key contributing forces  Fiscal policy has been quite expansionary in recent years,  and as can be seen in the middle left panel, we expect it to provide additional impetus  to growth through the end of this year  However, on our assumptions, fiscal policy  swings to slight restraint in 2005 as the partial-expensing provision expires and the  growth of defense spending slows  Monetary policy also has been quite supportive of  growth over the past few years  And with the funds rates projected to remain  relatively low over the forecast period, it will continue to be so  Another factor with  favorable implications for growth is the ongoing strength of productivity gains, which  should influence household perceptions of permanent income and business  perceptions of profitability  Given the surge of earnings lately, firms have been able  to finance their desired spending while keeping a tight lid on their borrowing  Indeed,  as shown in the bottom left panel, debt ratios have fallen sharply in recent years and  are now either at or near the lowest levels in the past two decades  With the marked  improvement in business financial conditions, risk spreads—as Dino noted  yesterday—have dropped dramatically on both investment-grade and junk bonds   Returning to the top right panel, the stock market is assumed to rise at a 6¼ percent  annual rate over the projection period—maintaining risk-adjusted parity with the  projected yield on long-term Treasury securities  In our forecast, we see the higher  stock market as providing some support to household spending after several years in  which it was a considerable drag     Your next exhibit focuses in greater detail on the household sector  Personal   income (the dark bars in the top left panel) is expected to rise smartly over the next  two years, supported in part, as I mentioned earlier, by the strength of productivity   The strong income growth provides a considerable lift to consumption outlays (the   January 27-28, 2004 95 of 238    yellow bars)  In addition, last year’s tax cut continues to boost spending in 2004   The top right panel shows the implications of the PCE and income projections for the  saving rate  As indicated by the thick line, the BEA currently estimates that the  saving rate was only 23 percent in the third quarter of last year, and we think it fell  another ½ percentage point in the fourth quarter  In our forecast, the saving rate  climbs about a percentage point over the projection period     One risk to the household sector forecast is that the saving rate might rise more   than we have allowed for in the baseline  The bullets in the middle panel present our  thinking on this issue  The first thing to note is that the BEA, in effect, shifted the  goal posts in its most recent comprehensive revision, by taking the level of the saving  rate down on average over the past decade about a percentage point  This suggested  to us that we ought to revise down our thinking about what constitutes a “normal” or  “target” saving rate by a like amount  Considerable econometric work suggested the  same  That said, the current saving rate still is well below the level that many  observers often think of as a more normal rate  It’s important to keep in mind,  however, that the target saving rate is a moving target  It varies over time as the  fundamental determinants, such as the wealth–income ratio, the composition of  income, and real interest rates, change  Indeed, we read the current settings of those  fundamentals as pointing to a target saving rate for the next year or two in the  neighborhood of 3 percent  In our projection, the saving rate rises to 28 percent by  the fourth quarter of 2005, eliminating the bulk—but not all—of the gap between  actual and target saving  We’re not sure what accounts for the gap that we’re seeing  currently, but departures from our saving models of this magnitude are not unusual   Historically, disequilibriums like this have been worked off fairly gradually, but a  more sudden and complete adjustment, and a consequent drag on aggregate demand,  certainly is a risk     The forecast for housing starts is presented in the bottom left panel  The pace of   homebuilding, fueled by low mortgage rates and robust income growth, is anticipated  to remain strong over the projection period, edging down only a bit from the current  elevated pace as mortgage rates drift up a bit  The bottom right panel shows our  projection of house prices  In our forecast, house prices slow from the 7 to 8 percent  gains posted in recent years, to about 2½ percent during 2005  The downtilt primarily  reflects the current disparity between rapid house-price inflation and much smaller  increases in the data for rents  The econometric evidence suggests that such a  disparity typically is closed by house-price increases moving into alignment with  rents  Of course, there is a wide band of uncertainty around this forecast, which  imparts a wide band of uncertainty—both upside and downside—to movements in  household net worth over the next two years, with consequent implications for  household spending     Turning to the business sector, exhibit 4, we expect real outlays for equipment   and software—both the high-tech component and the “other” component—to rise  rapidly this year, spurred in part by the temporary tax incentive  Indeed, the partial- expensing provision adds about 2½ percentage points to overall E&S growth this year   January 27-28, 2004 96 of 238    and subtracts close to 6 percentage points next year  The basic contour of the forecast  is consistent with the information given recently to the Reserve Banks by businesses  in their Districts  As shown in the middle left panel, slightly more than half of the  respondents plan to boost their capital spending in 2004—the responses are  appreciably more upbeat than those in June  Although the usual accelerator effects  were the primary reason given for the improvement, a sizable fraction of respondents  also pointed to replacement needs as an important consideration  Moreover, partial  expensing finally appears to be on the radar screens of at least some firms  A quarter  of the respondents also cited improved cash flow or balance sheet positions, reflecting  no doubt strong profits and, presumably, the expected profitability of new  investments  As shown to the right, in our forecast the profit share continues to rise  through mid-2004 before drifting down as labor costs accelerate and competition puts  pressure on margins  Nonetheless, even through the end of next year, profits are still  elevated by historical standards     An important element of our capital spending forecast is strong demand for   computers  In part, our forecast for computer spending has been informed by the  projections of industry analysts for unit sales of PCs—both so-called desktop boxes  (which typically sit on the floor) and laptops (which often sit on desks)  [Laughter]   The bottom left panel shows one such forecast from a leading consulting group  As  you can see, unit sales are expected to rise sharply throughout the projection period,  driven by the need to replace machines that have become physically or  technologically obsolete  After adding in the effects of quality change, these unit  sales translate into real spending increases on the order of 40 percent annually over  the next two years—roughly in line with the increases posted during the second half  of the 1990s  One concern that has been raised in many circles is the implication for  the domestic economy of outsourcing computer production—that is, whether today’s  boxes contain considerably less domestic content than the boxes sold a few years ago   The bottom right panel addresses this question  It uses cost shares to measure the  domestic content of PCs sold in the United States  Most of the domestic value-added  in a PC is for the micro-processing unit—the Pentium or similar chip that lies at the  heart of our PCs  This is shown by the black shaded portion of the bars; smaller  contributions come from the production of specialized chips that provide basic logic  or act like traffic managers inside your PC and, to a lesser extent, from integration  and final shipment  The bulk of the foreign value-added is for such things as printed  circuit boards, storage devices, and peripherals  The point is that the United States is  still the world leader in designing leading-edge chips (a very high value-added  activity) and fabricating them (also a high value-added activity)  As a result, the  domestic content of PCs has changed relatively little over the past few years   Accordingly, the sharp rise in PC sales that we are forecasting should translate into  domestic production at about the same rate as in recent years  Steve will now turn the  discussion from domestic content to foreign content       I don’t think we have a conclusion on that  Accuracy has to be defined   as relative to what?       I understand, but I don’t have any third source of the real world against   which to compare the other two  The one thing we can perhaps do is to ask ourselves which of   the two measures, in terms of the econometrics, helps us best in transforming the data into an   understanding of consumption behavior or household behavior  Once again, I don’t think there   is a firm conclusion     Yes, and we can’t definitively say which has won over the other  In all   of our work we stay with the NIPA measure because then we are working with a consistently   measured system       Right  So that’s why we do all of our work using the NIPA data   Obviously we do look at what’s happening to household balance sheets, and the flow of funds   saving rate is a part of that household balance sheet system      It’s the flow of funds saving rate       Right     They’ve started to fall  Rather, the rate of increase is coming down      I will agree with you  [Laughter]  It is true that in our baseline forecast   we don’t see any bubbles  We’ve tried to lay out the possibility of risks and point out to you   where, if we are wrong in that judgment, bubbles could occur  For example, by our forecast   there isn’t a bubble in house prices; but if there were, we have tried to point out that that could be   a risk  So if that sector were to collapse suddenly, we have indicated the implications of that for   household balance sheets  But you are correct that in our baseline we do not have a bubble     Let me be perfectly clear about one thing  We have a couple of   different ways in which we try to make an assessment about what is happening to house prices    One of those doesn’t take into account the arbitrage condition, as it were, between house prices   January 27-28, 2004 115 of 238    and rents; it basically looks at interest rates and cyclical variables  On that basis, the expectation   would be that house prices would continue to rise quite rapidly  When one takes into account the   gap between house prices and changes in rents, that model would actually have house prices, as   Dave indicated, essentially having to flatten out and the gap coming down to zero  So what we   have done in the baseline forecast is to take a position about midway between, moving only part   of the way toward that flattening-out view of the world  And the point Dave was making is that   the flattening-out model could be the right one, so there is a chance that we could see more   house-price deceleration than we’ve forecast  We could see the change in house prices actually   flattening out for a while or perhaps—though it would be unusual—even turning negative       Yes, that model suggests that house prices could rise faster than what   we’ve put into our baseline  So we’ve tried to take a position somewhere between those two     I’m just looking at my chart, and I think it may be misplotted     Mr Chairman, unfortunately there is a charting error on chart 1in the   exhibit on nonfarm business productivity at the bottom left  I just want to point it out so that no   one is confused  Rather than plotting the quarter-to-quarter percent changes in those bars we   inadvertently plotted the percent change from four quarters earlier  So the correct numbers   should be 94 percent for the third quarter, 33 percent for the fourth quarter, and 37 percent for   the first quarter of 2004     I was using what I thought was constructive ambiguity there   [Laughter]  I’m not sure what most observers think of as the normal rate, but when one reads   Wall Street newsletters and things like that, one often sees numbers like 6 or 7 percent  I prefer   the term “target” because I think it implies what we think is actually going on in terms of our   models of consumption—that households have a target saving rate that is based on things such as   those I noted here, including the wealth ratio and real interest rates  And then it is affected by   the composition of income and, in particular, the role of transfer payments  So I prefer the target   concept; and by our reckoning, that would currently be something on the order of 3 percent or so    That is the number that I think we should be focusing on       In the extended Greenbook simulations that are presented in the   Bluebook, we have real interest rates rising out to 2010  Consistent with the baseline of that   extended forecast in the Bluebook, we would have by 2010 a target saving rate on the order of   6 percent  But that’s not what we should be thinking about for 2004-05     Absolutely  And as I pointed out, that 28 percent saving rate that   we’ve written down for the end of 2005 still is a bit below target, so we could clearly get a more   complete correction to target and maybe even some movement above that target  "
7975,2005-02-01,"3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  We’ll be referring to the package of materials  entitled “Staff Presentation on the Economic Outlook”   As you know from reading the Greenbook, the only material change in our  forecast since the December FOMC meeting concerns prospects for the near term   So, after briefly reviewing some of the recent high-frequency indicators, I’ll focus  my discussion on the fundamental forces that we see driving economic activity over  the next two years   With regard to the very near-term outlook, your first chart shows a variety of  data series that have informed our judgments  The upper panels highlight two  “production side” indicators As illustrated in the upper left, private nonfarm payroll  employment rose 181,000 per month, on average, in the fourth quarter, a noticeable  pickup from the third-quarter pace  In addition, the Board’s index of industrial  production continued to show above-trend gains in manufacturing sector activity   Most forward-looking indicators of production, such as the regional business surveys  conducted by the Reserve Banks and the ISM [Institute for Supply Management]  manufacturing report that was released yesterday, also point to continued near-term  gains, although perhaps not as robust as late last year   The data on private final sales also look quite favorable Real PCE excluding  motor vehicles (the middle left panel) rose rapidly in the fourth quarter, and motor  vehicles (the panel to the right) continue to sell at a brisk pace After the Greenbook  was published, we received information on orders and shipments for nondefense  capital goods As shown by the inset box in the lower left panel, shipments  excluding aircraft rose 22 percent and orders advanced 18 percent in December   These figures were about in line with our expectations All told, our estimate of  fourth-quarter real GDP growth, shown on line 1 of the table, was fairly close to  BEA’s [Bureau of Economic Analysis]—especially after BEA factors in an error in  the Canadian trade statistics that apparently depressed estimated US exports  Karen  will have more to say about the Canadian numbers shortly  In any event, we see no  reason to alter our first-quarter forecast as a result of the BEA’s fourth-quarter GDP  estimate   Your next chart presents an overview of the forecast As described in the  first bullet of the upper panel, our forecast is predicated on a continuing withdrawal   3 The materials used by Messrs Slifman and Struckmeyer, and Ms Johnson are appended to this transcript  (appendix 3)                          February 1-2, 2005 69 of 177  of monetary accommodation over the next two years, with the federal funds rate  reaching 3 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and 3½ percent in the latter part  of 2006—a path quite similar to that implied by futures quotes  Regarding fiscal  policy, we’ve reduced our deficit projection for fiscal year 2005 more than $20  billion, primarily reflecting stronger incoming data on corporate tax receipts; the  deficit in 2006 is unchanged from the previous Greenbook  But the change to our  deficit estimate has virtually no effect on our preferred indicator of fiscal stimulus,  FI, which is designed to capture the macroeconomic effects of exogenous policy  changes FI is expected to be neutral in 2005 and to provide only a small positive  impetus to GDP growth in 2006   Although oil prices have moved higher in recent weeks, the futures market  continues to see the likely path as pointing downward from here forward, and, as  usual, we have conditioned the forecast on their views Karen and I will both have  more to say about oil prices  And, as Karen will discuss, the staff expects the foreign  exchange value of the dollar to drift down As for asset values, stock prices are  assumed to rise 6½ percent this year and next, which would roughly maintain risk- adjusted parity with the yield on long-term bonds, while the rate of increase in house  prices is expected to slow considerably from last year’s torrid pace   As shown in the bottom panel, real GDP is projected to rise at a 3¾ percent  rate, on average, over the projection period, about half a percentage point faster than  our estimate of potential GDP growth  Spending on private consumption and fixed  investment (line 2) is the main contributor to GDP growth, although some of the  growth in that demand is expected to be satisfied by foreign producers (line 3)   Domestic production is also boosted by export demand and government purchases  (lines 4 and 5), while inventory investment is roughly neutral   Exhibit 3 examines the forces that we think will be working to produce two  more years of above-potential growth  Monetary policy continues to be an important  factor As shown in the middle left panel, even with the assumed policy tightening  over the next two years, the real funds rate is projected to remain below its long-run  average and on the stimulative side of the short-run measures of r* shown in the  Bluebook   Returning to the bullets, other financial market conditions also are expected  to be supportive Nominal long-term rates (not plotted) have been well-anchored and  are projected to be little changed over the projection period, despite the assumed rise  in short-term rates  Moreover, corporate balance sheets are quite strong Cash is  abundant, and the combination of aggressive deleveraging, debt restructuring, and  low interest rates has brought interest expenses relative to cash flow (the middle right  panel) down to very low levels Reflecting these developments, defaults,  delinquencies, and risk spreads are quite low, and, as shown in the lower left panel,  banks continue to ease lending standards                            February 1-2, 2005 70 of 177  As I noted earlier, after the rapid run-up last year, we expect oil prices to drift  down over the next two years, which should be a small plus for domestic spending  power and GDP growth Turning to the final bullet in the upper panel, we estimate  that the higher oil prices in 2004 reduced GDP growth by three-fourths of a  percentage point last year In our forecast, the negative effects wane to a quarter of a  percentage point in 2005 as oil prices begin to recede; the projected decline in oil  prices then boosts GDP growth a couple of tenths in 2006   Exhibit 4 focuses on the household sector Consumption outlays (the blue  bars in the upper left panel) grow at a 3¾ percent rate this year and next, a shade less  than in 2004 We expect income growth (the red bars) to step up as the labor market  strengthens Moreover, household financial positions—as summarized by the  financial obligations ratio, to the right—seem solid  However, the downdrift in  household net worth relative to income that we project in the baseline forecast, and  depicted by the black line in the middle left panel, imparts a slight drag on spending  In addition, the strength of consumer spending last year pushed the saving rate (not  shown) to an unusually low level, and, as a consequence, consumer spending also is  expected to be restrained a bit during the forecast period by a desire on the part of  households to rebuild savings   One risk to the forecast that we discussed in the Greenbook is the possibility  of a real estate slump  In the Greenbook alternative simulation, depicted by the red  line in the middle right panel, we assumed that house prices fall a little more than 10  percent cumulatively over the next two years, leaving the level 20 percent below the  baseline Such an outcome, especially if accompanied by a drop in consumer  confidence, would restrain PCE and GDP growth appreciably over the next two  years But, even with the implied loss of household wealth, the ratio of net worth to  income that comes out of the alternative simulation (the red line in the middle left  panel) is still quite high by historical standards Accordingly, we don’t see this  scenario as causing a serious debilitation of household sector financial health, on the  whole   In the housing market, the lower panels, annual single-family starts are  projected to remain close to the 16 million unit mark over the next two years   Favorable mortgage rates are expected to provide ongoing support to housing  activity in our forecast And, as with consumer spending, solid income gains also  support housing demand   Your next chart looks at business investment  Outlays for high-tech  equipment, the red bars in the upper left, are the major source of growth in this  sector, reflecting an ongoing need by firms to replace and upgrade their equipment  and software Spending on non-high-tech equipment, the blue bars, grew briskly in  2004, spurred, in part, we think by partial expensing After the anticipated “pothole”  in the first quarter of this year, we expect that real outlays for non-high-tech  equipment will increase at around a 4½ percent rate—roughly in line with their                          February 1-2, 2005 71 of 177  longer-run average Demand is supported, in part, by a shrinking margin of unused  capacity over the next two years, as depicted in the panel to the right However, as  shown in the middle left panel, the rate of return on capital is projected to ebb over  the next two years, which tempers our forecast slightly   We interpret the results of the special questions on capital spending asked by  the staffs at the Reserve Banks—summarized in the table to the right—as being  broadly consistent with our view that this will be a pretty good year, on balance, for  business equipment investment, although probably not quite as brisk as in 2004  The  usual accelerator effects were the primary reason given by survey respondents for  boosting capital spending this year; additionally, a sizable fraction of respondents  pointed to replacement needs as an important consideration   The remainder of the chart highlights two of the risks to the forecast for  equipment spending  An upside risk that we highlighted in the Greenbook is the  possibility that we have been wrong about the effects of partial expensing If so, the  alternative simulation of FRB/US, shown by the blue bars in the lower left panel,   suggests that equipment and software spending could increase considerably faster  than in the baseline   One downside risk to the forecast for high-tech equipment, which Governor  Ferguson noted in a speech recently, is the possibility that the pace of technical  advancement in computers is slowing  As you know, the speed at which quality- adjusted computer prices fall is a rough indicator of the pace of technological  progress for that equipment  The constant-quality price index for desktop computers  that we use for constructing industrial production is shown in the lower right panel  The price declines are decomposed into declines that we attribute to improvements in  production processes—for example, Michael Dell figuring out better ways to  assemble boxes—and the price declines that we attribute to technological  improvements—for instance, Intel designing better chips to go inside the boxes  As  you can see from the red portion of the bars, this decomposition suggests that the rate  of technological improvement for computers has slowed appreciably  A further  slowing in the pace of innovation going forward would imply less spending for  upgrades than is implicit in our forecast  However, recent announcements by Intel  and AMD regarding introduction schedules for their next-generation chips give a  hint that a return to a faster pace of technological improvements may be in train  If  this speed-up in planned improvements to semiconductors is, in fact, realized, that  should translate into faster technological progress for computers   Sandy will now continue our presentation  "
