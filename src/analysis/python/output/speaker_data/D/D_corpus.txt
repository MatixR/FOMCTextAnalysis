 LINDSEY Thank you, Mr Chairman   LINDSEY Thank you again, Mr Chairman [Statement-- see Appendix]   LINDSEY I agree with Peter's comments   LINDSEY I personally started out with that view last week and early this week And I thought particularly that if the Committee were to go down 1/4 point, that is what is expected and it could be done in [the midst of] an auction But after talking to Peter, who yesterday read me a litany of commentators saying it's inconceivable that the Federal Reserve would move during the auction I said "Peter, I realize that's a common view, but is it right?" I was resisting even then I did finally come around to the thought that it would be better not to mix this policy change with the middle of that bidding process So, as I said before, I personally come down    11/5/91  with Peter on this one After having thought about it, I realize there are two sides and I've been on both!   LINDSEY Well, let's say that the 1/4 point isn't fully built in Let's say we announce tomorrow and there's a little decline in the yields in the 3-year note To the extent that there is some market reaction, those who went short on the 3-year are going to be hurt and we're going to hear from them There are going to be complaints I think they'll complain more if we move tomorrow than if we move on Friday in the sense that they're going into their bidding on the 3-year note pretty sure that we are going to move on Friday So, they're not as likely to write irate letters even if yields move against them So, there are people who potentially are damaged I should probably let Peter--    LINDSEY I think it goes up to 1988 now    LINDSEY I'm going to argue in my presentation, though, that there is a feedback effect from the lower interest rates, particularly in real terms--that the future strength of the economy and the fiscal reductions in the out years did in the markets' mind shift back aggregate demand for constant real rates such that the ensuing real rate declines helped to mitigate those fears, giving investors a sense that the economy could continue growing at more or less a moderate pace I also think, going back several years, that clearly the decline in inflation expectations has played a role as well   LINDSEY Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   LINDSEY Oh well, I'll fill in for Don I do think the alternative sentence that we gave for the directive concedes that the meaning of that table for policy implementation is not what it used to be when M2 relative to the Committee's expectations truly was a factor in decisions to alter the degree of pressure on reserve positions or the federal funds rate It was not the only consideration but it was an important one in a way that one can't say is still the case today So in that sense I think your insight is a correct one The next question you also asked is Okay, what other intermediate target variable then do we use as a substitute for M2? If I knew of one, I'd supply it But I'm not sure there is a unique alternative intermediate target that could play that role, at least  -38-    3/23/93  for a time Down the road I think there's a chance that M2 or some other, possibly redefined, aggregate might show itself worthy of reasserting that kind of role But I can't say that I can offer one today for you   LINDSEY Well, let me take a minute to answer that question because it is complicated First of all, the answer depends on the lag that you look at Here we're simply going out four months to midyear There I think the evidence is pretty clear that we've got the sign right Around the ends of the two prior years the System eased and we got big increases in money growth in February of the succeeding years Indeed, it was such a large effect that we're now saying we think X-11 distorted our seasonal factors So, I think over the short run, given the lags and how quickly deposit rates adjust downward, there clearly is an effect from the narrowing of the opportunity costs and inflows particularly into liquid accounts So in answer to that part of your question I would say I'm confident of the signs for these near-term effects It gets tougher as you go out for a year You'll recall in the February Bluebook that we put together simulations that did show that a decline in the federal funds rate would tend to increase the rate of M2 growth over a year's time You, I recall, asked Don if he thought that was reasonable and his answer was--I'm paraphrasing it--that it's questionable in the sense that we had to make the intermediate-term rate adjust down faster in response to a funds rate [decline] than is standard in the quarterly model in order to get a result like that If you allow the intermediate rate to come down with the speed that we did in that simulation then, yes, M2 will increase We used the Feinman/Porter model for that simulation; that's the result we got It is interesting, as Governor Angell pointed out at that meeting, that nominal GDP [growth] was more responsive to the decline in the funds rate than was M2 In other words velocity in that simulation tended to rise when we lowered the funds rate Nevertheless, that simulation was based on the Feinman/Porter model with an extraneous assumption about how long rates react to movements in short rates Finally, and I'll try to keep this very short, my own view is quite different from the Feinman/Porter model My own view is that that model attributes too much to interest rate spreads and attributes, therefore, too little effect to reductions in short rates over time; it has a very small interest elasticity because there are certain variables that it doesn't embody at all And it seems to me that those variables were at work over that period pushing M2 down at the same time our easing moves were tending to support M2 In my view, the model doesn't fully appreciate the support that we were giving to M2 through our easings because it isn't quite rich enough to capture the omitted variables  -39-    3/23/93  So, my own personal answer to your question is Yes, even over a year's time, there is an appreciable interest sensitivity to M2    LINDSEY Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   LINDSEY We have attempted to construct an M2 plus mutual funds We've tried to define the bond and stock mutual fund component of that aggregate as consistent with M2 by pulling out the IRA/Keogh components of bond and stock funds and also institutional holdings, which unfortunately are reported to us only once a year We, therefore, have had to interpolate The most recent data we have for this measure are through March They show that whereas M2 has fallen since December, M2 plus mutual funds was about flat in January and February before jumping up to a 67 percent rate of growth in March As you may remember, M2 growth for all of last year was 18 percent and growth of this broader measure was about 4-1/2 percent or so   LINDSEY Well, they are not absolute but our guess was that banks would tend more or less as a knee-jerk reaction to maintain the spread, given the opportunity Presumably, at some point those spreads would come down but I'm not sure it would be tomorrow if the FOMC decides to move up the funds rate   LINDSEY The problem is that there are a lot of other things going on If you held everything else equal and affected borrowing by $200 million, that would have a big effect   LINDSEY Oh, my goodness! [Laughter] You're approaching zero or near double-digits, I think, with that kind of change Maybe that's slightly exaggerated   LINDSEY Well, around current levels, [we estimate that a change of] $25 million in the borrowing level will have a 50 basis point effect So, you're talking almost 10 times that much    LINDSEY This is Dave Lindsey But part of the proposal is explaining to Justice that we plan to put in place an orderly process for releasing the substance of the material, in other    10/22/93 -5-  words, the Memoranda of Discussion idea That's part of your proposal   LINDSEY Well, this is Dave Lindsey again I guess part of Virgil's premise is that it may be difficult to protect those raw transcripts and, therefore, they may get out absent this fallback position of going forward with the process of an orderly release of Memoranda of Discussion    LINDSEY Mr Chairman, the broader monetary aggregates appear to be weaker than we thought on the afternoon of the policy tightening when we tried to build in those effects M2 appears to be declining at about a 1/2 percent annual rate in February The falloff in mortgage prepayments this year is, we think, deducting some 2 percentage points from February M2 growth after boosting that growth late last year In light of M2's growth of 2-1/4 percent in January, from the fourth quarter through February, M2 has expanded at a 1-1/2 percent annual rate, quite close to its pace last year and quite close to the pace we estimated, abstracting from the various special factors influencing it M3 is weaker still in February than M2, declining at about a 6-1/4 percent annual rate after growing 1 percent in January From the fourth quarter to February, M3 is declining at a 1/2 percent annual rate Sharp declines in the money market mutual funds component of M3, however, explain virtually all of its decline in February Bank credit is continuing to expand in February, in fact a little faster than in January--about 5 percent in February following 3 percent in January But there is an artificial upward boost to both months' growth rates in bank credit coming from an accounting change that is boosting the "other securities component," non US government securities So, if anything, since bank credit grew 5 percent over all of last year, in an underlying sense it seems to be slowing some this year The recent weakness in bank credit so far this year reflects runoffs in US government securities and a flattening of    2/28/94  real estate loans after they showed pretty strong increases late last year Business loans were quite strong in January but their growth apparently is slowing in February My February interpretations for bank credit are still somewhat preliminary, as some of the month is still projected    LINDSEY Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the Bluebook, starting with the table on page 11 [Statement--see Appendix]   LINDSEY I don't think the market's view is very different from that of the Board staff regarding the reliability of forecasts of velocity Market participants have not been focusing on the monetary aggregates They essentially have accepted the FOMC's analysis that in the 1990s there has been a heightened degree of uncertainty regarding velocity behavior So, I don't think they would change their view of whether velocity was predictable or not if the Committee were to raise the ranges The wording of the Committee's report and the Chairman's testimony surrounding this decision could attempt to disabuse them of the notion that we felt there was any greater reliability to velocity forecasts than previously Judging at least from the experience to date for which they have accepted our analysis, we might have a chance of persuading them   LINDSEY It turns out that in 1990, when the process of very slow growth of the broader aggregates began and M2 velocity started on its upward march, we were a bit slow in catching up But subsequently, despite the uncertainty, we were not too inaccurate I vividly remember briefing this Committee in May 1993 with a projection of 1-1/4 percent for M2 growth through that year Perhaps luckily, M2 ended up growing that year at 1-1/4 percent I also know that last year we were quite--   LINDSEY The transcript of this will be out in five years and I will be vindicated! [Laughter]   LINDSEY That's right We are revising M2 and that alters the comparison For 1995, M2 growth and nominal GDP growth came in almost exactly where we predicted six months ago when the Committee last visited this issue, and that involved a judgmental  -30-    1/30-31/96  adjustment on our part to a model forecast that was predicting much slower M2 growth, a forecast that we essentially did not believe This year we are closer to the model forecast in predicting M2 growth of 5-1/4 percent, but we have been influenced a bit by the slope of the yield curve In a way, our judgmental forecasts have been better than one might have expected, but I wouldn't say that that would necessarily argue for upgrading the role of money as an intermediate target, or even as an information variable   LINDSEY I wouldn't deny that there is a significant range of uncertainty around our forecast even if the Greenbook gets the pattern of the macroeconomy more or less correct I wouldn't want to assert that there is not a pretty big range of uncertainty that the Committee ought to take into account But, as we tried to argue in the Bluebook, it seemed to us that any of the alternative ranges could be justified and a reasonable case constructed even on the assumption that the aggregates were not being upgraded    LINDSEY Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   LINDSEY A quarter point increase for the next four FOMC meetings, so an upward adjustment of 100 basis points by year- end   LINDSEY Yes, I looked at the chart that I got from him yesterday We have done a little work on MZM That chart and our earlier work do not show anything like the breakdown in the velocity/ opportunity cost relationship that has occurred for M2 in the 1990s On the other hand, judging by that chart and the econometric work we have done, MZM has a rather substantial sensitivity to movements in short-term interest rates and thus opportunity costs Therefore, it does not recommend itself as an intermediate guide to policy The example I like to think of in this regard is that if nominal spending starts to drift up sufficiently to cause a problem with inflationary acceleration and the Federal Reserve tightens a little, the result could be to drive the growth rate of a very interest-sensitive aggregate back down at the same time that nominal GDP is still spurting ahead Inflation could get out of control by insufficient, gradual increases in short-term rates even though we would be keeping this interest-sensitive aggregate well within a range This is a problem that harkens back to the situation that developed with M1 after the introduction of super NOWs in the early 1980s Indeed, I think the fundamental reason why the Committee deemphasized the Ml aggregate was that it had become too interest sensitive to be of use as a normal intermediate target   LINDSEY Yes I am somewhat sympathetic to that suggestion Obviously, we do not currently target Ml; we do not currently put much weight on it Clearly, the sweep-account problem, which involves these adjustments only for the initial sweeps, is making it more and more difficult over time to have confidence in Ml, even after sweep adjustments I am a little sympathetic to that idea I will not speak for my division director, however [Laughter]    LINDSEY Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   LINDSEY I will turn to Mike Prell for answers to some of your questions about the forecast As I look at the nominal GDP numbers on a four-quarter basis starting this year, I don't see much change in the annual growth rates, which go from 47 percent this year to 45 percent in 1997 and 44 percent in 1998--actually a little deceleration I do think, though, that the question of the CPI versus the broader measures of prices is something I should probably pass on to my R&S colleagues  -28-    11/13/96
