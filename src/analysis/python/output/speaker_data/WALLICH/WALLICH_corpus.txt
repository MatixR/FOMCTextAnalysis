  Well, I’m wondering what would happen, for instance, with minority  points of view  If one member of the Committee were to hold a view totally different from  others, this presumably would have to be stated  It would also be stated that there was little  support for it, something that conveys the balance of the meeting     Well, I was thinking of a description of the arguments presented at the  meeting, not the dissent as such  Suppose one person believes the economy is contracting and  then [is] led to believe it’s expanding  He may not even dissent substantively--     I think you have two separable problems--one is that the data over the  period on the review were constrained because of the effort not to let the federal funds rate get  outside its range; that is Governor Holland’s point  The other point is that, if you had a  [non]borrowed reserves target, interest rates would in effect be more variable and you wouldn’t  be as constrained in pursuing the nonborrowed reserves target as you are now     We had several--     Mr Chairman, I think we have two ways of looking at the funds rate  here  As I understood our subcommittee’s work, the reason we’re tending to move away from it  is that the funds rate may be a very good predictor of M1, but it is a good instrument [only] if  you’re willing to move it around vigorously to get the M1 or other aggregates that we want     We treat the funds rate in two senses in one sense as an instrument and in the other as an  objective in itself as a proxy for other interest rates and something therefore that we don’t want  to move as vigorously as we may have to in order to get the [behavior of] aggregates [that we  want] In the past, this has often caused trouble  And as it causes the aggregates to run away or  to lag, the funds rate has proved to be a poor lever even though it’s an effective lever if it’s used  [aggressively]    That’s where we were going and I thought we were going probably to a less accurate  nonborrowed reserves instrument  Now if we could prevail on ourselves to treat the funds rate as  we would treat nonborrowed reserves, namely, purely as an instrument and not at all as an  objective, then I think it would be the superior thing  But we’re not able to do that for pretty  convincing reasons     I don’t see focusing on the aggregates as in any way denying that money  works through interest rates  I think that is precisely how it does work  But our question is,  should we achieve interest rates directly by setting the federal funds rate and making a judgment  as to what’s the right interest rate, which is hard to do in times of inflation, or should we go with  the aggregates and trust that they will produce the right interest rate because, under inflation  conditions, that’s a safer guide?  We don’t know what interest rates we want, but we think that a  reasonable rate of money growth will produce an appropriate interest rate  That’s how I view  our procedures     Well, in the funds rate there are notches where one becomes concerned,  say, when it [unintelligible] approaches disintermediation level, but other than that, it’s really  very difficult to say now what is a rate that contributes to stable growth     I also tend to think that changes in rates are significant, and they  probably are  The immediate effect of going from one Treasury bill rate to another, particularly  from one long-term rate to another, is pretty major  And for that reason we may delay the  necessary adjustment that would come about automatically if we stuck to some rate of growth of  the aggregates     Well, I think we--     Well, my argument is that it’s a little easier via the aggregates and only  at a time of inflation, when you really don’t know what the real interest rate is,  With the  aggregates, you know at least that you’re not way out of the ballpark--7 percent cannot produce  enormous inflation or it cannot produce stability     Is there a possibility that if you waited a little while it might turn out that  the aggregates would in fact begin to move in the direction in which the overshoot error in the  nonborrowed reserves suggested that they would go?     Federal Reserve [unintelligible] everything     Mr Chairman, we really have experimented a lot with reserve measures,  and I think among reserve measures there is some preference for nonborrowed reserves  We  could at least hint that that’s what we’re thinking about     Well, I think we will get a criticism from the monetarists for dropping it,  whether they think that it’s useful or not     I’d like to inject, Mr Chairman, that there is a growing understanding  internationally that the swap lines are not simply available for the asking  There have to be  negotiations, conditions, and circumstances that make it plausible that they will be paid off  within the proper time  Now, in the past, this repayment often has been based on the expectation  of a turnaround in the balance in payments and capital flows  Under conditions such as today’s,  this has become a little less plausible for some countries, and as a result we have increasingly  leaned on specific takeouts like an IMF drawing or the EC loan  I think it is beginning to be  understood that these are bridging credits     And we have achieved a relatively favorable loss-sharing proposition  with the Swiss     Could I ask a question about this table, Mr Chairman?  I find puzzling  some of the projections here  It is a hard thing to estimate the consequences of M1 growth, but I  note for instance [regarding] unemployment that a 1-1/2 percent difference in the rate of growth  in real GNP is associated only with a minute 02 [percentage point] difference in the level of  unemployment  I would have expected something closer to 04 or 05 bearing in mind the  familiar 3-to-1 rule of thumb here     The other point I have is the expected effect of the Treasury bill rate  It  has been frequently suggested that at least [for] the long-term rates, a change in the rate of  money growth might have not the typical effect [in which] the faster money growth reduces  interest rates but may actually, through expectations, raise them  Here at the short-term end, the  assumption seems to be very clear that over a period of five quarters, short-term rates will move  significantly in the direction in which one would traditionally have expected--that is, an increase  in the supply of money continues to reduce the short-term rate     I see  Thank you     Mr Chairman, my question has been answered by this discussion     With respect to M1, this would have been my suggestion, too, and I  think this is a good way of following up the previous move  We don’t move dramatically with a  whole range, we just pull down the [upper] end    Now comes the second shoe  Clearly the upper end is the more crucial one  The lower  end only reflects the uncertainties about M1  I think there are many people who might think that,  as the expansion progresses and the demand for credit picks up--if not the demand for  money--we might be pushed to higher growth rates  I’ve thought so myself in the past, but the  experience seems to show that we may be able to get away with [unintelligible] moving the rate  of money growth in one big movement over the cycle from what was too high to closer to a  reasonable rate       4/20/76 - 23 -           I don’t think it is unreasonable to expect this  The expansion of nominal GNP in our  forecast is on the order of 10 to 11 percent, so we continue to bank on a significant increase in  velocity of M1, [although] not as large as we’ve had in the past  As far as M2 is concerned we  need virtually no increase in velocity there at all, and that’s roughly in line with past experience   I would think, therefore, we have at least a good chance of making the goal stick, and since they  are logical and move in the right direction, I think that’s what we try     I think the question before us is whether to bring to an end this nice  period of stable interest rates  It has done a great deal for the market, it’s given everybody a  chance to soak up liquidity, put on some fat  Sometimes I wonder whether perhaps too much  liquidity and too much stability [unintelligible] resist over time a tightening move, but it has been  a very favorable period     Now the answer, it seems to me, is that it’s pretty late in the expansion--one year has gone  by and interest rates are still at their low  We now find that the expansion is stronger than we  had thought, certainly in the first quarter and quite likely over time, and that leads me to think  that probably we’d better bite this bullet  There’s also the point of consistency with the long-run  targets     I subscribe to what various members have said, but I’d like to add one point  It’s been  suggested that the short-run movements of the aggregates should not [unintelligible] within the  cone of growth rates that looks so nice on paper but within a band which allows for a wider  range in the early stages because that’s quite consistent with reaching a narrow range in the  longer run  Of course, if that were to be the advice, then these narrow ranges we set for the  aggregates on the two-month period are not very meaningful  On the other hand, I think the  width of the band that is implied in allowing the ultimate range to have its effect in the  immediate two-month period is so wide as to deprive us altogether of all guidance for the     4/20/76 - 45 -           aggregates of those two months  So the conclusion at which I’ve arrived is that it may well be  better to have a somewhat wider band in the short-run, two months, but not anywhere near the  full freedom given by applying that band over the whole period     Well, if we need to be consistent with our long-term targets being at a somewhat lower  growth rate of the aggregates, I would see nothing wrong with going to 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 and to 8 to  12  I am not enamored of a zone of indifference within this at this time  However, I started  talking about interest rates, and while I would like to see us get back to an aggregates target--and  that’s why I’ve been setting this out--the funds rate is really the crucial element  And it should  be, to accommodate the appropriate changes, even if we have, as I think we should, an  aggregates target  So I’d begin with a funds rate then, which, at 4-1/2 to 5-1/2, I would think  would be about right, and structure around that in the manner I said       Well, when the plaintiff rejected your argument with respect to category  two, foreign central bank negotiations and so forth, did he simply say that he didn’t understand  the argument or that he rejected the point that this would interfere with the flow of information?     Well, there is a question whether in lieu of a Memorandum of  Discussion one should try to invite visiting scholars to work on the history of the Federal  Reserve and [unintelligible]     I have a question with regard to the general style of the expanded  Record of Policy Actions  I don’t know whether it’s appropriate at this time to bring that up       I think what we saw was an extremely well-done piece, and what I’m  going to say is in no way critical of the fine work that’s gone into it  It does seem to me that it  kind of aims [at] a great deal of material that is familiar to every reader of the newspapers, who  know GNP was such, employment was such, and so forth  Now, it’s interesting to somebody  who studies these matters carefully to know what information the Committee had, [but] that  could easily be accomplished by saying information was available up to such and such a date, in  particular     Yes, but the general reader of this [unintelligible], such a reader is really  very familiar with all the data that are in that record, besides their release with a delay of 30 days  or whatever, so that they are not even a useful way for him to recapitulate this information  The  interesting information for the reader, I think, is what the projections were of the staff  [unintelligible] That’s new information  My suggestion is that we emphasize the latter and  deemphasize the former     Mr Chairman, I just want to put out a warning  Capacity data derived  from particular industries, and particularly locally derived, of course, can be extremely helpful   There’s some danger in putting them together unless one bears in mind [that industry sources]  very often talk about what they can do provided they get the labor, provided they get the  materials  They may not be thinking of the national effect of an expansion [in which] not only  they but their competitors are expanding, so the Reserve Banks, in evaluating this, would have to  be cognizant of that limitation of estimates on single firms      I have a comment on capacity  Since 1973, ’74, we’ve had very  moderate plant and equipment spending  We’ve had a good rise in labor force  So overall, one  would guess that the relationship of plant capacity to labor force capacity has deteriorated, and  we would be suffering from shortages and higher levels of unemployment  This might have been  offset if the area in which there were shortages had experienced a higher rate of investment in the  midst of generally lower investment  Is there any indication that that might have happened?   [Can] one, for instance, match up our major materials index categories to McGraw-Hill  categories?       I wonder if I could make a general comment on two ways of looking at  the outlook  So, look at our projections--we have a very strong business spending outlook and  yet a tapering off of GNP to the middle of ’77 [that] results from the expectation that almost  nothing else is going to [grow quickly]  Government is going to go slow, consumption is going  to take off a little, housing will taper off strongly, then exports are flat  So we’ve got the picture  of just [business spending] being very powerful and pulling the economy along--everything else  moderate     Somehow this strikes me as an implausible picture  Either, it would seem to me, other  things will be pulled up, with the exception of housing, if the impact of investment is as strong as  indicated here, or else maybe investment spending itself will suffer from this  But I see a  sectoral divergence here in the configuration of the expansion that strikes me as somehow a little  unusual     How much did [you consider] the possibility that the aggregates might  slow again during the period?       You go by your estimates exclusively?     I’d like to be guided by some of the same considerations that others  have mentioned, and broadly I follow what Mr MacLaury has said  I am concerned that we  have increased the annual rate of growth of our money in the past by about 1 percentage point for  the last recent period  We’ve used up something like 1 percentage point of our range for the year  ahead  The thing that gives me some pause is not the move in the funds rate and associated other  short-term rates, but the move in long-term rates  That, I think, is a pretty critical event  One did  not have to expect that this would necessarily happen [as a result of] short-term rates moving  It  shows the sensitivity of the market, and that is a crucial element     I would not like to see long-term rates move up very fast at this juncture  Even so, I think  one has to bear in mind that the impact of all this is likely to be quite late--late this year, early  next year--so that if, by that time, a strong investment boom is under way, it would not be  inappropriate to have moved relatively early with interest rates, even long-term rates  As I look  at the short-term rates to which we’re likely to be pushed if we stick to our long-term targets and  don’t move relatively fast now, I am concerned because that gets into 9 percent federal funds rate  territory, and, again, that I think is something we ought to try to avoid     All told, therefore, I come out with a funds rate more on the high side, 5 to 6; an M1 which  is the same as our long-term range if we are to get back to that 4-1/2 to 7; and M2, 5 to 9     If [we lose] the suit, would that affect any past actions taken by the  Committee?     From your observation of the market, when sterling was going down as  you said--without resistance, I think--would you have said that was a disorderly market?   SPEAKER(?)  I think by all of the attributes of disorderliness we have spoken of in the  past, the sterling market would certainly qualify as being disorderly, yes     SPEAKER(?)  Would you call it a disorderly market, Governor Wallich?       If I had to stretch a point in order to be able to intervene, I would, yes     If that occurred, then [their debt] would never mature  Because they  would extinguish one debt by creating a new debt   SPEAKER(?)  We would have to be a party to that   SPEAKER(?)  I agree     I think you said, Lyle, that no reduction in the rate of inflation was likely  during the present expansion, which makes me feel [that the projection is] rather ominous  Will  it take another period of slowdown in order to get any improvement in inflation?  How are our     6/22/76 - 20 -           wages likely to develop with productivity that would permit some reduction in inflation, perhaps  during the expansion?     Imports is a possible source of lower prices?     I’d like to hear a little more--the comparative observability of our  objectives under the two techniques--the fed funds rate, how early they can feel us out with  nonborrowed reserves, how early can they figure out what the objectives are      Mr Chairman, I would think that at most it’s a question of putting the  nonborrowed reserves target where the RPDs [reserves available to support private nonbank  deposits] used to be, in other words as a subsidiary element, not as a change in operating--     May I just verify a point in case I misunderstood it  We can use  nonborrowed reserves in two ways  One is as one of the aggregate targets; that’s what I  understand we discussed tonight  The other is a more ambitious step--to replace the funds rate  by nonborrowed reserves and have the [System Open Account] Manager look at that and not  look at the fed funds  That I would not propose at this time     In thinking about rates toward the end of the year, one has to look at the  [unintelligible] levels of M1 and alternatives A, B, and C for early ’77, and those are so low,  ranging from 28 under alternative A to 40 under C, that one wouldn’t be very surprised to see  those produced [unintelligible]  That’s, of course, the consequence of having moved up much of  our gross leeway in the second quarter       Yes, all I’m trying to say is, these projections of high short-term rates  are partly the result of an artificial constraint       In a general direction, I think we have little choice but to accept the rise  in short-term rates  This lull is perhaps not the best moment to start it, and as a compromise of  these two things, I would go with the 5 to 6 fed funds rate     I would also like to get back to a narrower aggregates target  We have had this time of  great uncertainty about M1, and it may not be over  But eventually, I think 4 percentage points  will be too wide, and I think this time we could afford to go to 4-1/2 to 7 and thereby match our  long-term target  I have no quarrel with the existing specifications of M2, and I would prefer an  aggregates directive     But if we still kept one and if someone else brought a suit, given this  precedent, would that increase the probability that subsequent Memoranda would have to be  released [unintelligible]?     That is the main argument, then, against the Memorandum     Well, there’s another aspect to this  It seems to be one could be  responsive to Reuss and Proxmire by being more specific about [unintelligible]  improvements in  the policy record      Now, why is it, Mr Chairman, so long as we have an opportunity to go  over the draft, that names can’t be mentioned?  I wouldn’t have an objection to having my name  used in a way that I didn’t understand [if I could] protect myself     I wonder, Mr Chairman, whether I should report on the gold discussion  [at the Bank for International Settlements] in Basel     Well, when gold--     It’s now $105-$106 in the afternoon market, between the two figures      We received the report that had been agreed on in central bank  negotiations on gold sales  The way the BIS handles this is that the general manager of the BIS  gets full information on quantities and prices, and I asked him to give us assurance that he has  received that in the form agreed on, which he gave  He passes this on in the form of a table that  contains considerably less information but is nevertheless more complete than most of those  present anticipated; we have country detail on who sold or bought what     Very little actually seems to have gone on in the market  The French and the Swiss both  bought a ton in the IMF auction, through the BIS, and assuming the report to be complete, that  seems to be all they bought  The largest seller at the auction, other than the IMF, was Canada,  which sold for the purpose of [unintelligible] medals or coins   As a result of these sales, there is now a leeway under the ceiling, that is to say, by virtue  of the G-10 agreement, a central bank would be allowed to buy as much as 352 tons To get the  dollar value, you have to multiply by $4 [million] at the price that prevailed a few days ago and  by something more nearly [like] $3 [million] at the price that prevails today, $3 million per ton,  approximately  In other words, the ceiling is on the order of $120 million now       7/19-20/76 - 22 -   Well, there was general approval of this, an expression of gratification that the report was  complete  I had to note that some things seemed to be not fully stated, and there is in that report  evidence that one has to watch carefully what information one is given  But I think there’s  goodwill to supply the data correctly, and so far nothing [unintelligible] seems to have happened     Yes     The price at which the BIS sold to Switzerland and France was the same  as the auction price  On the other BIS sales, they didn’t tell us  However, from public  sources--that is, leaks--we did know roughly what the bidding pattern was; namely, the BIS, and  possibly the Swiss National Bank, had spread out a considerable volume of bids in such a way as  to, in effect, support the price had there been pure bids from the market  It turned out that this  tail of [unintelligible] bids not accepted was fairly close to the market price  This is something  that we extracted at the meeting and [unintelligible] was present there, said that they were going  to publish the price of the bidding pattern without names, which they’ve done  I don’t have it  here now     The agreement is for regular auctions  The next auction is to be on  September 15, I believe  There was at the [unintelligible] meeting not among the Governors, at  least not that I heard, but at the level of the BIS Committee on Gold and Foreign Exchange,  which Scott Pardee attends, there’s some pressure for postponement of the auction on the  grounds that the market was saturated and the sales had not been fully absorbed  Well, the price  pattern since that time doesn’t seem to contradict that statement, but the US position is that gold  sales should continue on a regular schedule     They have to lose on account of the trust fund, and even more, Italy and  Portugal, whose main resource and [whose] present difficulty is their substantial gold stock, are  of course involved  The [BIS] may be concerned about their collateral under the Italian loan,     7/19-20/76 - 23 -   which is at a level now above the market  With respect to their Portuguese [unintelligible], they  have a margin call facility, that is, a maintenance-of-value clause for that collateral     Mr Chairman?     When you try to anticipate the possible movement of the dollar--you  mentioned interest rates and the current account--do you regard [unintelligible] rates of inflation  as an additional separable factor or is that sort of factored into the current account expectation?     Thank you     I’m puzzled by the great steadiness, quarter by quarter, that you  anticipate for real GNP growth  It goes at a rate of 5 percent  First, it seems not very likely that  this degree of stability can be maintained  Second, I’m puzzled by the relatively low rate of  growth, which is considerably below what I would have thought the economy might be doing  I  ask myself what are the ingredients of this forecast  I realize that it’s partly the model, which is  geared to a rate of money supply growth that will come out at that rate in the very long run, but I  take it that’s not decisive here  This is in good part judgmental     And what I’d like to hear is--given that there are a number of elements in the GNP that are  not strong now, like housing, business fixed investment, and even inventory, even state and local  government--there seems to be more room on the upside for things to accelerate than on the  downside  Is that a reasonable view?     7/19-20/76 - 25 -     Does that bias adjustment differentiate between expansion and  contraction?     Mr Chairman, one of the hypotheses about the above-average rise in  velocity in the first year of the expansion was that it was a normal feature of the early expansion   Now, to the extent that that was the explanation of what we observed, one would have to assume  that in the latter stages of the expansion, velocity ought to expand below average, other things  not taken into account here     That’s what I had in mind     That puts a heavier burden on the technological [source of] demand  changes because, looking purely at the cyclical pattern, there’s a case for some secular slowing  in the rise of velocity     Well, Mr Chairman, I think the problem is with the manner in which we  pursue the aggregates  It’s very difficult not to take into account recent data  In fact the whole  idea of optimal control is to take full account of recent information, and if one doesn’t do that,  one finds that, a few weeks or months down the road, one is very far off target  But what we are  doing now is to pursue the aggregates by means of the federal funds rate, and that attributes a  great deal of importance to the rates, so that the whole structure of other rates have become  hinged to it as if it were the discount rate in the United Kingdom     Everything moves; that constrains our ability to move that [unintelligible]  If we could get  by with operating in a way that isn’t based on the funds rate, the funds rate would be simply a  residual result, then the market wouldn’t attribute that much importance to it; bill rates and other  rates wouldn’t be so tightly hinged to it; and we’d have more freedom to let the funds rate move  about  That was the idea essentially of having a wider funds rate [range]--2 percent instead of  what we’ve been having recently, 1/2 of 1 percent--and we’ve been moving away from that  objective rather than toward it     In one way or another, I think we ought to get away from the narrow  range  Operating on nonborrowed reserves doesn’t seem to commend itself in terms of the  experience that is described in the Bluebook and in the New York report--maybe operating more  directly on the aggregates themselves without using the funds rate would do the trick     Mr Chairman, I find your list of pros and cons very complete, and I find  the cons more persuasive, that is, cons against reducing the M1 range now  I would supplement  that by saying I think 5 percent real growth is not very much  I think there’s room for more  As  I view the expansion, there probably will be more, and I wouldn’t want to do anything at this  time to reduce the prospect of that  Now so much with respect to M1     With respect to M2 and M3, one point that gives me a problem with your suggestion is  that, after all, we aren’t operating on expectations of what these variables will be, which may  well be influenced by outflows from the thrifts  But these are supposed to be our instruments  which we set, and if there are outflows from the thrifts, that seems to imply that we ought to take  some action to keep the growth rate of those aggregates nevertheless at the level that we thought  appropriate  The staff seems to think that, for alternative B, a gap of 3 percentage points  between the growth of M1 and the growth of M2 is the expected relationship, and I would be  reluctant to alter that     Well, that weakens my case somewhat  However, I would apply  reasoning to M3 that is similar to what you have applied, Mr Chairman  I have no great faith in  M3 as an instrument  I wouldn’t attach as much weight to it as a symbol of the tendency to bring  growth rates down--and I think that’s a valuable symbolism--as I would to M1 and M2  I would  be quite prepared to make a small downward adjustment in the upper [end] of M3      Mr Chairman, it seems to me that, for those who might like to dissent,  [we should have] some way--not, perhaps, in the way of formal votes--to leave the record clear     On your nonborrowed reserves exercise, I thought that the idea was not  to look through to the aggregates, but here, if I’ve understood you correctly, you implied that you     7/19-20/76 - 62 -   had been operating on that basis  Is that because you concluded that it isn’t feasible not to look  through?     Well, I regard it as a hopeful development, given that the experiment, it  seems to me, has not worked all that well  Do you feel you are exploring a path to better  performance there?     I can see many reasons why one would want to narrow the funds rate  now, but the consequence of doing that is that one increasingly gets married to a narrow funds  rate range, and the problems that come from that escalate  Each time it becomes more critical  not to have the funds rate go too far; more short-run [unintelligible] effects come from that, and  there is probably never a good time to broaden the funds rate [range]  Therefore, I believe that  we ought to accept this painful discipline and stay with least the 1 percentage point range; 4-3/4  to 5-3/4 looks right to me     7/19-20/76 - 68 -     We have one other difficult conversation with Treasury, Mr Chairman,  and ’til that’s concluded, I think we’d weaken our position by also asking to be taken out of the  Swiss swap     Well, we haven’t had any direct conversation with the Mexicans so far   They’re coming into town this afternoon--contrary to what we have heard before, that they were  coming yesterday--and what seems likely to happen is that the Treasury will make a more  modest offer than they had contemplated--on the order of activating the 300 million swap, plus  maybe 100 million additional  In that case they would want us to roll over the swap that matures  on October 9, unless by that time rate changes have taken place in Mexico--which is not at all  impossible--that would make that unnecessary     Right  I think that if the Treasury did not come into this operation, the  situation would be quite different for us and we would not now agree to roll over     I think one of the important determinants of investment is capacity  utilization  I wonder if we could hear a little about the various seemingly conflicting data on  this  The Federal Reserve capacity index for manufacturing is quite low but is generally  regarded as being statistically too low  The Commerce Department has a series, which I’m not  well informed about, which seems to have reached 4 to 5 points below its previous peak  The  Wharton index is always high by nature of its construction  There seems to be an index by  [unintelligible] which shows capacity utilization well above our data  So we’re left with our  index low, and the materials index somewhat higher, but still not showing any pressure on  capacity, and then these other indexes possibly pointing in another direction  Any useful  conclusion that can be drawn from all this?     8/17/76 - 16 -       I saw some data indicating that the change in velocity in M1 during the  second recovery year since the war has been remarkably constant, that is, within a lower limit of  37 percent and a higher limit of 52--average of 42  Does that sound still applicable to you in  the light of the recent shifts in demand we’ve seen?     Yes     I think there is a balance of considerations here, Mr Chairman  The  economic situation might induce one to want to give a little push, but this pause probably will be  over long before the major part of that [push] would be felt  And as the [push might] indicate a  high degree of concern, the announcement effect, as I would see it, would possibly be negative     There’s also the fact that we’ve had interest rates low [for] very long in this expansion, [so]  a great deal of liquidity has accumulated in the economy, which at some future point might raise  problems for us which we do not want to intensify  Also, if we stick to our one-year target, then     8/17/76 - 23 -    anything we do now to ease means a faster rise in interest rates later  This is perhaps more a  defect of the way we handle our projections and calculations now     There’s really no reason why one needs to gear the expected rise in interest rates to the  midpoint of the long-term range  One could gear it to the edges and, say, associate a policy of  money growth higher than in the long run, not with alternative B for the long-term of the  midpoint, but with alternative A, and that would give one less of a rise in interest rates  But in  any event, it seems to me that [counter]balancing the desire to give some push for the negatives  that we have here, I come out, as do our colleagues, with the conclusion that B is the right thing  to do     Mr Chairman, the Mexicans almost a month ago presented a pretty grim  picture of their situation to the Treasury, with hints of the possibility of a moratorium on  [payments on] their foreign debt  They’ve since moved in a much more constructive direction,  made an agreement with the IMF, made an agreement with the Treasury and us, and set  themselves on the policy course that hopefully will get them out of trouble over time--at any rate,  avoid anything on the order of a moratorium     So far, we’ve had a sharp devaluation of the Mexican peso, which brought back about a  $190 million reflow  They then, however, raised the rate again in order to give their wage  negotiations, which are critical, an assist; as a result, they lost more than they had taken in  This  is an important feature of the situation  As soon as the wage negotiations are out of the way,  then they will be free to let the rate find [a] better level again     The agreement with the IMF is under the highest conditionality that the IMF has for the  extended facility  They draw first their regular credit tranche, plus the so-called compensatory  facility which has little conditionality; but nevertheless the conditionality relating to the whole  agreement is intended to apply to this part also  Then [they] draw over three years on amounts of  $235 million per year under the extended facility, giving them in the aggregate [an] amount well  over $1 billion       9/21/76 - 2 -     Now the Treasury and possibly the Federal Reserve engage in a pre-financing of some of  these drawings  The first part, the credit tranche plus the compensatory facility, amount to  $365 million  The Treasury has offered a pre-financing in which the Federal Reserve, in the  manner in which I will explain, is a potential participant  The expectation is that the money from  the IMF will come in around November 1  That would mean that the Mexicans get this money  for a matter of 35 to 40 days, and the financing would be paid off from that IMF money  Further  installments of pre-finance by the Treasury [would come] then in three annual installments  during 1977  The Federal Reserve has nothing to do with that     As regards our own participation, the arrangement is the following the Mexicans are given  [two] option[s] [In the first,] they maintain their present swap position of $360 [million] until  it’s due on October 9, and [then they] pay us off  Steve Gardner and I have talked to them, and  we have some impression that there is considerable goodwill  It was strengthened in later  conversation, I guess today, that they will do everything possible to repay at that time     Alternatively, [under option two] they would integrate up to one-half of the 360, that is  180, into the Treasury arrangement  That would mean that they have to prepay the swap and  immediately redraw--it’s the same swap but a separate drawing  They repay immediately,   redraw, and the new drawing would be under the same conditions that apply to the Treasury  [financing]  The advantage there from our point of view is that the Treasury has a firm takeout  from the IMF for its pre-financing; if we could get into that, we [would] have the same takeout   The advantage to the Mexicans is that they keep that money a little longer instead of having to  repay on October 9  They`d be repaying whenever the IMF money comes in, around November  1  So we think that we have at least [potentially] improved our position with respect to the swap   If the Mexicans take this option, then we have a takeout for one-half of the money, although it  comes back three weeks later  If they don’t take the option, well, then we are in the same  position we were in to begin with, with this maturity coming up on October 9     Now, one has to see that operation in proportion  The Mexicans have an enormous current  account deficit, and merely to finance that deficit of about $3 billion a year they must be  borrowing something like $250 million a month from the international capital market  In  addition, of course, they have maturities, so they’ve got to refinance by additional borrowings   So they’re in the world capital markets continuously  Our [part] of the Treasury’s operation is  financially rather small for them  It’s crucial for them in the sense that they want to establish  their credit, they want to show a solid position to their creditors  And one element of doing that  is not to draw on this facility that the Treasury and the Fed are offering to repay the swap if they  possibly can [avoid it], and to make their affairs look as normal as possible in these conditions     Fundamentally, the devaluation has eased their position by laying the basis for the  improvement of the balance of payments  Very much depends of course on the kind of policies  they follow  There are some reasonable doubts about those policies because they involve an  undertaking to avoid a decline in real wages  My impression is that that undertaking isn’t being  taken all that literally, and it would be very difficult to implement it     The agreement with the IMF is such that the IMF appears to be fully satisfied and is  prepared to give them this credit, which they can do only if they are satisfied with the program   They’ve also certified this to the Treasury, and you have a copy, I believe, of the letter from     9/21/76 - 3 -    [IMF Managing Director] Witteveen certifying this to the Treasury  There is another letter from  the Mexican Secretary of the Treasury confirming the arrangement  We have to wait until  October 9 to see whether the Mexicans pick up their option under the swap to go in on the  undertaking with the Treasury     The latter is correct, and I would like to add that this certification of  Witteveen does represent a carefully negotiated program  Now, I gather that the Chairman is  somewhat skeptical of this program when you consider that the British are very much concerned  about the political implications of getting that certification from Witteveen  I think one has to  concede that there is some reality to that [concern]     Moreover, there is an opportunity to implement the conditionality  The money doesn’t  come all at once, they can’t walk away with it, thumb their nose  It comes over three years, and  any time they don’t meet the stipulations, they don’t get it  The ultimate test of this is that  balance sheet numbers are specified on the balance sheet of the Bank of Mexico [unintelligible]  unless the credit expands     They say that [there is] not  They say that they recently received an  offer of $1 billion--and the inclination was to say, “Why don’t you grab that?”--which they  turned down because it would have [involved] irregular procedures  They borrow in $1/4 billion  lots and they want to go on doing that     Their inability to borrow in--     That may very well be, because that’s where the most [of the] money  comes from     I think we could give credit also to the Treasury, which steered the  Mexicans in a good direction     Of course, to the extent that’s there more risk in the later payments, we  will have a little less risk by virtue of being able to pay about in proportion the first year, then of  the second and third year, the Treasury taking the later installments in larger part     I would not think so  Our discussions were of the kind in which the  Fowler letter was discussed  It was treated with some irritation, if I may say so, but not with  total rejection     Mr Chairman, that is a perfectly realistic view, but the alternative [was]  having them take over our deficit, as Mr Holmes said, and that was really the issue that one  would discuss next time     Looking at investment expenditures as they are projected, would you  say they are more or less on track given the determinants as we know them and as we evaluate  them?  Or are they significantly under what we would expect them to be at given capacity, given  the rate of growth of the economy, given the financial availability, profits, and so forth?     Mr Chairman, I was interested in the comment on the slowing in growth  of velocity  This is a particularly good test because interest rates have been relatively stable  Do  you see the prospective ability of velocity to increase as interest rates rise [as being] more limited  than it would have been last year?     Mr Chairman, we’ve had a remarkable degree of stability both in  interest rates and rate of growth in the aggregates  And that tempts one to want to perpetuate it   The easiest way of doing that is fixing a narrow funds range, but I think we would do that at  some cost  Later, things may change  By that time the market may have thought that when  things are good then everything is very stable  We ought to keep the market accustomed to some  degree of variability  For that reason I would go with a wider funds rate  I think 4-3/4 [to] 5-3/4  would be right     The aggregates as you specified them, I think, are good  It’s probably desirable to put a  slightly lower ceiling on the expansion of M2 before there is a reaction in the funds rate because  M2 is now moving at a rate substantially faster than M1  The gap is unusual, and even though  this may mean mostly a negation and not really the creation of additional liquidity, nevertheless  it’s a little excessive, and so I would agree with you on 8 to 12 as a substitute for 9 to 13     I just want to say I think the asymmetry proposal with the instruction to  stay near the present level unless there are extreme movements is a good one     I find very intriguing the suggestion that there’d be a full listing of all  operations  Now, the idea is stated here, and then it is rejected, and I wonder how strongly the  authors feel about this rejection  I could see that very considerable benefits in terms of public  posture would come from it--we tell everything  At the same time, we don’t tell very much that  isn’t on Telerate, as far as I can see     They have so many other pieces of information, Mr Chairman--     --exchange rates, which makes it a very attractive thing to acquire for  other reasons     I think it would be a very nice posture to be able to say we publish all  we do in the market every day, and then there remains only one little bit that we don’t publish,  which is where we want to be at the end of the market by our decision [unintelligible]     [Unintelligible] I think the growing differentiation of the middle- and  higher-income LDCs from the others that brings about its improvements so long as they want to  present a common front, which they’ve always done up ’til now  They’ve got to drop these  demands for a [debt] moratorium, demands for guarantees, which have been so troublesome  I  also was impressed that there’s relatively little criticism of the comfortable [unintelligible] that  the US now occupies in the international monetary system of a floating dollar, reserve currency,     10/19/76 - 4 -   [unintelligible] no convertibility obligations  It’s a nice spot for the US to be in, and I thought  there’d be some criticism of this, but I didn’t hear much       There are two  I went to Hong Kong, [unintelligible], Sidney, and  Canberra  I inquired wherever I could about banking arrangements with respect to two things   the foreign reaction to the proposed foreign banking legislation in the US and examination and  supervisory arrangements of American [unintelligible] subsidiaries representatives  I found no  great excitement about the US banking legislation  With respect to the examination  arrangements, I found on the whole that they seem to be going forward, at least one would  assume that they [unintelligible] that is not the case  How complete they are, obviously I can’t  say, [unintelligible] that there was a degree of normality about what was reported and was  encouraging     A less encouraging element is what one hears about LDC indebtedness and the attitude of  bankers  Apparently, American bankers [were] traveling around, which is no great surprise, after  Manila  But what is surprising is that apparently they [were] pressing loans upon countries  And     10/19/76 - 6 -   here at home we hear that they can’t place loans [unintelligible] prices of raw materials rise, the  exports of these countries rise, their credit capacity seems better, and there’s pressure for more  lending  This is just the opposite, of course, of what we’ve been telling the LDCs and telling  ourselves in Manila  That this is a time for adjustment rather than financing, that too much  financing of large balance of payments deficits has been going on, that the stronger countries  must now take on their part of the deficit burden that the [oil-price increase] is imposing on the  world  So I think here is something that one needs to worry about, both the level of  indebtedness, the prospects for rolling over, and apparently the view, I’m not saying [of] all  bankers, but just a general report, the banking pressure to place more loans rather than to bear  down on [unintelligible]     With respect to the nonborrowed reserve experiment, which apparently  would have produced a somewhat perverse federal funds rate behavior toward the end of the  period--is that on the basis of an unchanged path of nonborrowed reserves enunciated at the  beginning of the period?  Or could the path have been modified in the light of evolving  developments?     Yes, so that it is perhaps not quite as negative a comment as it appears  from this experience     Yes     10/19/76 - 9 -     I have two questions, if I may  One is very similar to Mr Mayo’s  I  took Lyle’s statement to mean that what was previously the probability distribution of outcomes  of the forecast was skewed upward with a tail for the higher forecast, now it’s skewed downward  toward the lower forecast     I heard it said that the inventory situation is such that it [limits] a downward spiral  And  one could take Governor Lilly’s simulation as evidence that [unintelligible] doesn’t it seem to  induce that kind of inventory liquidation?  Is that a reasonably correct interpretation?  Is the  inventory situation putting a kind of floor under the situation, so that even in a relatively bad case  we don’t have to anticipate a severe downward spiral?     This is very important in response to my question  I assumed that it was  the mode and not the mean when I talked of the tail on one side or the other  If you take the  mean, then it’s somewhere on the downward sloping end of the tail   You said, Lyle, that you did not think monetary policy was responsible for the slowdown;  credit had been available, interest rates have been moderate  Have you weighed this against the  fact that in this expansion, money has been created very largely against purchases of securities     10/19/76 - 19 -   by the banking system rather than by loans, so that in the first round effect, as it were, money  creation has not generated a demand for goods and services but merely increased the pool of  available capital and then flows into other assets?  Do you regard this difference in the form of  money creation as a significant difference in the way the monetary expansion has proceeded?     May I make a comment on this, Mr Chairman?  In the light of the  financial situation of many LDCs and also of industrial countries, it seems inevitable that in one  way or another they reduce their deficit  Now what Chuck foresees is a form of doing that   Whichever they do, in one way or another, it probably means that a larger part of the OPEC-  induced deficit is going to shift to the United States  We’ve already taken a sizable amount, but  we may have to take more that has to be factored realistically into our prospects       Mr Chairman, we shouldn’t forget, on the other side, that CDs, which in  corporations, after all, are highly monetary, were going down all along, so if the higher ends of 4  and 5 have a negative bias from that source, I don’t know what to say about Treasury bills, which  presumably have a very similar role [unintelligible] probably expanding       I share the view of those who argued like Governor Partee  I see a need  for some kind of a push, however mild and slow it would be in working  I think we’ve been low  on the aggregates over a long period of time  I think that’s by and large the result of our  emphasis on the funds rate  [If] we don’t allow the funds rate to go down, then the aggregates  will not expand, and I think that’s what’s happened and what seems to tell us that there isn’t  much expansionary force in the banking system  Well, the differences are very minor, but I’d go  for 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 [for the federal funds rate], and the aggregates 5 to 9 and 9 to 13  And unless  there’s clear strength in the aggregates in the next week, I would move to the midpoint of that  funds range, 4-3/4       Well, I would go with the 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 on M1  I think the logic of  gradually cutting each time is quite hard to resist because one begins to wobble when it becomes  a controversial action  Whereas if one does something of this cutting kind, no matter in which of  the aggregates and whether the upper or lower edge of the band, one follows a continuing  principal that makes sense  Eventually we’ve got to come down to lower rates of money growth  and never will unless we move in that direction     The real significance, I think, of today’s action in any event is what we do on the two- month targets  On the longer targets, they have significance, but we’re not really trapped into  those, we can change them  Besides, base drift, although I’ve been concerned about it, is  something that I wouldn’t readily give up because it’s a great safeguard and may stand in some  good stead some day  I don’t feel too concerned about the longer-run aggregates, and I’d go  with the same specification for M2 and M3 that we have at the present time       This is Henry Wallich, can you hear me?     [Others reply “yes”]     I have a great deal of difficulty with this decision  It seems to me that,  during the brief period that has elapsed since the last meeting of the Committee, things have not  improved  In some respects, failure to improve really means deterioration of the situation  I am  quite concerned that we should not seem to be throwing off false signals; in particular, we  shouldn’t seem to be giving up in the effort to bring the aggregates down as a means of reducing  inflation over the longer run     Now there are two ways, really, one could go about this  One is to bring down the 7  percent for M1--the upper edge--to 6-1/2 and then make a statement explaining that it is not a  restrictive action because that upper part of the range has never been used  The alternative way  is to leave it where it is and make a statement to the effect that one is not thereby compromising  one’s long-run policy of bringing these aggregates down  I am somewhat impressed by Willis  Winn’s point about base drift  Without wanting to enter into discussion of the base, the fact is  that in the last three months we haven’t achieved the midpoint of our range, and I guess over the  last six months, with 55 percent M1 growth, we have not quite achieved it       Well, October is strong, and we may well find our base drifting upward  from whatever decision we may make now  My own preference is for leaving things as they are,  with a statement at the hearing that we should not regard this as an ending of the effort to bring  down the ranges but that, in the light of the economic situation and the length of the pause that  we’ve experienced, it seems appropriate at least to give that [situation] a degree of recognition     11/8/76 - 4 -           We’re not raising anything but simply slowing down the rate at which we’re bringing down the  aggregates     I have less confidence, I think, than some of my colleagues in M2  It’s  becoming a broader and broader concept, becoming more monetary at its highly liquid end  [with] transactions balances, and more investment type at the other end, where multiyear  certificates are issued  Also, I’m aware that M1 is contained in M2, so that if there is some  tendency of M1 to be understated by something like 2 percentage points, 1 percentage point of  that reflects in M2     But on the other hand, I’m not greatly concerned about the danger of conflicting signals  It  seems to me that can be explained  What we’re doing is a realignment; there probably is never a  good time to make a realignment  But by raising the [broader] Ms while lowering the  [narrower], I think we are, as far as the technicalities are concerned, making a realignment; as far  as the economy is concerned, we are at least not reducing the expansive force of the economy,  the monetary aggregates  In short, it seems to me that to raise M2 and M3 slightly would be a  good move     Well, I certainly agree, Mr Chairman, I certainly agree that 1/2  percentage point in M2 does not make a vast amount of difference in the uncertainties that we  face  I also agree that raising it by a full percentage point might be a signal of a change of mind   I just want to clarify that, in my thinking about a combination of lowering the upper end of M1  and raising the upper end of M2 and M3 by equal percentage points, we can interpret that as a  technical realignment, leaving the overall immediate stance of policy unchanged--but the  longer-term intention continues to be to bring them all down       11/8/76 - 14 -             Mr Chairman, I don’t think there’s a great deal I can add to what you  say  You’ve adequately, accurately described the situation of Mexico  Going into a little more  detail, they have moved into a period of uncertainty about the exchange rate after many years in  which it was taken for granted that the exchange rate was stable  As a result, there developed in  Mexico a great degree of ease of moving between dollars and pesos; there is no exchange  control, people can maintain dollar deposits in Mexican banks, they can take their dollars out of  the country, of course     This system, once stability has been abandoned, becomes very troublesome  The dollars  deposited in Mexican banks can be sent abroad very easily, or they can be withdrawn in  currency  That’s the reason why we have these heavy currency shipments to Mexico  It’s a form  of capital flight that is difficult to manage by means of interest rate policy  Interest rate policy  affects the corporate borrower, but it is not, on the whole, the corporate borrower who is taking  his money out of Mexico; it’s the individual who has dollar deposits, or even has peso savings,  and cashes those in and buys dollars     Now, in the face of that, the Bank of Mexico, in my opinion, has tried far too long and far  too hard to hold up the rate  The Fund [IMF] told them at the beginning of the negotiations that  led to the last agreement--the Fund has had three missions there this year--the Fund told them  that they had concluded that a 50 percent depreciation would be needed  The initial depreciation  was much less than that  They held the rate at this level, which cost about $1 billion of reserves   Finally, they had to let go and went to what is, in effect, close to 50 percent depreciation  The  peso used to be 8 cents, and now it is around 4  Even then, the Mexican central bank has tried to  manage the rate and convey a sensation of upward trend in order to reduce the capital flight      11/16/76 - 3 -           They have invested less money in this effort than before, but they needed additional reserves,  and that is one reason for the drawing     The other reason for the drawing on Treasury and the Federal Reserve is that they need  compensating balances  They typically keep 12 billion to 16 billion of compensating balances  with their various banks--these are their exchange reserves  Now these are down into the low  hundreds [of millions]  The Treasury examined the possibility of a swap that would give the  Mexicans only compensating balances that they couldn’t in effect draw out, but it was  abandoned because it would create legal problems, and there are no particular strings attached to  either the Treasury’s or our drawing     We had, in the new drawing that was agreed, a sharp cutback from the original level of the  swap  That level remains as being a general authorization, but then in this particular case,  instead of 360, we said a limit of 150  This they were to take down in two tranches of 75 each,  the second one to occur after they had secured a loan from Bank of America, which is being  negotiated--800 million--and which, according to reports from the Mexicans, is being signed  today  So that would create the conditions in which the second drawing could be made  The  first drawing was made right after the agreement     We had a new wrinkle in this swap, which gives us a little added protection, although I  would caution not to overrate it  They had to agree to a maintenance-of-value clause  If the  peso, which fluctuates in the market, should go down during the period of the 90-day drawing,  then, in the first place, they’re expected to repay; but second, if it is [mutually] agreed not to  repay, to extend the swap     Three months  But if we agree that it is to be rolled over, and if the peso  has depreciated at that time, they have to put in additional pesos so that the dollar value of  collateral is maintained  In the back of this there is the thought--which I am sure is obvious to  them, although we have not made it overt--that we could go into their market and sell these pesos  for what they would bring  Now this, of course, could [unintelligible] by blocking this account,  and it is a thing that we would hardly do except in extremes, but the fact that they would have to  take further action to keep us from doing so, I think, will slightly weight the scales in their mind  in favor of doing what they can to meet their obligation  The Treasury tried to get a similar  arrangement into their swap, but they found again the legal problems defeated them, so they are  going without this little added protection     Now as to the future, the Chairman has described the situation  A new government is  coming in, and the President is a former finance minister  It is hoped that he will inspire  confidence  His views are not 100 percent known, and there is some apprehension even that they  might lean in the direction of the agricultural reform, and other things, that would certainly not  add to confidence  The Fund thinks that the situation is manageable if they decide to do the right  things, that is, cut down government expenditures and keep wages from rising unreasonably  On  both fronts, so far, they have not performed very well  The government deficit looks as if it  might be larger than expected and will have to be renegotiated with the Fund to preserve the  standby  On wages, the increases were larger than were seemingly agreed with the IMF       11/16/76 - 4 -           Other than that, there is as yet no obvious impediment to the continued viability of Mexico   They claim that this $800 million loan, negotiated after the devaluation, was oversubscribed  It’s  being signed apparently on schedule, to the date that they have said, although they’re getting the  money a little later than they had led us to believe  They have not yet negotiated for next year,  on the ground that when one is negotiating one big loan, one must not be negotiating something  else  They do have to borrow something on the order of $250 million a month, given that they  will have something like, at best, a $2 billion current account deficit, and ought to restore their  reserves by about a billion  That does not yet allow for any reflows  If they get reflows, their  situation will be very materially improved  Total outflows just during this year were roughly  guessed to have been at $2-1/2 billion  So very large Mexican amounts abroad could come back  if there’s confidence of great profit in pesos to the owners, and it depends entirely on the attitude  of the new government     The Mexicans paid us; it might have gone the other way     The effect of doing that is the Mexicans are going to get $235 [million]  a year for three years from the Fund  The first year, 1977, the Treasury is going to prefinance in  tranches of three pieces again, not the next two years, so there is nothing for us to get our teeth  into   SPEAKER(?)  Mr Chairman, what is the extent of the exposure of the commercial  banking industry in this country?  That’s something you mentioned     I think it’s a little over, I think it’s 9, close to 9   SPEAKER (?)  So this is merely a drop in the bucket?     That was repaid out of the IMF     They were told that we wouldn’t go over 150 even though the swap  remained at its original level of 360, and it’s geared to be the same as to the Treasury; that’s  because the Treasury went to 150     All I can tell you is that the bank that usually heads syndicates with  them did not do it, and that’s how Bank of America got into it     No, I don’t  I was told by them that it was oversubscribed, which  suggests that it was more than a very small number, but I can’t tell you     To American banks [unintelligible,] in part government, part  nationalized enterprises, and part private enterprises  In Mexico, the proportion of private  borrowers out of total Mexican foreign indebtedness is particularly high because it’s that kind of  a country     I think that is an accurate assessment  The Fund, surprisingly to me,  concluded [that, in seeking a] 50 percent depreciation, at least 40 was what they needed  They  didn’t believe it  They finally got it  The price impulses are somewhat stronger than was  anticipated, so the undervaluation is probably temporary     11/16/76 - 9 -             Yeah, this was one of the 12 or 13 points in the original program to take  care of firms that were in that condition  If they’re doing this, they are not doing it on a very  generous scale, because one of the strong objections that are raised to further depreciation--for  instance, one [wants to say] why don’t you let the rate go, let it find its own level--is the threat of  bankruptcy to firms that owe dollars but have been invested in pesos  How they got themselves  into that position is the history of the last 12 years of stability, in which it was cheap to borrow in  dollars and dear to borrow in pesos, and they did not properly as individual firms manage their  exchange rate exposure     Could I make one comment going back to Mexico?  The word  “moratorium” has been used, and that is one way of describing something that might happen   The arrangements, however, that the Mexicans have in place in case one of their major units  should be unable to roll over--and they’re all actively engaged in rolling over, during the last two  months of the year, some $600 million or $800 million of indebtedness--are that there would be a  degree of central control so that one would not suddenly be confronted with sporadic  nonpayment, but rather that it would be possible to enter into negotiations so that what otherwise  might be a moratorium would look more like a rescheduling, and I guess would be a  rescheduling  This is something, of course, that has happened to other countries--Argentina has  been rescheduled more than once; Brazil has been rescheduled repeatedly, and today these  countries enjoy a great amount of credit  So the world has not come to an end, because countries  don’t come to an end when that happens  There is a new situation with respect to what the  accountants might do to reschedule loans today  In that regard, we’re in a different ball game     You get $25 billion credit     11/16/76 - 11 -             Mr Chairman, I think it’s getting increasingly understood in the world  that the swap facilities are a framework within which one negotiates, rather than an automatic  drawing right, and to that extent I think your wishes are being met  We have to bear in mind that  we, too, draw on swaps, although on a very small scale, when we engage in open market  operations, so that we wouldn’t want to build up the resistance, for instance, of the Germans,  who usually ask questions or may put limits on what we can draw  We wouldn’t want to build  that resistance up any more than we have to     11/16/76 - 12 -             I wonder if I could get the view of the Reserve Bank Presidents on this?   Is this likely to lead to a change in the way the minutes are going to be written hereafter?     Well it’s most natural that one should search for signs of weakness at a  time like this  I note one that I think has not been commented on much  Projections involved a  slight reduction in the saving rate from the second to third quarter and then it stays [put] on out   It goes from about 7 to 6-1/2 [percent] and stays there  But as I look at the data, the main reason  why this seems to happen is that, in the third quarter, personal income indeed did not rise very  much, an assumption more or less carried on, and so that automatically cut the saving rate  But  now I ask myself, is there any good reason not to up it again after this quarter?  Was there any  reason why it should have come down in the third quarter, however slightly, and stayed down  thereafter?  It’s about 1/2 percentage point--that’s more than $6 billion--I think that’s not  altogether small     The second point ties in with the discussion of the shortfall  We have now more or less  inadvertently slipped into a continuous full-employment surplus, with the exception of next  quarter, where there is a minute deficit, but in general there is a small but not rising surplus  I  would have thought that this is rather early, for this stage of the cycle, to reach that condition,  although I realize that at some point we ought to get there  But given that we don’t have a very  strong recovery, it makes me think a little about 1958-59, when the budget also turned out to be     11/16/76 - 26 -           stronger, in the sense of less of a deficit than one anticipated, and I realized that we may be doing  something similar again here  I realize, of course, it’s a hypothetical computation on the  benchmark full employment, something other than 4 percent, and you get a deficit   Nevertheless, compared with what we thought earlier, the same benchmark, this is, I think, a  significant change, unless it’s made up by a catch-up in the shortfall     Mr Chairman, this isn’t going to relieve your gloom, I fear, but that of  some people--which seems to be the increasing probability of a tax cut of some kind  More and  more, the newspapers are full of not only political but economists’ statements pointing in that  direction, and I think one has to begin making one’s forecast, to begin to think what kind of a tax  cut this might be  I would very much hope that it would be something that is at least in part  oriented toward investment, not all oriented toward consumption  I hope it would be something  short-lived  I think it would have some negative confidence elements, but on balance I would  think it would be expansionary if it isn’t made permanent  If it’s made permanent, I think the  confidence element would become more serious  Well, this cannot be in our projections here,  obviously, but I do suggest that it’s not an unrealistic expectation     As I look at the liquidity, Mr Chairman, first, I share Frank Morris’s  feelings that, in technical terms, using the usual measurements of liquidity applying to the  working capital, liquid assets, debt/equity and so forth, we are not in a very liquid condition   We’ve made some improvement, but it’s small improvement compared to long-term  deterioration  Liquidity at the present time exists in the sense of plenty of funds around--could  very well be the result of slack business rather than a cause of better business  That is always a  possibility  So the fact that there are seemingly idle funds around does not suggest to me  necessarily that these funds are going to go to work     As for the gains from easing, I think that they’re probably not likely to be that great   There’s even a danger at this time  To start easing late in an expansion--after all, it’s a year and a  half, now, into this--could get us to the point where, if this took and really were effective, it  could cause us to hit the capacity ceiling a year or two from now with too much speed  We made  that mistake before     Well, saying all this, I come out for a slight easing  I’m not too much concerned by the  longer-term interest consequences of something like alternative A--that we would have to raise  rates substantially later on  Aside from the fact that we can change the one-year target, I think  base drift alone, if it occurs, would take care of this and not necessarily drive us into higher  interest rates  So I would recommend a 3 to 7 on M1; 9-1/2 to 13-1/2 on M2; and 4-1/4 to 5-1/4  on the funds rate, bearing in mind that I think we are slipping into a dangerous habit if we narrow  the funds rate  We’ve put ourselves into a box, and I’d like to keep us at least at a 1 percentage  point [range for the funds rate]     That’s right, up to 3 to 7 percent     Oh, M2, 9-1/2 to 13-1/2     Provided there’s no base drift     11/16/76 - 44 -             Mr Chairman, we have three documents here, and concerning these  there are four actions that the Subcommittee [on Foreign Currency Instruments] recommends be  taken  Let me just specify the documents  One is the Authorization for Foreign Currency  Operations, given to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which corresponds to a similar type     12/20-21/76 - 7 -         of document for domestic open market operations  The second is the Foreign Currency  Directive, which corresponds to the directive that we formulate every month within the domestic  field  And a third document that has no counterpart in the domestic area, entitled Procedural  Instructions, which serves to pull together internal relations between the Manager, the Foreign  Currency Subcommittee [of the FOMC], and the Committee  And finally, in addition to these  three documents that the subcommittee recommends approving, there is a fourth, entitled Special  Authorization, which deals with some aspects of the main authorization     This authorization was circulated to the members of the Committee  along with the other documents, and I hope you had a chance to familiarize yourself with it   We’ve received a number of comments, which were very helpful, from within the [Federal  Reserve] Board, and as a result, the subcommittee, consisting of Mr MacLaury and myself--in  the past, Dick Debs--have made some changes in the authorization and also and more  specifically in the other two documents, so that these documents now embody all the  recommendations--to the extent that they could be accommodated--that we received  The  authorization--you will find it on attachment B to the document of December 14, and it is also in  the document of November 12, as attachment A  You can work from either one     The authorization is the broad framework within which the instructions [from] the  Committee to the New York Bank Manager are given  It sets forth the currencies in which the  Manager may operate, it sets forth the swaps that he may maintain, and the amounts of these  swaps  It gives him the broad guidelines for how he is to operate in cooperation with the foreign  central banks [unintelligible] coordination currency holding ought to be invested, daily reports to  the foreign currency subcommittee, and a number of items of that kind     In this authorization, we have no major changes  There’s been some shifting of materials  to the so-called procedural instructions, which are the third document, and furthermore, there is  now a somewhat greater integration with the three [documents] than was evident when the draft  was first circulated on November 8  By making a reference in the authorization to the  procedural instructions, there is a legal difference among these documents  In this sense, we  should have to publish the first two--the authorization and the directive--in the Federal Register  at once and in the Record of Policy Actions after 30 days  We should speak to the procedural  instructions, the way they are handled, when we get to that document  A different publication  requirement is advised there     If you go to the beginning of the document, the first page, does it say  September 14?  What date does it give you there?     November 12  That is related but does not contain all the material that  [unintelligible]     I can tell you in general what the point is without referring to it  It was  renewed--     That’s how we practice it  It’s always for 3 months  Sometimes with a  short renewal for another 3 months, rarely for more, but it can be extended up to 12 months     As far as our lending operations are concerned, yes; as far as borrowing  operations have been concerned, as you know, we sometimes exceeded that     12/20-21/76 - 9 -           Yes, that’s correct     Does say 12 months     There’s no legal limit, but this is a policy     That’s where a sentence was removed, I think, specifying that no  artificial exchange rate be set  What this here says is that the foreign central bank and the  Federal Reserve reciprocally guarantee each other the exchange rate--that intervening exchange  rate movements would not affect the value of the payments  Now in addition to--     Apart from purchases from the foreign central bank, which are in effect  reversals of the swap and repayment, if there are purchases in the market, such as when we’re  engaging--     --such as we’re engaging in with the Swiss, for instance, that we  engaged in with the Belgians--those ought to be at a market rate and not at some other artificially  set rate     Yes     These operating arrangements refer, I think, to the cases where there is a  coordination with a foreign central bank     Well, this was language that was negotiated, and it bears on an  important point--that the Treasury is an important factor in this area  It’s not like the domestic  area  And the word “consultation” seemed to reduce, or may seem to reduce, the role of the  Treasury     12/20-21/76 - 11 -           These are not swap arrangements     We have “cooperate” in the next paragraph on foreign monetary  authorities     Let me just say, this is one of the words that were quite heavily  negotiated  So I would feel that we ought to at least inform them--you may not believe it--but  two grown-up men meeting six times, holding 10 hours of discussion, mostly on the first  sentence of this document  And, yes, [taking] this quite seriously     Right now I can only give you the answer that it appeared in a different  form in an earlier draft of this  Apparently not--I can’t find it to be in the existing directive   That form was objected to, and as a result, this language was found which set the Secretary of  the Treasury one stage higher, in the degree of consultation, than foreign monetary authorities,  with whom we cooperate but not collaborate     I think that the effort to go back to the word now and change it would  certainly not escape attention     I’d be glad to do that     Yes, I think you should be aware that the philosophy that the Treasury  seeks to impart in the international monetary system is one of clean floating  And so their view  was that the only grounds for intervention were two  counter disorderly markets and, second, act  when foreign monetary authorities have been violating a section of the proposed article 4 of the  IMF, which prohibits manipulating exchange rates or trying to gain an unfair advantage     Our argument was that markets aren’t that perfect, that conditions might arise in which  extreme values might be reached by the dollar and that it would then become desirable, to the  very limited extent that it would be possible, to intervene in the market to correct that  It’s very  difficult to change the rate of the dollar in the scale of operations that seemed feasible for us   [After] very extensive discussion, it was agreed to accept this proposition but to incorporate it in  these torturous terms where the word “actions” refers to the actions of foreign monetary  authorities, and “behavior” refers to the behavior of the market     That it’s being approved by legislative action by the membership  The  US has approved the legislation, and it’s expected that it will go into force when the right  number of countries has approved it  It’s not yet--     Well there is a description in the subcommittee’s report to the  Committee on this     It is all the legislative history that sort of forms the [unintelligible] of a  file in which this has been annotated over and over again  But no letters have been exchanged or  other formal communications     No, this gives us the possibility--suppose that, through aggressive  intervention or interest rate action or market events, the dollar should go much higher than it is  now, and suppose this would affect us competitively  If we thought that this was due to action in  the markets not reflecting underlying factors, we would be entitled to move into the market and  try to correct that--I repeat, to the very limited extent that we could influence the rate     Well, the reason for removing it in the other place was that it gave a  policy directive in a place where we were simply writing a broad framework for authorization   So it belongs in here, that it is correct  What is in here is now the maximum I think that could be  done under the prevailing circumstances  Intervention is certainly now a great deal more limited  than in the days when we intervened to support the dollar, to safeguard the value of the dollar, to  maintain an equilibrium rate, to supply liquidity, and various other things that we thought we  were doing under a fixed-rate regime     In this framework, here are floating rates--[there] is no implication that anyone knows the  right rate, therefore there is nothing here to say that we are to establish or attain any particular  rate  It’s simply a statement of what can be done within a system of floating  There is a  considerable advantage to the United States in having others float cleanly because one of the  troubles with the old system was that the dollar got overvalued, but we couldn’t correct it   Others pegged to the dollar  Today the dollar is free, but only so long as others do not interfere  with that freedom in the market  Therefore we have an interest in urging others to float cleanly   If we want to do that, we ought to have a conduct that manifests the same intention on our part in  a directive that, at any rate, doesn’t say overtly that we might violate that principle     12/20-21/76 - 16 -           I would add to this, Mr Chairman, it’s not my basic philosophy either,  but it certainly is the philosophy under which the US has been operating for the last year     The third document was modified by the December 17 memorandum by  Mr Broida, so that, if you’re following it from the document of December 14, please bear that in   mind  Let me just summarize what happens here  In the old authorization, where much of this  comes from, there was a variety of activities and transactions that were authorized which had  various historical origins  And there was no clear limitation on what the Manager could do by  himself, what the subcommittee could do, and what could be done only with the Committee     Here we have tried to, first, pull together all types of operations and define them as the  overall open position, which means the total risk exposure on which we could suffer loss  That  covers all currencies  Then we have the open position in a single currency, and finally we have  gross transactions, which are simply the operations over a given period of time  The overall  exposure that we’ve [specified] in the authorization is limited  here, the Manager is limited to  $100 million a day in changing the overall position, and $300 [million] since the regular  meeting  He is further limited to $100 [million] a day anyway on gross transactions regardless of  how that affects the overall open position  And beyond that, he has to clear with the  subcommittee  He also has to clear any swap drawing proposal by a foreign bank with the  subcommittee     Then, when operations go beyond that size, the subcommittee or the Manager clears, with  the Committee as a whole, [those] transactions that would affect the overall open position in  excess of $500 million, and [they] would have to clear with the full Committee any swap  exceeding $200 million  The meaning of that is that this is a limit on what the subcommittee can  authorize the Manager to do, and the subcommittee can authorize changes in overall open  positions up to $500 million and foreign swaps up to 200 million, or 15 percent of the size of the     12/20-21/76 - 17 -         total swap  The $200 million is smaller than the full size of any swap, so the subcommittee  never authorizes a full amount [for] any swap  Under the 15 percent, the subcommittee could go  up to, for the largest--$3 billion swaps--up to $450 million     That is true  If some emergency should arise in which clearance with  the full Committee is not feasible in the time available, then this would be done  I think this is  not an unreasonable power because the contingencies could be large, if you read Charlie  Coombs’s book  On one occasion, the Manager had to act on a sizable scale on his own because  he could not reach anybody  Ordinarily this is, I think, not likely to happen     No, the subcommittee does everything with the Manager in the way of  clearing a swap from zero to 200     No Manager’s discretion     The way we think it reads, I think, is exactly the way it’s intended to  work  Let me go over it  Under 1, the Manager shall clear with the subcommittee; however, if  [clearing with] the subcommittee isn’t feasible, then with the Chairman--any transaction that  would change the overall open position by $100 million in one day and any gross transaction  exceeding $100 million  So he’s free to engage in either kind of transaction  Gross transactions  up to $100 [million] or a transaction that changes the overall open position by $100 [million]  without the benefit of clearance  Scott Pardee has just said that, as a practical matter, he doesn’t  do that; he consults for amounts that are much smaller  But within this $100 million, he has a  degree of freedom, so long as it doesn’t involve the activation of a swap or so long as it doesn’t  involve nonroutine transactions  This you find at the end of the piece that is paragraph 3     Well, we’ve reversed this a number of times, and the word “not” is there  very deliberately  One could perhaps phrase it positively, that the Manager shall clear with the  subcommittee [under item] (c), every swap drawing up to $200 [million]  And then later, the  larger ones will be cleared with the full Committee, according to (b) But I think this is perfectly  clear in what it says     I regard that as useful because that relieves the Manager of the  responsibility of deciding whether or not it is possible to clear, and he shouldn’t be in a position  to make that decision, it seems to me     The Chairman does make that decision     Well, that is possible in the case when consultation with the full  Committee isn’t feasible in the time available or even with the subcommittee  These are,  however, fallback positions      I may draw your attention to the directive, the previous document we  dealt with  The first paragraph does state the purpose, not so much of swaps but of foreign  currency operations in general  And our operations are dependent on having a swap so that we  can obtain currency, and in some cases the operations on the other side are dependent on their  having a swap so they can obtain dollars  And the purpose, therefore, of the operation of the  swaps is here generally directed at [countering] disorderly market conditions provided, etc, and  this proviso clause implies there may be other motivations, mainly market failure and  manipulation on the part of others     That is in page 2  All of the subcommittee, etc     The purpose of this is to lift the ceiling--the authorization said that,  long-run, [it is] $1 billion  Since we’ve got a Swiss swap outstanding close to $11 billion, we  need to make an exception for that  That’s the purpose of this special authorization     12/20-21/76 - 23 -           Well, I think that we ought to realize that this is an extremely important  matter which can play a very great role in the success of monetary policy  It has been the  experience of the System from Bank to Bank that by focusing on interest rates and the funds rate,  but more broadly on interest rates, it has believed [itself] to be doing one thing when actually the  force of the aggregates are not adequately observed [and] cause the Committee to be doing  something else     Typically, the central bank that pursues interest rate policies always looks good cyclically   In the recession, interest rates go down, and so it seems that the central bank has done the right  thing  In an expansion, interest rates go up, so the central banks seem to have done the right  thing  That’s fine  If you look at the money supply behavior during these periods, the money  supply may well have been behaving procyclicly instead of anticyclicly  That is to say, during a  recession, even though interest rates went down, money supply may have slowed or even shrunk;  and during expansion, even though interest rates seem to be exerting a braking role, actually they  were not rising enough to exert an effective brake, and the money supply was expanding more  than normally     Now that is why essentially I think there is something to be said for an aggregates target as  against interest rate [targets] in general, and the narrower range for [the path of] nonborrowed  reserves and targets as against the funds targets  It is certainly true that nonborrowed reserves  has a high cost  It makes the funds rate tend to roam, and we all know that this unsettling [of the  markets] has been damaging in many ways  At the same time, the more we try to avoid these  unsettlements at these costs, the more we tie the whole rate structure to the funds rate because  the market knows of our reluctance to move the funds rate unless it is necessary  And so when it  does see the funds rate move, it anticipates a change in policy and moves with it  And so  gradually it becomes harder to move the funds rate, the cost becomes greater, and the danger that  we are moving inadequately and allowing the aggregates to move too far one way or the other  becomes more real     I am not arguing here to adopt a nonborrowed reserves target  I do think that [would be]  too unsettling, even though after a period of time that unsettlement would wear off as the funds  rate became somewhat uncoupled from the rest of the rate structure  What I am arguing for is  more willingness to move the funds rate in order to avoid the danger of having the aggregates get  away from us, because if we do that deliberately, I think we can forestall that danger  That  means, however, moving not toward a narrower funds rate [range], as we seem to have been  doing lately, but toward a wider funds rate [range], more frequent reversals of funds rate  movements if necessary--accustoming the market to [expect] that such things may happen and  that this need not dominate the movement of the whole rate structure  That way we may be  keeping our hands on interest rates [and] at the same time making sure that the aggregates can’t  get away from us     Well, the recommendations with respect to the future treatment of the  nonborrowed reserve number, I think could [be consistent with] what I had in mind, namely,  consent can be reached that we should be more flexible on the funds rate  I think one could even  argue about the cyclical timing at which one might move in that direction, but, generally, what I  had in mind is something that we would be aware [of], not something that goes into effect as of a  certain date      No      Lyle, your projections suggest at the very tail end--last quarter of  1977--a rather alarming acceleration in the rate of growth, going above 6 percent, which would  be in the third year of recovery  Also, as Mr Partee has pointed out, there are strengths in quite  a lot of other areas--private investment would be surging to 20 percent, this all in nominal terms,  and [unintelligible] constant prices should not accelerate  So one gets the picture here of  [unintelligible] accelerating factors late in 1977 [unintelligible], which does seem to be rather  ominous  Anyway, when you can, peer beyond this as possibly a temporary thing that you can  look into [regarding] ’78     Once more on the question of M1 and M2, if I may--why we can’t  choose from looking at the data  I’d like to get Steve’s view on that, whether that has some  numeric [calibration]  Whereas M1 is marginally understated at the present, the growth of M2 is  very substantially overstated  I say this in terms of a normal relationship, 2 or 3 percentage  points difference  At the present time, the difference, 4-1/4 to 6-1/8, we’re now 2 percentage  points understated [for] M1  Then ask ourselves, what, on the basis of M1, equals 4 at the  present?  What would M2 be?  We get a very substantially lower figure than the 10 to 12 that  we’ve got now  And I attribute that, of course, to the same denominator that everybody else is  mentioning     Mr Chairman, I don’t see a great deal of strength in the economy  The  current data have improved, as one would expect if we’re not going to switch paths  I think the  monetary aggregates are not that strong, and M2 I see largely overstated  If there were a fiscal  policy push ahead, I would say that no monetary policy stimulation would be needed at the  present time  What impresses me is the outlook for a significant fiscal push, and for the big  leverage that it seems to have, and for the lateness [with] which it seems to impact  And it raises  the question to me whether we’re again in danger of mid-expansion over stimulation  This has  happened before, and it has led to an acceleration in the latter phase of the expansion when  actually we should be phasing down to the long-term growth rate for a soft landing  This is what  mainly gives me pause now--suggesting that we should continue easing a little more  I add to  that, as others have, the weakness of the dollar, the high rate of wholesale prices--materials  prices     Well, given these concerns, which now I think are more on the upside than the downside,  I’d go pretty close [to] alternative B  Except I would like to see the funds rate widened on  general grounds--I guess that would be from 4 to 5--and the aggregates seem all right to me   4-1/2 to 6-1/2; 9 to 13  I think the funds rate might well be asymmetrical and stay at 4-5/8   [Unintelligible]     I continue to prefer an aggregates directive  And while the present aggregates directive is  all right, I would like to add that, since it doesn’t give one a choice in either quarterly periods,  perhaps we ought to think about providing a choice, making it more to the short-term ranges than  to the long-term ranges  Otherwise, two times out of three, the aggregates directives isn’t very  meaningful unless we’ve openly incorporated the longer-run specs--     Unless we move to specify the short term     No, by using numbers     The purpose of the agreement--which exists in principle, and its main  components remain to be finalized in a few details--is to reduce official sterling balances  These  have been a disturbing element due to their volatility  The agreement provides that the BIS  [Bank for International Settlements] will finance the Bank of England to the extent that these  balances are reduced, except by bond funding and to the extent that the British reserves  simultaneously go down  The details are to be worked out  If the BIS cannot fully carry through  that financing, it has a fallback with respect to the participating central banks     Now, the Bank of England is committed to use its best efforts to reduce official sterling  balances to working balances  First, by a funding operation offering some of the major holders  of official balances 5- to 10- year bonds, 75 percent of which, at a maximum, would be in  dollars, the rest in nondollar and nonsterling currencies  Second, whatever is left of the total  balances after this operation, [the goal would be] to bring that down to the level of working  balances  The detail of that is not described, but it could consist of various administrative  measures  Broadly speaking, we’re talking about something like £2 billion sterling, or $34  billion [equivalent]; maybe half a billion pounds of that could be funded  Maybe something like  £1 billion might remain as working balances, and the other half billion would have to worked off  over time     This is to be done in cooperation with and under the supervision of the Managing Director  of the IMF [International Monetary Fund]  The Managing Director of the IMF will confer with  the UK jointly with the governors of the participating central banks to observe the progress  made  Should it turn out that progress is not satisfactory during the two years during which the  stand-by agreement is in effect, or if the UK should become ineligible to draw under the IMF’s  stand-by during these two years, then the facility can be suspended  In that case, also, the  amounts already drawn will be required to be repaid within 120 days unless the agreement is  reconstituted  These are the principle parts of the agreement  Do you want me to go into the  Treasury side of this?     1/17-18/77 - 2 -             That is correct  However, the BIS is obligated to repay only to the  extent that it is being repaid by the Bank of England, except for its own small 4 percent share     Yes     Well, the first question is how the BIS establishes its rate with respect to  the Bank of England  Then we would normally lend at the Treasury bill rate for swaps  If, for  some reason, that’s inappropriate because it would give the BIS, for instance, too large a margin,  I’m sure we could adjust that     Yes     Well, I don’t think there’s much to add  What we are doing is protecting  ourselves as a central bank to make sure that this remains a short-term operation  We have a  clear take-out     I’m sorry, Mr Chairman, I’ve been focusing on a problem which just  came up and I didn’t follow the discussion     1/17-18/77 - 6 -             May I add something, Mr Chairman?  I think one has to be aware that  this is not only an operation that has been performed before and, therefore, is not innovative   [But also,] it is not the kind of operation where the central bank makes a loan to the government,  which typically gives concern  It is an operation performed under the foreign currency  authorization, a purchase of currency, and in that respect, I think, does not carry the kind of  connotation that a loan to the Treasury would     It’s not even tied to the sterling as such, although that may be the main  asset at a given time in the ESF, but if the ESF has other currencies--any currencies [on which]  there is an authorization to purchase can be made the object of the transaction     Well, it has to be a swap currency for which a swap is authorized  Now,  within the limits of the swap authorization, that is a do-able operation     No, not without a new authorization     I had a preliminary conversation with Sam Cross  Mr Yeo is travelling   The view is that as a general principle, they would like to publish  However, they would first  like to see the final text, and second they’d like to touch base with the appropriate members of  the Congress before that is done     The Germans are still in surplus  [Otmar] Emminger [of the  Bundesbank] said that they are willing to accept a deficit, as was stated in the press  And my  question is, does the German intervention suggest that they are merely trying to iron out minor  market fluctuations, or are they positively resisting a upward trend in the D-mark?     Well, I share what Mr Partee says about the full employment deficit  In  addition to the financial consequences, it also shows the greater limitations in the way of capital  expenditures that we face once the economy is operating at a high level again and the problem,  therefore, of getting an adequate amount of capital spending     Well, the other point I wanted to make is the stimulus that is being proposed to be put into  the economy, not in fiscal ’78 but in the following year  The program is divided in those two  parts  The second part is more iffy than the first, but they seem to be of about equal  size--$15 billion apiece  And I’m asking whether we’re not repeating the mistakes that have  been made in the past--of overstimulating late in an expansion  In putting in a two-year  program, are we in danger of getting into the fourth year of expansion and overheating, and if so,  what is the proper stance for monetary policy?  So, my question really goes to what is the likely  effect of this second part, the second year of the fiscal program, to the extent that one can now  assess it?     And I think many people would say that 49 is lower than can be  reached, actually for labor force reasons rather than for capital capacity reasons     On the fact that there was an overshoot in M2 and M3, I would like to  explore this a little  If we were to continue with the same ranges for M2 and M3, we would be  doing nothing to correct for that overshoot  In other words, we would be allowing base drift to  proceed  Now this is a convenient way of dealing with a past event, but it does not reflect the  intentions that we had three months ago when we set this target  If, on the other hand, we bring  down the range for M2 and M3, we would be making a correction of this overshoot, and I think  that should carry some weight     Now, as to whether to reduce the upper or the lower end and whether these reductions  should involve a change in the midpoint with respect to six months ago, is a more complex  matter  There is some logic in bringing down the upper end, precisely because  of the overshoot  element  On the other hand, we’ve learned, I think, from the experience of past hearings, that  Congress is more sensitive to the upper than the lower ends     Now let me comment for a moment on M2 and M3  I don’t feel like giving much weight  to M2 and M3 in the short run  In the long run, M2 has turned out to have been remarkably  stable--over the last 15 years  I can only think at the present time that this is the result of two  conflicting trends  The M1 component has all the instability that M1 has, and the time and  savings deposit component has instabilities which we are familiar with, namely the  intermediation process that occurs because market interest rates are low  So, stability here is, I  think, [a] balance [of] conflicting forces, either of which could change, and for that reason M2 in  the short-run does not impress me as a very valuable guide       1/17-18/77 - 49 -           I think the logic of the situation is that M2 will tend to move more slowly as interest rates  go up, and in that sense, my concerns about base drift will be allayed  Also, the inconsistency  that has been observed on the M1, M2, [and] M3 targets--the trends are just not in line with the  way our ranges are set up  That, too, I think is likely to come more into line [if], over the years,  interest rates go up     One last concern--the targets ought to be flexible  We want to be able to change our  minds  The only consistent action we have taken is to lower them over time  This, too, is an  element where flexibility or inflexibility can play a role  I agree with you, Mr Chairman--there  is never a good time  I suspect that now is perhaps a better time than three months from now to  do it  I would like to caution us that we may run out of half percents, which [unintelligible] to  reduce over time as we go, if we operate on the fringes as we have to, if we do that on a quarterly  basis  So--     Well, I feel apprehensive about quarterly changes  This one, it seems to  me, has a good deal of logic, and I support the reductions in the lower ends of the M2 and M3   So I do not arrive at a different conclusion  But there are some considerations here, I think, that  at some time might need to be examined more in depth     There is a lot of work done on this which shows that, over 15 years, M2  has been very stable     Steve, we’ve chosen for the long-term ranges something close to  alternative B  If we were now to choose something like alternative C for the two-month ranges,  then, of course, the interest rates path of Appendix 3 will not apply  But there will be something  like the usual pattern, which shows that C means a higher funds rate earlier on but a lower funds  rate relative to the other alternative later on     I think the matter that should dominate our thinking is the prospective  bulge, and that’s been very troublesome in the past  I therefore feel that Governor Partee has a  very good point in suggesting we accumulate a little reserve  That leads me to alternative B,  shaded downward by 1/2 point on each end  Once the bulge is within immediate distance, I  would also go to a money market directive  This time, I would stay with an aggregates directive   And with that in mind, I do lean toward a wider funds rate specification and would like to go  with 4-1/4 to 5-1/4, bearing in mind that we should begin to guard against the bulge at this time     I think that’s highly desirable, also, in the interest of softening up the  precision of these things a little     Even temporarily?  On the way to recovery or to some full employment  goal?     Well, I see things somewhat as Mr Volcker does  I note all sorts of  arguments as to why capacity pressures are not likely and why the experience in ’73 and ’66,  when it went to 89, is not relevant  But nevertheless, I think we have the fact that we’ve greatly  changed our data and that these do show that we have a good deal less capacity  We know now  it takes a lot more time to bring capacity on stream  Somebody here the other day said that, on  some project, it took five years before you could put a spade in the ground  And under those  conditions, I’m not very hopeful that these capacity margins that we still have are adequate     Well, I listened to a discussion of business economists the other day in  which even more micro and nonmonetary approaches to prices all led to an impression of  downward price pressures, which seemed very gratifying  But my own look at these numbers  always is a little bit above what yours is  Wage increases--I think we would have to be a little  optimistic to get 7-1/2 to 8  Productivity, 3 percent--well we might be able to do that  So that  allowing for some losses from things like drought, oil, other adverse factors, we might be  underestimating our rate of price increase  That is what I fear     And the question I want to attach to this is, we have now mapped out what is a relatively  slow rate of recovery-- growth about 50 percent above long-term trends  As I remember, in the  past people would talk about 100 percent above the trend quarterly growth rate sometimes--8  percent with a trend assumed to be 4 [percent]  We ought to be getting downward pressures on  prices simply from excess capacity and unemployment  And countries like Germany and  Switzerland are getting this and have been quite successful  Why is it that this doesn’t seem to  be clearly happening in the US?     God help us then     God help us then     If I may interject, I do see things somewhat that way, but late in the  cycle, everybody will realize that [they don’t] have enough capacity, that they should have  invested earlier, there [will] come a great rush in this--bottlenecks in capital goods industries   And that’s exactly how I negatively interpret the belief that, at some time, we all should go  ahead     There seem to have been significant shifts in interest rate relationships,  with the principal rise in rates [being] in the medium-term Treasuries  What does that imply for  the market’s expectations of future rate movements?  [Is it] an indication of sharper rate  increases in the area immediately below that in maturity?     2/15/77 - 22 -             I wanted to ask a question about appendix table 3, which shows implied  velocity growth rates  Now the growth rates that would eventuate under the various alternatives  are pretty high--particularly when you look toward the third and fourth quarter, they are  remarkably high for V2, because typically that doesn’t fluctuate that much  Now, I think Steve  has given a partial answer to the implied concern here, by pointing to the high degree of liquidity  and the ability of the economy to take care of a growing demand for credit out of its existing  resources  But I’m still puzzled by something like on alternative A and B, almost an 8 percent  rise in velocity requirements  How does that come about?  Do you expect a very low rate of  money growth at that time after the initial blip in the earlier part of the year?     In the absence of rising interest rates, allowing for the special factors  that are operative now on the demand for M1, did you say how large that trend growth rate  would be?     Yes, I do     7     2/15/77 - 25 -             Well, that would be a growth velocity of about 4 percent, if M1 grew at  7 percent     Well, I think one can sort of decompose what’s happening to V2 to the  extent that it contains M1 or if there is an increase in velocity  Now, if there’s disintermediation,  one would of course expect an increase in velocity during that period because M2 would be  rising at a less than trend rate     Well, I think our concerns once more are more with inflation than with  growth now that the pause seems clearly over the dam  We also see some substantive blips  ahead in the aggregates due to rebates, refunds, rebounds  As I look at those velocity estimates  and the associated interest rate increases, I’m [sufficiently] troubled by the pressures that may be  ahead that I’d like to lay in a little reserve against all of these things     So I would lean toward alternative B, with a slight shading toward C to widen the funds  rate 1/4 point on the upside, 4-1/4 to 5-1/4, and leave M1 as is  In M2, I’d go with Mr Black, 6  to 10; I think that’s an interesting innovation      There is no basic disagreement at all on my part with the subcommittee   I do feel that stressing aggregates is a defense for us, even though the Chairman has pointed out  many times that Congress really thinks in terms of interest rates and that hiding behind good- looking aggregates will not help us if interest rates go up  I think there is some defense   Moreover, there is substance here  In an inflation, interest rates, both are less meaningful--we  don’t know what the real rate really is--and they are less controllable  Our span of control over,  certainly, long-term rates may be minimal, maybe zero     So I would like to do what one can to stress that we are focusing on the aggregates, and  hence I’d like to add the word “target” to ranges, so that it’s clear it’s a target     And I’d like to substitute for the rather timid “appear to be consistent with,” which is good  for the Federal Reserve prose but really doesn’t, I think, influence anybody else  Say “reflect,”  which is still very much Federal Reserve--a very modest, cautious term--and yet I think a little  stronger in focusing on what I think we mean--namely, that we try to set an aggregate and try to  exert our influence on the economy through it      Mr Chairman, excuse me, there is a point--      Alan, you interpret the Swiss franc decline as a relaxation of tensions,  which seems plausible  At the same time, we’ve got the rising gold price, usually stated to mean  the opposite--do you see some way of reconciling this?     It looks as though there were a solid, nonspeculative [demand] under  that price     I wonder whether we’d be helped in looking at the price situation by  distinguishing between the macro and micro elements  I think our discussion has been in good  part on micro aspects--particular prices, particular sectors  And while, in the past, I have always  heard industry people predominately talk about the absence of [macro-type] pressures, the  conversation here has been predominately focusing on where there are pressures  I find myself  somewhat confused     What I am going to ask you is, [what weight do these] two elements carry in your forecast?   We have capacity, which I think is less large than most people think at the present time, [but]  nevertheless, it is substantial  There are wage increases, and they do not seem to be accelerating  significantly  There is monetary and fiscal policy  Monetary policy, I think, one can hardly say  is excessively stimulatory  Fiscal policy has a question mark  On the whole, I would look at the  macro variables as being more nearly on the side of a slow rate of increase in prices  The micro I  have a difficulty in telling  What is the weight that you would attach to these things, Jerry?     If I may follow up on Frank Morris’s point, I think these two things--the  projected rise in velocity, which is really remarkable, and the contrary indication of business  plant financing needs--do belong together  But maybe they belong together in a different way   Namely, that at a time when there is no great pressure for business financing, there is then the  possibility of getting much more work and turnover out of the given money supply because the     3/15/77 - 17 -           money supply isn’t being increased by business financing  So that we might get high rates of  increase of velocity without the kind of interest rate pressure that’s--     At least this is a hypothesis  I am troubled and puzzled by this very high  increase in velocity, including a high increase in V2, which supposedly does not move around  that much     Can one try to anticipate the behavior of businesses as they look toward  the rebates and the bulge?  Is it reasonable to think that it will be different from the behavior of  banks, in that the businesses must anticipate a spurt in sales, therefore an increase in liquidity?   This ought to cause them to be less liquid in advance, knowing that these funds are likely to  come to them     I wouldn’t disagree with your analysis that it might call for an increase  in inventory  But the more immediate look ahead suggests simply that more cash is going to  come in, and they may meet that from existing inventory as well as from a previous buildup  So  that the main impact of looking ahead to the bulge would seem to me would be in the demand for  M1 and other liquid assets     Well, it seems to me that we have a decision more of strategy than of  economics here  The economics of the situation, for what my view on it is worth--we have  shocks ahead  They come mostly from the monetary side, but to some extent inventory  accumulation also from the real side  That counsels, broadly speaking, sticking with interest  rates and letting the aggregates run     But that argument, it seems to me, is dominated by broader considerations  In the medium  run, we’re going to have the prospect of rising interest rates  The earlier we face up to that, I  think, the less that increase will have to be and the better off we are  We’re quite well positioned  to meet this  The aggregates have been slow, and we’ve accumulated some reserves, as it were,  there  I think we ought to go on accumulating as long as we can until the bulge hits us     And that leads me to suggest, first, pulling down the aggregates a little from alternative B,  as you proposed, Mr Chairman--4-1/2 to 8-1/2 for M1; 7 to 11 looks all right for M2; funds rate,  I would widen a little on the up side, 4-1/4 to 5-1/4, and I would, over the period, suggest drifting  up to 4-3/4 if nothing unexpected happens  And despite all this emphasis on the funds rate, I  would stick with an aggregates directive, because in the days ahead I think it would be important  to draw public attention, even with a lag, to the aggregates rather than to interest rates     If I may interject here  The overall figures, percent of GNP, do point in  the direction that you say, Chuck  I look upon them the same way  I’m struck by the fact that  the acquisitions by households, which are usually the marginal element--the regular sources  don’t produce enough, then the procedure used here squeezes it into household--do not increase     4/19/77 - 18 -           their share as a percentage of disposable income over the quarters following the second half of  ’76  It remains pretty flat at a little below 10 percent     Well, those go up because they assume some disintermediation     So we do assume that some more credit instruments have to be pushed  into the household sector?     But in lieu of what they would otherwise put into thrift institutions, so  that the aggregate demand of their savings doesn’t increase     I have two questions  We’re going through a period of very rapid  changes in the picture  first the snapback from the cold spell, now the withdrawal of the rebate,     4/19/77 - 19 -           thereafter possibly the impact of the energy message, so that one cannot expect a very smooth  evolution of the cycle  But is there reason to think that the expansion is less well balanced now  than it appeared a year ago or so, the main imbalancing to be a rather slow advance of business  capital spending?  Everything else was coming along pretty well, in balance  Now, my  impression is that housing is very strong, automobiles are very strong--and that raises the  question of whether there are some imbalances developing here  This is my first point     Second relates to my favorite subject, capital needs  There was a piece in the Wall Street  Journal a little while ago which suggested that pressures for acceleration of capital spending  tended to develop in recent cyclical periods at higher and higher levels of capacity utilization   Originally they used to begin, that is an acceleration of capital spending, in the low 80s of  capacity utilization  Now they have moved up to the upper 80s, and in fact were getting into the  area where capacity pressure shortages were typically beginning  Is there anything to that kind  of analysis?     If it is the way it’s been described, at least there is the advantage that [it]  does work through the price mechanism, mainly taxes and rebates, and--      Well, that would be very difficult in today’s conditions if you want to  achieve those objectives     Yes     I’d like to set forth new considerations  First, I think when we set  longer-run ranges we ought to look at the base drift which has taken place, and this is very  usefully reflected in the appendix here  Over the last quarter or so, there hasn’t been significant  base drift, so we [do not] have much getting back on track to do  If we go back one quarter  further [to a third-quarter base], we see that M1 is pretty much on track, but M2 and M3 actually  overshot, so that [if] we wanted to go back to that track we have to come down somewhat for the  actual higher aggregates     Certainly, it seems to me, we’ve got to look at the general fact that inflation has  accelerated as a result of outside forces, in a very small way the same as the oil shock  After  many debates, I have come to the conclusion that such an event should not be fully  accommodated by a monetary policy that would just build the price increase into the economy  permanently as a continuing rate of inflation  Neither could it be ignored fully, because that  might create a high degree of monetary stringency, and so I tend to feel that, other things equal,  which in this case they are not, one should accommodate that in part     The third set of considerations is that we have major changes on the fiscal side and on the  side of the Administration  Fiscal policy has just given the signal that plans were too  expansionary and they have been cut back  That to me seems to say we should certainly not     4/19/77 - 34 -           compensate that but, if anything, either move in the same direction or stand still  The energy  message--I find it hard to evaluate; a greater uncertainty does suggest doing less     The President’s inflation message, it seems to me, we ought to attach ourselves to very  firmly and take this objective of getting inflation down by 1 percent or so per year very much to  heart, and help the President by getting our aggregates down over time  I think that is an  excellent point both of substance and a talking point     Well--putting these things together, I’ve looked at what’s going to be ahead  What seems  to be likely to me is that interest rates have to go up and that we will be pushed into that by  pressure on the aggregates on the upside  If we do not allow interest rates to go up, then the  aggregates are likely to accelerate  I know this forecast has been wrong before, but it looks  plausible to me now; it’s the best thing one can go with     So what matters are the upper ends of these ranges  It therefore becomes a relatively cheap  shot to reduce the lower ends  I think it unlikely that those [lower limits] would be triggered  I  would argue that we can go down with M1 a half percentage point without achieving much of a  result  The trigger that is likely to be touched is the upper [end]  On M2 and M3, the same  argument, same reasoning, would suggest that one again lowers the lower [limits]  I would be  more inclined to lower the upper part of the range, on the grounds that I would like to bring a  little closer the [triggering] that is likely to cause the rise of interest rates that somehow has to be  distributed over the course of the year  It’s also in conformity with the overshooting that has  occurred over a longer period in the two higher aggregates  So, in summary, I would say on M1,  4 to 6-1/2; on M2, 7 to 9-1/2; and M3, 8-1/2 to 11     Is the change in the shape of the yield structure in your opinion  indicative of a substantially different expectation of the market about short-term rates in quarters  ahead?     Thank you     The growth rates in appendix 4 for V1 and V2 are intended to be over  the first quarter?     Yes     Well, I have no quarrel with the aggregates of B, given the uncertainties   I’m a little troubled by the long stability of the funds rate  I think we’re in danger of  accustoming the market too much to that  Also, I think that there might be more real pressure on     4/19/77 - 45 -           the aggregates than we think and less of a noise element  So I would like to see the funds rate  4-1/2 to 5-1/2 but go up toward the midpoint of that very slowly  Certainly not the first and  second week     Well, I think--     This, I think, performs a function  People have substantial capital gains  in their homes  All they get out of it so far, if they don’t refinance, is higher taxes, so they  actually think they’re poorer when their wealth has increased  Their consumption could  legitimately rise  So therefore, a question of how soundly this financing is handled--but  basically, I think this is a logical and good development, where the financing system fills a gap  which so far has not been filled properly--how to cash in on these capital gains that are quite  invaluable     This [is] compensation for the very high rates of interest that people  have to pay  Unless the property goes up, there is really no justification [for borrowing], but they  are collecting for the interest by remortgaging the property     I wanted to address myself to the same subject as Chuck and look a little  farther ahead, if possible  This recovery is now entering its third year, so it’s beginning to be an  old one, and while there are no clear imbalances--     --a new one, maybe with new life; we certainly wish it a long and happy  life  But what I seem to see in the projections is some kind of a rolling readjustment, with some  things losing strength and other things therefore necessarily being relied on to gain strength if the  expansion is to continue  So if housing were weak--you’ve still got it very strong, but you’ve got  good reasons why it should come down  flows of funds, interest rates  Consumption has carried  this expansion for a long time, autos have been very important in it--we could easily, with the  savings rate rising, have some slowing there  And government, while scheduled to be strong the  next couple of quarters, also into 1978 tapers off     And what we have is businesses fixed investment hopefully coming along and the very  strong inventory numbers in the middle of 1978  Those are the two big elements of the strength   Both are not assured  It’s conceivable that one could have a cycle without an investment surge,  and it is conceivable that that cycle can peter out without ever reaching a credit climax  At any  rate, I think what one has to accept is that the elements that are carrying the thing forward are  changing guard  And what’s carried it so far will probably be relieved , in the next quarter or  two, by some of these new forces, if things work out right     In those days I think your report, Mr Chairman, called it a rolling  readjustment, and [it] went from one sector of strength to another sector of strength, and so there  was hope the business cycle had been overcome     Right, there was a real sequence, first housing in ’54, then cars in ’55,  and plant and equipment thereafter, so it was really going from one support to another  It’s just a  question of whether these things will always show up in time      I am one of those who worried about the economy, but more because I  didn’t understand what was going on than because I had a negative forecast  Now I am  impressed by the very peculiar behavior of the aggregates  I think this may be a time where one  might contemplate a money market directive  I think that no matter what happens to the  aggregates in the immediate future, the second quarter and even the first half will look like a  period of very high monetary expansion, and I would like to hold that down while at the same  time not relying too much [on] what one can guess [about] which way the aggregates are going  to move from here     So I would go with Philip Jackson and widen the aggregates range  My preference there  would be to allow even a negative number in M1, negative 1 to 4; and on M2, 2 to 7  Now the  funds rate--I am impressed by the fact that, according not only to our own forecast but even to  Otto Eckstein, we have got to go up 150 basis points or so by the end of the year  We have taken  one bite right now, but there are three more bites [of] that size ahead  I think we cannot--     Well, that’s a hint according to Otto Eckstein; then more may be ahead  according to--     From here to 6-3/4 or 7  But we’ve three more bites of the size that we  have taken just now  Each time will take a great effort of will on our part to steel ourselves for  that  And given that the aggregates behavior right now has been helping us and justifies the  appearance of a further move, I’d go to a 5-1/4 to 6 on the funds rate and move slowly, not  immediately, to the midpoint of that range  And as I say, I’d be open to a money market  directive on that if there is some spirit for that from the Committee      I just wanted to say I have no difficulties at all with Paul’s proposed  procedure; it seems very reasonable to me  I do think that broader issues are raised here by a  decision to continue or not to continue--namely, present operations seem to be in some measure  a form of competition with the private sector  Banks or dealers might be able to do the same  thing for foreign central banks that we do, and we should not compete unless we have a strong  reason for doing so     One conceivable strong reason for doing that is that if the Desk didn’t do it, the  transactions would move not only out into the New York market but they might move out of the  country to London for tax reasons, or they might even move out of the dollar into other  currencies, reducing the demand for dollars possibly, influencing the exchange rate     So I suggest that the staff here undertake some work to assess these two aspects--the  degree of competition and the possible repercussions on the demand for the dollar--and that  eventually at some time we have a discussion of the FOMC of these matters [so that they do not]  stand in the way of a resolution of the matter the way Paul is suggesting this      5/27/77 - 5 -        Mr Chairman, I find it difficult to believe that this isn’t going to go into  wages at some point  These CPI increases--with a lag, I suspect--are going to influence hourly  earnings     Well, yes, but there’s a lag in these--     Well, I think, Mr Chairman, these things need to be interpreted in the  light of what we have heard about investment predictions  If [the estimate is] correct, despite our  belief that investment is peculiarly low, then we don’t need to attribute this to business  pessimism if the objective facts as embodied in the model seem to say that investment should be  even lower  It must be the peculiar result that the objectives, factors--despite what I would have  thought--point toward low investment  Excess capacity, cost of capital, and whatever goes into  that equation       That’s been my intuitive interpretation, too, and I am surprised at what  the equation says, but I think one has to pay attention to it to some degree      I have a couple of questions concerning rather minor aspects of the data  you present  One has to do with corporate profits  I see that some of the inventory valuation  adjustment and the capital consumption allowances in the first quarter was $40 billion, which is  more than one-quarter of profits before tax; in other words, very large  You then have it going  down in your projection to a much smaller sum, $26 billion, which is one-seventh of the then- expected profits  My question really is, what makes it so large now, and what hope do we have  that it will decline, given that the price trends aren’t all that favorable as projected     On page I-7 of the green pages in the Greenbook  And a little below the  middle of the page     Do you think it’s oil?       That’s [why it seems so odd]  Even those profits that we see are  deceptive, that is, the result of inventory and underdepreciation     My second question, Mr Chairman--in the federal budget, I see that  from the first to the third quarter, we have a massive swing in the high-employment surplus or     6/21/77 - 13 -         deficit going from plus 10 in the first quarter to minus 10 in the third  And I wonder whether  this plays a significant role in your evaluation of the stimulating effect of the budget     You know, I think one needs to look at what goes into it and what are  the factors that produce this result  That’s why I say--when I spoke of a particular equation--see  if it’s the stock market, or excess capacity, or orders, or some other variable     I wonder to what extent open market operations in bills offset what the  Treasury does by running off its bills?  You mentioned one week where the numbers seemed to  be not too dissimilar  But then you said that, over the quarter, the Treasury reduced bills, I  believe, by $10 billion, which surely is much more than the Fed could have sold     Well, the other special factors from time to time--when we have to do  the same for each of them, in the end, then we find that the money supply throughout the year  grows at 55 percent       Well, we’ve worked off most of the bulge of April and the two  following months, but not all of it is for M1  So to be going again at 8 percent in July is  something of a concern  However, this is a special situation, and so I would not take issue with  the alternative B range of 3 to 7 [for M1]  As far as the funds rate is concerned, I hope we can  stay at the present level and take our subsequent moves in discrete steps  So again, I would go  with 5 and 5-3/4, although ordinarily I would prefer a wider range  As far as the directive is  concerned, I have preferred on general principles an aggregates directive     When you observe that some pressures are being brought on the  Japanese with respect to the upcreep in their reserves as a result of nonmarket acquisitions, [do]  you see a tendency there to also try to accumulate, to some extent, high reserves at commercial  banks?      Well, I meant by commercial banks, banks of the Japanese--      The opposite of what the Italians are doing       Well now, what will happen when you get to [a] lower [volume of]  operations if the legislation concerning Treasury interest on balances passes?  Wouldn’t you then  find yourself sometimes in the position, and perhaps quite often, that you are acting in the  markets simply in order to offset something that you’ve done with the foreign accounts?  You  then tell the market, don’t you, that this is a foreign account, you don’t--     So there’s no danger of misleading the market that you’re actually trying  to achieve an objective that isn’t the case     But it could still appear after a while that a very substantial part of total  transactions reflected these customer transactions in the foreign accounts      Well, government operations are one thing you do with a government  institution, but here we are taking business away, it seems to me, from the market  Now is this  analogous to operating in bills on behalf of customers?  If commercial banks did this for a  foreign central bank, would that commercial bank be making a profit or getting maybe some  kind of a collateral advantage out of the operation?      So we are already, by virtue of having all of these securities, taking  something away from the market     Well, I can see there are advantages, but I can also see that the general  principle that one should let the private sector do what it can is in danger of being violated here   There may be many things that we could do better, or at least we could take away from the  private sector, if we were so minded  And I think, unless we can demonstrate that this is very  important to us or that we do it substantially more to the liking of the foreign central bank, there  is a presumption of letting the private sector do it     So there would be some slight pressure on the dollar from possible  movements into other currencies     This kind of operation doesn’t happen in very many countries--     What sorts of comments do you get from the market?  Is there a sense  that they’re being done out of a little business?      Is it important to the private sector?     6/21/77 - 49 -           Balance or actual cash?     I’d feel better about it if there were some specified charge so that we  couldn’t be accused of competing on the basis of no charge, no profit       If we are very useful to them, then wouldn’t they be willing to go and  seek certification?     I’m looking at this as a measure, you know, of the eagerness of the  central banks to have this facility and the importance of it to them  And the result of the test is  that it’s not all that important; they are not willing to run that risk       6/21/77 - 53 -           It’s understood that if we do this, you’ll impose a charge of some for--     Because you have been able to do it only due to a large movement     I wonder how we’ll proceed in the market  Is the market aware of the  moderate intervention you’ve been doing?     7/19/77 - 3 -       And how are we perceived by the Europeans?  As doing enough so that  we’re not going to [be] blamed for benign neglect?     The underlying economics are quite debatable, it seems to me  An  exchange rate move does not change a current account very much until a year or two later  So  that’s really what we’re saying--these exchange rate movements are necessary to alter the  German, Japanese, etcetera, surplus one or two years down the road  Now, by that time, who  knows what cyclical developments may have done  We think that part of our present deficit is  cyclical  It will continue to be so next year but perhaps get somewhat worse  But eventually,  one would think that other countries would catch up with us  Meanwhile, the short-run effect of  an exchange rate move is the familiar J curve  In other words, the Germans sell the same amount  of goods at slightly higher prices and realize higher dollar receipts and a bigger surplus, for some  months at least     And the rate of speed is really the only thing we can influence  When  you look at these large amounts that Europeans, not primarily Germany and Switzerland--Alan  said the British and the Italians--billions they’ve thrown into the market  We couldn’t operate on  that scale, and so we could not expect to do very much to the longer-term outcome of the rate  movement  But we can moderate the speed of the movement, and to the extent that that has  something to do with the long-term outcome, then we do have some significance     Well, I’m saying, to the rate of movement, not to an ultimate  equilibrium level     Are you referring, Alan, to switches of existing holdings or redirection  of the new money that they have to--     Have they been at all restrictive, as they sometimes have been?     Was that required by law at that time?  Legally, we couldn’t have done  anything else, could we, but perhaps defend the dollar?     But that was a very major action     I’m a little puzzled by the balance of forces that I see projected here   With the rate of expansion that is indicated--that is, a slowing in 1978 even below 5 percent--I  don’t see much wrong because, as time goes by, we are getting closer to the full-employment  ceiling and, even sooner probably, to the manufacturing capacity ceiling, the capital stock  ceiling  So we have to think of not going much above the trend rates of growth as we get in the  neighborhood of these limits  And I guess that slowdown is in the works now     But at the same time, I see some things that suggest to me that strongly expansive factors  may be at work, especially the federal deficit  We’ve got a rise in the federal deficit projected in  a range, I guess, of $10 billion to $15 billion  And state and local expenditures, which I haven’t  observed, apparently are growing very sharply--there may be some overlap here  Can you give  us an evaluation of these conflicting elements pushing very strongly and yet the overall tendency  [going] toward slowing down?     I might say, Mr Chairman, that I have asked for the data, and they’ve  been made available  It is a question of remembering to ask for it in time  If we can sort of put  in a standing order, I’d be satisfied     Well, it’s particularly [useful] running it out a long time, even though  it’s very hazardous and all the qualifications attached  Since we’re dealing with something that  has an effect only with a long lag, it isn’t really helpful to ask ourselves what it will accomplish  over a year  It accomplishes minute differences  Now, if it accomplishes anything, it does so at  the best over two or three years, and we ought to at least have a shot at it     That’s--forgive me, Mr Chairman, but that’s really not the issue  The  issue is time  We take these one-year data  We always find that, for a painful increase in interest  rates, we get very little gain on inflation--      It used to be about 3     Well, I would like to note first that I believe our staff forecast is  relatively high compared to forecasts made by other professional forecasters  Is that right?     At the same time, as I look at the details, I’m puzzled why the forecasts  are all so relatively low, tapering off toward mid ’78  Here we go into a late period of expansion  with a very high budget deficit; there’s a lot of capital investment to be made up; we’re  approaching capacity ceilings; and so it puzzles me why the economy shouldn’t be accelerating  dangerously  However, there seems to be a general consensus of forecasters that the trend is the  other way, and I have no particular quarrel with that       7/19/77 - 27 -     If that is the trend, I think it’s the right direction to go  And perhaps what the Committee  might want to do is ask itself how--not in just the next half-year or even year, but two  years--how we want to accomplish the phasing-in to a full-employment growth path  I don’t  think we are all that far away from it--as it would seem, from the 7 percent unemployment  figure, we think that full employment is somewhere between 55 and 6 percent  We might be  able to get to something like that in a year and a half or two years, and at that time we ought to  be moving at something like 3-1/2 percent if we don’t want to hit into the capacity ceiling  Well,  that means a gradual phasing down, and in that sense the trend that is projected here of getting to  45 percent in late ’78 is, I think, a reasonable one  That is the gradual slowdown that we have to  have if we want to have a soft landing     And there are more things heard than that, Mr Chairman  It’s really a  defense of the mature and more highly experienced worker against competition from the young,  who might otherwise undermine his pay and his job, and also a defense of the stronger Northern  unions against the South     The South, mostly, in our country     I would agree with the proposal, Mr Chairman, that you’ve made, with  some provisos  First, I would not want to get back on the track [that] alternative D implies, and  that would be a much larger move than you’ve suggested  But as a matter of principle, I think  we are maneuvering here somewhat  We’re not hitting our targets, and we’re using base drift to  avoid being confronted with situations where interest rates would rise very sharply  I don’t think  this is the kind of expansion that can stand sharp increases in interest rates, and so I would like to  see us take this action with the understanding that if we overshoot, well then, we’ll take another  look  We do not absolutely hold to this target     I think we should bear in mind that what we’re trying to do is influence expectations where  we’ve gotten investment in those  People have seen us bring down the aggregates  I think that’s  very valuable  We should continue it  I think it’s wise to do it only on M1  That gives us a  chance to do it again next time on M2 or M3  I think one cannot take for granted that we can  steadily continue this course without [setting loose] a rise in interest rates that could be very  troublesome  So at some point, one has to ask, we may be confronted with a reversal in this  steady policy of bringing down the aggregates  But so long as it’s possible, and I think it is  possible now in the way you suggested, we can and should stick by this course     Last time we had a money market directive, do you feel that this made  any difference in why things went--for instance, would the funds rate be significantly different  from now had we had a corresponding aggregates directive?     I would have thought so, too     7/19/77 - 48 -       You say that there’s much less relation between velocity and interest  rates; is that the case also if you try to allow for the clear upward trend of velocity that we have  as a result of technological changes, such as you have specified before?     I think we’re in some danger of mixing the two directives  I think, if we  want an aggregates directive, we ought to have a wide funds rate spread  The narrow spread is  appropriate for the money market directive  So I would go for 5 to 5-3/4 with a midpoint of  5-3/8, and otherwise, the specifications of B     7/19/77 - 55 -       In your report for the period, you mentioned that various currencies tried  to avoid getting into the lower part of the snake [intended exchange rate band] and also, I guess,  wanted to avoid being at the top, and so they intervened  Is that now the standard procedure?   That they will not wait and operate in their own currencies, which I understand is the rule of the  snake?     Is there any evidence they’re thinking of using their own currencies  within the limits?  I realize that there are accounting difficulties     I’d like to throw out a hypothesis about the investment and profits  picture  I have long been puzzled  Why would capacity pressures [that are] clearly     8/16/77 - 7 -           ahead--[firms] having invested less than the growth of the labor force seems to imply--[why are]  we not getting any additional investment?  Now, when one ties that together with a poor profit  performance, then the following may not be an unlikely course of events  The present level of  profits doesn’t permit adequate investment, even though the capacity needs may be quite visible  in many industries  What is happening then is, we’re moving up closer on capacity until those  pressures are really of the kind where prices begin to rise, [unintelligible] and then at that point,  profits will become sufficient to justify the investment that should have been made a year or a  year and a half earlier      That is what I think is the likely course of events  There’ll be price  pressure upward that will get us investment at the delayed point--better late than never, but under  conditions that will be somewhat inflationary  Well, that is a reasonable hypothesis  There is  still ahead an element of strength in the economy from that source  At present we seem to see  more weak spots in the economy than strong  I think it’s partly just perhaps characteristic of  shifting from a 7 percent rate of growth, such as we had in the first half, to 5-1/2, and later 5, and  4-1/2  There are bound to be more weak spots as one gets down to a little above the level of  long-term growth  So, in all, it looks to me as if a somewhat choppy period [is] ahead but with  this expectation that eventually profits and plant and equipment spending will come around     Of course, other countries [are] probably further away from capacity  pressures than we are here  As far as our own situation is concerned, if we were to go, just in a  model sense, to full employment overnight, we would not have the capacity to employ the labor  force  I think that’s quite clear  The Council of Economic Advisers is doing a study  now--sounds somewhat ominous to me--they want to compute the optimum path by which you  might move quickly to high-capacity utilization and then slow down so as to move at that  continued level of capacity utilization as more capacity comes on stream  That means accelerate  fast now and then taper off, a proposal that one would--you or I---view with considerable alarm     Well, tying this to the [foreign] situation, I think if anything, the international situation has  weakened  The Germans are now ready to accept 4 percent GNP growth as about the most  they’re going to do instead of the 5 they have been talking about, and that they [unintelligible]   The Japanese seem to be of a mind to do somewhat more  But overall, the sense of a settling  down that I get from our discussion here is not going to fit very happily into the international  situation     Mr Chairman, I think your questions have produced a set of answers  that may not be fully reflective of what’s been going on here as conversation     Does this overpredict on what basis?     Does that involve a shortfall for some previous period, and--     In other words, it stabilized, but has not made up--     What are the prospects for significant disintermediation for the thrifts  and for bank time and savings deposits     Excuse me, Mr Chairman, do we have data on what happens to the  calculation of velocity using the money stock as you redefined it here?     So that the miracle of the inconsistencies in that area might be reduced  by this redefinition     I think our question is whether we want to make a strong effort to get  back on track  We’ve made, to all appearances, a poor record of these two very high quarters,  and the question is whether we should make that effort at the cost of high interest rates and  substantially lower growth of the aggregates  Now I’m going to argue against this in light of  both the technical factors and the state of the economy, the international situation  Let me say  why  I think these adjusted numbers as you’ve described them, Mr Chairman, seem, in good  part, to differ from the standard M1 numbers by the very factors that we’ve always had in mind  as causing changes in velocity  So here we’ve expressed, I think very helpfully, what we used to  call the change in velocity     It’s really a difference in M1 that tells us that M1 has been higher,  which is plausible because we’ve had these high increases in velocity that we’ve found hard to  explain  Well, given that, now I look at where we are with respect to past long-term ranges, and  it’s my impression that we are not all that far outside, even though we’ve done poorly and will  have done poorly in the light of the second and third quarters of this year     Going back to the ranges announced [for] the second quarter of ’76 and continuing since  then, M1 is [mostly] high, but fractionally with respect to the range based on the second quarter  of ’76  In fact, we are inside the range--making a reasonable prediction for M1 for the end of     8/16/77 - 43 -           this quarter  For M2, one can say somewhat similar things  We are high, but not disastrously  high in this long sweep of our ranges  Sins that they are, sins that look bad mostly with respect  to the last, the third and second quarter, and to the relatively low increases we’ve had just before  this     So my sense of urgency to get back on track is somewhat diminished by that  My sense of  urgency is further diminished by the thought that we’ve had these shocks clearly from the  monetary side  And the old rule of thumb says that when you’re shocked from the monetary  side, stay with interest rates, ignore the aggregates  We’re not prepared to ignore them, but I  think there is, in terms of that rule of thumb, a message here because we’ve had monetary shocks  and not shocks in the real sector  We look at the real sector  The economy is not very strong   It’s shifting gears downward  If we had a very booming economy, I think there might be a better  case for trying to get back on track with the aggregates  It’s not clear to me that our economy  could even stand a concerted effort to get on track  Interest rates have risen very substantially, as  Governor Partee has pointed out, and maybe enough [unintelligible]     I would just add that, from the international point of view, we’ve heard that the rise in  interest rates has done a good deal in getting the dollar back up  I think we could get to a point  where the rise in interest rates here might present problems for other countries in terms of their  own monetary policy  They are weakening; Germany still is  And rising interest rates here  would make it somewhat more difficult for other countries to assume easier policies that they  might want to continue     So I come down to a very moderate set of numbers  I would like a wider funds range, as I  always do--5-1/2 to 6-1/2  On M1, I’d go with the alternative C in order to give it a little more  leeway on the downside, 1-1/2 to 5-1/2; M2, 4 to 8; and an aggregates directive     A sudden change in the demand for money, which seems to be what  we’ve had--it went up very suddenly, and that shock did not come with money [holding]  constant [and] the real sector moving  It was the demand for money moving     I wonder if I could ask that to put that in a somewhat different context  than yes or no, because there are things in between  You mentioned one just now yourself  That  is, wait and see whether we’re sued, and then decide whether to settle     This is without prejudice to further consideration     Didn’t the Bank of England operate through its own channels in the  New York market when it was doing this heavy buying?     I meant foreign exchange--and whatever they put it into     Does the Desk know what they do?     Thank you     Mr Chairman, I thought your comments on final sales very well taken,  because there is a difference now, and one has to bear that in mind  But overall, as I look at the  change in our projection from here through the end of 1978, I am struck that for some one-year  periods, mid-’77 to mid-’78, end-’77 to end-’78, there are pretty substantial reductions--in the  first case, as much as 1/2 percentage point  If I look at the projections for final sales, they  [increase], as you indicated, up to the third quarter; and then, however, from the fourth quarter  on, with one exception, final sales are below GNP figures  So apparently they’ve been counting  on some inventory accumulation more than would reflect the growth of inventories at the growth  rate of the economy     So my impression is also that we are at the high end of the spectrum of forecasts on GNP   Certainly that was the case some time ago  It may not be, now that we’ve pulled down our  forecast, and I don’t know whether other forecasters have pulled down theirs, but there has been  a general tendency, I think, to pull down 1978 forecasts  I realize that this happens usually as a  function of the latest quarter’s events, and one extrapolates over time instead of considering the  possibility that there may be an inventory oscillation in it     I’m concerned about the very low reduction in unemployment that our projections show,  even given the very modest increases in GNP over the years end-’77, end-’78--less than 1/2  percent  It looks as though Herb Stein was right--but I think, for people who are concerned  about inflation to say that 7 percent unemployment is full employment is a little like people who  are concerned about unemployment saying that 6 percent inflation is zero [inflation]     I am troubled by the outlook, and that is why, in my own thinking, I’ve concluded that we  ought to move to some kind of incomes policy  This is not going to happen overnight, and so the  fact that I argue for discussing it now doesn’t mean that I think it would or should go into effect  this year  But I do think that the data, the experience, so far show that the high unemployment  doesn’t bring inflation down  Our projections say that it doesn’t have that effect, and I think that  we could begin thinking about trying something else     Excuse me, 4-1/4 percent over an annual rate or--     Annual rate     Isn’t that the way in which we’ve got to work--     We’re not doing very well [at quantifying], but the direction alone isn’t  good enough     Those are the countries that there are major problems in     A couple of points, if I may  One is, as I look at today’s call, you’re in  one of those situations again where you are making matched sale-purchases with foreign  accounts and then have to compensate by supplying funds to the rest of the market  Does that  kind of situation give you any problem?     The market knows about these operations, doesn’t it?  So that it doesn’t  get a false signal?     When we had that wide spread between discount and funds rate, was the  increase in borrowing more or less in line with your expectations?  Were you able to make a  good forecast of the rise in borrowing?     Of course, you would say that the expectation of a rise in the discount  rate soon would intensify the borrowing, but that would be true of any such situation where a  wide spread tended to develop     Thank you     Well, I’d like to get some light on the nature of the shocks that money  supply has recently received  The rule of thumb says that if it’s a monetary shock, ignore it, and  keep interest rates constant  But doesn’t that imply that--     It means that if there is a shock from the financial, monetary side--     What does that mean?  A rise or fall in the demand for  money--technically known as the LM curve     That would be a very clear example  But I’m thinking simply of  occasions where we’ve got a $3 billion increase in one week or a $5 billion increase in one week  and don’t have much of an explanation  But they bring us to very high growth rates, and if we  take our long-term ranges seriously, we would have to go to very low growth rates in money  supply over a year in order to make these targets  Now the rule, as I understand it, is if it comes  from the monetary side, there is some change in the demand for money--don’t let that affect the     9/20/77 - 34 -   real sector  And the way to avoid an impact on the real sector is to keep interest rates constant  because the money supply works presumably to interest rates, and that channel of transmission  can be blockaded if it’s not appropriate to have that transmission     But what I’m trying to get your reaction on, Steve, is, doesn’t this theory imply that shocks  are stochastic and random?  That if we got a bounce up of $3 billion or $5 billion over time,  we’ll get a bounce down of that [amount]?  If that doesn’t happen, if we’re carried to a  permanently higher level of the money supply, then it may not have been a random shock  It  may have been something fundamental in the economy and maybe it should not be ignored but  should be allowed to have its influence on higher interest rates and the real sector     Well, if it were a random movement, in my opinion, it should over time  be offset by some other--     Well, I agree with that, yes     Well, I am trying to distinguish, and I say one of the distinguishing  characteristics should be that a series of shocks in one direction upward should eventually be  followed by movements in the opposite direction, indicating--     Well, if they’re not random--we need to distinguish, this is right  I’m  assuming when you get a shock like that, at first sight, that it is random  Now we have to  examine was it or was it not  If it wasn’t, then we’ve got to take it seriously and not ignore it     I think we need to make up our mind whether this is the kind of  unexpected increase which one should ignore and stay with interest rates or whether it is one that  one should take as an indication of future movement, future aggregate demand, prices and  output, and should act accordingly to restrain  If one thinks it--     If it is a truly random shock, I would say it would be offset by a move in  the opposite direction in time     Right  Since it hasn’t been, it raises this suspicion that it is not  [random]  Now there are two possibilities  One is that people have changed their demand for  money so that with a given GNP, they want more  If that’s the case, we should accommodate it,  because it doesn’t mean anything to GNP  But if it means that--     I was postulating the possibility that they had changed their demand  function so that they wouldn’t do this--     --permanent change in their demand function, just as we’ve had a  downward shift     Well, you know, we had a downward shift of the demand curve of about  $30 billion  Had we believed in that demand curve, we would have driven interest rates into the     9/20/77 - 37 -   floor, trying to push the money supply on that demand curve  We didn’t  We kept interest rates  at reasonable levels and therefore reduced the supply of money relative to what was expected  relative to GNP on a very substantial scale  Now, if we did exactly the symmetrical thing on the  way up, we would then not worry about a $30 billion increase in money supply relative to  expectations and relative to GNP and just avoid interest rates from going to the roof  I’m not  asking for a symmetrical action, but I think we should realize that we went largely with interest  rates when the money supply was falling short of expectations  And I’m now trying to think out  what we should do on the upside     If I may go back to Steve’s--     If I may pursue this one moment further, Mr Chairman, if we’re back  on the old demand curve at a lower level, the slope is the same but the level has been reduced by  $40 billion  That would mean, then, that we would not be able to count on the same velocity  gain on which we’ve counted so far to finance an 11 percent increase in GNP with a 5 or 6  percent increase in M1 or 9 percent increase in M2  This is the meaning of being back on the old  demand curve     Yes     I meant to say we’re on the same slope, not on the same path, because  the path is down $40 billion from where we expected to be     Even that is an “if”     A realistic 215, really     Well, I tried earlier to analyze our situation in terms of where the  instability in situations came from--from the monetary side or from the real side  The  predominant impression seems to be that it comes from the monetary side, whether it’s just a  stochastic shock, or whether we’re back on the old slope of the demand curve at the lower level   Either way, it seems to me to argue that we should lean more on the funds rate than on the  aggregates at this time  Now when I look at the economy, which I don’t see to be very strong,  again it seems to me--putting it in somewhat extreme terms--a choice of going with the economy  or going with the aggregates  I am inclined to go with the economy, which to me means not  making a great change in the funds rate  That does mean that one allows an overshoot on the  aggregates in terms of our long-run ranges, and I fully agree with what John Balles said  It  would be a tremendous job to get back on track from present levels; it would be harder even if  we allow a further overshoot  Nevertheless, I think, under the circumstances, I’d be prepared to  accept some base drift and consequently, in the short run, an overshoot     Now also, I do have some concern for the expectational, the appearance effects of having a  very high upper level to our short-run M1 range  I think that can be offset by lowering the other  ends, so that we simply have a wider range  And that leads me to suggest 2 to 9 for M1  Now I  would think, for M2--where, incidentally, we would also have to do a big job to get back on     9/20/77 - 50 -   track because its velocity flexibility is less, precisely because it’s been better numbers so far--we  do need something like 3, 4, 5 percentage points growth of M2 in order to get back on track, and  I doubt that we will be able to accomplish that without very high interest rates  So on M2 I’m  prepared to go to 5-1/2 to 9-1/2     And I’ll support this also with the idea that we ought to have consistent targets, that is to  say, to set low aggregates and not set a very high funds rate to match it leaves us with the  immediate problem of resolving that conflict  I don’t think much is gained by that  I would  rather set the key targets--interest rates, aggregates--in a consistent way, the way the staff tries to  do it  I think we can compensate for a wider range on the aggregates with the narrower range on  the funds rate, although I don’t like narrow ranges on the funds rate  But [given] that I want to  go with the interest rate anyway, I would say, yes, we can have a narrower range, and I would  say 5-7/8 to 6-3/8 on the funds rate  Now that really pushes me in the direction of a money  market directive rather than an aggregates directive, and I’d be prepared to go with that     Is there any sort of a guess as to the extent to which existing US import  limitations and foreign countries’ export restrictions imposed at our behest influence the total  volume of imports?     The trade deficit would presumably improve if we had imports  diminished, but the dollar would still be influenced probably by interest rates as well as the  improved deficit, and so one really doesn’t know--whether that works on the upside, too  Cannot  be sure of the deterioration of the trade balance--and if interest rates rise simultaneously and  inflation remains under control, may not be harmless     These are capacity pressures, Willis, in which industry?     Which industry?     Do you happen to know how long it would take to bring that into  operation?     Well, this is of course a contingent forecast based on there being no  further action on the policies that are in the pipeline so far  I would also say that it is not a very  high forecast--43 percent in the fourth quarter is not very much, and final sales of 38 in the  fourth quarter is really quite modest  Also, I’m making the case for the downside here, and I’m  starting off by saying that even the staff is not very high  Nevertheless, the staff is higher than  most forecasters, particularly toward the end of 1978  There are some [forecasts] for early ’78  that are above us  But [for] late ’78, I’m afraid, we’re at the peak  It may be that economists  typically see things that are strong petering out  There’s always a good reason for that, like  housing  It’s difficult sometimes to see things strengthening, and that’s what lends a bias to  these forecasts beyond the area of visibility     Now, I think if one wanted to make the realistic assessment of the situation, it is that we  may very well get a stimulus from the Administration during the course of the year  The  Administration talks about a 5 percent rate of growth during 1978--that is well above what we  think  They say that action would be taken if we fell below that, but what that action would be,  how effective it would be, how long it would take to get it enacted, and how soon it would  become effective is all very uncertain  I would guess that the evolution of the numbers that we  have here in the staff [forecast] might trigger quite early pressure from the Administration for  some kind of fiscal action  If one factors in that probability, one--     --assumes great wisdom--I was going to say this raises other risks  It  raises risks of acceleration of inflation; it reduces, I think, the chances of a downturn  So all that  I wanted to say is that, in the absence of new action, I think that the staff is more on the high side  than I would be     And what’s been the response to our recent interventions?  Do central  banks abroad feel that we’ve done our share of the job, or do you still get pressure to do more?     Can you tell from their reactions whether this enormous amount of  intervention, I think on the order of $20 billion supporting the dollar, whether they’re  disappointed in that it hasn’t had more of a stabilizing effect?     Well, I just want to bring out the fact that $20 billion was spent and was  not enough to hold the dollar     Oh, yes, I think that is probably so  But if you thought of it--suppose we  had done this, nobody else supported the dollar; we had, let us say, very large reserves of some  sort and had to spend $20 billion in support of our currency, it would not have been sufficient to  prevent this decline  And that impresses me very much, whether things were going back to a  stable system, what kind of reserves would be needed in order to maintain stable rates     Under present inflationary conditions I would say, not otherwise     You’re saying that effect of intervention depends to some extent on who  does it?     10/17-18/77 - 32 -           But if there were such a move, we would have to be able to observe an  increased proportion of Eurocurrency loans made in D-marks and yen, and that’s the  Eurocurrency, and so on  Somebody’s got to create assets if he’s going to assume liabilities in  those currencies  I’m not aware that one sees that, actually     May I make one more comment?     At the risk of taking too much time, I’m disturbed by Scott’s comment  that if we intervened on a very large scale, this would have a different effect from others doing it   I suspect, if that is true, it is true for a reason that we might not want to accept, namely that all  our other policies would be bent toward maintaining the dollar  In other words, if we got into  such a situation where we were trying to support the dollar by operations of the market, if that is  to be successful, the market has to be put in a frame of mind where they think we’re going to  raise interest rates, tighten the budget, maybe do other things, in order to support the dollar  And  we might find that we would be putting ourselves into a difficult box in order to assure the  effectiveness of that kind of operation     Because you think the market thinks we want it down positively     Well, as you saw these aggregates coming toward you, Peter, were  you--I’m trying to get a sense of your timing  Evidently you have to make decisions--whether  today, tomorrow--how soon you move with the rate  Were you comfortable with the way things  worked out, and was the directive as given helpful, capable of being executed properly?     When New York and the Board don’t have exactly the same estimates,  how do you proceed?     May I add a word here?  It seems to me Mr Baughman’s comment  would be very appropriate in any other country in any other circumstances than those of rapidly  rising interest rates  You create more money  There’s an implication that money will flow out  of the country, and under floating rates that means there’ll be pressure on the exchange rate  The  puzzling thing is that this happened in the context where evidently there was a strong demand for  money because interest rates were rising, and so you wouldn’t expect this effect, you know, of  pouring water into a glass and having it spill over, which is the typical sequence of events in  most other countries when you increase the money supply     Well, I was heartened by your emphasis, Mr Chairman, on pointing at  the economy rather than at the aggregates, because the two seem to have parted company, and  also pointing to the overshoots  I think that reduces our credibility problem  I think we have  some credibility problem no matter what we do  The best thing is to lay it on the table and  explain the facts  I don’t think anybody would believe that we’ve given up fighting inflation   Now--     At any rate, I don’t think we’re going to maintain that belief by setting  low ranges, then allowing the base to drift up and overshooting them  That, I think, doesn’t help  us, nor does it help us really to have unrealistic targets that people don’t think we can attain  I  do think we need to see what has happened  These are not just numbers that are changing  around  Our research people tell us that, for the time being, the shift in the demand curve for  money on which we’ve lived for two years has ended  It may resume again; if it doesn’t resume,  that still doesn’t mean that velocity instantly has to return to its old rate of growth of about 2  percent at constant interest rates but with a lag  The demand curve continues to shift, and there  is some reason to think that it will, somewhat, in any event, if not as fast as in the past; then we  will get somewhat higher velocity gains  But I do think we have to take into account the  possibility that the period of high velocity gains of 4-5-6 percent is over     Now, I think in terms of a concept of effective money growth, which is the usual money  growth plus that increase in velocity that you would get at constant interest rates--we’re not  forcing velocity by higher interest rates, and in the long run, I find it hard to believe that 5-1/4  plus velocity gains will finance an 11 percent GNP increase  It just asks too much of velocity,  and we ought to prepare for that eventuality, which may be upon us now     That brings me to my choice among your proposals  I think pulling down the M2 and M3  upper limits is a reasonable action  I think in the statement that might be made, greater stress  could be placed on M2--assuming we recognize that in subsequent discussion also  On the M1, I  do feel that we ought to take into account what has been happening to velocity  We don’t know  what will happen hereafter, but I am reluctant to rely on higher velocity gains as a matter of  certainty, so I prefer your proposal of a 3 to 7 percent widened range, even though it lowers the  midpoint growth of M1 slightly from 5-1/4 to 5  One could point to that as a small move in the  direction of greater restraint     I lean toward a money market directive because the aggregates seem to  be hard to interpret at this time  I would go for the aggregates with B  On the funds rate, even if  we have a money market directive that argues for a relatively narrow range, I would prefer to  widen it a little  I think the arguments in favor of having a limit on the low side that doesn’t  permit much of a drop are not as strong this time as they are ordinarily  When we see that there  may be an [upward] trend in the rate over time, then it makes sense not to backtrack with the  rate  I don’t necessarily feel that that is our present prospect  So I’d like to keep the lower end  at 6-1/4  In case the aggregates do continue to bulge, I’m willing to go a little higher than 6-3/4  or come out at 6-1/4 to 7 percent; and I would stay at [the midpoint of] 6-5/8 initially until the  aggregates begin to break out, if they do     I would be in favor of an immediate rise  Well, we’re really within that  range, you know, 6-1/2 to 6-5/8     We have been over quite a few times, not with the weekly rate, but it’s  moved up to there  I would say 6-5/8     My choice, which is very marginal between the two, was that I did rely  quite heavily on the aggregates specifications of being able to go up to 8 on M1     Well, I think, Mr Chairman, we ought to view this as part of a general  strategy  If, at the end of the whole thing, we would have to publish anyway, we might have  given away some benefits in terms of public posture by first having vainly tried to protest it in  the courts  I’m trying to understand better, for instance, how normal it is to make such an  appeal  Is that the quite usual course of events, or is that a major decision?     If the Solicitor General would not take on our case, are we still entitled  to the 30 days?     Mr Chairman, shouldn’t we examine the alternatives, the problem of  releasing this?  How would we operate if we had to release it?  Would it really be so damaging?   Given that this is a very unpopular thing we are promoting--this secrecy--what would be the  damage to us [with] the public, central banks, academics?  Wouldn’t we be better off trying first  to see if we can live with it?     That seems to me the most likely single course of events     We should examine, I think, how we could live under this  What are the  techniques by which we could do this?     --recommend that we do--     I think that’s quite possible     The market has a range in mind that, you know, we’ve been on a 1/2  percent range of late, and they’ll assume that that continues     Mr Chairman, if we [chose not to pursue] an appeal to the Supreme  Court, but then immediately responded to this mandate by that slight change in our directive, it  seems to me we wouldn’t be playing games with the law  We would be--     But this is a very reasonable thing to do  We respond to the court  without going to a last ditch fight, so we are cooperative, and we do what we would probably  have to do under the new mandate, namely, write the directive that doesn’t give insiders a special  advantage     Well, I think this more basic [than] that  I’m surprised to hear that we  seem to be so married to this particular directive that, if circumstances change entirely, namely,  we tip off the market where previously we had relied on not tipping them off, we are compelled  to continue doing just what we did  It seems to me, when circumstances change, namely, we [are  about to] inform the market immediately, it does not have to be exactly the same kind of  information that goes out     Well, with modifications in the directive     Well, we have contemplated a nonborrowed reserves target, and it’s  perfectly possible, over a period of time--whether one would do that with or without interest rate  constraints [is a] question that has to be solved on empirical grounds, to see what would have  happened had one not done so     I think the staff is about right, Mr Chairman--has a sense of a slight  sagging in the speed of the expansion, but not seriously  I do note increasing imbalances--Mr  Kichline has referred to some of them  We now are at a relatively high level of the full- employment deficit, and that, barring other government action, [is] going to take about $20  billion out of the economy over the next year or 15 months  That’s counteracted, perhaps, by a  decline of half that size in the state and local surplus  Then there’s the continuing drop in net  exports     These things, I think, begin to go beyond minor blemishes in an otherwise balanced  expansion, and one begins to wonder whether some real imbalances aren’t beginning to evolve   The main hope on the upside is that the underlying need for additional plant and equipment  spending will finally exert itself  There is nothing in the surveys to document that, but I think  the case in terms of the magnitude of the capital stock and of capacity utilization ratios is not a  bad one for some acceleration if there is a gain in confidence about reasonable tax proposals     Somewhat on the same theme, I see that the increases in velocity are  projected to reach--in alternative B by third quarter ’78--67 percent, and this is to come partly  out of the normal growth of velocity and partly out of a rise in interest rates projected from 6-1/2  in the funds rate to 7-3/4  And this really assumes a pretty sizable rise in the absence of an  interest rate increase, namely something of the order of 4 percent, I think  It presupposes again  that we get a downward shift in the demand curve     There could also be as we accelerate from the slack of the third quarter  to the fourth quarter  But still, these numbers seem very high to me, and of course they are  predicated on a 5-1/4 M1 target     If we went to the upper edge of the band--6-1/2--all these velocity  numbers would come down by a little more than 1 percentage point     11/15/77 - 34 -           I continue to be concerned about the shortfall that I anticipate in the  achievement of the velocity that the staff expects, so I’m concerned with setting ranges that I  think are on the low side     Now, since I can sense the ideas of the group, I don’t want to argue very strongly; I do  want to remind us that we really shifted to a permanent money market conditions directive by  adopting a 1/2 percentage point spread on the funds rate  I would like to get back to [using] the  aggregates [directive]  I don’t despair of M1; it needs adjustments, but I don’t think these  adjustments are beyond our comprehension  So I would go for a funds rate of 6 to 7 instead of a  narrower range, and I would up the M1 aggregate slightly  I would go for 2-1/2 percent to 7-1/2  just to make it a little higher than the staff has it  But in general, [alternative] B is acceptable to  me, and the monetary aggregates [directive] is what I would like to see     I want an aggregates directive     I have two points, Mr Chairman  One goes somewhat in the direction  of what Mr Roos said  I think we ought to test our procedures here by how well they will allow  us to control the aggregates as well as by how well they will allow us to stave off undesired  effects in the money market Now, it is certainly true that choosing a 1/2 percent[age point]  range does stave off the danger of undesired effect when we have to announce immediately  In  the past, we didn’t announce, and when we had a wider range that we set, a year or so ago, we  didn’t think it was very likely the market would go there, but we made it possible     Now we have to ask ourselves if we are going to make the changes in the rate--since we  are not going to allow the Manager or the market to make them frequently and easily enough--in  order to control the aggregates, and I’m somewhat doubtful  If this is only going to be an interim  procedure, it’s not very important  But if you visualize that this may go on for a longer time--it  always takes a telephone meeting to make a change beyond the 1/2 [point] range in other words,  a move more than 1/4, typically  Every move becomes somewhat like a discount rate change,  when one always wants to see a little more information, so we wait for next week’s average  aggregates, or for the week thereafter  This is the concern I have, Mr Chairman       Well, we can, if we steel ourselves, make these frequent changes  The  fact that, of late, we have had 1/2 point spreads and the aggregates have run high are not, I think,  completely unrelated, although there have been other reasons that have contributed  So we  certainly have to bear in mind that we may have to move the funds rate, painful though it is     The second point I wanted to make is a question to counsel  Does this court order imply  that we are stuck on a particular form of directive?  I see this implied in some of the concerns  expressed that some change or other might be interpreted as an evasion of the court order  I  would intuitively think that a new situation having been created, we are within our rights, and  maybe just doing our duty, in adapting the directive to that new situation      That’s what I had in mind; we are not precluded from--     Could the explanation be that, because of the conditions created by the  immediate announcement, we now face a market problem that we want to cope with by changing  our procedure, changing the directive     Nobody in the world that I know recommends that  Everybody tells us  what to do, but not that       Mr Chairman, I would like to make a couple of points  One, I don’t  think one can compare our scale of intervention with what’s going on abroad  It’s precisely our  low intervention as it’s perceived abroad that generates the image of benign neglect  And  intervention on a smaller scale conveying the impression that we are concerned would probably  do more on our part than larger intervention in Europe     Now, it’s perceived that our intervention is of limited effectiveness because we have to  buy back the currency later  Now that undoes the monetary effects and reduces the concern of  foreign central banks  But it also means that other countries--that the exchange rate is going to  be pushed in the wrong direction again if we buy it back  Now, if we are to buy the exchange to  repay the swaps directly from the foreign central bank, then the problem you point to--permanent  expansion in their money supply, their dollar holdings--would occur  This is an inherent defect  of the swap network     So, abroad, recommendations are made, for instance, to use gold  And I suspect that when  they say use gold, they don’t mean sell it in the market--they mean sell it to another central bank   This we would not do, because it would get gold back into the System instead of--like a sale to  the market--get it out of the System  But there is here a resource, including gold sales to the  market, which would at least have a demonstration effect  It’s argued that high interest [rates],  to the extent that they’re consistent with a domestic expansion, could be a means  Well, it’s very  difficult so see increases in the interest rates of any size that would be consistent with continued  expansion, and so there is a limit to that  But we shouldn’t be unaware that there are a number of  devices and things people think we could do  The fact that we don’t do them, they regard that as  an indication of the degree of importance we attribute to the dollar     Now universally, oil policy, the energy bill, is pointed to as the necessary action  I think  the effect of that is exaggerated in the minds of people abroad because the effect would not come  very quickly, and it wouldn’t be all that spectacular as far as the trade deficit is concerned  That  does seem to be the closest to a policy that would carry conviction abroad       12/19-20/77 - 36 -           I think they would do it if they thought it was a step toward turning gold  back into the monetary asset  I wouldn’t recommend doing that  Neither would I recommend  sales in the market, exactly for the reasons that you say  But it all adds up to this--that we find a  good argument against any action we can take--     It certainly does     That is the corrective  The reason people are worried about the deficit is  not the deficit per se, but precisely that it’s going to be cured by this means that they do not like      Mr Chairman, if I may, I agree fully with your statement about the  effect of a dollar depreciation, that it is undesirable  I just wanted to make the analytical point  that, if the dollar were to go down, this would have a favorable impact on the trade balance      Particularly FASB 8 [Statement No 8 of the Financial Accounting  Standards Board]     That’s an accounting rule under which the losses on foreign exchange  due to foreign exchange liability must be taken directly into each quarter’s profit     It’s those that have borrowed in Swiss francs and have similar liabilities,  they are particularly hit by this     They’re aware that their rates may have to decline, and the German  reduction in the discount rate was very much angled toward that  Now, it was not unsuitable in  terms of their domestic developments  But so long as they thought about it only in domestic  terms or mainly, apparently they were split  But when the international implications dawned on  them, they took the action     Now we can point to having had higher interest rates over the last few months, and that’s a  contribution, a very substantial contribution  Somebody says, “Did you do it for that reason?”   The answer is, “That’s the wrong question  We did it for whatever reason, and we benefit  internationally here”  Now probing a little deeper, should we ever do something with interest  rates for purely international reasons?  I think then one comes to a halt and says, basically, this is  a very large country and its interests are governed by domestic concerns mainly, and not by  international       12/19-20/77 - 43 -           I noticed that while the swap can be renewed up to one year, the  Germans talk in terms of renewing it once, maybe twice; but apparently they would much rather  see it shorter rather than run up  Is that your impression?     Well, they did talk about a third quarter     As the rate drops, the prospects of loss for these operations, of course,  diminishes and--   SPEAKER(?)  It does?     Well, the image of neglect rises as the rate goes down and we continue  at the same rate of intervention  So I think there is a case for operating on a larger scale as the  rate goes down     --and profit     Well, with respect to our forecast, I think it’s fair to say that, for the end  of 1978 we are high among forecasters  So certainly our staff couldn’t be [accused of] not  stressing elements of strength  I think that very few forecasters actually have a higher end for  1978; many of them go below 4 [percent], some close to 3, or even below     I think, however, all this is relatively unrealistic because it doesn’t seem to factor in a tax  policy  Now we read in the paper that a tax cut is being discussed--that we’ve known all along   We see now that at least what has been told to the journalists is within the range of $20 billion to  $30 billion  So far, I have heard mostly about $20 billion, so that one has to now begin to think  about what would be the impact of a tax cut of that order--what would be its timing, would it  come early, late; is it applied to the first half or only to the second  It would be apparently done     12/19-20/77 - 48 -         partly through changes in withholding and subsequently through changes in rates  These are all  matters that are very relevant to one’s view of 1978 and I think would raise the forecast quite a  bit above what it is now     Now, I don’t know what the multiplier on a tax cut of this magnitude would be, but surely  not less than 1  Probably more than 1  And if so, that’s about 1 percent of GNP  This year  we’re going to make $2 trillion GNP, and I guess nobody celebrates because it’s mostly  inflation  Well, I would regard the 41 [percent] of our forecast as an unsatisfactory result if it  weren’t for the expectation that we are going to have this fiscal action  What troubles me about  the fiscal action is that it’s a continuation of what we’ve done all along  fiscal ease, combined  with, I won’t call it monetary tightness, but at least if there’s been any restraint anywhere, it’s  been through monetary policy, and that has an adverse effect on investment     I can’t see that monetary policy should have had any adverse effect on investment  Interest  rates have been low in real terms  It is very difficult to believe that monetary policy has  restrained investment  But the net effect of this combination of easy fiscal and less easy  monetary has been to hurt investment, and we see it in the investment data that we get  I just  wanted to lay this out because it’s the result of the interaction of factors that, in part, we have no  control over, and yet we ought to think about the interaction     May I make a quick comment, Mr Chairman?  I think the problem [of]  teenagers, which is very dominant now, is in part a demographic one, which in time is going to  be changed around by the decline in the birth rate  That means that we have a generation that,  moving up the years, will have its problems  But the teenage problem as such, I think, will tend  to diminish as a result of lower birth rates following the ’50s and ’60s     Steve, can you assess the chances of another strong blip early in the first  month of the next quarter, and is your high, very wide range on the aggregates--the 6 percentage  points we have had the last two times--partly a reflection of that danger?     By changing the habitual range for the aggregates and for the funds rate,  we have really made every directive we give into a money market directive, because it used to be  that the ratio was 2 to 1 between the spread in the aggregates and the spread in the funds rate   Now, it is on the order of 12 to 1, so it takes much more movement in the aggregates to produce  a given change in the funds rate, 6 times as much as it used to      I have no problem with the specifications of the funds rate in  [alternative] B  I would prefer an aggregates directive  But let me explain why I said I think all  our directives now are money market directives; [it is] because the range for the funds rate is  very narrow and the range for the aggregates is going wide, so that it takes a very large move in  the aggregates to achieve a small move in the funds rate depending on how the Desk moves with  the zone or without the zone  That, I think, has been a change in our procedures, but sometime     12/19-20/77 - 74 -         we could talk about that  Right now, I could try to salvage what flexibility we have by going for  an aggregates directive  I’m concerned about conflicting difficulties  One, the situation with the  dollar, the other, the danger of a blip in January and high aggregates  On balance, I think we’d  better keep the aggregates low  And I would go with 2 to 8 for M1     This is Henry Wallich  I’d like to ask Alan what he has heard in the way  of reports and testimony       Anything on corporate treasurers or on foreign official [holders] who  might have been in and out of dollars       Is there anything in movements at the year-end--for instance in  connection with the financial accounting standards or rules about taking exchange profits and  losses into earnings--that could have influenced what has happened and will have an effect on the  beginning of the year?         1/5/78 8    The judgment that you expressed, Ted, does that imply that there will be a  cessation of or substantial reduction of official intervention from the $36 billion you mentioned  and, if so, that the financing of the current account deficit would have to be partly or wholly by  private capital?       There is another aspect, though, and that is with respect to [relative]   interest rates  Now, you may not put that under leads and lags, but essentially as interest rates rise  in the United States relative to elsewhere, people will try to finance their foreign trade in the low  interest rate countries  And that again sets up a capital movement that can be very large  I was  inclined to think that what Chuck had in mind was this effect       We’ve gotten into a discussion of a stable rate; I think Paul used the term--      That’s contingent  It wasn’t, I think, your thought that we ought to arrive   at stable rates  I don’t think either the discount rate action or intervention tends to stabilize a rate  that for market reasons wants to move in another direction       That is not the way I visualize the operation      I think the idea is to sell D-mark certificates to the [unintelligible] of the   government here      That’s the Alan Holmes plan, if I may call it that  That would be a way for   the Bundesbank to absorb bank liquidity  But the Treasury bill in that case--or whatever security it  was--would be serving I think as the guarantee feature and not as a means of making the merchant  bank take the dollar risk  [Those banks] wouldn’t do that       The Bundesbank takes the dollar risk, that’s right  But the Bundesbank’s   liability would show up in the D-mark obligation, I would think      I don’t find the staff’s forecast unpersuasive  It’s not far from the range of   other forecasts  I am puzzled about how the story is going to unfold eventually  We are now in a  very long-lived expansion  Nothing has happened that would lead one to think that it would end  with a bang, so if it ends, it will be with a whimper  And if it ends that way, there is no real need  for [the economy] to turn down  It could be a growth recession from which we could emerge  This  has happened before  It bothers me that the [expansion] is being kept alive with stimulation, a tax  cut, very late in the game  Monetary policy will in some form be supplying the means to finance  all this  And I’m asking myself what we are building up as we go through this year and maybe  through next year, with considerable government deficits in the face of an economy that ought to  be righting itself and arriving at some kind of full employment equilibrium, full employment  balance of the budget  Nevertheless, with all these concerns, I don’t see the [economy] turning  down with a tax cut ahead and a tax cut that is potentially variable; if the situation were very weak  late in ’78, it could be beefed up  With investment pressing increasingly on capacity limitations,  forecasts now get us into the 87 percent capacity utilization range  I think there ought to be enough  momentum there to carry the economy forward and that’s the hypothesis on which I’d be willing to  go       Could I ask a question?  What is the criterion for whether the System Open  Market Account is operating?  Is this a question of that day or that minute?       So a great majority of operations, then, would go through the SOMA      Well, I share Bob Mayo’s thought that we ought to tighten the M1 range   We’ve moved to a 6-point spread under conditions of always fearing an explosion  That fear for  the month of January seems to have diminished considerably  So I think we could go back to a  narrower range  I share the feeling that we should not allow the funds rate to go down, mainly for  international reasons  And, therefore, I arrive at an asymmetrical relationship  In principle, I’d like  a wide funds range, but on this occasion I think we should make the present level also the lower  limit, but stay at that limit and go to as high as 7-1/4 percent if M1 [comes in strong]  I would  make the M1 range 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent  That means really that we stay at 6-3/4 percent on the  funds rate, and [if] the aggregates are very surprisingly weak, we get a chance to review our  situation  I think in a difficult situation where we’re trying to reconcile domestic and international  factors simultaneously, it may be necessary to have more frequent communication  As far as M2 is  concerned, I’m reluctant to give it as much weight now as we do  We give it equal weight and it  seems to me now it is in a state of transition, so I would remove that paragraph  But I have no  difficulty with the alternative B range of 5 to 9 percent       Could I ask a question?  What is the operational interpretation of a strong   tendency or strong inclination not to go below 6-3/4 percent?  You have made this more important  now by lowering the lower end of that M1 range       Yes, I like that      I move [that the minutes be] approved    SPEAKER(?)  Second      I did refer to this when they complained about the heavy foreign   [exchange] losses and I made the point that we retained gold      Mr Chairman, may I make a comment in light of Mr Balles=s comment on   the losses in the foreign currency transactions?  I was going to bring it up [under agenda item 3] but  it bears on the System portfolio  The System portfolio is enormously profitable and it is well  managed, but there are computations you can make by which you can establish putative gains and  losses that would have been realized in certain conditions if maybe sales had been made to realize  them  Take our coupon portfolio of only between $60 and $70 billion  At the end of 1976 it had an  unrealized capital gain on it of $21 billion; at the end of 1977, it had an unrealized loss on it of  minus $1/2 billion  So it was a swing from an unrealized gain to an unrealized loss of  approximately $26 billion, but it was not realized  That doesn=t mean that we are not receiving an  appropriate interest on the portfolio  But it is a very sizable loss [if one makes] another calculation,  which is really an estimate and can be challenged in many ways       Well, you can say that the average maturity of the portfolio is on the order   of 3 years  What has happened to a 3-year note in the market?  It has gone down  If the portfolio  were to consist all of 3-year notes, which of course it does not, we would have had a loss on the  order of $4 billion from this  Again, as I say, this is a purely theoretical computation, but I mention  this because I anticipate that it will be pointed out that there are losses on the foreign currency       2/28/78           3  operations  And it needs to be remembered that in proper economics there are unrealized losses on  the portfolio that are much larger       So moved      We have [limitations on] both  The principal one that is stated in the   Authorization, which is the basic document, is in terms of the net exposure  And the exposure  limits were not overrun  [The Desk] was well within those  What was overrun was the [limit on]  gross transactions  The reason for having that is not that it=s more important than the overall  exposure limit but that a lot of things can happen in an unchanging net exposure  For instance, you  can go from plus to minus a billion in a day and it shows no change in the net exposure You=re still  exposed a billion, only you switched the position the other way  And that was the reason why a  gross transaction limit was [imposed]  That doesn=t mean that it can=t be lifted very easily, but this  Committee should be aware of what=s going on and the Subcommittee should be more aware       I think we have to bear in mind that the Bundesbank has some particular   interest in this matter  One is their concern about the expansion of their monetary base and their  money supply, which would be triggered if we were to repay by drawing on the Bundesbank  The  second concern they have is that they are uneasy about the 50-50 [loss-sharing], which suggests  that we should not do something that provides an opportunity for re-raising that issue  I think those  are the two principal concerns that might come up       There are two considerations I would like to put forth, Mr Chairman  One   is that when one is trying to defend a world currency like the dollar, one ought to think of doing it  in not just one other currency like the D-mark but to broaden it  After all, the Germans deal in  dollars, and that means they=re dealing with the biggest thing there is  But if we deal only in  D-marks, we=re trying to pull our currency up or keep it from becoming disorderly in just one  direction and all the burden is put on that one currency  So there is quite a case for [operating in  other currencies]  Second, we have told the market that we have $20 billion worth of swap lines  and that has been frequently cited as an indication of the magnitude of our resources  I=m a bit  surprised that nobody has ever said, “Which of these currencies would you really be prepared to  sell in the market in maintaining the dollar orderly?” And, of course, the answer is very few       Oh no, I never would because that would have the obvious effect of   making it seem that our resources are much less      I think we do need to think of broadening the scope [of our operations]  At   the same time, I=d like to suggest that we think again about the scale of operations  We went into  this enterprise of raising the scale of intervention, as we had some new reasons--the President=s  statement, the Treasury coming into the arrangement--to think that there might be strength for the  dollar  These were special occasions which justified a somewhat stronger effort  But I think those  special occasions have passed now and we ought to think whether we ought not revert to the earlier  scale of operations, which was substantially smaller--always, of course, bearing in mind that the  scale of intervention has to be commensurate with the scale of disorder  If the market gets very  disorderly, there=s got to be more  But in relation to a given degree of disorder, I think we ought to  reduce our scale of operations       I did refer to disorder      Well, I have some data here, though they are approximate only  They   show that in January the Treasury and the System in combined operations, both averaged on the  days on which we did operate--there were 10 days--something close to $90 million  In February  we’ve operated on a fewer number of days, so far, and we had $70 million on average per day        On the days we operated  This is well above the amounts we had in   October, November, and December      Well, we had a chance to change the perception in the market, technically   to shift the demand curve  It may have had some such effect, but that effect has been established  and absorbed now and we=re back in the old game of meeting pressure on the dollar  I think we  should not now, because we moved to this higher scale, go on spending more money than we  originally [had in mind] to do  We entered into a new ballgame as far as magnitude is concerned  and I think it was justified; it was a campaign  Now I think the time has come to review the results  of the campaign and in my opinion beat an orderly retreat       The rate of money growth [in their] M3 is higher than in our M1, but not   higher than our M3, which is really a different number      I=d like to look at the situation with a point of view that is perhaps a little   more broadly [focused] than just the present forecast  Being where we are in the evolution of this  cycle, I think we have to look for a soft landing--that is, phasing into a long-term rate of growth  that is sustainable at somewhere around 3-1/2 percent or so  In those terms, moving down from an  expectation of 4-1/2 to closer to 4 percent growth is not an unreasonable thing  I think we=re sort of  getting ready for that soft landing     Nevertheless, we=re developing a number of imbalances that raise questions about the   sustainability of the position ultimately reached  One very large imbalance is the net export deficit;  we have a big hole on the foreign trade side  We have a moderate-sized hole on the side of  business fixed investment being partly remedied  And the Administration keeps saying that we  have a hole on the side of expenditures by state and local governments, citing their large surpluses,       2/28/78           24  which usually include their pension funds  If you eliminate the pension funds--and I see no reason  for including them as part of the state and local surplus because they are really private-type pension  funds, tax demands probably “financed”--there still remains a sizable state and local surplus  So  those are the things that are reducing purchasing power  And that is matched by an enormous  federal deficit, which threatens to remain even as we get to full employment  In other words,  we’ve worked the economy now to a point where the private sector apparently can’t give us full  employment without the aid of a federal deficit  This, I think, is a very ominous situation      Even so, it=s the job of fiscal and monetary policy to try to keep this expansion going as best   we can, but some things could happen along the way that would throw a roadblock into it    Suppose the rate of inflation should accelerate significantly; and some of the things that have been  said here suggest that that could happen  Is that the kind of signal then that historically has called  for central bank action to slow down the economy and maybe significantly reduce the rate of  growth?  Central banks typically are supposed to act when the economy gets to booming  But  without getting it at all booming, it could get more inflationary  And the question is, what will we  do then?  Likewise, even without it getting more inflationary in a visible way, the aggregates might  accelerate, indicating that there=s inflation ahead somewhere down the road  Then again, what is  the function of monetary policy, if an expansion can be nursed along only by tolerating more  inflation or accepting the prospect of more inflation into the future?   These are the difficulties I  see, possibly along the way to a soft landing       Well, on the previous occasion when we discussed the long-term ranges, I   would have preferred raising the upper limit of M1 to 7 percent  I=ve changed my mind about that  for two reasons  One, we=ve overshot that M1 ceiling anyway, and the Committee does not seem to  be [of a mind] to get on a track that would substantially lower the growth rate of M1  Second, we  have the problem with the dollar to contend with; and as the Chairman=s pointed out, this could be a  very dangerous signal     Nevertheless, I think we ought to watch very carefully what the implications of what we=re   doing are for velocity and interest rates  The velocity projections seem to be that, with a rise in the  Regulation Q ceiling of 1/2 percentage point and with interest rates rising the way they are  supposed to rise under the alternatives--by maybe 125 basis points on the funds rate over a year for       2/28/78           35  alternative B--we=ll get a velocity gain of 56 percent  Now, that=s a large gain  But given that  interest rates are rising, that=s of course not unobtainable  The rise in interest rates in itself  presumably is factored into the projection, so that that 125 basis points on the funds rate is not  going to have any additional adverse effects on housing beyond those already built into the  forecast If we can take this as a rough basis for what we expect about velocity, I think it is not  impossible that it might materialize and that does not imply impossible interest rate assumptions   My own inclination would be to stay at the high end of that 4 to 6-1/2 percent range and if we  overshoot a little, not to do anything about it as we have done in the past      As far as M2 and M3 are concerned, I concur with the Chairman  I would leave M2 as it is in   alternative B, pulling down the upper margin of that perhaps the next time around to continue this  tradition of pulling the aggregates down  M3 allows a certainty to pull down [at least one of] the  aggregates and maintain that tradition on the present occasion       I=m concerned about the wide M1 range  If you take February as given,   that means the March M1 growth can move up or down 5 percentage points from where it is  without triggering the funds rate if we=re on the money market directive; it means a swing of 10  percentage points that we are allowing ourselves  What are we gaining?  We think that we want to  avoid triggering [a move in] the funds rate because if it goes down it hurts the dollar, and if it goes  up it hurts housing; it=s in a very critical, delicate position  But we don=t really gain anything, we  just postpone--       We can have [by] the next meeting a strong move in the aggregates one   way or the other, and we are going to be confronted with that situation of moving the funds rate  whether we like it or not, and we are going to have lost half a month or so  So I think we are better  off doing the following  Setting a narrower range and agreeing to be more ready to have a  telephone call or telegram if [the range] triggers a movement in the funds rate  Therefore, we stay  more in touch with the situation because that is important  But [we ought to] have more realistic  aggregates ranges, so I would argue for M1 a range of 2 to 5 percent; that wouldn=t change the  midpoint  And for M2, [I’d favor] 5 to 8 percent, which also wouldn=t change the midpoint  On       2/28/78           47  the funds rate, I would be willing to go a little higher and say 6-1/2 to 7-1/4 percent, but with the  midpoint staying where we are right now and an aggregates directive       This increase in the swap line is contemplated as part of a package in   which the Treasury and the German Finance Ministry make certain policy suggestions  The United  States says, in effect, but in very guarded language, that if there is no action on oil legislation, the  President is likely to take some action  The German side says, also in very guarded language, that  they will review their expansion policies in May, after they have the first-quarter results, to see  whether they expect to make their 35 percent growth target  These are the two policy issues that  have been very much discussed publicly--our failure to act on oil and their failure to act on  expansion  The Treasury also proposes to sell 600 million SDR, which is a little over 700 million  dollars, to the Bundesbank for D-mark for [use in] intervention  And the Treasury proposes to  mention its ability to draw on the IMF--although mentioning that $5 billion reserve position is not  quite firm yet--but not to indicate that they will draw anything  Finally, the announcement, as far  as the Treasury and the Finance Ministry are concerned, will refer to the Bundesbank-Federal  Reserve swap without mentioning the number       Turning to our swap, the Bundesbank seems to be contemplating an increase of $2 billion    This was discussed by Messrs Burns, Miller, and Emminger  That would make a total of $4  billion but to the extent that we repay what we’ve already drawn--$16 billion or thereabouts--or  consolidate this, it would not be reusable  It would not be like a revolving credit line of a total of  $4 billion       Right  This need not necessarily show in the published amount of the   swap  Interest rate conditions are the same as before, and the 50-50 loss sharing the same as  before No specifics on repayment techniques [have been decided]  Alan Holmes is in Frankfurt  and has discussed the technical aspects, including some preliminary soundings as to how the  Germans feel about repayment in the form that we might simply buy D-mark from them for dollars  and then give them back the D-mark, thereby relieving ourselves of any participation in risk   [Other possibilities are] that we might pay off the drawings after a given period, perhaps one year,  or consolidate them and treat them like the Swiss swap to be repaid in installments over a period,  possibly more than one year       I might just add that the subcommittee that was appointed at the last FOMC meeting has   explored some of these aspects, including alternative repayment techniques  As far as the swap  itself is concerned, I talked to Bob Black this morning and he said that while he thought it was a     3/10/78              3  compromise, it was the best we could do  He would prefer a Treasury takeout, but he is agreeable  as far as the [view of our] subcommittee enters into this  That is all       Well, the Treasury has been going 50-50 with us in the use of their   present swaps  They may not necessarily go in the same proportion hereafter  They will have $700  million additional plus a little over $100 million left over from the old swap  But to some extent  $300 million can--       They have about a billion that they would [use to] keep up their share in   the operation      The Treasury could also draw on the IMF  While the amounts   immediately available on the D-mark wouldn’t be very large--maybe a half billion dollars--over  time, say a few months or a half year, they might be able to get as much as a billion or a billion and  a half dollars  After that, other arrangements would have to be made to get D-marks out of the  IMF     3/10/78              8      We’ve explored that and the difficulty is that we can’t get the 50-50 there      We cannot get the 50-50      We have an exposure now of $16 billion  We have a leeway of about   $400 million to which we will be adding this $2 billion, making the [total] leeway $24 billion  If  we then repay or consolidate the outstanding $16 billion, that would not change the $24 billion   We could not go back and redraw the repaid $16 billion       And there is a 50-50 loss sharing with the Bundesbank      The Bundesbank seems willing broadly, subject to [approval by] their   central bank council, to go to $2 billion provided--      To a total of $4 billion provided that parts already drawn cannot be   redrawn as we described here  They are hesitant on techniques of repayment and have raised  questions as to whether it would be possible to consolidate  But they’ve also talked about a  rollover for 6 months and if we can’t repay it at that time another rollover to 9 and a total of 12  months  So they seem to be willing to go along with this       They are clearly reluctant to be very heavily involved both because of the   internal monetary expansion that intervention produces and I think because they’re concerned  about the losses  I couldn’t guess what would happen in the event, which we don’t foresee with  any certainty, the full amount is used up  And we would contemplate nothing beyond that       That’s very hard to say      I think the Bundesbank may be contemplating a somewhat longer time to   deliberate this and would propose simply to roll over for 90 days the maturities of April, May, and  June [and] in that period to then arrive at the conclusion       Well, I’ll be glad to put in nominations for Chairman and Vice Chairman   of the Committee  I would nominate you, William Miller, head of the Board, as Chairman and  Paul Volcker, President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, as Vice Chairman     SPEAKER(?)  Second      Scott, could you give us an opinion as to what the Treasury’s views are   on the scale of operations?  You receive some guidance from them, don’t you?      It has been sporadic intervention      Could I ask Paul a question?  When you got these responses in Basle that   they would have wished for more multilateralism to the action, do you think they were, among  other things, referring to the use of swap facility drawings on others than the Germans--maybe the  Swiss?       That may mean that real wages will rise significantly      That would be a very moderate amount--something like less than 60   million  And bear in mind that unless they can develop a means of selling the gold for foreign  currency in a way that doesn’t cause holders of dollars to buy that foreign currency in order to buy  the gold, it could be completely counterproductive  Then there isn’t going to be much of a net  effect  There is some because after all we are importers of gold, which may reduce the imports of  gold and may make the trade balance look a little better  There is some portfolio shift when there is  gold in portfolios instead of dollars, so I wouldn’t say it’s without effect but there are lots of  qualifications on the possible success        3/21/78              8    I spoke to                         of the Bundesbank and he said that, sure, they’d   love to sell these bonds just as you say, but I don’t think he thought it would be a very helpful  operation for you  That’s because people with dollars would go and buy the D-mark bonds and in  the end there wouldn’t be much effect other than that there would be a little more D-mark bonds  and fewer dollar bonds in the world, a rebalancing of portfolios       I’ve heard this and it’s influenced, of course, by the rapid decline of the   unemployment rate       I’m reporting now and Alan Holmes will have something more to say   that takes off from the report of our subcommittee  I would like to remind you that this ad hoc  subcommittee--which will go out of business today--must be distinguished from the Foreign  Currency Subcommittee, which is a continuing body  We had three charges [To make  recommendations on] (1) revisions in the procedural instructions, which govern the limits on what  the Desk can do in a day or over an intermeeting period; (2) options for the repayment or renewal  of maturing swaps with the Bundesbank and, (3) the appropriate scale of System exchange market     3/21/78              10  intervention  I think you all have seen the report, so let me just highlight what the subcommittee  came up with on the three charges      One, we did have two suggestions for the daily and the intermeeting limits on gross   transactions  Bear in mind that we have two kinds of limits  One is on gross transactions in a  single currency, simply the dollar amount of [the total volume of our] trading even if it leads to no  net change in the overall position  The second is on the overall open position, often referred to as  the net position, which is the risk exposure  We may be long of something and short of something  else, and it doesn’t matter which way the exposure goes; the risk depends on the magnitude, not on  whether one is long or short in a foreign currency      Now, the Desk has found that the gross transactions limit of $100 million a day is   somewhat confining  If they engage in “in and out” trading, making a market on both sides, they  may not be changing the risk exposure at all, or just very little, but they may be engaging in large  transactions, and that limit may become confining  So, we have suggested that this be raised to  $200 million per day and to $500 million for the intermeeting period  The Foreign Currency  Subcommittee has the power to raise both limits  At present that Subcommittee can raise the $100  million to any level--in effect waive the limit if the Subcommittee doesn’t want to set a new limit-- and it can raise the $300 million intermeeting limit It is now proposed that the same powers be  given to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, taking off from the proposed new limits of $200  million per day and $500 million from meeting to meeting  There’s no ceiling on what the  Subcommittee can do because the Subcommittee cannot cause the incurrence of a higher degree of  risk by these particular transactions      There is a minor matter relating to the purchase of foreign currencies for the purpose of   buying another currency with which a swap is to be repaid  That [involves] three transactions, and  if you add them all up, they cut pretty heavily into the daily transaction limit  That was not the  intention   It was discovered that that was indeed what would happen if, say, the Desk buys D- marks, then buys Swiss francs with the marks, and then gives [the francs] to the Swiss National  Bank in repayment of a swap  As I say, the money has moved three times, but it doesn’t make  sense to take that out of the limit  So we are proposing to ignore these transactions for the purpose  of that limit  Well, Mr Chairman, since this would take a vote, I think I will just stop at this point  and let [you proceed on that]       Well, there is an explanation of this here in the paper  There are   essentially two reasons and not everybody considers them equally important  One is that, given the  nature of the definition of the net exposure, it is possible for the Manager to perform a very large     3/21/78              11  operation which completely reverses the existing situation but comes out with the same exposure  on the other side  You can have a plus exposure that you eliminate and make it a minus exposure,  and you haven’t changed the net exposure at all  Yet this would be a sizable operation and, of  course, policy wise, very different  While one would not expect the Manager to do that,  nevertheless it seems that there’s a defect in the way the net position is defined and that ought to be  cured  When the subcommittee discussed this, there didn’t seem to be an easy and obvious way of  curing that defect  Paul Volcker suggested that he would work on trying to find a better  formulation for limiting the net exposure and I’m also doing more work on this  But I have to say  that we did a great deal of work some years back trying to accomplish just that and we didn’t make  any headway      There’s a second reason, which I think the Desk weighs much more heavily, but I do not    And that is that the Desk can be going in and out in small amounts with, say, the Bank of Canada  or the Bank of England  If this is done to excess, then the whole market moves into the central  bank; the central bank preempts the trading that goes on with the nonbank sector, and that is not  desirable from our point of view  We want to have a market with, as you remember, breadth,  depth, and resiliency--to coin a phrase  And this limit tends to inhibit excessive trading of this  kind  Bear in mind that the limit can be removed any time by the Committee or by whoever can be  reached from the Foreign Currency Subcommittee        Well, we are trying to find a way of accomplishing that  It means that   you then say to the Manager you can reduce the exposure from $100 million to, let’s say, zero  exposure and that’s the limit of what we allow you to do  That’s not a meaningful guideline       What you want to do is to limit the additional exposure that the Manager   can create  So it’s fine if the constraint limits him from going from $100 million to $200 million or  above $200 million  But it seems to me that something that increases the protection of the System  account ought not be constrained       Well, I think it’s fair to say that the Desk came up with a proposal of   $300 million per day and $1 billion for the intermeeting period      That seems to me too large, but it’s something that perhaps should be   discussed      May I make two points there?  One is that it raises the question of   whether the ad hoc subcommittee should be continued to work on this  Second, I’d like to  emphasize that any increase we might allow now or subsequently in this particular limit shouldn’t  be understood as a suggestion that the scale of operations should be raised  It’s simply for the  convenience and better functioning of the Desk, not as a hint that they should double our  operations       For this purpose and there’s also a minor issue in that we may wish to   define the nature of “disorder”  There’s work going on in the subcommittee on that      That’s correct      That’s the proposal by the [sub]committee and I move it      The second motion that I’d have to make involves these purchases   leading to the repayment of the swaps  That is all in paragraph 1[B] of the procedural instructions  and I move that it be amended as proposed here       Yes, the second topic we dealt with--the repayment or renewal of the   maturing swaps--I have no immediate final proposal to make, with one exception which Alan  Holmes will talk about subsequently  Essentially there are four options (1) to repay quickly; (2) to  repay with a short rollover of 3 or 4 times for a total 9 to 12 months; (3) to renew for a total of  perhaps 2 years; and (4) to use a device by which the existing swaps are consolidated into a     3/21/78              15  different kind of paper which is amortized over a period of 2 or 3 years, along the lines of the Swiss  model  We’ve done the latter with the Swiss swaps that are outstanding  We have tried to set forth  here the considerations pro and con     From our point of view immediate [repayment] is, of course, in many ways best because it   reduces the risk  It’s true that we [realize] the loss and we forgo the chance that the dollar may  appreciate and reduce the loss, but that is uncertain  All that is certain is that if we renew in any  form we continue to have a risk, which is shared 50-50 with the Bundesbank--provided they go in  on the 50-50 [risk-sharing agreement] on all these [drawings]  Conversely, from the point of view  of the Bundesbank it is quite frustrating to have us repay immediately  The only way this can be  done, practically speaking, is to draw on the Bundesbank to get the D-marks [necessary to repay]   We give them dollars, get D-marks, and then give their own D-marks back to them in payment of  the swap  If the market should turn around dramatically we might still, in the course of a few  months, be able to go in and buy the D-marks in the market  That’s what the Germans hope and  would like to see  But if we say now that we can pay when the swaps mature, namely in April after  6 months--[and some mature in] May and June after 6 months--there is very little time for a  turnaround before repayment  The Bundesbank is very sensitive to our getting D-marks from them  I think it is basically a sense of frustration  They thought that they had what’s in there with them  and now they’re getting the dollars just as if they’d bought them to begin with except that we share  50 percent of the loss during the period the swaps [exist]  But ultimately, it’s just as though they  had done all the intervention and are running all the future risks on dollars  Alan will explain this     So from [the Bundesbank’s] point of view, they lean toward a longer arrangement,   extending the swap for 2 additional years perhaps--the Swiss type slower amortization approach-- because that lengthens the period, postpones the [time] when they’ve got to take dollars, and  increases the hope that we’ll be able to go into the market and unwind [this debt] without taking  D-marks from them  And we’d have the additional advantage that they would not have to make  permanent the monetary expansion that came when we first drew on them and they had to issue  marks  If we give them dollars now, then that monetary expansion is permanent; if we buy the  D-marks in the market and give them to the Bundesbank, then there is a monetary contraction at  that time, which the Bundesbank would probably like although they can offset it one way or the  other       Well, this needs a very detailed and thorough explanation and we didn’t have the time to do   that  Alan and I talked in Frankfurt and Basle, as he pointed out, and persuaded the Germans to be  a little more forthcoming on the length of time we would have for these discussions  What the  Bundesbank suggested in their proposal for a new $2 billion swap was that we roll over the swaps  maturing in the next three months--in April, May, and June  These are all swaps that have run for 6  months and, therefore, have been renewed once  That is the limit, unless we take special action  with respect to the German swaps  They propose that we renew these swaps for 3 months and our  response to them was that we took note of this proposal; we didn’t agree or disagree  The     3/21/78              16  Committee has to decide whether as a first step in dealing with these swaps it wants to [proceed] in  the proposed way     The subcommittee recommends that the Committee do these 3-month renewals and give   guidance for negotiations with the Bundesbank, which would lead to the formulation of a  recommendation or possibly alternative solutions that could be submitted to this Committee for  approval  The Bundesbank would be willing to accept that [based on our] intensive discussions in  Frankfurt, Basle, and elsewhere  So, we do have a recommendation here  I wonder if I may defer  now to Mr Holmes, Mr Chairman, so that he can make his formal recommendations       I share Paul’s view that among the various evils if we cannot get a   repayment after 12 months [by] drawing on the Bundesbank, which I think would probably be  preferable to the Swiss type of arrangement, then certainly the Swiss model is better than a rollover  for 2 years or more  The latter would set a precedent with respect to the length of swaps and  weakens our own position with countries that might borrow from us on swaps [in terms of]  insisting that they have to pay them off after 1 year  There’s one improvement we could do on the  Swiss model and I think Alan has indicated it  The Swiss model leaves all the loss below a certain  level to us; we could go 50-50 with the Bundesbank, if we can persuade them  Whatever the final  loss is, the first recognition of losses when you fund the swap into another instrument is at the  exchange rate of that day  Then there will be further gains or losses as time goes by  There may be  a gain that eventually offsets the original loss--anything is possible--and there may be further  losses It would be good to have the Bundesbank stay with 50-50 and I think we should negotiate     3/21/78              19  these things all as a package, and particularly our right to draw from the Bundesbank rather than be  forced into the market or forced into an undesired rollover  We shouldn’t give on one before we  know what we’re getting on the other       If we do this, I’d like it understood that when they reimburse us they   reimburse us in marks so that any exchange rate fluctuations in the meantime are not against us but  against them       Whether we like it [or not], an exchange of letters is a very laborious   affair with the Treasury      I might say that this leaves open what is going to happen down the road    If we go 60-40, then the Treasury will run out of their SDRs before we run out of our $2 billion   Of course, we hope that we’re not going to go to the limit for either of them  But if that were to  happen, then the Treasury has to look for additional funds       The IMF, for instance  Or we have to change the ratio  I would much   prefer the former, but we should not be there naked and alone; we should have the Treasury with us  whenever it happens       In a sense, of course, our losses fall on the Treasury      I have a final item from the ad hoc subcommittee report, which deals  with the scale of intervention  As you know, after the Treasury came in, [our] intervention was  more forceful and of a technically different type also--that is, going in part to the banks directly  with bids or offers  The question is how long we should continue at this higher scale of operation   The subcommittee felt that in the absence of more fundamental policy measures by the  government, continuation of the recent large scale was undesirable  The subcommittee in a  somewhat ad hoc form took this matter into its hands and suggested to the Manager that the Desk  think in terms of a $300 million limit in the period between meetings--a limit which could not be  observed  The ad hoc subcommittee, of course, is not the party that controls the intermeeting or  daily limits; that is the Foreign Currency Subcommittee  And on a couple of occasions the latter  Subcommittee did authorize the Desk to exceed its limits      We’ve been trying to grope for some kind of definition of a proper scale of intervention and   cannot say that we’ve found something that is very satisfactory to the members of the  subcommittee, or at least to me  But there seemed to be two determinants of the proper scale  One  is the degree of disorder  When there’s more disorder, then presumably more intervention is  needed to counter that disorder  Second, however, for a given degree of disorder one can, of  course, operate more or less forcefully  And the definition of that degree of force eludes us  But  it’s clear that when we have a limit of $100 million per day for changing the overall open exposure,  that sets a scale  The Foreign Currency Subcommittee, of course, could take an action to reduce  that scale if it wanted to  It’s this range of questions that concerned us  There was one suggestion  that to me at least seemed to give some help on this issue  And that is that when there has been a  package deal or when some special unsettlement due to a very unusual event has occurred in the  market, this justifies stepping up the degree of force of intervention relative to the degree of  disorder  But once that has been done and an immediate short-run objective has been  accomplished--whether it has created order or whether it has held the rate or not--we should wind  down [our operations] quickly, within a few days  Otherwise there is a great danger of spending  money limitlessly  That concludes my report         Well, I would hope that eventually we can get to definitions of types of   disorders  You seem to imply the types of disorder are limitless  There can be wider spreads,  jumpier rates, fewer participants in the market, more rapid movement in the rates--        3/21/78              25    Nevertheless, it ought to be possible to describe the market in those   terms because essentially the Manager has to make up his mind whether that is one of the  conditions of the market and whether he wants to operate  So, the decision can be made on the  spur of the moment or presumably it can be made once the excitement has died down  Now, how  closely can we monitor the Desk?   I think our Desk is doing a fine job and we should allow the  judgment of the man on the spot to prevail  But the Committee, I think, does need to maintain  some kind of oversight of the operation because the amounts to which the Desk could go if it  operated badly are very considerable  In three days the Desk can go through $300 million, and  then they must say--unless the Foreign Currency Subcommittee raises the limit from $300 million  to $500 million, which it can do--we’re out of the market  That could be very damaging  And once  the limit has been raised to $500 million, then again when it is used up, the FOMC is on the line  and has to make up its mind whether to go out of the market or increase the limit  So, I think we do  want to have some control over the approach to all these decision points        Well, the most cited things would be energy legislation and action on   fiscal and monetary policy and, therefore, on inflation  These are the fundamentals  Then there are  bridging actions, which aren’t very fundamental, but nevertheless go beyond intervention  That  would be to sell SDRs, draw on the IMF, sell gold, or maybe issue foreign currency bonds       If I may add a comment  Even though we do now have a strong concern   about the value of the dollar and the desirability, if it can be avoided, of keeping it from  depreciating--short, of course, of pegging a rate--the yen is a pretty special proposition  The  Japanese have such a large surplus and it is projected to continue at such a level into the future that  I think here lies the exception from the thought that it is undesirable to see the dollar go down  against any [currency]  Against the yen, I think it may very well have to go down       I’d like to go back to the employment data once more, if I may  About   six months ago, in the September Greenbook, I think it was estimated that for the first quarter of  ’78 the unemployment rate would be 68 percent and that by the fourth quarter of ’78 it would be  66 percent  Here we are in March and the unemployment rate is not 68; it’s 62 for the quarter  and it’s currently 61  And the Greenbook estimate is 59 percent for the fourth quarter of ’78      3/21/78              30  Granting all the uncertainties about the data, as Jerry Zeisel said, the present unemployment sample  is a better and bigger one than we had in the past  So there is no strong reason to think that the data  are wrong, although the rate might jump up again  The increase in payroll employment has been  very strong, which confirms that there may be something to this sharp reduction in unemployment   Nobody knows why but it must be an expectation by businesses of strong activity ahead  In any  event, we’re now very close to what I would regard as the zone of full employment  You can say  it’s 5 to 6 percent or 5-1/2 to 6 percent, but I would be surprised if we could be in the 5 to 5-1/2  percent zone without generating significant wage pressures  I read in Dunn’s Review that labor  shortages are turning up in the Sun Belt in a number of skilled occupations  So we’re beginning to  have the first inkling of getting close to full employment--give or take 1/2 percentage point  I think  that tells us that if we want to get ready for a soft landing, we’ve got to do it rather faster than I  would have thought       Yes, a speedy soft landing  I thought we had a year or two years, but I   think it’s probably less  The sustainable rate of growth is something like 3-1/2 percent, I think  We  need to envisage getting to that within a year or so; there would be no great damage if that were  attained around that time or even a little earlier  That does mean doing things that will allow the  rate of growth to diminish--not because of the dollar but because of the internal situation and the  need to avoid inflation and then recession  We certainly don’t need a recession but we need to  avoid the inflation that will bring a recession       We’ll have a conference on this at Brookings within a month  I have a   150-page analysis of the technicalities of it now, which says that it’s bad but no worse than the  income equalization tax       Why not go through with it?      If you contemplate what Humphrey-Hawkins implies, if anybody abroad   thought this would be taken seriously, we would be disavowing all our anti-inflation effort      Peter, has it ever been pointed out to our friends abroad that when they   buy Treasury bills so single-mindedly, that they have reduced the interest differential and,  therefore, find themselves buying more Treasury bills?       Are they aware that at the present time this great concentration of buying   is actually pushing down the bill rate a little?      Steve, I see that the nonborrowed reserves and to a lesser extent the base   rose very sharply in the last three months   Do you see any significance in that for future money  growth?       I’m really very concerned about the Federal Reserve predicting a rate of   inflation because that works its way through immediately into interest rates, if anybody takes it  seriously  I wonder whether there aren’t ways of qualifying this  For instance, I found myself  putting down three alternative scenarios here for these [inflation] numbers  After all, we don’t  control them; the outcome depends on what the Administration does and what Congress does       Likewise, I think probabilities can be mentioned [on] fears that inflation  may rise significantly, but I would be very bothered by some numbers stated cold, whether [they  represent] your view or the Committee’s       I feel that the good days of stable interest rates are approaching an end   We have a strong month, as far as prospects for M1 are concerned, ahead of us  Of course, this  may turn out to be wrong, but I share Phil Jackson’s thought that the seasonal adjustment which has  already been applied in order to pull [April’s growth rate] down ought to make us aware that this  may be a very strong month without showing itself  And I look at the interest rates that are  projected over the rest of the year in Appendix 2  Now, this calls for alternative B if things turn out  that way--a 1-1/4 percentage point rise over the rest of the year  And we don’t get there by sticking  at a 6-3/4 percent fed funds rate indefinitely  I would wait, certainly, until the evidence is in on a  strong April; but with that in mind I’d lower the M1 range to 4-1/2 to 8, which I find desirable   Anyway, I prefer narrower ranges  I’d set the funds rate range at 6-3/4 to 7-1/4, with instructions to  the Manager not to go to the midpoint of that until two more weeks of data are in so that we don’t  make a false move by chance  But if the data develop as expected, then an upward move will be  triggered after a while, and I think we have to--painful as it is--make a start on getting the funds  rate up  I haven’t said anything about M2; I would move that to 6 to 9 instead of 6 to 10  And I’d  go with an aggregates directive, always bearing in mind that the instruction is not to move for the  first couple of weeks        Mr Chairman, we’re now constraining the funds rate more than we’ve   ever done, I think, by giving it essentially a 1/4 percentage point range to move in  We’ve come a  long way from saying that the funds rate ought to be reasonably flexible  Reasonably flexible  shouldn’t be too much in the means of determining market rates and we should look to the  aggregates  But here we’re moving very far in the direction of a pure interest rate target, just  moderately constrained by the aggregates  And it seems to make some sense in the present case;  we anticipate an upshoot in the aggregates and we want to have the rate triggered in the upward  direction  But in that case I think we ought to have 7-1/4 rather than 6-1/2 to 7       Well, really 6-3/4 but I could live with 6-1/2, subject to not going there   without consulting      Let me say, Mr Chairman, this is quite the opposite operation from what   we’re talking about  This is one where the Treasury is a lender, not a borrower  Second, I really  don’t see any reason to believe that the Treasury will renege on an arrangement that it has made  with you, even though verbally, and that we’re now going to confirm in writing  And third, I don’t  know why we should quite needlessly--abstractly, it seems to me--irritate them by informing them  that we’re terminating this thing  If they’ve lent to Mexico, say, and we think it is a bad thing for  them [to lend to] Mexico--we have not been in on the deal--and they come to us after a year and  Mexico has [now repaid] they might say please warehouse [these funds]  That is the situation  foreseen  We can still talk to them about it  We’re not, I think, ironclad bound to make that  transaction         Could be on [unintelligible] it was also on the British                    How about the authorization that we have raised from--      Well, that is not disorderly       Narrowness or an absence of trading sometimes is orderly       Well, it is an old joke that disorder at the New York Desk occurs only on  the way down, but I think Scott had a good point here  A broader definition of disorder means that  once a currency has been going down and down, then the presumption when it jumps by some  points if certain conditions occur is [unintelligible] when it recovers  I talked to the Bundesbank  last night to see if they felt inclined to do any buying  They said yes, [they] could have done some;  they didn’t  If this recurred, [they] might  So the thought is in everybody’s mind but I ought to  stress Paul Volcker’s point that you give a signal to the market that you are trying to hold the rate  down if you appear visibly and very systematically  We would have to do it within Europe or we’d  have to go through the BIS to be as invisible as possible       Well, I do think it is important to contemplate this market euphoria [in the  context of] what the Greenbook says  The staff is very pessimistic on the outlook for the dollar,  and I find it very hard to square the behavior of the market [with] that  [That] the market has  thought so far ahead that it is even discounting all the Greenbook states and is now looking beyond  that valley is remotely possible, but [traders] haven’t been distinguished by great foresight       Briefly, two things  In discussing the swap repayment with the Germans,  we focused on what can be done to implement early repayment  We did not talk about the funding  option because that exposes us to greater risk  It seems to be what they prefer  We discovered that  they are quite willing to let us buy back in the market without fear of damaging what they hope will  be the recovery of the dollar  And we ought to move somewhat in that direction  The ball is now  in their court  They are discussing means of repayment with their directorate and will come back to  us with a proposal  We have to agree in May to something in order to be able to have a proposal  for the FOMC before the meeting       We have rolled over through June--       One other thing, if I may  I found really a depressing degree of  anti-Americanism as I have read the European press  They are very angry at us  I did not find this  with the people I dealt with  And I had a number of public appearances with Emminger and  Lambsdorff to show that there was no bad feeling and that we loved each other  But the press is  very bitter about the United States, and this focuses largely on the dollar and what they perceive to  be our hogging the supply of oil       Well, Ernie has made much of the point I wanted to make  I think we can  say something in qualitative terms  It would be difficult to marry ourselves to a 3-year--even a  variable 3-year--quantitative target  I am trying to put together some thoughts on how this  Committee operates and targets things and I’ll be in St Louis giving a talk on this subject  You  will hear more about it  It seems to me that the basic fact is that so long as we don’t have full  control, it is not very meaningful to set forth [a goal for] an instrument in the long term  That is  why a money supply target or any other target can’t be made to stick  You need many more  controls over the economy than just that one in order to make it stick  So it will always have to be  a variant       Well, I see us moving into a pattern that is quite traditional in business  cycles   My question is how genuinely this pattern reflects past developments  We are  approaching a high level of employment--I would call it getting close to full employment--and  prices are beginning to rise  Now, ordinarily, I would associate these two things  There are always  special reasons why prices may be rising that are not associated with the expansion of the economy  in the latter phases of the business cycle  And I would like to get the staff’s reaction to whether we  are facing a traditional pattern where one would have to say this is in danger of getting out of hand   Or are there enough special circumstances so that one could hope the pressures would not be  exacerbated unless monetary policy took action against it?       I would be satisfied to stay with M1 as it is  I would, if possible, cut back  M2 and M3 simply to accommodate to the degree of disintermediation  I don’t think that means a  great deal for the actual liquidity of the economy because the people who no longer hold M2 or M3  hold something else as a liquid asset  It does mean something for housing to us because it affects  the flow into the institutions that finance housing  I agree that we ought to be concerned with  getting within our targets; we have overshot each of the last five targets but one  We are outside all  those except the most recent one and that shows that we have pumped quite a bit of money into the  economy  I would recognize the argument that Steve put forward--that if nominal GNP rises, a  constraint on money growth means something different in terms of financial pressures  One can’t  deny that  On the other hand, if one were to follow that thought out to its ultimate conclusion, one  would always be accommodating inflation  And the higher inflation goes, the more money we  need  That surely cannot be the policy that we want to follow  So as a practical matter, I would  expect that if we stay with the existing M1 range we may find ourselves pushed toward the upper  end of the band and maybe even above it, but we should at least make an effort to hold it there   Cyclically I think that is the right thing to do and I think it is also the right thing to do in terms of   the considerations that Steve has mentioned on the side of either reducing or holding on to this  level       Yes, I can vote for that       I share Phil’s views  I think it is not conducive to good policymaking to be  put in a position of having this kind of forecast  It isn’t quite clear to me whether it is a forecast or  a target  Presumably, it would be the latter  I wouldn’t want to have an unemployment target of 6  percent even though it might be my forecast  And I wouldn’t want to have an inflation target of  your numbers and my own [forecast] would be a little higher  So I think that the way you achieve  agreement in this group is not to argue over the various real sector numbers which, of course, we  could multiply very considerably; it is not only these three  We can agree on a proxy for what kind  of policy we have in mind  That is what we are doing and that is what is relatively easy for a group  to agree on--the aggregates or interest rates  So my inclination is to stay as far as we can from     4/18/78             38  having either projections or targets of a quantitative kind and to make whatever you say as much  yours as you can       I want to commend the staff for narrowing the aggregates ranges [shown in  the Bluebook]  At the same time, I don’t think a range of 6 to l0 with a midpoint of 8 is a very  good way of getting to a 5-1/4 percent 1-year target  So I think we should hold these down in any  event or treat them simply as triggers and not as particular rates of growth in the money supply that  we anticipate  I would say 4 to 8 [for M1] and for M2, 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 since that 1/2 point seems to  be the spread now  On the funds rate, I wouldn’t like to see it go below where it is in any event  because of international implications  I would like to see it move up fairly promptly before the  Treasury financing so that any damage that might result falls on the government rather than on the  innocent buyer who might feel that he had been misled  And I would like an asymmetrical  midpoint with the 6-3/4 to 7-1/2--a 7 percent midpoint--and an aggregates directive       We have protected ourselves by that consultation at 7-1/4       Well, if somebody had told me at the last meeting what these numbers  were going to turn out to be--and had I believed him--I would certainly have voted for [moving]  more quickly and going this week to 7-1/2 percent on the funds rate  Now, we have some slight  hope that the numbers will reverse themselves  They should have reversed themselves this week if  the tax phenomenon was really the main cause and they haven’t done so  So this is a somewhat  weak hope  There is, of course, a question of whether our long-term targets are realistic and  whether we can expect the velocity increases that [were implicit] in those  For that reason I’m not  quite as worried as Mark Willes about longer-run overshoots  [I have a] concern that we will [be]  giving a demonstration of no action in the face of these measures  I would have preferred,  therefore, to move now on the discount rate increase; an early time is second best  I could find an  argument in favor of putting it off--that we would like to have these data, if they are as bad as they  appear now, in the open  I think that would give us a lot more support  But that is only a question  of the week  I think it is likely that we’re going to be under continuing pressure and my preference,  therefore, would be to go to 7-1/2 percent        I would add that from the point of view of the exchange markets to delay  both actions would be adverse  A discount rate action would indicate that we’re responding in  some way       They have been down [and then] a little up       5/5/78              11     I’d like to add to what Scott said  I think our ability to repay the  Bundesbank is now reasonably assured  They seem to be willing to [offer] us D-marks if we can’t  get them through one of the other operations  As Scott has laid out, we can get them through their  capital export conversions, we can buy them in the market, and we can possibly get them from  special transactions where the Germans need dollars  And if all that doesn’t add up before the end  of the year--that is, before the end of that 12-month period on each particular swap transaction-- they would be prepared to [sell] us D-marks  So to that extent we would seem to be in the clear, as  far as repayment is concerned      Now, as far as the rate is concerned, we should not have in mind any particular rate; we rely  on fundamentals  But there is such a thing as going too fast and there’s also such a thing as trying  to look ahead to see what the fundamentals are going to be  In both senses it seems to me that the  rate has gone quite fast and it has gone in a direction that is not what the forecast of the current  account deficit would lead one to think  It’s quite possible that the market has looked farther than  we have, but that’s not the impression one gets from talking to people and asking them what they  expect in the way of a deficit in 1978 and in 1979  The official statement is still that the deficit in  ’78 will be at least as big, or a little bigger, than that in ’77  And while nobody says anything about  ’79, the outlook is not very strong  The summary of my remarks is that to the extent we can  influence the rate by being more active when there is disorder on the upside or buying back marks  simply because we need to repay--which is a known fact--I think we ought to do that  And if that  slows down the upward move of the rates somewhat, I think that would be all for the good       Well, as we pay off [the drawings] we are closing out the old line of $2  billion, but the new line of $2 billion we haven’t even drawn upon  So we would always find  ourselves with at least a $2 billion line  I think the fact that we’re repaying they regard as normal  There was an issue at one time of whether we wanted to fund the debt--and I think they might have  liked the funding idea--by carrying it over one year  It was the sense of this Committee that that  would not be a good idea; we wanted to pay it off after one year  And we pushed fairly firmly in  our negotiations for that  The Germans dropped the funding idea without saying anything more  about it       Yes, this is part of the capital export conversion program  The Germans  have an agreement with their banks that--well, for customers [who] put on D-mark issues and when  these customers are foreigners, they want dollars and instead of buying the dollars in the market,     5/16/78              4  they buy them from the Bundesbank  That means that there’s less support for the dollar than there  ought to be from these capital outflows  But the Bundesbank gets rid of its dollars  That’s their  intention  We have pressed for some of this to be put into the market  That hasn’t carried very far   But we’ve been able to get one half, on average, of these accruing D-marks  And then we use  these for repayment instead of buying back in the market  So the effect of that is to avoid a  downward pressure on the dollar  To the extent that we use them for repayment as we do, it works  in the right direction  The only sterilization of the effects that takes place is when the Bundesbank  keeps the D-marks and gets rid of the dollars  We have no firm commitment there but I understand  that they’ve been very cooperative in offering us [D-marks]  And on the Canadian, we’ve been  getting half or more, is that right?       The Canadians have been a little sensitive about these operations  If we  got any sales in the market it would mean that they were getting less for their D-mark than they  might, so we had to take that into account also       Speaking of sterilization really as a--       No, as the exchange rate effect  They sterilize the exchange rate effect that  would occur if a foreign borrower sells the D-marks he’s borrowed, gets the dollars that he needs,  and thereby drives up the dollar  That effect doesn’t take place; they sterilize it  That’s what I had  in mind       If part of the D-marks they borrowed were sold in the market, thereby  driving down the price of the D-mark, they fare a little worse than if the same D-marks are sold to  the Bundesbank at what they hope would be a slightly better price  We’re always talking about  very small differences, of course  I just wanted to add--       Chuck is right that what the Bundesbank does is also a domestic  sterilization operation  They absorb D-marks from the market and get rid of dollars       Jerry, if I may, it seems to me that you’re being very optimistic with 5-1/2  percent  You focus on the quantitative phenomena--changes in the structure of the labor force and  so forth  I think we have to take into account also changes in attitudes  One factor you mentioned  goes in the other direction--the phasing out of the long compensation period  But I think basically  there is a much greater acceptance of unemployment as not very detrimental, not at all  dishonorable, and in some respects a productive condition  And that, it seems to me, injects a very  significant upward bias into the rates       I’m less optimistic on the price outlook than the staff  We’ve now had  three months where the [increase in the] CPI, computed at an annual rate, would be at 9 percent   We are likely to get another bad month in April because we’ve had a bad wholesale price index   That would give us four bad months to live down, as it were, if we want to stay at or near a 7  percent CPI for the year  In fact, it would have to [rise] at close to a 5 to 6 percent annual rate for  the rest of the year and I think that’s quite unlikely in the light of what we see  So I’m pessimistic  about the price outlook  I feel that way also because from my colloquy with Chuck it is clear that I  think the limit on where we can go with unemployment without producing more inflation is  unfortunately higher  I don’t doubt that one could get to 5-1/2 percent or even 5, but you see that  even now there are some inflationary consequences  They may not be closely related to  employment, but I think four or five of the Reserve Banks referred in the Redbook to incipient  skilled labor shortages  [The unemployment rate for] married males is 3 percent, if it hasn’t gone  down below that  So my concern about inflation rests on these factors      Now, as far as income is concerned, if you take 6 percent unemployment or near there--I  would be surprised if it did go below that--what we ought to do then is not to aim above 4 percent  for real growth  In fact, we ought to aim over the rest of the year for slowing down to the  long-term rate of 3-1/2 percent  That’s about what we can expect to do at constant unemployment   We don’t have to shift to that right now but by the end of the year it seems to me we ought to not  worry at all if we’re in the 3 to 4 or around the 3-1/2 percent range  That makes me somewhat  more relaxed about concerns that the economy is not as strong as it seemed to be       Right, a soft landing       Given the prospects for a reduced federal deficit and reduced federal  borrowing, can you make any quantitative guess as to what impact that might have on interest rates  if nothing else changes?  Would it be at all significant?       Let me look at the economy first  Inflation looks worse than it did some  time ago  Growth looks a little worse, too, but I think that’s not inappropriate because we are, in  my opinion, close to full employment  I think our main need now is to go out against accelerating  inflation  If [a pickup in inflation] were to happen, we would be sure of a recession and probably,  with inflation going into wages, very little chance of winding down that inflation  As far as the   dollar is concerned, I would argue that it’s strong enough and we don’t need to do much to tighten  as far as that consideration is concerned, which I don’t give a great deal of weight to  Now, that  [leads] me to [want a] somewhat tighter position  Looking at the aggregates, I think the evolution  of M1 over time will be that we will not try to get back on track but that we will go on  overshooting and using base drift as a means of covering our tracks  So we’ll be going on at 4 to  6-1/2 percent  I don’t share Philip’s view that we ought to change this because I think it would  create a false psychological impact  But I do agree that it’s not a meaningful target once one  recognizes that velocity gains are going to be smaller than seemed possible  But we can get by  perfectly with 4 to 6-1/2 and occasional overshoots  The danger is, I think, that these overshoots  might be very large and I’d like to guard against that by setting a slightly higher funds rate target  now and putting the trigger points on the aggregates not too high  So that would get me to a range  of 7-1/4 to 7-3/4 on the funds rate, with 7-1/2 to move to  For M1 I would have 3 to 7-1/2, bearing  in mind the need for a relatively low upper trigger  [I’d favor] for M2 a range of 4 to 8 and a  monetary aggregates directive       We shouldn’t go immediately after Thursday because if the preliminary  indications stand up, then Thursday there would be a considerable drop [in the money supply  figures we publish], which is not unexpected, but wouldn’t be consonant with a move       That’s not the language of the directive       Mr Chairman, the way it is written I think is quite a distance from where  we are now  It’s more in the direction of an interest rate oriented, and less of an aggregates  oriented--       I would support that       I think this is a code word now for one thing to support another       I feel the same way       That’s not really the intention that I think was implied today  We treated  the ranges as trigger points and not as a defining midpoint       You move gradually       Scott, how is the program going--that we buy moderately but as  regularly as we can?       What percentage of days would that be, approximately, in this last  period?       I think we might go to the revisions, Mr Chairman       I can summarize       We are [proposing] essentially six things  First, as you know, we want  to get rid of the gross transactions limit, which has proved cumbersome in active trading  There  is a reason for it, namely that the limitation on the Manager of not being able to change the  overall open position by more than $100 million a day and $300 million in the intermeeting  period is ambiguous  He could make very large transactions, reversing totally the entire position  from plus to minus, even though he couldn=t do intermediate-size transactions that would change  the position moderately  He is very unlikely to do that, but it was just procedurally defective to  have such a provision  If we should ever get audited in this area by the GAO, which I assume  we will not, it would become apparent that our procedures were not watertight  So to replace the  gross transactions limit, which is to be dropped, we add the net position  The net position refers     6/20/78                4  to positions in a single currency and is taken with respect to signs that make a difference whether  we=re long or short whereas the overall [limit] makes no distinction between being long or short;  it=s just the measure of risk  By adding the net position and giving the Manager the same right--  $100 million a day and $300 million between meetings--we have relatively simple numbers  They are the same as on the overall open position  At the same time, we make the regulations  watertight and prevent a Manager who was going haywire from making very big changes that  would be possible under the overall open [position limit]  Then we add a restraint on substantial  trading  The Desk has found that it can achieve desirable market effects by making a two-way  market--offering bid and ask deals--and that can add up very rapidly to large transactions without  changing the net position very much if at all  So in order to make sure that when that happens  we do have a control, it is also entered into the procedural instructions that a Manager must  communicate that      [Also, we have proposed] two minor things  We say “operation” now where in the past we  have said “transaction”  Transaction presumably refers to any single $5 million affair   Operation means a kind of campaign undertaken to achieve a given objective and it seems more  meaningful to have the Desk communicate on operations rather than transactions  And finally  we adjust the authorization, which is the more fundamental instrument compared with the  procedural instructions, so that we refer there now to the [net] position rather than the [open]  position  It=s a terminology change that seems to make sense if we say “open” for something that  involves risk and “net” for something that is merely a position without indicating whether it  actually involves an open position or not       The proposal is that it be on the net position  The overall open [position]  is the major risk measure and the net is in a single currency, taking account of sign--either way   In other words, plus is not the same as minus but on the open [position] plus is the same as  minus      We=ve also sent you a set of papers on disorder  It was not possible to be very precise in  defining this  The term is used all around the world and everybody is very careful always to  claim that he is intervening only to counter disorder, not to influence the rate  We have found  that disorder is a fairly flexible term but disorder can [have] a cumulative aspect  So if rates as a  result of [changes over] a series of days move continuously in one direction, one can regard this  as a disorderly market and accordingly intervene to overcome that       I=d like to make a suggestion, which really follows in the footsteps of  what Bob and Larry have said  This is a very artificial performance where three different kinds  of unlikely assumptions have to be made in order to get a halfway presentable result--namely,  that the demand function for money shifts, that Regulation Q is raised again, and that interest  rates remain at the lower level of the estimated range  All these things are not likely to happen at  the same time  It=s a purely formal exercise  I wondered if we could not authorize the staff to do  the following in addition to [not] instead of what they are doing now simply assume that the  5-1/4 percent midpoint growth rate that follows from our M1 range [goes from the current actual  level of M1]  Likewise the M2 midpoint would be employed on the basis of where we are with  the money supply so that the overshoot is in essence integrated into the existing money supply  rather than trying to come back on track as, of course, the exact observance of the targets would  require  We could do two projections, perhaps--one the rigorous one and the other with this  modification  We would get a better answer to Larry Roos=s problem       Well, it looks as though we are coming in for some sort of landing  It is not  clear whether it will be a soft one and I think it very much depends on what we do  If you look  ahead one year, monetary policy has time to be effective  If we do what is in the Bluebook which, of  course, is a purely statistical exercise, I think we tilt the probability very clearly in favor of a  recession  Now, I think we=re not going to do anything like that  We may or may not suspend [the  range for] M1; that doesn=t cause the concept to go away  I would say that M1 [will be] interpreted  excluding automatic transfers, given the past behavior of our group to something like this; we will  think of it as moving at the upper edge of the band  We=re not going to change the band very much,  if at all, and we added 1 percent to overshoots in the second quarter so that 6-1/2 really becomes  7-1/2 and that is not an unsustainable thing if you think of GNP as moving somewhere around 11 to  11-1/2 percent in nominal terms  Some rise in interest rates plus the normal uptrend of velocity will  make that, I think, roughly livable  So that=s not a guarantee of a recession at all     Now, I do think we need to come down from the relatively high growth estimates that still  exist  I think our potential is probably closer to 3-1/4 than 3-1/2 or 3-3/4 percent  The IMF seems to  have taken us to task in their consultation for having a higher potential than seemed reasonable  We  looked at the rapid growth of the labor force recently  That must have involved some borrowing  from future increases, which would mean that given rather poor productivity and not a very fast     6/20/78                26  growth of the labor force hereafter the potential can=t be very high  That=s why I say 3-1/4 I would  think that we ought to expect and try for GNP growth of that level  It would also be confirmed and  supported by the suspicion some of us have about capacity; the paper that John Balles circulated  suggests that  I=ve always been skeptical about how much the capacity level really is in both the  labor force and in manufacturing  So again for that reason--approaching capacity--we ought to slow  down  Given all this I think we still have a chance of a recession but a less than even one  It  depends very much on what happens to inflation  If inflation remains halfway moderate, we will not  be driven into actions, and the economy will not be driven into reactions, that will precipitate a  recession  I=d be surprised if we got away with less than 7-1/2 percent inflation; 8 percent is a more  likely number and that is barely consistent with thinking that we may be spared a recession or may at  worst have a growth recession       Yes, the next 12 months  And likewise on GNP I=d be inclined to say that  we would be at 3-1/4 percent a year from now  We might have a little more, of course, over that  period  Unemployment [I’d put at] 6 percent  But the main issue really depends on whether  inflation becomes such that the economy and any reasonable monetary policy would create pressures  that would push the economy down       Well, I would like to move up the funds rate  I=d like to give us room to go  from 7-1/2 to 8-1/4 but with consultation at 8  I think we have to recognize that, whatever we call it,  we’re really on a funds rate target and that every move now is very sensitive, so we ought to have  more consultation  As far as the directive is concerned, I still would prefer an aggregates directive  because it may provide for a smoother movement over the month than a money market conditions  directive  I wish I could find a way of pulling down the ranges somewhat and getting them more in  line with what we say our long-term one-year ranges are  But that does set in motion immediately a  movement of the funds rate  So I=ll go with the staff=s alternative B, 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent for both       I think we=re in some danger of talking ourselves into a change in policy  I  wouldn=t give up the one-year ranges quite that easily even though they are unrealistic       I can see the rate then staying put while the aggregates move and then  comes the moment for their [unintelligible] when they have to take a jump  That=s not a happy  situation         At that point we might have a consultation to do another 1/4 so that the  whole move then would be 1/2 and we might not have the courage to do that  I=d rather let the  market do it for us       Mr Chairman, I had moved [my ranges] in a lower direction because mine  were predicated on being able to go as far as 8-1/4       How quickly would we eliminate the existing stock?       On a small scale       Yes  I just wanted to note that in looking at the cost of the swap in terms  of losses that Scott just described, it’s worth bearing in mind that we’re paying interest at the dollar  rate, not at the D-mark rate  I think the staff is working now to figure out how much that difference  is and what we might do about it  We get this 50-50 loss sharing, which is fine, but they’re taking  us on the interest rate  We really ought to split the interest rate between the dollar rate and the  D-mark rate in order to make it fair for both sides  We’re working on that       During the last BIS meeting the Japanese came to me and suggested that  we now implement something that                                                                                                                               [The Japanese] are interested in having the System intervene in yen for its own  account instead of just as an agent  I said we’d have to discuss this here but gave them very little  hope, citing the objections that exist there  The Chairman and I have talked about this and I’ve also  taken it up with Tony Solomon  There seems to be a continued strong feeling that it would not be  appropriate at this time to intervene in yen--that is, to support the currency that has the biggest  current account surplus  It would undoubtedly arouse a lot of political comment if we were to give  any support to the yen for our account  It would also probably be unwise in terms of the  prospective losses, considering how strong that currency is in a fundamental sense       Yes  I could visualize it if this were a concession as part of a package  But  as you know, the Japanese have not been terribly forthcoming on their summit package and their  trade negotiations       Jim, you have alternative levels for inflation and unemployment, which if I  read this correctly are roughly of a 1-to-1 nature  One percent more inflation saves you 1 percent  on unemployment and vice versa  How does that check with the numbers that we frequently hear  from Charlie Schultze and Art Okun where a much less favorable tradeoff is assumed?   I think  something like 1 percent on unemployment gets you a 02 percent reduction in inflation  Also,  there’s the widespread argument that the Phillips curve, which this seems to imply, is really an  unstable construct and doesn’t have any validity for the longer run       Thank you       I think the possibility that these figures may not materialize is quite  considerable  The chances are still that we will make it without a recession but I think the chances  have increased that we might have a recession  Full employment has come upon us more rapidly  than we thought and you might say that we again missed the right timing for a soft landing  We  should have moved a little earlier, realizing as we do now how quickly unemployment was coming  down  That was quite unanticipated  So we confront now some considerable imbalances in the  economy with very little room for maneuver for accommodating them  Inflation is mounting; if I  am skeptical of anything in the staff forecast it is the moderate inflation forecast  I see next year as  one of very strong wage contracts and the possibility of a wage explosion in the organized sector  carrying over into other prices  So that seems to be the most vulnerable aspect of the projection   Other than that, I would say that these numbers are perhaps the most likely single outcome but the  probability of its being realized I think has diminished in recent months       Are we averaging here recessions and continued expansions?       I would argue very strongly for not changing the present M1 range, and not  changing any of the relationships of the three aggregates  First, there are substantive reasons for  proceeding as I suggest  We have for a long time had an unrealistic M1 target; we’ve lived with  that by utilizing base drift  We have adjusted it, in effect, from quarter to quarter and we [operated]  essentially on a very modified money supply or aggregates target  We have been more nearly on  an interest rate target  At the present time I think the dangers of ignoring sudden upward  movements on the interest rate, as might come from observing a tight money supply target very  closely, are particularly great     Now, we probably are going to have automatic transfers and I am impressed by what Frank  says--that they might not produce very much of a change  I can visualize, because of the very fact  that NOW accounts have been talked about so widely nationally, that people would be prepared for  them now and would be interested in taking advantage of them  I wouldn’t write this off  In the  least favorable case, I think Steve predicted an improvement in velocity--if you can call it that--of 1  percentage point and the maximum I think you had was 3       Yes, so that it might be in the range of 1 to 3 percentage points on growth  or equivalent of growth depending on the [unintelligible]  At that time then, we could use [the new  accounts as a reason] to get away from an unrealistic M1 target  We have lived with it for a long  time and I think we might live with it for another quarter or two      Let me point to what I think would be the consequences of changing the ranges or the  relationship of the aggregates in any major way  I am sure you have all been discussing the  implications of our discount rate action when asked questions by the press; I have gotten this  abroad  Everybody is looking at us wondering whether we are about to move to inflate ourselves  out of an oncoming recession  And if we do anything like this, there will be a very general and  uncontrollable reaction among central bankers abroad, in the press here, and I would guess the  general public [to the perception] that we have turned  And to say what we might say--that there is  a technical adjustment and we haven’t changed our thinking at all--will be taken as a major policy  change for fighting an oncoming recession rather than continuing to fight inflation      Since that isn’t, as I see it, this group’s view or intention, we should not give a misleading  signal in that direction  The only way to avoid giving that misleading signal is not to make a public  statement to that effect but to stick for the time being with the M1 targets certainly  On M2 and  M3, I have great misgivings as to their meanings  I think M2 is not a factor that determines  economic activity  M1 transactions balances one can say ought to have some relationship in  influencing activity  Savings deposits influence activity in a very indirect and remote sense,  namely by making people feel a little more liquid and so they will spend their M1 a little faster   But that is a far cry from saying it is a determinant  And that is of course what our research shows   that M1 is what has the close relationship to [income] and determining it even though the velocity  fluctuates; and that M2, even though it has a statistically close relationship, is really not a  [determinant] relationship  So I would stick with M1, not give any weight to M2 or M3, and for  the present exercise today I would leave all three targets unchanged     7/18/78              26       Well, a benefit of the automatic transfer--       Base drift makes anything doable       Loans from foreign banks I think are what you asked about  In other  words, Barclays lending [unintelligible]  But that is a big factor in this       Well, I think we can do without an interest rate increase at this time  If we  do 1/4 every two months we will do 3/4s over the rest of the year to January and I think that is what  one can now foresee as likely  So I would stay with 7-3/4  I would like to see an upward move  triggered more readily than a downward move, so I would reduce the M1 range to 4 to 8 and the  M2 range to 6 to l0, but with a money market directive so that we are in an asymmetrical position   Then it’s only when the upper limits get triggered that there should be a move       You could tell them     7/18/78              44       One reason is the timing of Board meetings       Any clue, Mr Chairman, on the discussion of the yen swap?       But isn't the Treasury doing that now?       I see we are now counting on a full employment surplus in the second  quarter of $12 billion  We still have a very large actual unified budget deficit  How do we get  from a large deficit at about 6 percent unemployment to a full employment surplus at, I would  assume, 49 percent?       No longer is there basis--       Well, I thought it was 49 but if you tell me it's otherwise, then you've  resolved my perplexity       Well, just to give it a little variety, I think it's quite difficult now to be  married to a single forecast  One has to ask oneself what the probabilities are of a negative growth  rate sometime in 1979       Successively, say in the first half of '79 or beginning in the second  quarter and following through so that it will be classified as a recession  I would think that there  are enough imbalances, even though the situation looks quite well balanced by usual standards   But there’s heavy consumer credit, the creeping up on us of capacity limitations, and diverse  seemingly unimportant shortages that I think we underestimate  And more than anything, there are  the wage settlements that seem to be pending and the inflation  I think that is the key factor--that  the inflation accelerates--and I would guess if there's no recession 8-1/2 is the least we can look to   But if the pressures are very strong there, then the chances of an end to the expansion become  much greater  If we can hold it a little better, then I think the other two-thirds of the probabilities  are that we'll get something like the staff's projection 3 to 3-1/2 on growth, unemployment at about  6, and inflation I would say even in the most favorable case at 8 percent       Well, I'm concerned about a 5 to 9 percent M1 range; that allows for a  very substantial rise in September, given what we so far know about August  I think it would allow  for up to 12 percent in September and I wouldn't like to give such a signal  So my preference on  the M1 range would be 4 to 8  I would move to 8 percent definitely on the funds rate and make the  range 7-3/4 to 8-1/4  I realize this is somewhat skewed with respect to the aggregates I am  proposing, particularly if I add to this that I'd like to see an aggregates directive so that movement  could come immediately  I do think, though, that the situation is very [touchy] on the upside and  on the downside so we ought to set ourselves yet narrow limits on the funds rate  I think perhaps  we ought to become reconciled with having to have a telephone conversation in the middle of the  period more frequently than we have had in the past  I think that would be a way of playing it safe  It would be worth the inconvenience and difficulties associated with that  So that would be my M1  [and funds rate ranges]  Let's see, I haven't given you M2  On M2, 6 to 10 would seem right to me,  and that still would allow for a pretty sizable rise in September given what has happened so far in  August        Well, Mr Chairman I think you've made it clear that we have a crisis on  our hands--a crisis of confidence  For some currencies yesterday, it was a panic  I think it’s at a  point where the functioning of the monetary system is in some doubt  That is, it could lead to  severe capital controls and it could lead to trade controls--all things that would eventually hit back  upon the United States  So whatever is done is really in the interest of the United States primarily,  and not just for the sake of international cooperation or helping other countries  That's all I have to  say       And, Mr Chairman, the interest rate       So that we don't just pay a higher rate       This [is] not in line with the rules of floating  We'd clearly be acting to  change rates; I would be very skeptical of such a move       I've been a proponent of a yen intervention  I've changed my mind,  given the vicissitudes faced by the dollar, but in my view what we should do here is to support the  dollar rather than to hold down the yen  The Japanese can do all of that themselves  They can do  $800 million in a day and I don't think they need any additional resources  What is needed here is  evidence that we are not practicing benign--or malign or whatever--neglect  There is a gap, an  implausibility, in our method of operations; we do everything in D-mark and occasionally in Swiss  francs and somehow there never seems to be disorder in the yen market  So even though the  Japanese through the New York Bank can take care of disorder in the US yen market, we are seen  to be somewhat implausible here  We should remove that and we should remove it in a credible  way      I think the only way to get any response from the Japanese in mending their policies is to  keep their feet in the fire with a high rate and I would regret it if the yen were to come down from  its present level  Their situation, I think, is not nearly as desperate as sometimes it's made out to be  While exporters suffer possible [drops] of profit margins, even losses, this is a very diversified  economy  They're making up on cheaper raw materials, which they use [in products for] domestic  sale, what they lose on sales to the rest of the world      So I would do whatever is the minimum to give credibility to our participating  But I’d let  the risk and burden of it fall on them to the extent that's possible through loss-sharing and the  proportionality of operations  I think we should avoid being sucked into their very large  operations; suddenly we'd find if we promised to do a quarter of what they do, they’d do $800  million in one day  I would also avoid violating, obviously, what are still the rules of floating, or at  least precepts, namely, we shouldn't push a rising currency upwards  That is one thing we're in  danger of doing here  And we should not, of course, aim at a particular rate  We need to explain  this to Congress, I think  We need to explain it to the business community  We have to bear in  mind that over time if inflation rates continue anything like now, the yen will rise against the dollar,  whatever it does in the short run  And we shouldn't do something that goes against this     8/15/78             42  fundamental  And finally, the Treasury, I think, needs to be in and we need to have a package and  not just this one operation  I think it would be very unfortunate if we didn't get a package       It throws the risk back on them       Is it possible to so look toward future operations as to make it plausible   that the Treasury and the Fed will get out of debt at about the same time--that we are more or less  in step in terms of the 50-50 on new drawings and 60-40 on when we purchase D-marks?       That's 7 to 3 and we're repaying 6 to 4; it’s closer than it was before  It   would be hard to calibrate it so we'd both be out of debt at the same time  It's not unreasonable to  say that that's a possibility       Mr Chairman, I continue to think that we ought to have a program of   gradually but steadily buying [foreign] exchange as we go  We're working on how to devise this so  it doesn't lead to adverse consequences but I'd like to urge the Desk again, whenever there is a  reasonable chance to pick up some exchange in the market--if the market is rising and it wouldn't  seem to the market that we were putting a lid on the advance--to take advantage of the  opportunities       I think, Paul, this is reasonable  There's a relationship of the interest rate   and the expected change in the exchange rate, which in equilibrium offset each other  That is, the  German interest rate is 3 percentage points lower than ours, there's an expectation in the market  that the D-mark will appreciate by 3 percent over a year, and so if we pay the German rate, we can  afford to take the full loss  We take 50-50 on any loss of the exchange rate; we ought to have a  50-50 rate on the interest rate also  That's what I've been criticizing at times--that we were paying  the US high interest rate and yet we're getting the 50-50  The full risk should have been on the  Bundesbank if we paid the full US interest rate  So I think backing away from the 50-50 is  perfectly feasible  It gives me a little pause to hear that foreign central banks are unhappy with it   If they're unhappy with it, it makes you suspect that maybe there's something good in it for us     The concern of the Treasury I think is genuine; it has to do with making a change in the   terms of their swap at a time when the dollar is weak and they are subject to criticism  I think we  have to head this [way], but next year when the dollar is strong we could have another go at this      May I say one more thing, Mr Chairman, at the risk of running [too long on] this  The EC   government wants to homogenize all our swaps  That means bringing up things like the 50-50 and  other minor differences, although we homogenized them pretty much last year  Lester said he  would try to talk them out of it and seemed confident that changes proposed by the EC government  may therefore not come up  Thank you       Well, I think the odds favor continued expansion, though one can not   discount the possibility of a downturn  I think what we have going in our favor is the absence of  major imbalances of the usual cyclical kind  We have some new ones  We have the very high rate  of inflation, and I think that is our main threat to a stable expansion now  We have a large budget  deficit that more than offsets the net negative exports  We have the weak dollar  These are the  principal imbalances plus the inflation  The staff's estimate of inflation looks low to me  Maybe  for the next quarter, the third quarter, we can count on something better than we previously  thought, but I think for next year the chances of getting high wage settlements and high wage  increases are very serious       For both domestic and international reasons, I think it would be desirable   to get even more of a downward sloping yield curve  The Treasury bill rate is still well below other  short-term rates  The coupon area could come down a little  I'm wondering whether the Desk is  doing all it can to move rates in that direction  I noticed you have been buying coupons, but you  also have been buying some Treasury bills directly from foreign accounts  I would hope we could  get the intermediate- and long-term area to continue going down and in the short-term area a  straightening out of the yield curve       Well, I go with Phil Jackson in looking at the M1+ numbers but I draw   somewhat different conclusions from them  I think this is a very interesting study  It shows that  we once more underestimated the rate of money growth both because of the benchmark adjustment  and because of the cash items bias  Now I have two or three more items that cause us to  underestimate M1 growth the Euromarkets--and we continue to debate that--corporate RPs, and  NOW accounts  When I throw all of these together I get the impression, very impressionistically,  that we may have underestimated the rate of growth of M1 by 2 to 3 percentage points  When you  factor in a normal growth trend of M1 velocity of 2, we've got an effective rate of growth of M1 of  something like 4 to 5 percentage points more than what we think we have  In other words, with our  7 to 8 percent real increase in M1 as recorded we quite amply finance the 11 percent rise in GNP       9/19/78            26  [given] rising interest rates and their effect on velocity  Then we have the fact, as Steve Axilrod  pointed out, that interest rates don't bite as much as they used to; they don't bite so hard on housing   We have the fact that long-term rates fortunately are coming down, which is where I think it  counts for long-term investment  But the funds rate seems to be getting a little more detached from  other interest rates, leading the pack less tightly than it used to  So in short, I would like to see us  move quite firmly M1, 4 to 8; M2, 5-1/2 to 9-1/2; and a funds rate range of 8-1/2 to 9-1/4 but go to  8-3/4 for the time being and hold it there And I guess that compels me to make it a money market  conditions directive       If the dollar has been the vehicle for going long on marks and Swiss  francs, would that suggest that there's some unwinding of positions ahead--to buy back those  dollars or to repay them?       Well, logically there's something to be said for the proposed change   Certainly the way things are now, where we share 50-50 in losses but pay the high interest rate, is  altogether bad for us  At a minimum [if] we share 50-50 in losses, the interest rates should also be  merged or split  As for giving up the 50-50 loss sharing, one anticipates over time that intervention  properly done, when it's merely to counter disorder, should yield a profit  That has been true in the  past  It doesn't seem to be working out quite that way so far, so we've been fortunate to have had  the loss sharing this time around  But I think for the long run, a simple analysis suggests that we'd  be better off not sharing losses and that we'd be better off getting the benefit of the lower interest  rate on borrowed currency  You might remember, of course, that that relationship of interest rates  is a logical one--that the strong currency has the low interest rate, the weaker one the high rate  It  doesn't always hold       I think Chuck has a good point  After all, the dollar is a world currency   We're supporting something which is of great interest to others  When Paraguay supports the  guarani, that's of no interest to anybody except Paraguay       For the short run and for one month, I think the picture is better  Housing  is well maintained and business investment looks stronger, so the expansion has gained another few  months of probable life  No expansion is immortal  If the peak is next year, [this expansion] will  be four years old and that will be well above the average  And I think one could say that it had  been a successful performance, not a great failure [if] something happens that has happened  cyclically for two hundred years with considerable regularity  We can, I think, push this  [expansion] into the future by restraining inflation; that is the thing that is likely to kill it  I see  inflation going further than the staff's forecast  I see, unless the President's program is surprisingly  successful, very high wage settlements and I see anticipatory price increases  And I think for a  good part of 1979 we'll find ourselves with double-digit inflation  That means then declining GNP,  perhaps a positive downturn  The position of the dollar contributes to this inflationary scenario and  to the risk of recession  I think the main thing we can do is to restrain inflation now       M1, I think, should be downgraded       Well, I would go with the money market directive  I would keep M1 but  put a low weight on it--say, 1/4--and put 3/4 weight on M2, much as I am skeptical of M2 as a  general proposition  But in this situation, I don't see any other alternative  I would like to have  M1+ as an additional guide  For the amounts, which are very speculative in this case, I'd go with  alternative 2  On the funds rate I see the attraction of waiting and seeing what we've [achieved]  when we've raised rates  [But] the aggregates aren't going to wait and see and they've been running  high  If they weren't, I'd be happy to slow down on the funds rate  But as it is, I would go for the  8-3/4 to 9-1/2 percent range, go to 9, and stay asymmetrical at 9       We'll probably be asked about it at the next--       Two points--one on Frank Morris’s [comment] about strong demands for  money ahead  Of course, this may cut both ways  If we accommodate them and hold the funds  rate, presumably that would call for a revision to the forecast in an upward direction  Otherwise, if  we don't accommodate, then it would be a downward revision  [Unintelligible] now compared to--       I am puzzled, Jim, by the dichotomy between the short-term and long- term outlook  The short outlook is quite good; everything, with some exceptions only, is strong   Longer, we've got weak indications  Isn't there a chance that the experience of good current  performance is going to bring [about] quite a change in the long-run evaluation?  Likewise, isn't the  strong present picture conducive to increasing inflationary expectations [or] behavior even though  over the hill or halfway down the valley one sees a better performance?       The range of possibilities, I think, is widening  I think a growth  recession is entirely possible  There is a long history of growth recessions and they don't have to  turn into full recessions, although it sometimes happens  And the reason, of course, why  expansions don't go on forever is not that they die of old age but that the probability of  disequilibrium or maladjustments arising increases as time goes on  I think our principle  maladjustment now is the inflation which threatens to bring this [expansion] to an end      But I'm very much impressed by the strength of the economy in the short run  The dire  things that have been talked about for some time now aren't happening  Housing hasn't collapsed  and investment spending has been quite strong  So these things may turn the economy around--in  fact, may give inflation an additional [unintelligible]--and there is a wide range between the  immediate recession scenario that one cannot absolutely deny and the possibility on the upside that  we may face some further pressures  So, my most likely numbers would be real growth 3 percent,  unemployment 6-1/4, and inflation 8 percent       I am particularly concerned that we shouldn't convey a sense of easing  inadvertently at a time when that has a balance of payments and dollar implication  So I would  begin by starting the funds rate at 9-3/4, but be asymmetrical at 9-3/4  I’d leave it at that point, but     11/21/78              25  if the aggregates come in badly, go up to 10-1/4  For the aggregates I would say M1 with a cap of  5, M2, 6 to 9, and M1+, 1 to 5       Well, I think “stabilizing” is not helpful  I think “supporting” or  “strengthening” or using the announcement [wording]--       It’s reported that support for the dollar in Europe may flag because of the  oil price increase and the desire to see that reduced in terms of their local currencies  In fact, the  drop that you note in the dollar has already undone something like 1/3 of the oil price increase, as  far as the countries with strong currencies are concerned  Have you heard anything on that?        Because our imports are small; the oil proportionate to GNP--       You want me to [comment now]?       Well, it seems to me that the economy is now in a state of demand-pull  inflation--aggregates or no  We are beginning to push against the capacity limits  The Redbook  reports particular areas are filled with considerable pressure, although the general tone of the  Redbook was not all that strong  We are getting inflationary rate pressures, I think, in part as a  result of monetary developments that occurred quite a while back  We can’t expect the present  aggregates to have much influence, and I doubt that the present aggregates tell us much about the  future course of the economy because there are so many reasons why they might be weak and  might not be reflecting the economy      I think loan demand at banks at the present time is a better indicator; the banks are selling  off securities  Individuals and businesses are buying the securities because they want to get rid of  their cash balances, and what remains is strong expansion through bank credit  Now, one has to  ask oneself, as Jim Kichline did, how does the present bulge carry forward into the future?  The  consumer seems to be borrowing from the future and there one cannot foresee much strength  But  strong consumer buying can trigger temporarily inventory accumulation; and likewise pressure on  capacity can induce additional investment  I don’t think anybody would be investing now in order  to get capacity for the next few quarters  But he would be looking beyond possibly a small dip in  the economy and would realize that at last the capacity limits have been reached and he has to do  something to enlarge his plant      All that suggests to me that there is some underlying strength here that we don’t observe   Furthermore, I think we have been continually wrong in our evaluation of the inflationary risk  As  I look at the forecast that we have made over time on inflation for this present time--namely,  October or November of ’78--we started out fifteen months ago with an estimate of 61 percent and  we gradually upped it and it’s coming to over 8 percent  On unemployment we have done the  reverse  We thought unemployment would be 66 percent fifteen months or a year ago and we’ve  gradually come to see it at 58       Real growth has been slower than expected also       Yes  That reflects the poor productivity performance [which] is another  inflation factor  So I think not only have we done much better on unemployment than we expected  and much worse on inflation than we expected, but we also seem to have a built-in bias toward a  low inflation forecast, whatever the cause of that  When I see we are going to get down to 73  percent in the second half of next year, I wonder, like Paul does, if we shouldn’t add a point or two  and allow for a worse outcome       Well, all this pushes me in a direction of greater tightness  I think tightness is really a  relative term here  With inflation expectations rising, nominal interest rates don’t mean what they  seem to; and to maintain real interest rates where they were, nominal interest rates have to go up  I  would agree with Phil Coldwell that we should at this time look at interest rates and not look at the  aggregates because they are so disturbed  So that points to a money market directive  I also agree  with what Steve Axilrod said in the way of widening the funds rate range  In my case, I would  want to widen it in an upward direction       I think we have to focus more on the funds rate than on the aggregates  I  think it’s a delusion that we are steering the aggregates by means of the funds rate  The funds rate  now has a special function, namely to regulate the dollar situation  So I don’t think we should have  any decline in the funds rate  I think we should consult if the aggregates point downwards, as has  been suggested  That’s a wise precaution  I would give the funds rate a wide range in terms of the  aggregates M1, 0 to 6, and M2, 4-1/2 to 8-1/2  On the funds rate itself, I’d say 10 to 10-1/2 and go  to 10-1/4        Well, either way is possible  I think naming a number like $8 billion tips  off the market in an undesirable way  However, suspending the limit entirely, even though we  certainly would maintain very close consultation, I think is not ideal in principle  So I’d look for an  alternative way  We could suspend the [limits on] intermeeting changes, which now are $100  million on the overall open position in any one day and $300 million for the intermeeting period   We could suspend that in particular for the intermeeting period, bearing in mind that every dollar  number here is multiplied by two because we’re now going 50-50 with the Treasury  And we  would not, as I understand it--subject to being better informed--have to publish any of what we do  in this area because it comes under the procedural instructions, which we don’t publish, [whereas]  any [change] in the authorization does have to be made public  Furthermore, even if it were to be  published, the intermeeting limit wouldn’t tip off the market; it wouldn’t tell the market [anything  about] the accumulated magnitude of past or future operations         You’d have to give [the Desk] room on the aggregates        The aggregate limit would disappear under this proposal  You would not  be without some control          I hope this doesn’t sound too esoteric  We are making a very  fundamental decision here  We’re getting to be like every other country that has foreign exchange  reserves  In the past, we only had gold and SDR  Here we have foreign exchange reserves and we  are now making a decision on how to finance these reserves  For all countries this is a very  important decision  It tends to affect their money supply--their domestic monetary management   So we should be well aware of what it is we are doing  The reserves belong to the Treasury  This  is one very important decision, which I guess is set by law in our country, although not necessarily   The Treasury owns the gold and the SDR, but we could own the exchange reserves; it makes a  great deal of difference in a country who does [own them] because the balance of power between  the central bank and Treasury is influenced thereby  We seem to be in the present framework the  financier of the balance  We supply the money, we face the money market consequences, which  seem easy so long as all we have to do is offset a few billion by open market sales that we give to  the Treasury, and we compensate that by selling our own securities to the market  But some day it  could be different  It could be large relative to our portfolio  So I think we ought to first think  about what it is we are doing on a structural basis        Second, until we’ve arrived at a better understanding, I would argue for a small increase in  the warehousing limit  It gives us time to think; it gives us time to talk to the Treasury again about  this  If there should ever be a problem, the limit would tend to give us a chance to review the  situation        Well, at some point we might want to raise the point of who is to own  these reserves  This is very important       Excuse me  There is one decision, isn’t there--whether it is to be year- over-year?        Jim, say for instance that we had a range of 4 to 6-1/2  Would you then  indicate how 4 and 6-1/2 would be implemented [relative to] the President’s program?        So if you found that the President’s program fell within that range, that  would be the conclusion to be drawn          If we found that it fell outside, we’d tell the truth  But are we sufficiently  sure to be able to assert that the President’s program is unachievable by our policies?  I doubt very  much--        Then there are real possibilities  Suppose he proposes a 20 percent  nominal increase  Wouldn’t we then say we don’t want to pursue that objective?        Well, I think very much we should convey the degree of uncertainty  because our model results are just one point in a wide spectrum         It’s like putting a constant in an equation; it doesn’t make any difference     12/19/78          66          I’d like to register some sympathy for reserves, not for the base   Particularly if we should have the Merrill decision going against us, I think we’d have to take a  serious look at this       As an operator       Everything that can be said is bound to have  been said I’m impressed by the fact that in the two quarters before  what must be the best advertised and predicted recession, if it comes,  the economy has been growing well above potential--at 6 percent and 4  percent rates--and we have had a steady pattern of underpredicting  inflation The rate of inflation is always worse than we think it is  We have, as we have learned from the Economic Report, far less room on  the up side in terms of where the potential limits are than we  thought The Council cut that from 5 or 5-1/2 percent, I think to  2-1/2 percent The outlook may well be as the staff describes, but I  have the impression that outside forecasters are postponing the timing  of the recession, pushing it ahead As for the signals that  frequently are implicit in the soft money supply or weak aggregates  that Frank Morris referred to, while I think our staff reads those  too, those signals seem to me to have been somewhat disavowed by the  course of events Meanwhile the dollar is still very vulnerable even  though it has improved And on the financial side we are told by many  observers that monetary policy really isn’t biting I personally  think that real interest rates are barely positive and they’re  negative after taxes Nonprice terms of lending are gradually being  tightened, but that’s the main biting element, though some restraint     2/6/79 -24-    may be coming from the weak liquidity position of corporations  are the elements of restraint that I see   Those   Well, in the light of this, I think we do have considerable  risks on the up side more on inflation than on GNP I'd like to fix  the aggregates accordingly, and I share the numerology that Mark  Willes engages in I see three factors of shift, as it were One is  the A T S  shift of 3-1/4 percent two seems to be the demand curve  shift The third, which of course others have recognized too, is the  increase in velocity that comes with rising interest rates so these  three things really have to be factored in When you are concerned  about where this added velocity is coming from, bear in mind all the  quasi-monies that are being increasingly used now--the Euro markets,  RPs, and money market funds We overlook what are sources either of  money or of increases in velocity which make that 2 percent shift not  at all that ambitious, it seems to me So my numbers would be 1/2 to  3-l/2 percent on M1--this is alternative C, which I have modified just  a little--4 to 7 percent on M2 and 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent on M3    With the M1 range, I think we can get to 10 or  10-1/2 percent growth here, which is equal to nominal GNP growth and  therefore would require no rise in interest rates I'm talking about  10 percent, not the midpoints    No, 4 to 6-1/2    We were essentially ratcheting it up by first  going to the upper side of it and then by chosing a range that would  make the upper side fall in the middle    Is it appropriate to ask, Mr Chairman, whether  this dissent would cause you any serious inconvenience in the hearing?    Thank you very much    Well, if Steve is right, we should have a month  of very large increases [in monetary growth] And it seems to me that  that might very well trigger either a telephone conversation or--    There is a strong reason for not letting the  rate drop if we think the dollar is vulnerable So I think we ought  to limit that possibility--not cut it off absolutely, but not allow it  without further discussion We can make that decision, but it  shouldn’t come about through the automatic workings of our  instructions    I‘d like something that, if the aggregates  strengthen, would quickly raise the rate into the 10 to 10-3/4 percent  range and wouldn’t trigger [action] on the down side So my  preference, if it has to be done in an asymmetrical form, would be a  money market directive on the down side--and I’d want a very low  limit--and aggregates on the up side That would suit me    The aggregate ranges are too high for me,  particularly the midpoints    It [sounds] a slightly ominous note because it  suggests that if the aggregates behave for another period of time as  they have behaved so far, then we'll make a decision to ignore them    That's what one can read into that    But we do need to look at this in depth at some  point because we are getting to the point where we are operating in  foreign currencies    I would propose [William Miller as Chairman and  Paul Volcker as Vice Chairman]    Would you like to approve the slate as  proposed? Any objections?    Scott, you mentioned the reaction that if the  dollar goes down, the Fed steps in and if the dollar goes up, the  Bundesbank steps in Do you think the market views the rate as pegged  in some sense? Are expectations built on that?    Do you think they perceive this as a conflict  among the national policies?    Thank you    I think we’re in imminent danger of building  into the economy a higher rate of inflation and of putting ourselves  into a position, with or without a subsequent recession, of having to  work that off and starting from a higher level with less chance [of  success] than we had the last time around It’s not true that we  can’t work off inflation; we did it after the experience of ’74 and  ’15, But we’ve done very poorly of late and our surprises have always  been that we’ve found more boominess in the economy and more inflation  than we expected up through the last forecast which shaded the     3 / 2 0 / 1 9  - 2 3 -    boominess a little So, I see our main risk on the side of inflation  And I fear that we’re in some danger of validating the increase in the  price of oil and accepting that as inevitable I think we ought not  to do that; I’d accommodate this kind of outside shock only partly  It seems clear that the economy is much closer to capacity than we had  thought That is, I think, accountable for a good part of the  pressures we’re getting Whether or not a recession is in the works  is probably something that is beyond the power of monetary policy now  to remedy I think we have more chances of doing something about  inflation than doing something about a recession If there is a  recession, it is likely to be a moderate and short one I have that  reaction because of the fact that it’s so widely advertised and, in  the face of that, business behavior has been to step up plant and  equipment expenditures It seems to me they’re looking beyond the  valley; they can’t possibly be planning to put much [capacity] in  place before some kind of a slowdown occurs Meanwhile, the inflation  pressure is threatening the President’s wage and price program and if  that collapses, we‘ve lost one further instrument It threatens the  dollar and if something happens to [weaken] the dollar, we will have  more inflation All this suggests to me that the dangers are more on  the side of inflation than on the side of the real sector I don’t  want to minimize those real sector risks; I think they are real I  might add that people who are concerned about excessive boominess and  excessive inflation are not just a small minority I’m surprised how  much support one sees around the country, even in the Congress and  even among economists whom we have listened to and not usually found  on the restrictive side--and even, if I may say so ,  amony some people  in the Administration So if we are talking about beds, there are  some prospects for unusual bedfellows here   A s  for the aggregates, I have much sympathy for Steve‘s  analysis I think it is reasonably persuasive except perhaps the  magnitude  something like a proxy for the aggregates, realizing that it’s not a  very good measure of total credit S o  that brings me to what I should  say about policy I think if we fail to do something that recognizes  the threat of greater inflation, we will really add to that inflation  A demonstration [of our anti-inflationary resolve] is needed At a  minimum, I would not relax the funds rate for that reason I’m very  reluctant to push it up because I can see that six months from now we  might regret having done that if the economy has weakened I think  some demonstration--an action on reserve requirements or the discount  rate--might be more [appropriate], within a broader program than this  Committee would ordinarily deal with On the funds rate, I would like  to hear the rest of the discussion   I would look at bank credit at the present time as    Well, I question the meaning of the aggregates  I think we have to add something to them, both for ATS and for shift  in the demand curve, so I believe they are much higher than they look  on paper I would, therefore, take the C alternative, 3-1/2 to 8-1/2  percent for M1 and 3 to I percent for M2 And somewhere in the  directive I would make reference to the view that the aggregates are  being interfered with by technological developments due to ATS and  other factors, which I think should also be reflected in our one-year  targets There‘s no sense running after those if we have good reason  to believe that something has happened to the demand for money that  makes a given amount of money go further than we thought it would On  the funds rate, I would like to push it up just a little to 10-1/4  percent and go to a range of 10 to 10-1/2 percent But I do think the  inflationary environment calls for some other kind of action, so I  would say that the Board should move on reserve requirements or the  discount rate or some combination of these in a moderate way AS far  as the nature of the directive is concerned, I’d like to have a money  market directive with the range of 10 to 10-1/2 percent and, as I  said, move to the midpoint of 10-1/4 percent with reasonable  promptness    No, I can live with the aggregates, but I’d  like to see the funds rate a little higher    Alan, do you have the feeling that the Germans  would want us to use Treasury funds raised in their market to repay  swaps rather than go to a second renewal?    Yes, I wouldn't either I think the Treasury  is right    Well, we use up the easily disposable money  where nobody can say "no" when we want to use it and we put ourselves  in their hands And they can restrain us--    Particularly in light of the     3 / 2 0 / 7 9  - 3 6 -     If I may add to this--    Mr Chairman, there is pretty close contact  [between the Manager and the Subcommittee] I would certainly expect,  if operations of that order of magnitude or anything remotely  resembling that were in prospect, that prior conversations would have  taken place So--    Because the Subcommittee is sometimes hard to  get together    We can do that I think that reduces the  flexibility somewhat The Chairman, too, may not be easily accessible  so I don't see a great deal of risk here    I guess that's the Vice Chairman    Alan, in terms of the possible magnitudes of  these movements, you remember what happened to the United Kingdom a  couple of years ago There was a tremendous inflow into sterling and  they held the rate [for a time]; eventually, after taking in $10 or  $15 billion in reserves, they had to let the rate go Do you see any  possible parallel for the United States?    With the new wider distribution of Treasury  bills, do you feel that the dangers of inadequate collateral for RPs  are substantially reduced?    I wanted to ask Steve what his reasons were for  placing much confidence on the existing relationship  there is at least a possibility that that relationship has changed  It has changed, I think, for two years running and has led us to an  overprediction of $30 billion in that time, if I remember People are  now looking at what they consider to be inflation of 10 to 12 percent  and that is a tremendous incentive to hold down not only Ml balances  but also lower-yielding savings and time deposit balances I really  think that under these conditions we have to assume that there is a  change in the relationship and, therefore, I don’t see much basis for  predicting a rebound I think this shift can go on at a substantial  rate f o r  a long time If I were to look at any monetary aggregate  now, it would be more nearly bank credit plus commercial paper plus  finance company lending In any event I am aware that the monetarists  are divided now, with some taking the point of view that the  aggregates are moving too slowly and others arguing that the  relationship has changed I‘m trying to ask Steve What is the  reason for thinking we’ll get back on track with the relationship?   As Chuck said,     4/11/19 -1l-    I agree    I think we are in a very difficult situation  The real sector points down Inflation points up And the question  is whether we can do anything about the downturn of the real sector  without aggravating the inflation I think the answer is no It is  very probable that a slowdown is ahead after four years of cyclical  expansion It would be really astonishing if we didn‘t get a cyclical  peak after such a long expansion The circumstances we observe are  not those we’ve seen at other peaks Unemployment is still relatively  high Capacity utilization isn‘t all that high But the economy has  changed Six percent [unemployment] is now what 4 or 4-1/2 percent  used to be, and 84 or 85 percent capacity utilization is probably what  87 or 88 used to be after all the obsolescence in the capital stock  that changing price relationships must have caused S o  I think we  have all the makings of a cyclical peak; we don’t know whether we will  descend into a recession or just a slowdown I see no similarity,  however, to 1974 There’s no comparable buildup and there’s no  financial crunch Meanwhile, inflation and inflation expectations are  clearly mounting I think something like 1/2 percent per month or  every two months is being built into expectations If I believe Art  Okun, every 1 percentage point in the inflation rate costs $200  billion to remove by orthodox means, and I don‘t know of any other     4/17/79 -17-   good means I think that's greatly exaggerated, but I'd like to alert  you to the very high cost, in terms of an inflation correction, we're  incurring if all we're doing now is postponing that slightly It is  in any event probably inevitable Actually, I think the choice we  have is between a mild turndown now, in the second half of 1979, or a  more severe one later after having suffered some more inflation I  don't think the choices are an obvious or foregone conclusion   As far as the aggregates are concerned, I don't need the  aggregates at this time to tell me that the economy may be heading for  a slowdown I think the aggregates have become very weak because of  what seems to be a shift in demand I see that as plausible because  the equations by which we're guided don't really encompass  expectations of inflation of the kind that we now see, where  expectations have moved from the 8 to 10 percent range to the 10 to 12  percent range I think Paul is right that real interest rates have  declined In fact, they're probably no longer positive And in a  situation like the present, the only halfway plausible guide is to aim  at positive real interest rates I'm not even talking about after  taxes because after tax real interest rates are very demonstrably  negative except for nontaxable holders So looking at this  combination of a possibility of a downturn, or even of recession, and  almost certainty continued inflation at an accelerating rate if we  don't act, I come out for some tightening of monetary policy    I share your views, Mr Chairman, about what  monetary policy can do with respect to the real sector; I don't think  we can do anything that will affect it very much very soon But  monetary policy certainly can affect expectations and prices; prices  can be changed overnight because of inflation expectations and I think  that's what is happening now So I think we can do something on  inflation and we should I'd go largely with alternative C For M1  I'd have a range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent as in "C" I see no point     4/17/79 -27-   in trying to get back on track in six months Chuck’s thought that we  should change the track and notify Congress might be one thing we can  do to favorably influence expectations, because for M1 to grow over  six months at that‘rate of speed we’d have to have--adding 2-1/2  percentage points for ATS--it growing at 9 percent for six months I  think that would be very inflationary and very alarming to the public  Continuing with the specifications, for M2 I’d say 4 to 8 percent I  would say 10-1/4 to 10-3/4 percent [for the funds range], go to the  midpoint of 10-1/2 percent and not go below that without a telephone  call If the aggregates are very weak, then we should reexamine And  I’d go with a money market conditions directive    I have a hard time because I add 2-1/2  percentage points to each of these and it gets very high for M1  wouldn’t worry me so much   M2    No    Well, I believe we should think very carefully  about what we're doing here; $2 billion is not a large amount and can  be a perfectly good means of enhancing our operations It could be  the first step into a totally different world If we ever got to a  very bullish dollar situation, which is not inconceivable, and we  wanted to restrain the dollar from going up very sharply--not peg it--  [because] we would lose our trade competitiveness, we might find  ourselves authorizing $5 billion a week And after a few weeks of  that we might throw in the sponge, as the British did If that were  to happen, I don't think we should do that We still have to think  about what the reactions of other central banks will be; we don't want  to promote countries into reserve currency status if they don't want  that We don't want to get them in the frame of mind where they throw  all the burden of intervention on us We've already attracted to  ourselves more of the burden of intervention The New York market has  increased in scope; I would guess it has become a better market  because there is a strong supplier of D-mark in it and we will be  attracting an increasing burden I'd like to be sure that what we do  here remains small unless we carefully consider what we should do in  the other direction If we do go in the other direction, I hope we  could find some way of using SDRs and not individual foreign  currencies There are technical difficulties but we might overcome  those Meanwhile I'd convey to foreign central banks as we accumulate  [these balances]--provided they agree--that we by no means intend to  make a total change in our predominant use of the swaps We don't  intend first to use the reserves and then the swap lines; and we don't  want to expose ourselves to their saying that when we've drawn on the  swap we pay that off out of reserves that we've accumulated rather  than give us the money outright as we have done sometimes [in the  past] These are some of the market strategy considerations that I  think will come to [unintelligible] and we ought to lay [the ground  rules] out with foreign central banks very cautiously    These are our swap partners    Let me say something about that It may not  fit the market situation; it may make no sense, for instance, to  accumulate yen    We would probably, predominantly That is the  big intervention currency I see your point of limiting risk but I  think it would be better to limit risk by limiting the overall amount  and then leave it to the Manager [to decide] what is useful in these  relatively small amounts I'd prefer that rather than have the Desk  get to the limit of marks and say now we can make the market orderly  by working in yen even though it's really the D-mark market that isn't  orderly    May I make just one comment? There is no  government or central bank in the world that doesn't have this power  We are the only one; we have gold    Yes    Well, I would not give a great deal of weight to these aggregates;  they are only marginally above our ranges On the other hand, as I look at the economy I see  inflation expectations clearly worsening in the face of some straws on the down side in the real  sector I’m impressed by the evidence on the inflation expectations in the rise in long rates and the  declines simultaneously in short rates, which both are in the wrong direction I’ve been in favor of  a higher funds rate previously and I would think that the minimum we ought to do now is to go to  10-1/4 percent But my preference would be for [going] somewhat higher [on the funds rate] and if  that could be done later, I would regard that as right    Even with conditions changed    Seems fine to me but we should look again as the data evolve    Gretchen, when you operate as agent for the  Bank of Japan, can you tell anything from the way the orders are given  and what rate indications are given about how forceful they want to be  in defending the yen?    Peter, you mentioned that prior to the Treasury  financing there was a change in the funds rate [objective] and you  moved expeditiously so that the market would be apprized of that How  important do you regard it generally, other than in circumstances  associated with a Treasury financing, that the market be apprized of  exactly what the objective is?    But what is really impressive is the reduction  over the years in the fraction [of disposable income] people have to  spend on food and gasoline Since the ' 6 0 s  standards of living have  risen enormously in that respect and what's happening now is just a  small catch-up    Jim, am I right in thinking that among the  various price indexes--the deflator, the business fixed weight  deflator, and the CPI--there has been an unusually wide discrepancy in  the recent months? I see the CPI increase for the first quarter of  this year was 13 percent The other indexes are in the 10 to 11  percent range    It does make a difference whether the rate of  inflation was 10 percent or 13 percent over the last three months,  even if we give it the usual Federal Reserve discount    No, it was [measured] end-of-quarter to end-of  quarter    That accounts for some of it, probably    I share Phil Coldwell's feeling I think we're  in some danger of excessive preoccupation with the business cycle rt  matters much more whether we come down from I percent to 4 percent  growth than whether we go from 4  to -1 or -2 percent So in that  sense an important move is already behind us I think inflationary  expectations have increased substantially in the last quarter The  leading models have raised their projections of inflation for the next  two years by about 1 percentage point And as we know, we've always  been below on our projections I think we're now building inflation  into the economy to a degree that we've never had it; consumer  behavior shows that We also have evidence that inflation in the  American economy is much less variable than it is in other countries  and is, therefore, much harder to bring down what we see in our own  forecast is that at best we have to look forward to a period of a very  slow deceleration of inflation I think that will be regarded as  unsatisfactory And I expect that this situation is going to cause us  to adopt wage and price controls sometime this year or next year  people are sufficiently excited about the inflation and sufficiently  disenchanted with the actions in the fiscal and monetary fields If  we don't succeed in bringing inflation down, then the predictable  pattern is that after a mild dip we'll go into a renewed expansion  starting from an inflation base of 8 to 10 percent, whereas last time  we started at 5 percent And that will land us in an area where not  even Italy is today We are now the country with the most inflation  among the major countries except Italy, I believe   As far as monetary policy is concerned, I think we still  believe that somehow there's a free lunch--that we can accomplish our  objective of reducing inflation at no cost--and I believe that's no  longer true We will have some costs, either in terms of much more  inflation or in terms of reduced economic activity and a less than  soft landing I agree with Steve that real interest rates are  falling; and that I think is the basic stance of monetary policy We  are [now] accommodating an external shock from food and oil It's no  longer the view of the economics profession that external shocks  should always be accommodated, but our policy is doing that It's not  surprising, therefore, that in the ranking of inflation fighters we  find ourselves near the bottom of the scale, as the Redbook among  other things shows   As is obvious from my remarks, I would urge a tightening,  even though it is late in the game I think the impact on the real  sector would be very slight The real sector is going its own way  with little benefit from monetary policy [A tightening] will have  some favorable effect on expectations I think we have to look at  interest rates at this time The aggregates have become so unstable;  for six months there has been no growth [in M11 and then we get 17  percent in one month Why should we allow our funds rate decisions to  be triggered by that kind of mechanism? So I would agree with Steve  to have a wider range--1 think that is fine--and a money market  target, with a rise immediately in the rate Thank you, Mr Chairman    Well, the news isn't very conducive to  [focusing on1 what I think is important The news that we hear is all  about the business cycle and very little about inflation I think  monetary policy at this time doesn't do very much to the real sector  it doesn't shape expectations So I would go for a mild tightening  I agree with Steve on a widening of the ranges but I'd widen them at  the lower side so as not to trigger a reduction [in the funds rate] if  the very unreliable aggregates should come out [on the low side] On  M1 I'd say -1 to 4 percent and on M2 2 to I percent I'd move the  federal funds rate up to 10-1/2 percent within a range of 10-1/4 to  10-3/4 percent and adopt a money market directive    I thought Bob Mayo came out with 0 to 6  percent    NO    I could compromise on a small increase in the    But these [aggregates] are very unreliable now  I don't know why we should expose ourselves to that    Alan, could you recapitulate quickly how much  the Treasury accumulated over what period of time so that one can get  an idea of how fast this accumulation occurred?    Is there some flexibility, if we should be  [approaching1 our limits on that accumulation, of pushing more of the  intervention on the Bundesbank? My impression is that they have been  reaching for it anyway    Until they reach a liquidity constraint problem  which--    We could find ourselves accumulating in a  couple of weeks an amount that we have debated about over a month on  whether we should or should not I just would like us to be aware of  that    Easily It could be that in a day    That's our only hope now    Are there similar agreements with the Japanese?    Also with respect to the Treasury's share there  would need to be flexibility    Yes    I would remind you that we didn't flinch when  were short $6 billion but here suddenly, when we're gong to be long,  $500 million gives us pause I go with the [proposal in the1 memo    Yes    I'd like to see what [the reporter] says here  There has been no change in the Basle procedures that [I'm aware of]    That's very disturbing because there's an  understanding that that doesn't happen    And 185 on the up side?     7/11/79 -3-     During the period since the last meeting there  probably have been expectations of an increase in the expected rate of  inflation Do you see this expressed in any way in interest rates?    Would you interpret that as saying that  interest rates in real terms actually have fallen more than the  appearance of the nominal change implies?    I wonder, Jim, whether your estimates of future  inflation and wage increases couldn't be considerably low This, of  course, has been our experience all along Here we have 13 percent  CPI inflation and somehow we seem to assume that that has a minimal,  maybe 1 percent, effect on compensation That seems to me to imply a  very strong effect on wages from rising unemployment and really a very  tough government fiscal and monetary policy    Well, I’m not as well prepared as I should be,  having just come back last night from Basle I continue to think that  we may be underestimating inflation For the first three months [of  this year] we didn’t have very much OPEC input into this inflation and  nevertheless the CPI was going up at 13 percent Now, that was food  [prices], which have improved But we see the food area deteriorating  again because of Russian import needs and I am fearful that food  inflation will actually be higher   Second, I very much agree with what the Chairman said just  now Bringing inflation down under these deteriorating circumstances  is not just a question of taking more time to do it but it will be  more costly in terms of real income And the cost of that real income  means less growth, higher unemployment It need not mean more social  problems from unemployment, if that’s properly compensated, but it  does mean less output On the recession, I [agree] with those who  think there are many reasons to believe it will not be deep; there are  none of the antecedents we had in ‘73 and ‘14 There are no very  powerful things to pull us out of it unless we make a mistake stepping  on the gas very hard, but my concern is more that we should achieve  some lasting effect on inflation     7/11/79 -16-   Finally, as for accommodation of the exogenously imposed  inflation, I sense a growing consensus outside this body that we  should do much less accommodating than we did in 1973-74 when we  accommodated in terms of money supply, in terms of financing payments,  and in terms of trying to offset the domestic recessionary effects of  the oil price increase Wherever I go I sense that there is less  willingness this time around to accommodate the OPEC shock monetarily   AS far as the aggregates are concerned, I have a very strong  suspicion that we are dealing here with numbers that don't encompass  reality We know about RPs; we know about the Euro-market I  understand that the staff is on the track of some new kind of  overnight deposit device in the Cayman Islands, which if we integrate  it into M1 would account for a good part of the failure of M1 to grow  for the first half of the year, although I'm not fully up on the  latest data on this research We have other variables such as money  market funds We have devices that individuals now can use outside  money market funds to keep money outside of M1, such as Merrill Lynch-  type cash accounts All this suggests to me that the numbers we have  here are simply too low and that the true money supply--if it could  only be made to stand up--would be a great deal higher than these  numbers show    Well, under those conditions, Mr Chairman, I  lean toward keeping the specifications that we have now They may  seem very low, given what--    I find that a real quandary I am very  reluctant, however, to indicate that we are going to raise the rate of  money growth We can still [change the 1980 ranges later]; we are not  casting this in cement    But I would be very reluctant, unless convinced  by the discussion here that we should, to raise the rates of money  growth    Yes    In order to be consistent between M1 and M2, we  may have to shade the M2 downward a little I haven't really examined  that     7 / 1 1 / 7 9  -29-    Yes, I may want to shade my M2 to bring it more  nearly in line with M1, but I have to check the numbers    I would think that staying with the same ranges  in the face of higher inflation is something that people will     1/11/79 -32-   understand They will see that there's resistance, non-accommodation,  [to that higher inflation] I think it ought to have a good response    Two things One, to automatically add to our  1-1/2 to 4-1/2 the difference between 3 and the current ATS [estimate]  wasn't quite my idea    I think we are getting ourselves here in the  spirit of [believing that1 in a recession we've got to accelerate the  aggregates Now, that way, there will never be a reduction in  inflation In a recession interest rates should come down, but at  constant rates of expansion of the aggregates otherwise prices will  go up indefinitely    That is what gives you assurance that you [can]  ease; if you just keep the aggregates growing at a constant rate, you  get very low interest rates    I'd like to stick with that because I disagreed  on that one the last time    [I'd prefer that you] don't start out with me,  Mr Chairman; I haven't had the benefit of education around the table    Well, I think I lean more to alternative 111,  although modifying the funds rate there downward My thought is this  If we have a crisis in the exchange market, we should be free to move  I don't think it's worth a great deal getting the funds rate up in the  absence of such overriding necessity, but I think we may very well  face that over the next month What I would really like is something  that gives that kind of instruction That would mean beefing up the  language of the directive--not just saying that we take account of  foreign exchange markets--but I have not found a good way of wording  it I would enhance that, as I said, and give high priority to the  program for supporting the foreign exchange value of the dollar and  due regard to developing conditions in domestic financing markets  That's not an optimal [way of saying it] but it's a distinction that I  am trying to draw    If we have a major boil-up, there is no way of  putting together a package this time, as was done last time And we  can't do it with intervention; I don't think we should do it with  intervention So we then just have to face a possibly substantive  decline in our currency, adding to inflation and adding to the  problems of the world That's how I would like to shape this Stay  at the present funds rate level, give more room on the up side--in  other words, 10 to 10-3/4 percent--with some proviso that would give  us a chance to move up readily to a higher rate if the exchange market  should boil up, but otherwise not go up on the funds rate    Well, we don‘t have to take the week in which  the Bundesbank is going to raise their discount rate    Very, very reluctantly, they are doing it    Think of what people are going to be buying  once they get gasoline again    Money market    I’d like to see it examined because the idea  has merit but I wouldn‘t do it now because I can’t [assessl the  implications    Are we going to stick by your suggestion, M r    Chairman, that if the exchange markets destabilize, we will have a  meeting?    ~ l l  right If we will have a meeting, then I  will go along    I have great doubts about it, Mr Chairman,  because it is a political move If we do this, I fear we will find  ourselves approached by the State Department and maybe the Treasury on  behalf of other countries That has already been the case at a very  low level of planning One person from the State Department has  raised questions on whether some other countries could be included in  the swap network    [Unintelligible] foreign policy and  developmental and so forth, I think, if we do what is probably  sensible to improve relations with And I  think we ought to resist this    But if we do it for a reason that the State  Department plainly understands to have a political element, I think  they will want to have some say in future swap changes Now, unless  you've indicated to the Mexicans a great degree of good will and  intention, I would suggest that we say we'll raise the swap line if  appropriate, if and when they want to draw on it, but not give a  bigger credit line in a vacuum, as it were On top of that, there's  my own uncertainty as to what the Mexicans really are up to They're  borrowing enormously They need to because they're financing the  construction of the oil infrastructure Whether or not this borrowing  is going well or not, I don't know  I have the impression that it is  going well I have no contrary indication But they may be uncertain  and they may want this as a backstop And they may want it as a means  of improving their own borrowing posture in the market I would  hesitate to be drawn into that    Technically, these things are limited to    This is Henry Wallich I think we have the makings here of a possible crisis I define as a crisis a situation where in the case of quite heavy intervention we would find the market breaking 180 on the D-mark I think under those conditions monetary policy action would be appropriate--some rise in the discount rate, some rise in the funds rate Hopefully we can say that this will be reversed as soon as conditions in the markets stabilize, although that would reduce the effectiveness of the action somewhat I think what we will need in order to take monetary policy action in the face of the weakening economy is clear evidence that there is an urgency in the exchange market And that, in my view, will be brought about by some snowballing effect in the face of strong countering intervention I think intervention has a very limited effect Certainly it should be tried as far as we can, but we should not rely on that    7/17/79   I see the need to move the funds rate on account of the behavior of the aggregates The exchange markets have not done anything immediately and visibly that would call for action but I think there is accumulating malaise there and if we don't act, we will probably see a move [in the dollar] and will have to take    7/19/79  costly counteraction Putting those two things together, I would say Raise the funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, as per the directive; move the discount rate up 1/2 percentage point; and urge the Treasury- -as a sort of blessing to the action--to increase its sales of gold to the old level   Bill, could I say that I think it's important to get the two actions together, as far as the markets seeing them, because they don't understand the reasons and the mechanics by which we operate Perhaps we'd be able tonight to get the Presidents ready to [catch] up with their boards of directors and have something ready early tomorrow morning   Yes, I'd go to a range with a 10-3/4 percent ceiling   Is it possible to figure out the unrealized gain or loss on the account, and have you tried to do so?   Domestic On the foreign side I take it that the rule of [FASB 88] requires us to revalue these assets continuously but I don't believe there is a similar rule for the domestic assets   Do you see the possibility of doing that? Are there technical difficulties?   Well, I'd like to know--   --where we stand For one thing it would be helpful if we find that we're taking a loss on foreign exchange transactions to remember that the loss may be offset [by gains on the domestic side]   Scott, do you think the market would respond favorably if there were to be a package that included new Carter bonds? Is that a valuable feature to them?   Do you think they'd respond one way or another to forward operations?   Is it possible at the present time to put a ranking on the various factors that the market weighs in looking at the exchange rate? In other words, in the current account there's improvement; inflation, no improvement; interest rates, a deterioration What weights should one assign to these?   Would an improvement in the current account, which seems very likely, make up for failure to improve on inflation?   I would like to associate myself with the precedent concern The State Department has always thought that the Federal Reserve might be a source of credit in one situation or another They have a low level project going to that effect on how we could lend to LDCs And it will not be completely easy next time, [when] relations with a large LDC need improving, to say we don't want to participate It may be that the discussion with Mexico has gone too far and we would do more damage by saying no But we should be aware that the government--not this particular Administration--in the past repeatedly has pointed to the Federal Reserve as a source of credit in an emergency situation When the State Department makes a list, the Federal Reserve is normally featured in there   If I may, I would say that if Mexico got into trouble, we should be ready to help them and for a larger amount than this swap I say that not only for the reasons that have always existed but because banks are now more deeply involved But I would prefer to see that done on its merits rather than on a previous decision to improve relations   So would I   Going back to this earlier statement that the average age of our portfolio is now 43 years   That 4 to 6 years came in the examination report That is well in excess of the average age of the total public debt, isn't it? So, we are a substantial factor in helping the Treasury to lengthen the debt unless what they report is only the publicly held debt   Thank you   Looking at your projections, am I right in thinking that net exports and the change in business inventories are the two really dynamic factors and that they roughly offset each other with a swing of about $30 billion at a maximum? My question is about the degree of confidence with which you hold these [projected] sizable swings   With some of these elements, [such as] consumption, I think you probably have a very narrow confidence interval   Well, I'm very much aware of the need to balance the considerations of recession and inflation I think if we tighten up a little now, which is my inclination, we probably will add something to the depth of the recession but not much And I would not  -26-    8/14/79  consider that this may provoke such ill-timed and ill-thought-out responses on the fiscal policy side that we can't do that I think we have to do what seems right and then contribute as we can in a sensible way to other decisions being taken Now clearly, monetary policy has eased a great deal in recent months, [looking at] the aggregates themselves or the quasi-monies which we can add to M1, in which case they nearly double the rate of growth Or we can add them to M4 or M7 and they have a less dramatic impact, but [the quasi- monies] are really pretty close to M1 Real interest rates have become much more negative as inflation has accelerated And if you can't buy the CPI, you can always take your money abroad and buy a currency that is somewhat like the CPI; people are doing that So we have had a change in monetary policy that we had not intended We haven't been going out of bounds [on the long-run ranges] because we had that six months of flat movement in the aggregates from late last year through earlier this year But I think the important thing is what has happened in recent months  [Let me mention] one consideration about the real economy We are projecting, hopefully, a reduction in inflation of 1 or 2 percentage points from a double-digit range in the period after this recession Remember that in 1974-75 we also got into the double-digit range; inflation was about 12 percent in 1974 and we brought it down to about 6 percent in 1975 and to about 4-1/2 or 5 percent in 1976 In other words we did a great deal better then--at considerable cost in unemployment--than we expect to be doing, at least for the first year of the post-recession period If that means that we go into a new expansion in 1980 with a base inflation rate of 10 percent or thereabouts and we go through the same experience and the rate of inflation because of an expansion increases by about half of its value, we will find ourselves with inflation in the 15 to 20 percent range I think that prospect is no longer at all incredible I don't think our present policies involve very strong inflation fighting; they involve a very heavy component of fighting recession and in my view the result of that will be that we will go through one further round of slightly diminishing inflation and then we will see sharply accelerating inflation again   I have not thought of a payroll tax cut per se as structurally a very desirable device I would have thought [more favorably] of something that undoes the great increase in the  -37-    8/14/79  corporate tax resulting from under depreciation If all they did was to remove that, by replacement costs depreciation--   I think we have a choice of either a narrower aggregates range that is likely to be triggered on the up side before we pull it down or being a little more generous on the funds rate I could go with 4 to 8 percent on M1 and 7 to 11 percent on M2 provided we move to 11 percent on the funds rate and have a 10-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent range, with the possibility of that being used if it is triggered by the aggregates under a regular aggregates directive so that there's a gradual movement If we don't want to do that, then I would say that we ought to pull down the upper end of the aggregates  -40-    8/14/79  ranges and maybe the lower end also in order to have a narrower funds rate but an earlier trigger I would prefer the first version 4 to 8 percent, 7 to 11 percent, and [on the funds rate] 10-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent and a move to 11 percent   Well, you have to [accept] the logic of this   I would bring those down a little   It probably will have that effect    I would remind you that this is an opportunity  to talk about the budget deficit and, therefore, not to be completely  despised even though it is rather illogical to first vote [in favor  of1 the deficit and then refuse to allow it to be financed But it  gives the defeated party a chance to come back a second time and  criticize    Jim, in the change of your output [forecast]--  and I don't mean to be critical because you've obviously got to change  it as things [evolve]--there seems to be a shift, by a rather sizable  amount, between the third and fourth quarters on real GNP You've  increased the third quarter by 2-1/2 percentage points and decreased  the fourth quarter by 11 percentage points I hear what you're  saying in terms of consumption being a cause of the third-quarter  increase as opposed to prior expectations I gather that inventories  went up a bit faster than you had anticipated, which may be the cause  of most of the shift The fourth quarter, though, I read you as  saying GNP declines in conjunction with [reduced] housing starts and  maybe capital spending Am I reading you right? Are those the  principal reasons for this shift?     9/18/79 - 6 -     Mr Chairman, it seems to me that we face  basically a question of timing If the economy goes into recession,  as it may already have done--interrupted temporarily maybe, but  perhaps a more prolonged one than we originally thought--at some point  we have to ease But at the present time it seems to me the signs are  still on the other side The aggregates have been very strong; in a  sense that’s been an easing rather than a tightening even though  interest rates have risen Inflation shows itself to be more  persistent than before and we have the old picture where we tend to  underestimate inflation That also means that real interest rates are  less than one thinks, at least the upper end We are now getting to  the point where we are getting positive real interest rates I guess  Chase with its move [of the prime] to 13 percent made us honest But  that is only before taxes And as we look down the road, it seems to  make people increasingly accepting [continued] high inflation and  thereby perceiving a lower long-term real interest rate   Now the economy itself seems to me very spotty What we  have in good part is an automobile recession This is reflected in  the Redbook Many parts of the country are still very strong and if  we were to ease at this time those strong areas would of course bump  against their ceilings increasingly and produce more demand pressure  and inflation there I would add that there are other things that  might give us concern about high nominal interest rates Most have  not yet materialized The suspicion that there might be some sort of  crunch ahead seems not to be valid based on what we hear There are  no real supply constraints on credit We think of how we’ve shielded  the housing sector through the money market certificate That just  means that we need more restraint across the board in all sectors--  that is, in lower aggregates or higher interest rates I would remind  you again that what’s going on in the Euro-markets means that the  relevant monetary aggregates that we ought to focus on, if we had the  data, are growing faster than what we see   Finally, as to the immediate situation, it seems that the  market interprets the behavior of the aggregates and of the economy as  something that will cause us to tighten So while we should not  slavishly follow what the market seems to expect, nevertheless we have  to recognize that we disappoint the market at a cost--at a cost in  credibility--and I see no reason for that at this time I would  therefore argue in favor of a mild increase in the funds rate in order  to slow the aggregates Thank you, Mr Chairman    This is a money market directive?    Well, we're already there if September comes in  as expected at 10 percent; that is 5 percent for the two months So  it would take 6 percent [growth] to move up That's not a great deal  and yet it is a very high rate if, as Larry says, [we tolerate1 8  percent plus 1-1/2 for ATS On the down side, the 3 percent, we'd  have to get minus 4 percent for the second month, which strikes me as  pretty extreme It's a useful precaution but I would prefer to  achieve the same objective by having a skewed [funds rate] range of  11-1/4 to 12 percent or so and go to 11-1/2 percent    I think that 8 percent is high, and I think the  3 percent, while it accomplishes my purpose of avoiding a decline [in     9/18/79 -37 -    the funds rate1 is almost unrealistic because it means, assuming  September comes in as projected, that we have to have minus 4 percent  [Ml growth] in October And that doesn't seem very likely so just  in the interest of plausibility, I would prefer to modify this M1  range, but I don't feel strongly If that's the best way of  qualifying the funds rate movements, it can be done that way    Like disorder in the exchange market, it only  occurs on the down side    I would go with 3 to 8 and 6-112 or 6 to 10;  that would be my preference    I should have added that I would prefer a money  market directive because of the sensitivity of any interest rate  movement now    I could live with that we would have a  conversation if [Ml growth1 strikes at the up side and go to 11-3/4  percent We’d have a second conversation to go beyond that    Just as a general principle    That is hardly speculative although it's a  little speculative In '74 it was virulent   M R   COLDWELL In '74 we had a constraint in terms of  capacity that we haven't faced to a big degree   M R   BALLES To follow up on what Ernie said, I've had  conversations in some depth with various directors over the last week  and whether they're businessmen or bankers they report essentially the  same story--that the present level of interest rates, in contrast to  the situation generally in '74, is just not deterring borrowing in any  way that they can see  country; small businesses and farmers are in a big cash flow bind  But medium- and larger-size companies, according to the companies  themselves as well as their bankers, just don't blink at this level of  interest rates They just go ahead and borrow anyway I don't think  we're approaching the credit crunch type of situation that we had in  '74 I think that's one of the big differences   I'm sure that's not true for everybody in the    The reporters left the room when [Secretary]  Miller said that Paul had gone home They just rushed to the phones    I think the main argument in favor of the  reserve strategy is that it allows us to take stronger action than we  probably could by the other technique  in the other technique by the appearance of very high interest rates  In the new strategy interest rates become almost a by-product of a  more forceful pursuit of the aggregates I think we need stronger  action because of the resurgence in inflation and the behavior of the  aggregates and the dollar I realize that this may involve a higher  cost in terms of the length and depth of a recession But I try to  look beyond that and ask myself where we would be late in 1980 if very  little inflation has been wrung out of the system and we resume an  upward price trend from a much higher base   We are much more constrained   Now, I wouldn't say that the proposed new technique is  superior if the same strength of action could be taken by the existing  methods That's because the existing methods have the advantage that  we know the interest rate and we don't run the risk of the rate going  in the wrong direction and creating dollar problems But I think the  issue is really how strong an action we can take And it seems clear  that an action via the reserve strategy is capable of greater power  I've leaned toward that strategy for a long time, but I must confess  increasingly less as I saw the interest rate becoming more important  from the point of view of the dollar There is that risk of interest  rate uncertainty involved in the new strategy We would have to guard  against interest rates going in the wrong direction    it is quite clearly down Upward we can  control [through] money supply We're aiming at a tight money supply,  and that raises interest rates--or that is what we [are talking  about] But downward has a totally different implication It  involves a signal that we've switched policy and the markets are going  to respond accordingly Obviously, as we go into a recession there  will be a time when interest rates will have to come down They will  probably come down by themselves if the time is right And if it is  feasible in terms of the exchange markets, then we should     10/6/79 -20   Iaccommodatel that and the more the better But we need to watch this  strategy in terms of what it produces for interest rates and for the  exchange market so that we don’t get surprised by interest rate  movements when they could be harmful    I think that’s purely an [incidental] number    I‘d like to understand a little better the role  of the discount window and the discount rate in this procedure If we  bias the reserve path in one direction or another, that will influence  the volume of borrowing That will then influence interest rates,  which in turn will affect borrowing by virtue of the spread between  the discount rate and the funds rate We could leave it to that     10/6/79 - 3 2 -    mechanism to control borrowing, we could leave it to the  administration of the discount window to control it, or we could move  the discount rate It's not clear to me which way might be the best    What we would do if it went to 9 percent--  intervene in the [exchange] market in very large amounts to offset the  effects?    And probably be defeated   M R   RICE Why would we probably be defeated?   M R   WALLICH Because it's not the effect of the interest  rate as such That doesn't play a big role in the short run The  exchange market would be the symbol but all over the world they would  be saying the new procedure really is a form of easing    We need to do two things, in my judgment One  is to set a money supply target that causes the funds rate to rise but  not excessively The other is to set a range that won’t allow the  funds rate to fall excessively And to me it looks as if something  like 4 percent on the money supply would probably do that     10/6/79 -41-    It doesn’t matter all that much    Yes    It doesn’t matter very much within a range that  is set like this one here    The rates that really would matter would be the  other short-term rates; the funds rate matters much less The other  short-term rates, I think, would move up in relation to the discount  rate and the money supply constraint If the funds rate stays at the  lower end of the band for a long time, then that would pull the other  rates down    I still think it's the safer thing to do     10/6/79 -52-    I share that view I would like 4 percent  rather than 45 percent   M R   BALLES I would, too    Thank you    Could I just say a word on this? At the last  Economic Policy Committee meeting at the OECD, from which Charlie  Schultz and I have just returned, the United States made a long  presentation [on US economic and financial developments], including     11/20/79 -3-    our domestic monetary policy Charlie and I got just three questions  on this The only subject of these three question was this What is  going to happen when the aggregates and the economy slow? Are you  going to let interest rates go down? We, of course, gave the standard  answer that when inflation comes down, the money supply slows and the  economy slows and then it will be appropriate for interest rates to  come down I don't know what the reactions were; there wasn't any  come-back on that    I think inflation coming down will be the most  convincing single thing but unfortunately we're locked into a CPI that  has certain lagged features from mortgage rates and from energy So  one can't promise anything    I share Scott‘s view on the present situation  as to how we should proceed I continue to think that if things quiet  down and we get halfway stable markets, we ought to make it a routine  to buy a few tens of millions a week or a few million a day, letting  the market see that these are routine transactions in order to repay  [swap drawings] So we get [marks] on that basis without always  frightening the market when we move in--having the market think that  we’re trying to cap the rate at that level But I would agree with  Scott that until the Iranian situation settles down, this isn’t the  time to start such a policy       You know, this discussion does not really  reflect what went onat the QECD meeting The numbers are roughly the  same but there was not a great sense of pessimism and not a sense of  world recession Rather there was a mild degree of feeling that it  was good to have economies desynchronized instead of having the cycle  moving synchronously everywhere    I know, but by the time this discussion took  place the recent increases were known so that was reflected in the  conversation    Imported oil is about 3 percent of GNP  Imported oil is half of our total oil [consumption], isn’t it?     11/20/79 -11-    I have no quarrel with the staff's forecast,  though I think there is at least a possibility that the OPEC decision  will be less adverse than they think In Europe there seems to be a  feeling that oil is reasonably plentiful and, therefore, that the  ability to raise [its price] rather drastically is less    Well, but at least they've got it Even so, I  think it's clear that we're facing a worsening outlook for both  unemployment and inflation The [situation] seems to be worse on the  side of inflation than unemployment and slow growth So I think we've  got to weight our approach accordingly--that is, lean more in the  direction of fighting inflation than taking account of the recession     1 1 / 2 0 / 7 9  - 2 8 -    We have [adopted] a money supply policy for some time into  the future and we're really talking here about how to phase into that  longer-run path Admittedly, we're going to review the path in  December or maybe in January But basically we laid down a pattern  for the future and this ought to satisfy those who like Larry feel  that we ought to have a fairly firm target I'm quite skeptical of  the meaning of this target; I don't think M1 measures what it is  supposed to be measuring If we had the revised aggregates--and  revised them the way I would like to see them revised--that [new] M1  would be advancing faster We see bank credit advancing fast, and it  has grown at a very stable rate all through the year, fluctuating in  an 11 to 14 percent range And in the forecast it is not projected to  slow down; it's currently projected to increase at its [recent] rate  of growth month by month through January All that suggests to me  that we do need continued restraint I don't see the prospect of  another blow being dealt to us by OPEC as a reason for relaxing; it  would seem to me a reason for doing more Otherwise we'll be in the  position of the man who was told by his doctor to take it easy because  he is badly overworked And at that moment he has a heart attack so  he says, "Well if things are as bad as that, I might as well go back  to working a full schedule" It would seem to me that if we are hit  harder on the inflation front, then the severity of another blow is a  reason for increasing the effort, not for diminishing the effort   I'd like to say a word about the dollar I think in the  long run we have to adjust to the prospect that we certainly can't  keep up with the D-mark If this inflation is going to go on and on,  the differential between the D-mark and the dollar is perpetuated We  are in much the same position as the French are with the franc; they  cannot get their inflation down and they're trying desperately to hang  on They've had to take one downward step; they'll have to take  others I don't think we have to yield on our trade-weighted exchange  rate, which is the more meaningful measure of the dollar We ought to  be able to hold on and our policies ought to be designed to that end   Now, I quite share the reactions of the Chairman and of  Roger Guffey [regarding] people's statements about our policies AS  soon as we say interest rates are coming down as a result of a logical  evolution of our money supply policy, they say '"Aha, you're changing  your policy" I think there's an obvious logical defect here One  can perhaps differentiate two statements One is We're not changing  our policy, but the environment is deteriorating as far as maintenance  of the value of the dollar is concerned and maybe that's the logical  consequence But we do have to make clear that our policy is the  money supply, properly defined, and that interest rates therefore do  have greater flexibility And if inflation comes down, I think that  will be fairly acceptable The problem is that inflation may not come  down   Well, forgive me for that long statement I just want to  say briefly that I lean toward alternative C The only thing,  frankly, that bothers me about it is the prospect that it will bring  interest rates down sometime this winter But I'm aware that we  presumably will have a chance to reassess that If inflation comes  down and we have a serious economic situation, the doors are entirely  open But I don't want to prejudice that [policy response] now    "C"    I think that's very likely    I think we ought to avoid the prospect of  needing a 10 percent rate of growth and having to force in reserves in  December to achieve that   SEVERAL I do, too    I think December would be much too early for a  decline in interest rates in line with trying to say that this should     11/20/79 -39-   go hand in hand with [what is happening with] the economy and with  inflation    But the non-M1 component of M2 doesn't absorb  a very large amount of reserves, so the impact would be slight   M R   AXILROD Yes, but for whatever it absorbs if M2 grows  at a higher rate, there will be less for M1 So it would go in the  direction of reducing MI below 5-1/2 percent in practice if, in fact,  M2 was growing as strongly as projected    Well, I could take the second    Well, would you be willing to raise [the  initial borrowing assumption]? This gives us a little more  opportunity for fine-tuning and sharing because we've got the  borrowing Would you be willing to raise that a little?    I wanted two Yes, if you made [borrowing]  $18 billion   M R   PARTEE But that's tougher The choices were between  ,VB" or "C ~ I! You're trying to make it tougher and move it toward "C"    Yes, that's what I'm trying to do    And the 8th is the date I'll be returning from  the BIS meeting   M R   COLDWELL You'd be gone on the 7th too    The 7th and 8th I'll be gone   M R   ROOS What did you say about December, M r   Chairman?    We're back in 1937   The mechanism described just now must have some similarity with what went on during the '30s when [the FOMC] found that it could not generate the money supply it wanted Well, I don't    1/8-9/80  know what [the FOMC at the time] wanted, but at any rate most of the expansion they did engage in, mostly through gold purchases not security purchases, went into excess reserves But this is a very faint effect here, which would not worry me a great deal What does worry me is that I now encounter, not only here but abroad, a criticism of our procedures that in effect says we're back to the procedures of the 1920s when borrowing was regarded as contractionary; the more borrowed reserves you had, the more contractionary effect you were setting up Banks were trying to get out of debt, so to push the banks into debt was the way to tighten credit; that is sometimes associated with Riefler's name As I say, I have heard this comment that our procedures now are very similar to that We push the banks into rediscount, by operating on nonborrowed reserves; the less nonborrowed reserves we supply, the more they have to borrow; and that, we say, lowers monetary expansion It does so presumably by driving up the funds rate and driving up other rates, and that reduces the demand for money Now, I wouldn't say that this is a bad mechanism And I wouldn't say that borrowing is expansionary as some of our critics say in the sense that more reserves, of course, is more expansionary than less reserves I would say that we aim at a given volume of reserves and that the composition of that volume of reserves makes a difference If they're all nonborrowed, it's more expansionary than if a higher percentage of them is borrowed That seems to me a reasonable approach  In support of a rejection of this criticism I would argue that some of the things we experienced here all do point in somewhat the same direction We got low borrowing at a given interest rate That would suggest that there is greater reluctance to be in debt now than there was in the past and that there is a true reluctance to be in debt that causes banks to restrain their [credit] expansion Second, we get high excess reserves Well, that seems to be the same phenomenon of caution on the part of the banks They don't want to get into debt; they'd rather have excess reserves And, finally, the funds rate remains high and doesn't go down as one would expect Well, again, they're bidding for funds in order to have liquidity, in order to be safe I could visualize that this is simply happening because we're in a transition period and they are learning the ropes And after a while the willingness [to hold] excess reserves will wear off and the reluctance to borrow may wear off But for the time being, it seems to me that this criticism that I hear--and as I say I was surprised to hear it in Switzerland--is not justified I'd like to hear what Peter and Steve have to say about this   Well, I'd like to make one general comment The experiment in terms of results has worked very well I have no quarrel with that, certainly But I think it continues to lay us open to the risks of unexpected and unexplainable declines in interest rates that can give us great trouble internationally Now, we can always say that that is appropriate--that we're going into a recession, inflation is coming down, and it is fully appropriate Nevertheless, as the Chairman has pointed out--he gets this question again and again and we get the same thing in the press and in criticisms at home and abroad--that by sticking to a firm money growth path and therefore a firm reserve path we can get unpredictable interest rate results In fact, they may even be predictable in the sense that rates become very low when the demand for money lets up And we may or may not want that So, I do think we need to build in something at the lower end   Well, that bothers me less   That is very true But the greater danger is on the interest rate side   Well, we're working hard at that Every speech contains the same things that I said just now And sometimes I almost believe them! [Laughter]   Even if we did close the window, we still could be thrown off by currency or by float  -17-    1/8-9/80   Well, the purpose of these measures is not so much to hit them all at once, which is impossible, but to be warned if something is going off track The purpose is to have a sense of the relativeness of the things we're mainly aiming at   Well, I start with the experience we've had of hitting our target on M1 and getting as a result a severe acceleration of inflation plus a much stronger economy We've been waiting for this recession now for a year It was predicted for the early part of '79 So, this leads me to think that there is something about our numbers that just does not reflect the true concept of money [I don't know] whether we're going to capture that by our revisions I think we'll make improvements but not really capture everything that is happening in the way of rising liquidity, and that makes me lean toward low numbers I also see that there are very ominous changes going on in people's habits and expectations In the last surge of inflation, 1974-75, there was a worldwide tendency for saving rates to increase That was almost the same in all major countries I haven't checked out what happened in this period, but we see now what happens to us People have a different attitude They are less afraid that they'll lose their jobs, but they're more convinced that inflation will go on That is what the decline in the saving rate seems to me to say  Now, as to action, I share the view that we shouldn't make a numerical commitment because the meaning of that commitment isn't clear enough, particularly if we had to start with a commitment that says 6 to 5 to 4 percent or 5 to 4 to 3 percent I very much doubt that we'd hit that because circumstances could force us into a pro- cyclical pattern We're not going to have the desire or ability to cut off a strong economic expansion, and we'll find ourselves being pro-cyclical Therefore, I think we have to start with a low rate of money growth right away I would say that 3 to 6 percent is a good starting point If we went much higher than that, we'd be in immediate danger of getting into negative real interest rates with what they do to allocation of credit and inflation and the dollar On the other aggregates, I'd like to see more clearly how they are likely to behave But I think a fairly narrow [Ml] range like 3 to 6 percent, aiming at the midpoint of 45 percent and expecting that that really is a symbol for much more liquidity than it seems to give us, is the way to start  -37-    1/8-9/80   Well, that explains a little more why we were able to finance such a tremendous inflation, but the increase in velocity still remains very large   But this still would have very little impact on the price of gasoline, wouldn't it, barring an increase in taxes? What would be the price of gasoline, would you say, corresponding to a world level price for crude oil?   That should be offset or compensated for by a rise in the personal income tax, shouldn't it?   We're talking about a shift of the social security financing from the payroll tax to personal income tax So we would have to anticipate the rise in the personal income tax as we cut back on the social security tax increase, if we didn't want to increase the deficit   This change in consumer behavior, as I said yesterday, strikes me as very significant If, now, in a period of accelerating inflation people don't save more but save less, there must have been some change in their evaluation of the situation The most plausible guess, it seems to me, is that in '74 people were genuinely scared They didn't know where the economy was going and whether they were going to have a job, so they cut back on average Now with a more moderate recession predicted, there seems to be less  -54-    1/8-9/80  of that fear On the other hand, there's a more rational attitude that if they buy now they save 13 percent They are buying; they did buy cars, which was perhaps the first wave of that Now they are buying something else You are quite right that [consumer spending] seems to go from one thing to another But I would argue also in looking at consumer debt, which has risen relative to income, that the consumer probably looks at it in relation to future income So, with future nominal income rising, the debt ratio to him appears less than it is  My main comment is on the nature of our staff's forecast It is in a sense a formal exercise because you don't give weight to the political probability of a tax cut So this [forecast] is what would happen if the things that are already planned and decided were to happen The Board staff's forecast is under those of forecasters who are not bound by that constraint; I think those forecasters generally accept and expect a substantial tax cut sometime this year Therefore, the shape of their recession is different Their recession is shorter than ours and its end is different; instead of saucering out very flat, it comes up more V-shaped And their inflation expectations--although I don't know this for a fact, but it seems logical from these differences in their view of the income pattern-- should be higher than ours Can you say anything about outside forecasts and the like?   Are you simply saying that the variance around the forecast is wider? Or are you saying that the forecast is--?   If I may follow up on this The purpose of a money supply target presumably is to force wider swings in interest rates If we stick to the same rate of money growth through expansion and recession, we'll get very wide swings of rates, wider than we've been willing to impose by acting a priori, as Steve said, on the interest rate But to me that doesn't mean that it is logical to move to severely negative real interest rates because we have a recession There are considerations of having a positive or a negative real interest rate, and to my view the ability to swing widely toward a low interest rate is limited by that It should not become severely negative   Well, I continue to think that the economy moves on interest rates If I rely on the money supply, it's because in [a period of] inflation I think that's a better way to get the right interest rates than to try to do it outright But I don't regard the money supply as a black box where I have to accept everything that comes out So if an unreasonable interest rate comes out, I reserve the [option] to evaluate that on its own terms As Nancy said, we have reduced the growth of the money supply for 3 years running and have brought inflation from about 7 percent to 13 percent in doing so   With able help from various--   Well, we can argue about the numbers, but [inflation] has gone up while the growth of the money supply as we define it has gone down So I lean toward the tighter side for the long term, alternative II And within that framework I lean toward alternative C in terms of the old definitions of money I don't care whether we use the old or the new definitions, just so we don't misunderstand I would go with the numbers that are in the Bluebook under alternative C 4 percent for M1; 65 percent for M2; and 7 percent for M3 I would raise the lower end of the funds rate from 11-1/2 to 12 percent and make the top 16 percent I agree with Chuck that before the rate got to 11-1/2 percent we would probably find ourselves making a decision about the discount rate anyway   To 16, yes And the bottom to 12   Well, I have a couple of points of uneasiness One, it seems to me that we may be biasing this in the direction of lower interest rates by the low borrowing assumption What happens if borrowing is higher? Then, presumably, until the nonborrowed reserve path is adjusted, total reserves would be higher than we thought So the low borrowing assumption does have some implication for the total reserves we anticipate and for interest rates   Not the very recent experience  -76-    1/8-9/80   It does make a difference what the source of reserves is, and we should not ignore that It may be a refinement, but borrowed reserves are not quite the same thing as owned or nonborrowed reserves   Well, the changes that can occur, such as changes in excess reserves and changes in total deposits that banks can bring about, would have to be enormous in order to offset any significant shortfall of reserves because the multipliers are so high for M1 That multiplier is on the order of 10 and for M2 it's on the order of 20, so banks would have to bring enormous pressure on their borrowers and the holders of securities in order to make up a given shortfall in reserves by changing their reservable liabilities   I'm trying to say what the difference is between lagged and nonlagged reserves It is a small one, as far as the [reserve] adjustments go  -81-    1/8-9/80   That's right   I feel somewhat the same way Evidently these [choices] do not matter a great deal [individually], but the combination of what seems to me historically low borrowing, an unchanged lower end of the funds rate, and a somewhat higher rate of M1 [growth] all cumulates a little in my view   I would like to say that it has been checked out very carefully My own feeling, if I were one of the foreign central banks, is that I'd rather not have that much reported about what my representative said at particular meetings But it has all been correctly checked out, as in the past, and there seems to be no uneasiness   You would rather have even more--?  -84-    1/8-9/80   Yes   Well, those were very thoughtful observations by Bob Black I just would like to make two points on those before I briefly say what I meant to I am not sure that we'll satisfy the monetarists by this change I think their reasoning is that they want to minimize Desk operations They believe that with contemporaneous accounting all the adjustment can take place through a change in deposits and none of the reserve needs have to be met by Desk operations You pointed out that these adjustments of levels of deposits don't take place instantaneously We need a very large change for each dollar of reserves, something like a $10 change in demand deposits and a $20 change in time deposits These changes are really so large that they can't take place quickly; any reserve deficiency or surplus must still be met very predominantly from Desk operations My other reaction is that the one-month procedure sounds like an ingenious possibility and well worth studying, but one can see the danger of slippage if we expanded this [time period] Suppose we made it not one month but one year One can see that that wouldn't be workable So somewhere between a day and a year there is an optimum in terms of less disturbance but also less loss of effectiveness  As far as moving to a contemporaneous basis right away is concerned, I think the gain we have in terms of the monetarists' analysis wouldn't be very great The staff memorandum convinces me that the gain in terms of speed might be very considerable The effects of any reserve shortage begin two weeks earlier unless we want to assume that somehow a reserve shortage or surplus casts its shadow ahead and the banks move into very short-term assets as soon as they see their deposits moving in one direction or another But that isn't very likely because all they see is their own deposits moving; they don't see the aggregate moving necessarily So, there does seem to be a significant advantage in terms of speed of adjustment and I think that is important because even though we say that it really doesn't matter over a quarter or so whether we deviate from our target, it is always very hard to get back on track It doesn't matter if we deviate if we indeed get back on track Nothing happens to the real  -10-    2/4-5/80  sector But getting back on track may be very painful because the forces that pushed us off may still be operative  I have one question on something that I'd like to understand better I have the impression that under the present procedure, the funds rate still serves as a guide to reserve needs Peter seemed to say that if we move to contemporaneous, we would lose that At present, a movement in the funds rate is an unambiguous indication that reserves are either too large or too small and it is clear that the Desk must take action unless it wants to have the reserve imbalance met by borrowing or repayment If we have contemporaneous, then a move in the funds rate may mean indeed that market factors have produced a deficiency or excess of reserves But it also may mean that the aggregates are moving in a particular direction, creating a reserve surplus or deficiency If the latter is the case, we may not want to counteract that; we may want to let the change in the funds rate do its job Say a decline in deposits leads to a decline in the funds rate We would want the decline in the funds rate to help push deposits back up So there seems to be a possibility of using the funds rate as a guide to operations under lagged [accounting] and less of a possibility to do that under contemporaneous Since I am troubled, frankly, by the use of the funds rate as a guide to operations because it exposes us to the appearance of still being on a funds rate target, I wonder whether this wouldn't protect us against that suspicion that we're trying to control the funds rate rather than nonborrowed reserves and the aggregates And I wonder whether the Desk wouldn't be able to judge what it needs to do--determine the need to add reserves or the absence of a need--without this indication coming from the funds rate   Nothing as drastic as going into the market and buying some D-marks   Could you expand a little on what you perceive as market expectations about future inflation? I see that Treasury bill futures, for instance, have changed by a very substantial amount, something close to 100 basis points over a month or so   It seems to me that the odds have clearly moved in the direction of less recession and more inflation than they were some time ago I think the degree of uncertainty is very high because the saving rate is abnormal and, therefore, potentially unstable And if we move to higher rates of inflation, people could react very unpredictably But the thing that most impresses me about the behavior of people is that in the last surge of inflation, in 1974, the saving rate went up--and it did so not only in this country but all over the world--while this time people have reacted differently They pulled the saving rate down That seems to be a message They seem to be saying "We're no longer so scared of losing our job that we're stopping our spending We're now out to beat the game" And that suggests to me that we may be in a new ball game unless the move to higher inflation rates throws a new scare into people  Well, I had anticipated a somewhat more severe recession than the staff, but recent events have taken me off that I could see a small dip in 1980 of maybe 1 percent, but [my forecast has] a very wide variance I see inflation now at very high rates, with the deflator at 12 percent for the year, that is year-to-year And the CPI could be close to 15 percent These [increases mean that] real  -40-    2/4-5/80  interest rates are no longer positive I know that some of us don't believe that real interest rates mean very much But we're only 19 people and there are 220 million out there who believe differently or at least act as if they believe differently So I share what Phil Coldwell said on that score I don't see quantitative monetary restraint being in effect--that is, availability restraint And I don't think that these interest rates, particularly when one considers them after taxes, really bite So we have to consider now that we are in a group of high inflation countries with Italy and the United Kingdom Then comes a tier of moderate inflation countries and then come the low inflation countries We've moved very far That is why I don't really expect a tax cut this year I think these forces will give people pause unless there is a significant deterioration in the climate Eventually, I think there will be a tax cut simply because we are getting more fiscal drag than we can accommodate over time I certainly would oppose a tax cut, and I would lean toward firm monetary restraint I don't know [how] one can have that confidence in the nominal aggregates that M-1A and M-1B convey All we know is that these [measures] are extremely uncertain I don't think the new definitions capture all that's going on, especially in the Euromarket We capture only a small part of that So I believe money is really expanding faster than we think, and I would want to take that into account in thinking that we can have 15 percent inflation On unemployment, I have no difference with the staff; 7-1/2 percent by the end of 1980 seems a possibility   I think we face more inflation and less recession than would have been [the case] before recent changes in the economy Now the question is How does one finance a higher nominal GNP with a given amount of money supply? In Chuck's calculation you have to look at the nominal GNP and ask how it can be financed from the rise in money, and a rise in velocity is very logical Moreover, one can't say nowadays that we would get some rise in velocity out of rising interest rates because presumably we wouldn't So we're dependent, really, on the amount of money growth in the effective money supply--that is, the amount of money growth plus the regular growth in velocity at a constant interest rate And I think the staff puts the drift in the demand function at about 2 percent  Since we've opened up the question of the aggregates, I would like to express some doubt not only about M-1A, on which I share what others have said, but M-1B In general I think we are not yet including everything that acts like money, and we probably never will Money market accounts and mutual funds are not in M-l, although I would suspect that they have a very strong effect on people's holdings of demand balances That is, they aren't used for transactions--their velocity is low--but they are very good substitutes for a cash balance I hear that brokerage firms are now setting up, in effect, zero balance overdraft facilities If that takes over, one needs no cash balance at all any more; one can just finance one's current needs against one's stock holdings There are Eurodollars, of which we [include] what seems to be a small part in the aggregates I don't think we capture even all the Eurodollars owned by US residents because we don't know their total and we certainly don't include any part of Eurodollars owned by nonresidents, even though one would think some of those dollars are going to be used in the United States, not for purchases of goods and services but for purchases of assets, which influence our interest rates and so on So, I think the monetary aggregate [targets] are really symbols of restraint--orders of magnitude, but not to be taken at face value If we did take them at face value, I'd say look at M2 and you will find that under alternative I [the staff] projects [growth at] 9-1/2 percent, the upper limit That's more than [the projected] nominal GNP increase for 1980, which I believe is about 8 percent, so we'd be over- financing in those terms This does not allow for any drift in the money function   There may be no drift in M2, but that depends on how one believes these extraordinary items, Eurodollars and so forth, impinge Well, that leads me to alternative III I think we do need wide ranges because it's simply impossible to target several aggregates and make them consistent using anything like a single number I would place a great deal of weight on M2 for the reasons I have given I think [alternative III] is consistent with financing [a nominal] GNP increase of about 8 percent   But [their target] varies with the rate of inflation   I mean the range has to be seen relative to the rate of inflation At 10 percent inflation, 3 percent [growth in money] isn't much At 2 percent [inflation] it would be a great deal   We could accept Steve's [suggestion] as long as we don't focus on the midpoint The midpoint gives us a quarter point and looks foolish A narrower range, other things equal, looks better I see the risks; we might miss We're much more likely to miss on the up side than on the down side   But, Nancy, on the other hand, we'd get a rise in the rate of inflation   That's just raising it, on average, because the lower ends don't really mean anything   Well, it seems that we'd very likely do something if it came out there Even I would be prepared to do that   Well, I was more worried about M2, and there we have an increase Raising the lower constraints on M-1A and M-1B doesn't really accomplish anything   Well, can we swallow something real now?   But it contains very different components   The measure of tightness in the face of higher inflation is not the money supply It is really the interest rate, or the real interest rate I see that as having come down   It doesn't bother me to tighten the money supply, not because I think that's the proper response but because I think it will have the desired result   I think we should be clear on what overall response we want and to me that is expressed in the funds rate   It raises a problem   Well, I think there has been a distinct perception of a higher rate of inflation by the public And there has been a challenge on whether or not we are still hanging in tough   Governor Wallich would prefer 14 and 18   President Winn is in favor of 18 at the top and he's  indifferent on the bottom Either way is all right with him on the bottom   Scott, you said that the fundamentals-- inflation expectations, the current account, and so forth--were not in favor of the dollar Do you see continuing strong pressure for the dollar to go up in the face of that?   The question I would like to raise more broadly is, insofar as we do anything in the market at all, should we restrain the dollar more than we have? We share with the Bundesbank in the proceeds of their support operation In any event, if there is a strong movement, one can't do very much But if the dollar goes up, say, three pfennigs in one day, wouldn't it be better to absorb some of that?   The market moves against the intervention is what you are saying The dollar goes up in Frankfurt against the Bundesbank intervention and doesn't go up in New York despite the absence of intervention   But at what cost?   Does that reflect the judgment of the Treasury on the outlook for the dollar?   I move we accept this    3/18/80   But we can affect the degree of pressure they are under so that they will start making adjustments   Yes   Well, they can [have a] reserve deficiency for a week, for a little bit   I wonder if I may ask two questions? The first one is to Steve Steve, on contemporaneous reserve accounting, how much of a change in deposits would you need in order to sweat out $1 of reserve deficiency?   The point I am trying to get at is Isn't the additional adjustment you get from contemporaneous reserve accounting relatively small? You need a very large movement in deposits in order to overcome a small deficiency or surplus of reserves   And you can anticipate it anyway but--   May I ask my other question? Peter, what determines your decision to buy coupons? You mentioned that you bought nearly $1/2 billion   Would you have done about the same had the bond market been different?   Yes, so you were stabilizing the market?   It's very difficult to tell what effects our policies are having These high interest rates may hit some borrowers very hard but they don't seem to hit others at all, and the net effect one can't predict I see that Charlie Schultz, after the President's program was announced, predicted a 2-1/2 percent rise in GNP for 1981, so he doesn't seem to think that this has a very powerful impact I am particularly concerned about the inflation forecast I view the forecasts of both our staff and the Administration as wildly optimistic The very slight recession that we are anticipating is very unlikely to make that kind of dent in the inflation rate Of course, we have a history of always underestimating the rate of inflation  I am aware of the repercussions of a firm policy at savings banks, small commercial banks, and elsewhere As these [problems] come toward us, we have to be prepared to meet them, and I think we should meet them in a liberal way--stretch our powers as far as they can reasonably be stretched But we should not be obsessed by the concern that the recession may last a little longer or even be a little deeper As I look back over our record, I am impressed that we never stopped fighting recession We moved imperceptibly from fighting the last recession and its consequences into worrying about the next recession And that recession concern essentially has dominated our thinking and has brought us now to 15 percent inflation It's a situation with very poor options, but I lean toward the firmer ones That is, I lean toward "C" The market has not been impressed by our policy package except abroad The bond market hasn't responded very much Short-term rates are actually down I think there is a real danger that if we now give the impression that we are about to relax our general credit restraint behind a shield of selective credit controls, we will get the worst of both worlds We'll get the selective controls not working--I have not been very enthusiastic about them anyway--but we should do what we can not to disavow them completely That is best done by not throwing any burden on them and by holding to a firm general control I think it's important at this time not to convey the impression that the regular discount rate, which wasn't changed, is the discount rate and that essentially we have taken evasive action in trying to avoid raising the discount rate We should so operate on nonborrowed reserves that there is a  -31-    3/18/80  good amount of borrowing at the surcharge so that the rate acquires some credibility  Finally, I share the concern about the April bulge If we have taken 15 percent out through the seasonal adjustment, there must be a lot of money out there--in reality, people don't draw checks on seasonally adjusted checking accounts--and that may have its effect So in addition to "C" generally, I would like to see a funds range of 14 to 20 percent Thank you, Mr Chairman   If borrowings were, let's say, in the $2-1/2 to $3 billion range, what part do you think would be at the 13 percent rate and what part at 16 percent?   That would press the upper end, not the lower   That looks low to me   But there would be almost no borrowing at the higher rate   Following up President Black's question The market knows the projections are for falling interest rates These forecasts are also derivable from Treasury bill futures and the like    4/22/80  Do you think the exchange rate discounts these future declines in interest rates so that if they materialized there would be no further exchange rate effect?   These all strike me as rather unorthodox ways of coping with our problems Depreciate the dollar, bring down interest rates, and fight inflation Now, I don't think you really meant this seriously, but it sounded a little ominous because there are people who do believe that   I'd like to follow up on what Larry said I think it is perfectly possible to convince the market that we are sticking to a fixed money supply policy That doesn't mean that we are not engaging in a very stimulative policy at a time of recession That's exactly the nature of that policy It's not really a policy; it's a procedure And it's analogous to building strong automatic stabilizers into the fiscal system where without tax cuts the recession will produce a large deficit which, of course, is very stimulative Here we have generated a procedure that is highly restraining when demand for money rises against a fixed supply because interest rates rise sharply; and it's highly stimulative on the way down So we convince the market that we are on track with our aggregates All that we are telling them is that we are going to have low and extremely stimulative interest rates Their analysis will be quite correct Now, if it's a question of proving that we are following our policy, I think we can be persuasive But that doesn't mean the market will believe that we are not following a policy that has very stimulative effects So, I think we need to look at the reality--namely, that we would be stimulating very severely if we let interest rates go down--rather than at the procedure The procedure says we haven't changed our method of feeding money into the economy    4/22/80  All that makes very relevant what Steve said That we may have to modify our path We may be able to do this within the limits of the [annual] ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 percent for M-1B and 3-1/2 to 6 percent for M-1A I think we would not have to go outside those ranges, at least for the remaining two months of the first half of the year It would be very alarming if we went to money growth rates for the second quarter that would make us maintain the 5 percent rate of growth from December to June because we would have to have two months of very high growth rates in order to overcome the weakness of March and April This is an occasion where we ought to allow a little base drift Let the past be the past and make sure that in May and June we do not have very large increases in the aggregates Now, to the extent that the funds rate can contribute to controlling that, we should be concerned about the funds rate and not let it drop very low Our techniques of supplying reserves, of course, can give us a better handle on the expansion of the money supply And when we get to talking about specifics, I'd like to supply some more specific suggestions on how large an increase we ought to aim at   That comes out of the movement in the previous period, I think   No I don't believe there is any direct effect from money to the economy The economy in my opinion runs on interest rates The effect from money goes to interest rates and from there it goes to the economy And the prescription for a fixed rate of growth of the money supply, far from being a neutral and noninterventionist policy on the economy, is a policy of very extreme intervention One might even call it fine-tuning You want wide swings in the interest rates and that's what we get by having inelastic growth of the money supply [Rates] are high in expansions, which restrains, and are very low in recessions, which stimulates There may be very good reasons normally for stimulating strongly in a recession and then as demand for money builds up again to get interest rates rising early in the expansion But in our present predicament, where we have to worry more about inflation than anything else, I don't think we can afford this remedy   I'm afraid I don't like any of the three [Bluebook alternatives] I'd like something a little stronger It doesn't mean that we'd have to get outside of our range We can live within the 4 to 6-1/2 percent annual range on M-1B, which [is the aggregate] I like to think in terms of We would have to have a lower growth rate for the March-to-June period and, therefore, for May and June We'd have to go a little below [the growth rate in] alternative C for M-1B for the second half of our half-year period, to something like 3-1/2 percent perhaps Bear in mind, if you will, that this does mean a substantial increase in liquidity in the second half of the year because nominal GNP, according to our forecast, is going to grow at 5 percent and M2 on the path in alternative B is going to grow at a higher rate than that So we're going to accumulate liquidity on the way down I don't know how fast we're going to come out of the recession   Well, [you are] talking of "B" But now look at M2, which is after all what guides bank credit mostly If that has a reduction of velocity, I see considerable accumulation of liquidity In any event, after all that has happened, I think we'll be sitting here a year or a year and a half from now and I will then be asking that we stick by our targets And some members of the group will say What? You're trying to cut off this expansion at 8 percent unemployment? I fear the logic of the argument is going to cut both ways at that time That's why I'm willing to budge now on my side, but I hope you'll support my side next time around As far as the funds rate is concerned, I don't care if we cap it at 19 percent if the aggregates turn out to be as fast as [estimated] and we follow the alternative B target If that [monetary growth] were reached, we would probably find [the funds rate] moving back to the top of its range and we would have to have a consultation I very much think we ought to put a floor on the funds rate [that would trigger] a consultation at 16 percent at the minimum   When the funds rate drops as a result, we will have a consultation   I think we ought to look at other interest rates, too, because the funds rate has become a very poor indicator of the rest of the spectrum of rates If bill rates, for instance, were to fall more rapidly than the funds rate, that would be a further signal to the market   It helps me infinitesimally   Paul, this is a very technical matter and it has many ramifications Sometimes before when we've had a very technical matter, for instance on the directive, a subcommittee was appointed I wondered whether this would lend itself to that kind of treatment I guess by implication this examination by the Reserve Banks is a subcommittee in some sense I don't want to carry this too far And then I assume this is not before the Open Market Committee   It seems to me that we've become prisoners here of our technique I don't think from an overall point of view that we want such a sudden degree of easing [I say that] not because of the dollar, which has importance but is not dominant, but because the impression that would create is that there has been a change in policy It is not going to help us to say that we haven't changed policy and we're following the same targets as before People would perceive the big change in interest rates And I think substantively they would be right; it is a change in policy if we let interest rates drop dramatically So my suggestion would be to try to hold the line at the [present rate] or a little above it and wait for further developments   I think we're in danger of making a great mistake The real policy action is on interest rates, not on the money supply Whatever happens to the money supply over a period of a month has next to no effect on the economy But these interest rates --not only internationally but domestically--convey an impression of a drastic shift in policy and create expectations that we're all for inflation as soon as we work out of this difficulty So, I'd stick with 13 percent   I would agree with that   Scott, I was struck by your emphasis on the good cooperation we have had That certainly has been true in many instances But wouldn't you say that the whole episode of the rise of the dollar several months back and the [subsequent] decline was an instance of different rate intentions and different preferences for up or down on the part of the two central banks and that, therefore, we always had operations in one market but not in the other? On the way up, the Bundesbank held the dollar down in their market and we did little in our own On the way down, we held the dollar up in our market and the Bundesbank did little to keep it from going down So, I draw the lesson from this experience that we ought to move toward somewhat more comprehensive coverage of the markets; each of the central banks should be potentially present in both markets at the [same] time I think that could probably be worked out   What we would do, Tony, is to agree that the central bank that wants the bigger intervention prevails If we are willing to put money on the line to hold the dollar up, the Bundesbank [operates] in Europe It has to be done for our account, but they would do it We would have to agree on a method of communicating with them And if the Bundesbank wants to have the bigger intervention, then they would prevail and we would do [the intervention] for them in New York if necessary, or they could do it directly   Well, I don't think that would be the result of what I suggest But perhaps we should examine this--we can't debate it here--and see if we can make some progress with it   By worthwhile do you mean in terms of likely operations or in terms of a special emergency that might happen?   I don't know how much that would cost but it seems like a good idea to me because what [happens now], as we see, is that we sometimes wake up here and the dollar is down 1 percent and the Bundesbank has done nothing And by that time it is too late to push the dollar back up   That is another aspect of this two-party system We had different reserve objectives We would have liked to pick up some more D-marks The Bundesbank was very unwilling to lose dollars because they were running a current account deficit [and were] worried Nevertheless, the Bundesbank sold a great many dollars and we picked up as many marks as we would have liked We could have arranged this the other way; had we done the D-mark support we would have gotten the marks and the Bundesbank would not have spent the dollars So we did this to some extent by sharing the intervention proceeds, but not fully   So moved   I do think we should have that very firmly set down It could be done in two ways Either we set down all the conditions when we take action now to raise the line; or we do what we sometimes have done in the past, which is to treat an existing line as a framework for discussion, not as a commitment on our part to lend For example, Mexico has a line--what is it, $700 million? Italy has $3 billion and England has $3 billion We take this as a framework for discussion of both the terms and the amounts I don't know what lends itself better in this case They many want to draw very soon and it might make more sense to lay down all the conditions at the start But we shouldn't let it slide and then find that they are about to draw without our having had the chance to make clear what the frame of reference is, as Tony specified I very much agree with him that we need a firm takeout; they have to say that they will go to the Euromarket [even] if conditions in that market are not very propitious when the drawing matures   Well, it seems to me that in terms of conditions we shouldn't discriminate between the Swedes and others I think 90 days is reasonable and renewal for another 90 days is reasonable I'm mainly concerned about a takeout because even though Sweden may be a good risk--it certainly still has a very high rating in the Euromarkets in terms of the spread at which it can borrow--they may for that reason decide to let it go So [the drawing may extend] to 6 months, to 9 months, and to a year That is where we want to be sure that they can't overrun And it can be done very simply by agreeing that they will go to the market to pay it off   This is attributing to the money supply a significance that I see hardly any economists attributing to it The money supply is a means of getting [desired] interest rates People who want a stable rate of money growth want wide fluctuations in interest rates So we can always decide how much interest rate fluctuation we want to have and go from there without subordinating our decisions to the money supply [If] we say that we don't want interest rates to move outside a certain range, then it seems to me that we've made the judgement that interest rates are to prevail up to a certain point   But if the money supply is a means of controlling interest rates, it is a better means than for us to set [interest rates] arbitrarily low, as we have in the past   I'd like to make the opposite case, and in fact express some concern about getting back on track even in December There is at least a good chance that we have had a demand shift and that we would just be pouring in money when [instead] we should have taken account of the diminished demand for money Nobody can say how likely that is at this time There are some indications--and I think it has a rather fair probability--so I'd give it weight Certainly the situation seems to be rather similar to what we had from the fall of '78 through the winter of '79 There was an unexplained shortfall, though not as drastically concentrated in one month; I think we had close to four or five months of negative M1 growth Then, in the spring and summer the aggregates took off For a while we said that was just compensating for the shortfall of the previous six months Suddenly, in August-September we realized what was happening That the aggregates were running away, that it was not a compensatory movement, and that we were going into an accelerated inflation And we took the strong measures of October of last year; even that wasn't enough and we had to do it again So I think the pattern of having a shortfall and then trying to catch up--or allowing the aggregates themselves to catch up--has existed in the past And it seems that it can be very dangerous  Furthermore, under alternative B, M-lA would be growing at 95 percent and under alternative A it would be growing at 76 percent Even if these very high rates of money growth didn't lead to an inflationary situation, which is not likely given that we probably are going into a substantial recession, it nevertheless would be an uncomfortable situatuion to be moving at those rates of speed and then suddenly either in October or January have to turn off the faucet and get back on track [to a path that] would be more consistent with moderate growth In other words, at that time, when the recession would probably be at its deepest, we would be confronted with turning off the faucet and raising interest rates if we were to move as fast as these alternatives imply I would not like to be confronted with  -17-    5/20/80  that calamity We can handle all of this, I think, within our existing target ranges, if we aim at the lower edge I have a rough sense that we should aim [for growth in M-1A] by December at 1-1/4 percentage points lower than the midpoint We would be saving ourselves about 2 percent growth or a little more And taking down the aggregates by that much, [as I've] proposed here, would not get us to very rapid rates of expansion We would not incur the danger of overshooting and would not run the risk of having to confront a sudden change of pace that would raise interest rates   And the associated move in the funds rate If we put in the $850 million regardless--  -31-    5/20/80   With all the concerns I have, I wouldn't want to see interest rates jump up now I think people, at least people abroad, would think that we've really gone haywire   This is the practice of most other central banks They typically, though not always, state ranges; sometimes they aim at the upper end and sometimes they aim at the lower end The Swiss do it differently, but the British, the Canadians, and [unintelligible] use a range   I think Tony Solomon's point about not getting the interest rate below the rate of inflation is relevant, even though we are talking about the funds rate Also, even though I realize all of us don't have a vote on this [Committee], I think you should be aware that the International Monetary Fund in its consultations with the US [representatives] criticized us for the rapid declines in interest rates and also for going to rates that, as they said, are in all probability no longer positive in real terms They said that would seem inappropriate So that is a judgment of technically oriented people who believe that we should not go--   We are members of this institution, and they apply the same rules to everybody   We can't ignore completely what others say of us because there are two sides to every exchange rate--our side and the others This was a judgment that these people made, just as it could be the judgment of other people abroad, [because there are] consequences for the dollar and consequences for inflation   Why don't you let individual members of the Committee call you when they think that Chuck's zone is being approached? And when more than half have called, you can call a consultation  SPEAKER(?) What if he can't be reached, Henry?   I would like to postpone the time when we drop below our checkpoints as long as possible I know that Milton Friedman is tremendously excited about our failing to hit our targets, but I just can't follow him   Yes   They also seem to take the attitude that if we are going to allow the funds rate to move sharply in response to reserve-based techniques, they logically should let the dollar rate respond more I don't think we should accept that argument One could argue just the other way That precisely because it is necessary for us to tolerate wider fluctuations in the funds rate, we want to make a greater effort to avoid repercussions on the dollar    7/9/80  rate We have to try to persuade them of that; they don't accept that now   Even if we are able to repay, which I hope we will be, we won't really be getting out of debt We'd be substituting dollar debt for D-mark debt, which is an advantage But that's really the best way to look [at it] until our current account improves    7/9/80   What about recession?   No, they don't do it   In a sense, every country with a good currency can expect some inflow--in fact, a very large inflow in the aggregate --from these sources The Germans, the Swiss, the French, and the Japanese probably all benefit from this to an extent that they don't seem to want to admit So they've generated concern about their deficits that I think is needless They can count on some financing automatically They don't have to go out and borrow the money   I might say, just to make clear that we are all listening carefully, that I keep hearing about market perceptions that we have moved back to a funds rate objective with a very narrow range Do you hear that?   Could you say that if Congress wants to influence Federal Reserve policy directly that the appropriate way is to do it by legislation rather than resolution? I would expect that [such] legislation would not [be enacted] That is a tough statement But we could be snowed with these resolutions and the pressure--   As far as the forecast is concerned, which I view as very well done, I find myself much closer to the Administration's than to the staff's, certainly for 1981 I think we have to count on a high nominal GNP, quite possibly a good rise in real GNP, and an even higher deflator than either the Administration or the staff have The latter is based on [our past] experience of always tending to underestimate inflation We've had a very patient labor force Outside the strongly unionized sectors wage increases have been very low, and one must anticipate that at some time there will be a concerted push to make up for that We also have to bear in mind that, in a sense, our staff forecast is a formal exercise based on an assumption of a given rise in money supply And that is interpreted optimistically with a 3 percent [demand] shift We have never been successful in sticking by our money supply targets and I fear that the same thing will happen again That means that we have no very clear ceiling on the up side and that there's a real possibility of going to higher rates of inflation and much higher rates of nominal GNP than any of this says  Well, let me just ask one small technical question Jerry, you were skeptical about business fixed investment spending, partly on the grounds of low capacity utilization Isn't there a chance that we are once more overestimating our true capacity, as I think we did the last time round, and that the pressure begins at lower capacity use levels? And secondly, given the high increases in wages that firms [already have implemented] and that seem ahead, isn't it possible that they may put more emphasis on modernization than expansion?   Well, I feel we ought to reduce the ranges for 1980 I realize it looks a little like base drift in fitting the goals to suit the achievements, but the alternative of bringing the achievements back within the ranges that were our goals could be very damaging That would mean a rapid [rate of] increase in the aggregates We'd have to go for a number of months at rates of growth in M-1A, and M-1B even more so, that in the past have been regarded as indicating inflation and perhaps a reversal of our policy We would have to drive interest rates down somewhat further to severely negative rates And then we would have to make a turnabout at some point in order to get back on track; [with money growth] having sharply risen back to track, we'd have to slow it down, thereby suddenly raising interest rates after [previously] having driven them down I think all these gyrations would be damaging, and we are not likely to do them [when needed] We will find ourselves missing or somehow avoiding the very painful issues involved in these interest rate movements So I would favor bringing down the M-1A and M-1B ranges 1/2 point for 1980  For the next year I share the philosophy that we ought to announce a reduction I am very apprehensive that we will be far out of reach with regard to the development of nominal income on one side and the reduced monetary aggregates targets are concerned I see the additional problem of M-1B I, too, would be surprised if there weren't a more rapid switch [to NOW accounts], causing M-1B to increase more rapidly and M-1A to slow It looks as though M-1A is really a diminished, vanishing species as far as most people are concerned And I think perhaps Frank Morris' suggestion of focusing on M2 and M3 for '81 and explaining that under these conditions we cannot be very specific about M-1A and M-1B is a way out We would do what we should do--indicate a reduction; that is what I would recommend But we wouldn't quite trap ourselves in so difficult a situation as we would if we named lower numbers for the M1 aggregates   My response there is that we ought to go to a tax oriented incomes policy I see in the Washington Post today that they are revising--   It just won't die because it's a reasonable suggestion As for a tax cut, if we had the choice, I would postpone it into late '81   Well, M2 is getting more stable In the past it has slowed when interest rates went up Money market mutual funds are likely to go up when [rates rise] so that's a stabilizing element   Would you do that even if the last two months required us to go to some fantastic growth rate, say, 20 percent?   But I understood the consensus to imply that we wouldn't do anything extreme to force M-1A into the range if it happens to grow slowly all the rest of the year except the last couple of months   I think it would look terrible Nobody would remember that we had a shortfall before Besides, they'd say that was just the way things should be It's like somebody who is dieting and has missed a few meals and therefore feels he has to catch up on the caloric quota by eating something extra   In this particular case I think we have had a shift in the demand function   I have one problem with the approach "C" is what I'd like in principle; but the technique of accepting, by raising the path, whatever actual level of reserves is realized does get us back into a federal funds rate target with a very narrow range The market thinks [we're doing] that already, and they're going to have it confirmed if we do it for a second period   Well, if we were to limit the excess over "C" in a plausible way, I could see it   I think it would be helpful if the lower limit were a little higher We're going to be operating as if we were on a funds rate target even though we're not Then at least the market should not get the signal that we've lowered these targets I think they suspect that 8-1/2 percent is the lower limit, so if we went to 9 to 14 percent--   Well, they will know it [for that meeting], but they won't know [what it is] for the future   I wouldn't want them to think we've lowered it and I'd rather not have them think that it is 8-1/2 percent at this point   Well, it increases the perception, or the misperception, that we're operating on a funds rate target   Well, it depends on how one looks at it I share your doubts   If we are too easy now, we'll soon have to face higher lower limits than we do now Suppose the aggregates develop some momentum and then we have to slow them down in the last few months [of the year]   This is a sort of [unintelligible] The short run wasn't very good but one goes along with it and now here comes the second shoe   After all, these longer-run targets are mostly for '80 We're not talking about '81 now?   Do you accept that we will try to lower the ranges but that the announced--   It seems to me that we could say we will work toward lowering the ranges Whether this will be possible and to what extent can only be determined in the light of the circumstances that we meet then That wouldn't be a commitment as far as you're concerned   Inflation would probably rise next year   I can go with that   Is there anything said about the possibility at this time of widening the ranges now that we have to make a statement?    7/25/80   The second question that I would like to ask is Do you think we accomplish our objective by a five-page letter? Would it perhaps be better to have a short piece and then somehow add the rest of the material as an appendix?   Scott, you said that these countries would be quick to support their currencies Do you see any indications that that attitude might change if they go more deeply into recession?   Thank you   I am concerned about the danger of chasing our tail because if excess reserves go up and we say there is this demand for reserves and we have to accommodate it and supply some more, then excess reserves might go up further We would feel impelled to accommodate that again Isn't there a danger that we'll find ourselves involved in supplying more reserves than are needed?   Unless we supply reserves   Isn't it a technique [that resembles] a halfway [move] toward closing the window altogether? If the gap between the funds rate and the discount rate--that is, the penalty-- were large enough, clearly, nobody would borrow And we would be operating purely on nonborrowed reserves   It seems to me that the development President Black describes would imply either that there will be differential wage movements--because we know the movement in the organized sector is for fairly strong increases, the pressures would have to be in the much larger [non-union] sector--or very severe pressures on corporate profits Is there any other place where a decline in interest rates would work or where productivity would [lead to] a decline in prices?  -15-    8/12/80   The dollar could rise   I share John Balles' view that the real sector looks a little better and inflation looks a little worse I think that's a fairly general impression among forecasters I also see two characteristics of our economy that seem to be visible now It has very quick defenses against a sharp downturn, given that the downturn didn't go very fast Automatic stabilizers went into action and seem to have been holding--   That's what I said It caught--   The downturn went fast but didn't go very far It caught itself pretty fast, and we are already beginning to feel the counterforces on the other side That is, interest rates are already beginning to rise, which I think could choke off the expansion In other words, the economy now reacts very quickly on both sides What we have not gotten at all out of the recession is much adjustment There doesn't seem to have been time for much adjustment in corporate balance sheets or household balance sheets I don't think anybody's expectations and behavior patterns are likely to have been changed very much by this experience Not to put too fine a point on it, nobody has gone broke Nobody has been hanging on the cliff for a very long time except some of the thrift institutions In other words, this has been a surprisingly mild recession It is very unlikely to have [set the stage for] much long-term improvement if in fact it now takes off from here It's not likely to change our attention, expectations, or behavior in a favorable direction if [the economy] bottoms out quickly and resumes a modest advance, as seems likely So the conclusion I draw is that this is a situation that calls for continued restraint in order to get some more effect out of the situation   M3 is another of those [variables] that maintains its stability because one [component] goes down and something else goes up, which is a little suspect   I really want to say the same as Dave M-1A is not much good and M2 is not much good Isn't the main argument in favor of M-1A--and the reason why we keep talking about it--that it is used in the model?   Can't we re-program [the model] for M-1B?   There is another guide that we could go to, which is to look at what happened in 1974-75 The impressive experience at that time was that we all underestimated--except maybe your distinguished predecessor by one--the increase in velocity that we were likely to get So, I ask myself Do we see something in the economy that implies a very large increase in velocity? All I can see is that we have had a tremendous experience of very high interest rates and, as someone just said, the economy has learned [from that] As Lyle said, [firms] learned not to borrow at the prime rate plus two percent I think they also learned not to have idle money around with a prime rate of 20 percent So that may be the thing that has triggered a new increase in velocity  -24-    8/12/80   Well, that's simply the result of dividing a falling income by--   Yes, but one has to think about what happens at a constant level of interest rates in order to measure the velocity trend We have to hold the rates constant and then see whether or not there is an increase   Just a comment If we are getting sufficiently frustrated with the aggregates, there is the old standby of real interest rates, after tax We have done a certain amount of work on that now   After tax, real interest rates   I've mentioned it from time to time here I just wanted to tell you that it's available now It has been run through the computer, so perhaps it has acquired a little more--   I want to second John Balles for many of the same reasons [he cited] When we talked about the recession some months ago, it was frequently said that we shouldn't be too tight because of the danger that we might overshoot on the low end Now we see that it's likely, although not certain, that this will be a milder recession than anticipated And that doesn't give me any reason for wanting to go on a more expansionary course I don't see much achieved by the recession so far There have been no great changes in expectations It may well be that a few years from now we will look at this experience as something that was unnecessary because it didn't produce anything except a resumption of inflation from a new higher plateau into new and higher levels I think we're in some [danger] of concluding that because it's reasonable to expect the recovery to be slow we therefore ought to be relatively easy now If we are relatively easy now, we will be prejudicing our policy next year toward being still easier, precisely because the recovery is likely to be slow Finally, as I look at our policy for next year, if we take the hypothetical assumption that we go for the midpoint of the ranges that we've now supplied, which are 1/2 percentage point below this  -32-    8/12/80  year's ranges, that will mean a drastic reduction in the rate of money growth in early 1981 For instance, on M-1A the range is 3 to 5-1/2 percent So presumably we would have to shift to somewhere close to the midpoint of that from what on the present course is [growth of] 7-1/2 percent from the second to the fourth quarter of this year if we go with alternative A If we go with alternative B, we will be shifting to the midpoint of 3 to 5-1/2 percent, or about 4-1/2 percent, from the 6-1/4 percent rate B implied for QII to QIV of 1980 If we look at M-1B a similar picture prevails; the midpoint of its range of 3-1/2 to 6 percent is 4-3/4 percent And we would have to shift to that from 9-1/4 percent [growth] on "A" or 8-1/4 percent on "B" These could be some very drastic changes in course, if we really were to stick by our policy when the economy begins to turn around I would rather minimize the degree of change that we have to introduce-- not go down so far with interest rates now and not have to change their direction so drastically, or else abandon the proposed targets That is why I would go with "B"   If we eliminate those aggregates that misbehave in our view, what kind of credibility do we have?   There has been a great deal of discussion of that abroad, a great deal of exploration of that in the market and an interpretation of our actions So, I think if they smoked out that we are willing to let the funds rate go to 8 percent on average, that would be regarded as a clear signal that we have eased   Well, if they understood the process correctly But since they always look at the interest rate anyway--   It's 8 percent and $75 million on the one and 8-1/2 percent and $100 million on the other We are not offered anything "better" than that?   I didn't vote   Peter, when you made that adjustment of $150 million to the nonborrowed reserves target, what determined the decision to make it that amount and not $100 million or $200 million or some other number? This had to do with the overrun on the total reserves so, of course, by that decision you were determining the level of borrowing The level of borrowing again determines the funds rate So I'm trying to understand the structure of this reasoning   Do you use a monthly model or do you use some relationship between the funds rate and the level of borrowing?   Yes, but by forcing them to borrow more, we are raising the funds rate And the question here is Are we in that more distant sense back on a funds rate target?    9/16/80   I'm not saying that this was not the best way of coping with it But conceptually, for instance, one could say that for every dollar of overrun on total reserves we will reduce the nonborrowed not by $50, not by $150, but by $10 Well, that would have produced massive borrowing and the funds rate would have shot up Presumably that wouldn't have been a very good decision with the reason being that one shouldn't disturb the markets unnecessarily It's a question of how much of a disturbance to markets one is willing to accept in order to get closer to the total reserves path   That's for certain   But we really do have to look at what Frank Morris pointed to, the behavior of interest rates You don't like the behavior of aggregates Interest rates have been the one thing that    9/16/80  have been even more volatile And I think that since the mechanism works through these interest rates, we really have had more leverage in what we have done   But by having interest rates collapse as dramatically as they did, don't you think that we did a good deal to shorten the recession? Housing must have come back somewhat earlier and some other things may have come back earlier than they would have had we let interest rates go down gradually the way we otherwise normally would have done   If we do something along those lines, I would urge that it include an effort to see if we can't systemize the periodic adjustments in the path and find some way to appraise what the likely effect will be of [making adjustments of] $100 million or $200 million or whatever   The economy seems to be coming around much faster than expected This could be for one of many reasons, which could be very hard to disentangle I'd like to get your reaction One would be that the automatic stabilizers are stronger than we think, that the budget goes into a bigger deficit faster, and other such events Another might be that our interest rate policy has been particularly effective A third might be that the economy is just so inflation jittery that after people catch their breath they rush out and try to beat the game again But in any event, we do seem to have  -14-    9/16/80  gained a responsiveness to upward factors and lost a responsiveness to downward factors I'd like to get your thoughts on that  Now, with respect to tax policy, I'd just say that if the economy is stronger than expected, interest rates presumably will be higher Monetary policy in some sense would be tighter A tax cut will make fiscal policy easier So we would be moving exactly in the wrong direction on the fiscal/monetary policy mix--toward tighter monetary policy and an easier budget stance That's just the opposite of what a growth-oriented economy should have   This few months of weakness that you set out as a possibility Could you visualize that going to the extent of GNP growth turning negative again?   It fluctuates cyclically, doesn't it? That is to say, at the beginning of a recovery velocity increases more   I was thinking without rising interest rates At constant interest rates, velocity tends to increase more at the beginning of a recovery The explanation would be that people have accumulated some liquidity and some idle funds   Well, we're not looking at the substantial additional deficits from the off-budget agencies, which are now moving toward $20 billion Then there's the borrowing by the sponsored agencies, which also is on the order of $20 billion I don't know if it's fair to throw that one in, but surely one has to add the off- budget agencies to the $61 or $62 billion   Well, we had the luxury, relatively speaking, of moving back on track at an even faster rate than we had decided some months ago Now we face the question of whether we want to overshoot the track or take the wrench of getting back on it firmly I think we ought to get on it firmly The economy once more is giving us less unemployment and more inflation It's painful to think that we are going to move to a mortgage rate of 13-1/2 or 14-1/2 percent, but in an economy with 10, 11, 12 percent inflation, we are going to have to get adjusted to that, bad as it may seem The economy probably will adjust more easily to it than [we expect] in our gut reactions So, I wouldn't be too worried about letting rates rise Alternative B seems about right to me I would like to see the funds rate move a little higher toward the upper end, [though] not immediately; we need to pause before it goes to 14 percent And I would like to place more emphasis on M-1B When M-1A and M-1B diverge as much as they do now, that indicates to me that the factors that differentiate them have gained in importance And one is in some danger of losing sight of that if one thinks more in terms of M-1A, with its seemingly rather low growth values If one thinks in terms of M-1B, one gets to fairly respectable rates of growth even under alternative B So I would like to stress M-1B, at least in our thinking if not in the directive, instead of M-1A   Do you mean that we should then reduce the nonborrowed reserve path or not reduce it? If the aggregates are weak, I think the analogue to our earlier action would be to reduce the path   Neutrality has many meanings   That's really the old funds rate technique in an aggregates version That is, we immediately allow the funds rate to respond to any change in the aggregates   Yes, but [the aggregates have been growing] at higher rates than compatible with the guidelines And we're within them because we're making up for a large shortfall So if we continue at this rate of speed, we're going to overshoot Our question is precisely Do we want to get back on track by making a slight bend or a significant bend in the rate of growth?   You're not including August?   Even though I would like the consequences of that action, I don't think it is a good principle I didn't think it was a good principle when we did it [when monetary growth was] on the way up, so I shouldn't like it on the way down It's really getting back to a funds rate target   Okay, but [unintelligible] a given rule Given that option, I'm not proposing to go back to that   In that case, wouldn't it be helpful if we raised the lower limit of the funds rate?  -54-    9/16/80   Do you see any systematic move to diversify out of D-marks or is this footloose money that moves around all the time?   I'd like to point to a broader matter I [will try to] be very brief We may be facing a situation we had early this year [when] the dollar was very strong--this time not so much because our interest rates are rising as they did at that time but because the mark is weak And we may find ourselves either having the dollar go up or with a possibility of accumulating a fair amount of D-marks Now, last time we operated so as to allow the dollar to run up pretty far; it came down again We had a very pronounced upward and downward trip which did no particular good We didn't accumulate or gather in for repayment a very large amount, although we did do some but over time We didn't pay all [our mark indebtedness] off and we could have done so at that time Now the question really is If similar conditions develop, and there's no assurance that they will, should we follow the same strategy or should we follow a different strategy? That is, should we lean harder against the wind, which in this case would mean not just to gather in [marks] to pay off debt but to accumulate some reserves which might be split with the Treasury or be all for the Treasury or all for us There's a problem of risk in financing to be considered But I believe we should think ahead a little and not just leave it to the developments of the day    10/21/80   No We wouldn't be forcing it back down It's just that as it goes up we would accumulate some D-marks And if it doesn't come back down, which is highly possible, then we would have built up some reserves and we would have slowed down the movement, which I think is desirable in any event   The situation has become more and more disagreeable as our interest rates rise above German rates and we pay our interest rate for borrowing in D-marks They pay the D-mark rate Now, the expected gain and loss--I fundamentally agree with Tony that over time inflation will have its way on exchange rates--in the short run, of course, is very unpredictable So one can't be sure that the surrender of the profit and loss sharing will have the "expected effect" But that just means that one focuses on the gain in interest from switching to the D-mark rate instead of the dollar interest rate   Well, there is a--   At the very abstract level, there is reason to think that the difference in interest rates equals the expected exchange rate change, because why would anybody hold a currency if he can make 3 percent more in another currency unless he fears that he loses at least 3 percent going in?   That means inflation is part of the basic [calculation] Inflation differentials tend to equal interest rate differentials and inflation differentials also tend to equal expected exchange rate movements If you can swallow these abstractions, which are tremendous ifs, then you'd have a very neat pattern where the return on every currency is--   Exactly   You're making a very modest proposal   Well, it gives the impression that $500 million is a lot of money in this particular game, whereas actually if the market should be weak for the D-mark we could use up a good part of that in a day   In one sense I think that is almost certain because we helped to change income That's Lyle's case We have changed income by letting interest rates fall so sharply; we probably contributed to the recovery It changed income again So that mechanism has been in play Now on your mechanism, the lag in money demand to interest rates, I just don't know about the evidence We used to say it was six months to get the full effect, wasn't it?  -17-    10/21/80   And you've shortened it now considerably   I'm not sure that we have been using M-1B primarily and not M-1A, but I do think there are weighty reasons why we should downgrade M-1A There are substantial shifts into NOW and ATS accounts The indications that we get from M-1A are clearly biased So I would say that in the future we should look more at M-1B There are some [financial flows] coming into M-1B that are not coming out of M-1A   Well, as I look at the state of the economy, it seems to me that we have a lot of unpaid bills accumulated We've been through five years of expansion with a lot of inflation and other distortions and hardly any of that has been paid off--corrected or expiated, if you will We've had no reduction in inflation We've had no significant restoration of consumer demand The consumer has been overbought because of inflation and is coming around slowly We've had no restructuring of balance sheets It's hard to believe that after five years of expansion the distortions could be corrected, so to speak, in one quarter of recession Now, we didn't expect that kind of short recession We may have it The forecast that we have-- and it has changed quite significantly from last time--seems to say that we have more GNP now and we'll get less GNP next year At the end of next year we'll have about the same level of unemployment and GNP as we would have had if we had traced an alternative path with the recession continuing through 1980 and then a more rapid recovery I'm not sure whether this new path is as adequate in terms of corrections as the previous one because we seem to be treating as a gain the rise in the [third] quarter and maybe in the fourth quarter as something to be defended by our monetary policies We can't latch onto that I think we have a bigger correction, unfortunately, to go through We may be dragging it through 1981 with an almost zero rate of growth That is why I conclude that we have to accept a degree of financial discipline There just is no interest rate level that is both noninflationary and pleasant to live with in terms of the demand effects that it has If we're going to go to interest rate levels-- and I always think of interest rates as being established of course by money supply targets--so if we go to money supply targets to produce interest rates that will make the present situation livable and pleasant and make for expansion, I think we're building in more inflation for the future We're moving from an uncorrected base My inclination, therefore, continues to be to lean on the hard side of the aggregates   After tax   If we do that, aren't we saying "A," but doing "B" in effect? It seems very close to that because--   It's the borrowing level that really influences market conditions and, therefore, eventually money   If we look at the averages, we have to look not only at what is happening now but what has gone on before When we look at a 6-month period, the third and fourth quarters, we will have had a very strong rise I don't think one should say the third quarter is over, we're now looking at the fourth quarter only, and we can't accept a risk of near zero on M-1A We have to merge the two periods But I do share the view that we need not focus too closely on what happens between now and the end of the year on the aggregates We really ought to look further ahead in order to get a reasonable period over which these things evolve What matters to me mostly is the stance with respect to the real sector in that we have a very inflationary situation Several people have pointed to possible shocks that we might get from oil and other sources And we haven't run any of that out I'm not arguing for a recession, but I think we have to restrain this economy a little longer   We aborted the recession   Well, I'm less concerned about the money supply targets than about the borrowing level I said previously that one can do one thing and say the other, and I'm perfectly willing to compromise along those lines But in terms of the market, I think the interest rate is the crucial thing now   It's just that I don't believe the present situation is consistent with severely negative real rates after tax We're going to have an inflationary--   Some people don't pay taxes and some people take the standard deduction So this doesn't go across the board, but there has to be some allowance for taxes   I think you're looking [at this situation] with an assumption that there is a painless solution   And the only painless solution is more inflation   I'd go with alternative A, $15 billion   Scott, you made a number of very interesting observations I just want to check on how to interpret them One, you said we bought as many marks as we possibly could Was there really in some sense a restraint on how much we could do? Why couldn't we have done more?   My second question You said the dollar might have been driven to levels that would have been perceived as unsustainable without this intervention Do you have any thoughts as to what these levels might have been?   I also noted that you said we helped other countries hold their interest rates down I believe that is right and I believe intervention can have that function And it's an important effect I just want to argue that one can't trade off intervention for interest rates very far, though there is some such effect    11/18/80   And finally, were you satisfied with the amount of foreign support you got and their maintenance of orderly markets once the dollar dropped sharply and then recovered sharply?   Well, with respect to the dollar, I think we have to aim at a happy mean We want a strong dollar because it helps on inflation We don't want it to get so strong that we're not competitive We've had considerable appreciation in real terms And as far as the accumulation of reserves is concerned, in the long run I think we have to become like other countries and rely on owned reserves, not on the swaps that others can deny us the use of And we ought to be building up some reserves gradually   That is for monetary policy reasons not because they made decisions about reserves I think we ought to bear in mind first Tony's point that--   I think gains and losses in the exchange market have to be evaluated including the interest that one earns On one side if we have D-marks, as Tony says, the chances are that in the long run the D-mark will be stronger than the dollar, but we will have lower interest earnings on that On the other hand, if we owe D-marks, having drawn on the swap, say, that is an adverse position because the D-mark may appreciate If we pay interest in D-mark terms, we would be benefitting from that So the interest to some extent counteracts the risk factor insofar as the risk factor is based on purchasing power parity considerations, which will not work out exactly in the long run Also, I would like to remind you that other countries have enormous reserves The Germans still have, I think, $40 billion; they had $50 billion plus The Japanese have $20 billion They all take a great risk because these reserves are mostly in dollars, which from their perspective have depreciated, giving them losses We have a very large gold stock Every time the gold price moves, we are becoming richer or poorer We [never] pay any attention to that, and rightly so But let us not say that we are without exchange risks from the movement [in the value] of our financial assets   I would like to add to what Scott said about the purposes of intervention There are those two reasons he mentioned One is countering disorder, not maintaining order; we sometimes say it is countering disorder Disorder this time seems to be mostly on the way up whereas in the past it usually was encountered on the way down There is also accumulating for future needs And I would say that forming a reserve is provided for in that But the main qualification is that it has to conform with article IV, paragraph something, of the IMF articles of agreement And that gives a fairly wide degree of latitude for intervention in conditions of floating [exchange rates] It specifies mostly what one is not prepared to do, such as driving the exchange rate   Erratic fluctuations, yes   I think the basic objection is that we would be throwing away information, even if it's not very good information We can always filter that There's a great deal of research on whether one should throw away information just because it's not very good The answer is to filter it and give it little weight We may be  -17-    11/18/80  giving too much weight to the weekly data, but to throw them away totally just reduces the accuracy of the steering mechanism   I can't see how one can believe in markets and then try to avoid supplying information, however [questionable it is]   Well, that gives excessive weight to the achievement of the target for the rest of the year I think it would be much better just to adjust the path for the next year rather than [to try] to reach a particularly low base in order to avoid base drift   Different aggregates have overshot or not overshot in different degrees   It seems to me that the picture we are facing is one in which the economy has been a great deal stronger than we expected But we also now face the prospect of a greater degree of weakness hereafter resulting from this strength In other words, it puts somewhat of a ceiling on the development of the economy if it becomes really strong temporarily and that raises interest rates to levels that will push the economy down again I would not try to counteract the prospective dip in the economy, if that is what might happen in the first quarter I think we ought to look further ahead into the future, both with regard to the real sector and the monetary aggregates Now, I think the chances of a repetition of the second quarter of 1980 are very slight, even if interest rates don't go down as sharply as they did then I doubt that the economy will suffer anything like that But the chances of a severe drop in interest rates are there again And if we [allow] that a second time--if interest rates go up and then go down again in a yo-yo fashion--we will be accused, reasonably, of destabilizing interest rates beyond what is necessary Our new techniques do imply that interest rates will be more volatile, and that's the way the economy is kept on track under these conditions But we shouldn't yield to that tendency of the system very much  So far as the aggregates are concerned, my inclination would be to try to get back on track in the first quarter of 1981 but not in the present quarter, even if that were possible by a drastic wrench But at the same time, I'd try to limit the interest rate implications of that The interest rate implications of just saying we are going to get back on track in early 1981 might be to allow interest rates to drop quite far if the economy is weak I would say we should aim at a relatively reasonable growth path from here on out; something between "A" and "B" might do it if we want to be back on track with M-1B in the first quarter, but not with the interest rates specifications of "A" or "B" The interest rate specifications of "C" give us a chance, if interest rates tend to go down sharply, at least to review the situation and not to accept the slide willy-nilly as we did in the second quarter   I don't feel very strongly about the 19 percent [upper limit for the funds range] It just seems to me that we should not make the range too narrow   I have a concern about the lower limit And 18 percent [for the upper limit] would be just as well   We determine the funds rate; that determines the borrowing, and that determines the nonborrowed, I think  -31-    11/18/80   That's the unspoken sequence   It's a small open economy   You said earlier that we ought to think more about the deviations from the targets and the response to that than about the absolute targets, and I thought that very persuasive So an important ingredient of this decision seems to be where do we go with the funds rate if [monetary growth] falls below or goes above Now, one way of not capping but flooring the rate on the down side would be to set a rather high [level for the lower] limit, and I suggested 14 percent Another might be to say accept a shortfall in the aggregates I am not quite sure what that implies in terms of the funds rate, really   After taxes fourteen is negative in real terms for those people who pay taxes I am being told that there are many people who don't pay taxes and take the standard deduction or have no profits, so one has to take both things into account I think the rates are almost there but not quite   I think we ought to go slowly I differentiate between 14 and 17 percent, and I would hesitate to go above that Let's look toward next quarter and try to get on a [path] that will get us back on track Then we will [unintelligible]   I'd be willing to go to 17 percent [for the upper limit of the funds rate range] provided the 13 goes to 14 My concern is more with the lower limit than the upper limit   Why not do it my way?   Well, I was prepared to go to 19 percent last time, so I certainly would be willing to go to 18 percent It seems to me that we are not getting the pressures on the financial institutions or markets that we got last time around [when rates] approached these heights I think Governor Schultz is very right that people are learning to live with these rates because they are not really [biting after tax] We have waited long enough for the [unintelligible] effects, and they may still come But as I say, I think we do have to move now at the minimum to 18 percent   Mr Chairman, it seems to me that we took one type of action yesterday, which was an effort to be consistent We shouldn't back away from taking further action that would be consistent--that is, to raise the upper limit Now, [if] it's true that the aggregates are slowing and may be coming down, then there isn't going to be any effect On the other hand, if they are as relentless and they continue to go up, we wouldn't have lost several days' time in making that move [I'd prefer that] we go up I presume we will have to make that move anyway   It seems to me it is a logical and consistent action to have a discount rate increase and then to follow that up with an increase in the funds rate range   The gap closes gradually; it doesn't close all at once But it certainly diminishes We took a large step yesterday; I don't see why we should back away from a small and possibly quite inconsequential step now   Well, it certainly [would] be appropriate next week I would much rather take it now   Is it your thought that by letting it remain undefined, that it might actually go higher than it would go if we set a limit of, say, 19 percent?   But [not] on a daily basis, a weekly basis   Mr Chairman, just to clarify my position I don't think it makes a great deal of difference in terms of the rates likely to be achieved The time period is very short, to be sure But it does seem to me that one of our problems has been a lack of firm consistency on [timing] And that is what we could demonstrate here We made one move; we make another move It is not a very risky or damaging move and I think it would enhance our posture   Well, it means that we take a move that is logically consistent with the previous move And what we sought to [accomplish] would be missing in the record if we don't take it   Even that aggressive?   When we moved only one percentage point [on the discount rate]?   We have the warehouse limit   No, it goes against our limit on their credit lines with us   Yes, on how much we would lend the Treasury for warehousing purposes   That's on DM, but it isn't our total limit on all balances of all kinds   It might be tipping our hand if we published that month by month   It's US totals, $8411 billion   Well, I agree very much with what Tony has said I would add that we are really in a very abnormal situation We are no longer a unique country We are not pegged to gold and have others pegged to us We are one of a group of countries whose currencies float We are the only one that has virtually no reserves; we are the only one dependent on borrowing the reserves whenever we need them And we have seen that that borrowing can be denied or subjected to conditions So simply in terms of normalizing our situation in a worldwide float [regime], I think we ought to move toward getting reserves The immediate prospect may well be that we would be accumulating reserves That's what we are talking about because the dollar is strong If the dollar were weak, there would be little point in talking about accumulation But here we do have the opportunity and perhaps the desirability of slowing down that movement That depends on how the domestic economy goes A very extreme case of a country that doesn't want to intervene is the United Kingdom where they are going to sky-high rates that are killing their export industries, because from a monetary policy point of view they can't afford to intervene     Well, that's a situation that would not affect us We certainly can sterilize the liquidity generated by intervention I think it would be wise to avoid the situation that the British are in--a country with a high inflation rate being driven to very high exchange rates and then for the accumulated two reasons, losing competitiveness in exports We can't, of course, control the rate There is no question of that But we can moderate the movement and moderate the extremes  A further point we have not noted is that we've gone to a monetary control system that produces wide interest rate fluctuations That means it produces wide exchange rate fluctuations It would be desirable to have the means of compensating for that in some degree if we are going to inflict this interest rate and exchange rate instability on ourselves and the rest of the world, which I think we have to Intervention is a natural way of [reducing] the consequences marginally, obviously not totally Now, we might have losses on a portfolio of accumulated balances That is always a fear If we buy as the dollar appreciates, that danger is less We are buying foreign currency cheap It may turn out not to have been cheap So one must not ignore that risk But I'd like to remind you that we have a risk on the domestic portfolio, too A few years ago I believe we computed that the then-loss on the portfolio was on the order of $2 billion I wonder what it is now; presumably it's no less than that So we have lived with that situation without a great concern and I think the loss on the foreign exchange portfolio would be a great deal more moderate, given the kind of balances we are talking about   We can diversify our own portfolio if we want to even in proportion to the SDR, although that's 40 percent dollar now so we have to focus on the non-dollar part of the SDR But the SDR does contain currencies we are not likely to want to intervene in So I would say we ought to diversify a portfolio in terms of yen, marks, and Swiss francs, which are the principal currencies we have intervened in, and we probably ought to broaden our scope of  -18-    12/18-19/80  intervention to the smaller currencies to the extent that those markets can take it And we would get some of the protection that you have in mind, Chuck   I do think that the diversification argument is very important, and we ought perhaps to build that in from the start so that we not only have limits on [individual] currencies but an [instruction to] the manager I don't think one can be rigid about it because it might make one buy currencies that one doesn't want   There is an issue in terms of the [overall] magnitude of balances; we should remember that we have a limit on the overall open position--that is our total risk exposure--of $8 billion So at one time we must have contemplated being in debt [to that extent]   So I think one has to see the limits we have put on the [individual] balances in the light of that limit we have already set for overall risks  -22-    12/18-19/80   No, I'm just saying once we have decided that we can afford to be in debt up to $8 billion, we shouldn't be too worried--if we say we can take the risk of $8 billion--about having $4 billion   No, I mean we are talking about $4 billion in balances now   [It's $1-1/2 billion] for D-marks and $500 million for other [currencies]   Excuse me, Bob I don't understand the concept underlying the midpoint base That's not really the route on which we'd be going You'd have the aggregates expanding rather fast from a level at which they are not So they would not actually, with respect to the future, expand that fast   I think we should make every effort to avoid a replay of 1980, with a sharp drop in interest rates which misleads everybody as to what our policy is, and then probably a replay of what happened this fall I don't think there is a way of forming meaningful expectations in that environment because if we have a weakening of the economy in the first quarter or first half, as I would expect, then the aggregates will slow and interest rates will come down And a few hundred monetarists in some sectors of the press will say that we are tightening terribly, but the other 220 million people will perceive this as an easing because they can get credit again at lower rates and they will say the Fed has given up So I think we have to let the facts speak rather than bank on generating expectations I would say, therefore, that we should undershoot our targets, whatever targets we set, if necessary; to do otherwise would mean to force in reserves and to push down interest rates sharply That doesn't mean we shouldn't have some decline in interest rates, just not anything like what we had in 1980 That would also have a beneficial effect as far as the dollar is concerned The dollar wouldn't make that down-trip to the extent it did and that, in turn, would have some beneficial result with respect to inflation, although I think the gains for inflation from a high dollar are not all that strong The reason is that the price of oil is fixed in dollars, unfortunately, and [the value of] the rest of our imports isn't very large I think we should look very closely at interest rates and use them to monitor the meaning of the aggregates I have a suspicion that the way we are doing things now we are getting in our own way by generating a cyclical movement in interest rates and monetary aggregates--so-called instrument instability And the level of interest rates is one way of judging what it is we are really doing-- provided, of course, that we look at real interest rates  As to the strategies to follow, I would lean toward 1 or 4 Those are the tight strategies I'm aware that these are going to be very different from what the Administration is going to present, both the current Administration and also very likely the next one And they are very different from what the market thinks about 1981 So we may have a problem reconciling that in our Humphrey-Hawkins presentation with what the Administration is proposing, which is something we have to do under the Humphrey-Hawkins rules  As for the techniques, [accepting] base drift versus starting at the midpoint, I have a sense that we are not likely to get the full shift in demand that is implied in our projections We may get some We may get all, but if we don't, these targets are going to be extraordinarily tight because they are predicated on getting the full 3 percentage point shift Now, tolerating a bit of base drift here may be an antidote Otherwise, if we don't get the shift, the straightforward thing to do--if it weren't so devastating in terms of expectations--would be to raise all of our aggregates by a couple of percentage points or whatever the shift implies for M-1A and M-1B I would hate to do that We have here a means of equivocating a little If we do move from the old base, the last quarter '79 base, it means that the present targets would involve slightly higher rates of growth, but not as sharply higher as those in Bob Black's first chart For instance, M-1A of 3 to 5-1/2 percent would become under that calculation 43 to 5-1/2 percent; and M-1B instead of 3-1/2 to 6 percent would become 55 to 68 percent These, I think, are reasonable to tolerate If we do raise the M2 target, however, then I  -43-    12/18-19/80  would say we don't have that much leeway to tolerate past overshoots and perhaps then we'd better go back to the old base and try to grow from the midpoint as Bob Black's charts suggest  Again, I think we have to put more weight on interest rates than on the aggregates My preferred aggregate is still M-1B; it conceptually makes the most sense But it will be looking pretty bad and its interpretation will be enormously difficult I think we should simultaneously state M-1A as a compromise, but neither inspires any reliability M2 inspires little reliability I've never felt that was a very good indicator Bank credit isn't going to be a good indicator because the share of bank credit in total credit is going to fall drastically, according to the flow of funds analysis, from something like 40 percent of total funds raised to something like 20 percent of total funds raised This has to do with the bunching of credit recently at banks as a result of a drop in bond issues and a drop in the use of commercial paper So bank credit, too, may not be a good indicator One is left with the idea that we need positive real interest rates; that idea is gaining ground internationally and I think we ought to move in that direction Thank you, Mr Chairman   Sorry, I was obscure I would say that if we don't raise the M2 target, then I would accept base drift If we raise the M2 target and make that very conspicuous, then I would have second thoughts about accepting the base drift   Mr Chairman, it seems to me that the directive has to take account of two contingencies One is that the economy may continue strong; the other is that it may weaken If it continues strong then it needs restraint, and that means a higher funds rate-- higher than it is now If it weakens, it doesn't need much of an increase in the money supply because interest rates will go down anyhow Our main concern will be to slow that decline So I would go for a higher range on the funds rate than we have here, maybe 17 to 22 percent And I'd go for a low rate of increase in the money supply I think that meets both contingencies--if the economy weakens or if it remains strong   Well, we didn't follow a practice like that this last time I'd rather have the number there so that we understand what we mean   I think in principle it's a good formulation because it says there has to be some compromise when we're not meeting the target on the aggregates and having a movement in interest rates   It's too high to me   Just to make sure I understand you, the quarterly precision results imply that one goes off one month or two but in the third month one returns to track If one stays off track and comes back later than the third month, then there are more perceptible effects on the real sector Is that right?   How do we make that need to get back within the quarter, as it were, consistent with the [great] uncertainty--the very large standard error within a month of plus or minus 10 percent--if we really don't know in the first month where we are?   Well, that was one of the things we learned That the lags are shorter   If the procedure has had a defect, in my mind it has been the excessive volatility of interest rates Given the biases that I have, I've been more concerned about the rapid decline [in rates] in the second quarter of last year than about the way they got up to 20 percent on two occasions And now that I hear from Mr Axilrod that apparently the sharp drop in the second quarter didn't have much of an economic repercussion--that the quick revival of the economy was largely the work of the real sector and perhaps the credit control removal, not the drop in interest rates as I had thought--   Well, I think the reason rates dropped so sharply clearly was due to the new techniques And had we stuck by the new techniques firmly and stuck on the path, rates would have dropped a good deal more   Okay Well, in that case I have to say that, in my opinion, we wouldn't have moved from 20 percent to 10 percent in that quick succession any more than we would have moved up from 12 percent or so to 20 percent So I think what we need is more observation of interest rates But I'd be more concerned about sudden drops than about the increases we have had so far Of course, we could have increases that would worry one But the way I look at interest rates, as you know, is that they are not really high after taxes   [Yes] Now, as a technique improvement, I would say it would be worthwhile to go to a contemporaneous reserve--   I would say that we should not go back to the old technique of targeting on the funds rate because I've seen us not do enough or not act on a timely enough basis in the past The technique we have now forces our hand I would add that we might be well advised to publish our directive immediately under the new procedures, but I guess that's a separate topic also   Paul, could I suggest a topic--probably not a very popular one? I suggest we consider whether we want to publish the directive immediately   I'm very much impressed by the continual criticism in the press and the market that we have changed our policy They say the Fed has eased or the Fed has tightened and actually we've  -49-    2/2-3/81  done nothing at all I think we could defuse that by stating it in the policy record right away instead of 30 days later when nobody reads it   I think the main disadvantage of the band is that it gives some people a justification for saying that we're really targeting on interest rates Since I don't believe that that's the case, I think that's a wrong criticism But I think the usefulness of the band exceeds the advantage of defusing their criticism If one were to defuse it, there would be some other criticism   Well, that's an interesting suggestion   Well, Nancy, I agree with that But at the same time I recognize that the main volatility that carries into long- term interest rates comes from inflation and not from our procedures because it is very implausible that we should be changing our policy  -54-    2/2-3/81 -55-  from month-to-month even though that gets written up in various market comments   It hasn't been so bad either   Yes   Well, doesn't the borrowing begin two weeks earlier under this system so that the adjustment comes faster?   Well, it's a dilemma We can say that we've got all the instruments now to achieve the degree of money control that we really want, say, over three months, so why improve the techniques? But I think this is a speeding up It may reduce interest rate variability because certainly in the absence of an action by the Desk it seems to have been econometrically demonstrated that there is more instability of interest rates when we're up against fixed reserve requirements than when we're up against requirements that we can modify slightly during the week in question If that continues to hold--and I don't know if that's still the view--then I think there is quite a payoff   [Yes, under] contemporaneous because, in the lagged case, there's a given amount of reserves that the banking system must get if the Fed doesn't supply them Then the excess reserves have to be worked down to zero, in effect, and carryovers are created Whereas if the banks are able by reducing their reservable liabilities to reduce the amount of reserves required--   Is the reason we don't have to estimate the demand function that the volume of the money can adjust during the period?   Not me   I'm wounded!   They're mostly controllable by controlling the economy   You know there is the result--   I would have thought M1 had some independent impact   I think we did that once before and we found that the non-M1 components in M2 did not contribute anything to the relationship of M1 and income   Well, we're under challenge to prove that we're sticking by our guns It seems perfectly obvious to us that we are We announce our targets a year ahead; we meet only every five or six weeks and we then publish a record so anybody who wants to inform himself can see clearly that we haven't changed our targets Nevertheless, if you read the market reports--I try to read as many as I can and the most troublesome that I know of is Eric Heineman's of Morgan Stanley--they continually say that the Fed once more has given up on inflation Three months later he finally discovers that the Fed seems to have decided that they will fight inflation after all That sewage flows into the--  SPEAKER(?) Remember, we can't go back to--  -82-    2/2-3/81   How do we prove that we haven't changed our mind?   I think somewhat different, yes For one thing he always uses existing material, including our policy record and the discount rate proceedings in full detail He reprints them to fill about half of his letter And he's not the only one who for need of something to write says that the Fed doesn't know what it is doing, or doesn't know what it wants and changes policy almost continuously I think we could do something to defuse that I recognize that the cost of this is quite considerable For one thing, we might get much more of an immediate reaction from the Congress, for instance, to anything that looks like a rise in interest rates For another, it's only on this technique--if we don't emphasize interest rates--that we can publish immediately Under the old technique, with [emphasis on] the federal funds rate, we would have tipped off the market on what we were going to do over a month and the market possibly would have taken it to the next stage That danger still exists with a [federal funds rate] band if they see the band is not now 12 to 18 percent but 11 to 17 percent They might say the midpoint has moved and so the funds rate is going to move and they might do that right away So, I see a considerable cost, but I still think it's worth considering, and I lean toward doing it   Some [did]   Well, look at what other central banks do  SPEAKER(?) He said "Roosfully"   We are very much on the defensive We operate, as it were, trying not to show our hand The Bundesbank, which is a very strong central bank, calls a press conference every time they've done something worth talking about They explain very clearly what they are doing   Well, it has worked well for many, many years And I don't think it has to do with their present problem They're not afraid of their government and they're not afraid of their legislature And they do inform the market   Well, I guess they are an independent central bank   Well, there's a difference between uncertainty and ignorance You want to give the most information, but it will still leave the distant future uncertain   Yes, but these might both be well-informed opinions They could still end up being different   Well, it seems logical that one should make as good a judgment as one can And that really implies also as good a judgment as one can of the policy outcome, not the policy intentions The forecast here in the Greenbook is severely constrained by what may well be an unrealistic outlook And we have a chance here to be as realistic as we can   I try to be realistic   Well, I made my projection on the expectation of some overshoot of M1, whichever we choose, because while a shift in the demand function is perhaps probable, it may not be so large and it certainly is not assured Even so, I think it will imply very considerable restraint We wouldn't overshoot unless interest rates were pressing us very hard, so I arrive at a rather adverse conclusion on the real GNP On inflation, traditionally we have undershot our probabilities So, given that during the year some bad things surely are going to happen--more food problems, more oil problems--and no good things, one has to expect not a further rise in the CPI but probably a rise in the deflator On unemployment, although it's a very unhappy projection to make, I think unless unemployment is high, price increases aren't going to slow and wage increases aren't going to slow We have no magic way of getting from a low growth of the money supply to lower wages and lower prices, except via low capacity utilization and high unemployment; and, of course, that in turn is achieved by high interest rates These all are very unpleasant things to contemplate and that's why I decided I'd put them down I think I am among some of the excluded outliers here   I would rather have the lower target and at least have a chance of making the right effort But I would remind the Committee that we probably will have base drift I don't know what we're going to base the range for 1981 on, presumably on the fourth quarter of 1980 If so, I have the impression that that includes for all but M-1A base drift of about 2-1/2 percentage points Now, that's a very substantial step-up Maybe I've done my numbers wrong, but I think we have to add that to the level of the aggregates as stated over the year in order to see what they really would be if we had started a year ago--that is, at the end of 1979   I believe they raised the interest rate level lately   Isn't base drift from the midpoint and not from the edge?   We'll have some base drift anyway over two years that at least offsets or more than offsets the reduction--   Bob Black to some extent has made my speech for me because I, too, think that the seeming severity of these targets is somewhat modified by the base drift Now, the base drift could be figured from the midpoint Then it would have been, I think, 1-1/2 points for M-1A and M-1B; I was wrong yesterday in saying it was 2-1/2 points because I didn't take into account the revised numbers in the footnote On M2 I think it's 2-1/4 points, if you start from the edge of the band, assuming that we allow ourselves leeway at least up to the edge of the band There's still a little leeway, 1/4 point, on M-1A and M-1B, and 1 percent on M2 So what we do in the way of pulling down under either alternative I or II we undo by this base drift It's true that this is money that went into the economy in 1980 and it isn't going to go in hereafter But Chuck Partee yesterday made the point that getting back on track really means running below track for a while if we have been above track So the Partee integral, as it were--money under that curve--is stabilized By the same principle, I think we have to look at the overshoot I am somewhat encouraged by reading that on our new money demand function these projections really involve an upward shift of the curve, even though they involve an expectation of a downward shift on the old curve In other words, we would have a fair reason to expect that shift for M-1A and M-1B I'm not happy with M2, and I would suggest  -116-    2/2-3/81  pulling that down It's true that we really can't control it very well; maybe controlling the economy is the only way of controlling M2 But I fear that it's going to be our one reliable guide if M-1A and M- 1B behave peculiarly because of the adjustments; and there is the possible acceleration of growth in M-1B as savings accounts are transferred into it The levels of M2 proposed here under either alternative I or II allow for fairly good growth of nominal GNP, so that actually looks to me like a fairly comfortable target; if we believe that there's some tendency for V2 to rise, it's excessive  To come down to choices First, in stating the numbers, I would leave out the recent shifts--they're too uncertain--and modify the numbers later; second, I would go to alternative II; third, in alternative II, I would modify M2 a little and take it to 6 to 9 percent instead of 6-3/4 to 9-3/4 percent and I would pull M3 down accordingly But I haven't really thought M3 out, and I'm quite flexible on that Thank you   I meant to say the left side of the sheet without the--   Yes, without the bottom because that then gives us comparability I understand what Nancy says The figures the public knows about are those on the right-hand side We will have to supply continuous translations of the visible figures into the target figures   And the base drift in this is 2-1/4 points?   That means basing [unintelligible] base drift You're basing it on last year's targets and linking it up with last year's terminal points of the cone?   Yes If you draw a channel for last year and a new channel for this year, that will not be a straight line There will be an angle where they join   I am troubled by M-1A and M-1B and more troubled by M2 It's not that I want to speak up now, but in combination it becomes very, very troublesome   Well, 6 to 9 percent in a longer-term context is quite rich because we overshot the upper edge of the band by 08 percentage point, as someone said That means we overshot the midpoint by 2-1/4 percentage points That makes 11-1/4 percent the upper end, in effect, of the 6 to 9 percent That's more than the nominal GNP growth that the Board staff projects I grant you that anything can happen to M2 But there is going to be a temptation to rely on that very heavily because of the uncertainties surrounding the [narrower] aggregates It seems to me that this is just giving the economy what it wants, like demand feeding A more scholarly person, Bob Black, said it was the real bills doctrine We just supply the money that the nominal growth of GNP demands We ought to have some restraint built into this   But 7 to 10 percent really means 9 to 12 percent or a little more than that  -136-    2/2-3/81   Well, if we misspecified last time, why not adjust both?   Will we know?   There seems to be a market view that the dollar can't fall and that that's why it's safe to take advantage of high interest rates Do you see that continuing at these levels?   Yes, they can change very quickly   I've heard 6 percent, but not officially   Well, it's more of a Thatcher syndrome in that we seem to be getting impatient that it isn't going down by the virtuous circle that we ought to be getting But we are getting a 10 percent reappreciation of the dollar and I wonder what is going to happen to our exports here If you're indifferent, I would have thought maybe a half billion dollars would be a better expression   Let me just mention something in response to Tony's comment I got a call from the Bundesbank in which they wanted to stress that they had not changed their policy relating to the provision of liquidity that you might have in mind as the counterpart to the intervention It had to do with the ending of an earlier liquidity scheme of larger size; it was not to be understood as a change in their policy   I'd like to start the year off right   No, I just don't want to exceed our targets with an early set [of ranges that are above them], so I'd like to come in a little lower than "B"   Yes, somewhere between "B" and "C" in other words, but with 16 to 22 percent [on the funds range] I'm asking a great deal   "B" to "C" or sort of "B minus"   3 to 5-1/2 percent   No, that's 3-1/2 to 6 percent   That would suit me   Would you bring it back to where we had it originally by changing the path or would you drive it up or down by changing the path?   If we vary the path merely enough to drive the banks back to the same level of borrowing, we are coming close to pegging the funds rate, which surely isn't what you have in mind  -165-    2/2-3/81   If we simply said "shall vary the path in such a manner that total reserves are kept on track"--   It's perhaps a little strong, but the point is that borrowed reserves would be varied from their original--   Well, the banks still haven't exhausted much of their borrowing capacity for this quarter In other words, we probably can expect them to be borrowing more in January and February than in March, given the administrative procedures   The borrowing   I feel there is a matter or principle involved here in that the base, in my mind, is not a defensible figure It happens to fit We can get a correlation with any large number that grows slowly the way currency does, but it isn't meaningful  -172-    2/2-3/81 -173-   Well, [I dissented] because of the borrowing assumption--I wanted $15 billion--and the interest rate I would have been willing to settle for less than what I said, which was "C," but not quite so low   If we renew, does this mean that the implicit takeout from some further Euro-borrowing is pushed farther away in time?   Items 1-A and 1-B are the alternatives; we can do B while also doing A   But 1-C would be a different procedure?   Well, these currencies aren't substitutes necessarily So, if there's a reason for raising one, that's no reason to reduce another if that were to be the consequence of having a ceiling   It is noteworthy that any change in intervention policy can be accommodated within this document, no matter what we do   Essentially, we seem to have targeted on the funds rate  -15-    3/31/81   What I meant to say is that we targeted on borrowed reserves, which is very similar to targeting on the funds rate   Well, that's why we always target on the funds rate   We start by [making a borrowing assumption] in this way; subsequently [the actual level of borrowing and thus] the funds rate [are] free to move To make the place for that--   We also now use the term "taken over a period of time," which indicates that there is that flexibility you speak of   And eventually own them all!  -22-    3/31/81   Looking at the situation that we have, the economy is much stronger than we had expected Once again, we've had a recession predicted that so far hasn't materialized As a result, the degree of slack in the economy and the pressure on prices and wages are less from excess capacity The conclusion one is driven to is that our past policies, which we thought were quite restraining, were much less restraining As for why that should have been, I share the views that have been expressed around the table M-1B is probably misleading People are probably treating their money market mutual funds and other sources of liquidity as at least a factor that allows them to use their checking accounts more actively At the level of holders of very large liquid assets, bear in mind that the Treasury  -32-    3/31/81  has issued an enormous amount of bills, including cash management bills, which at least go into L if they don't go into the lower aggregates While these would be absorbed again as the Treasury avoids borrowing and people use this liquidity to pay their taxes, nevertheless, there is probably some additional liquidity, and some residual liquidity will remain So, if we were to look at these broader aggregates, including all short-term assets, we'd probably see a higher degree of expansion Now, M2 is probably a more relevant guide than M-1B I don't want to bore you again with my views about interest rates in real terms after tax and why they haven't been very restraining  As far as the outlook is concerned, I think there is a sense of unrealism about the Greenbook It would be nice if things worked out that way with slow, stable growth We have to bear in mind that [the level of economic activity] is really a little higher already than we thought it would be as a result of the strong first quarter But the realism of the outlook is undermined by the fact that we use M-1B at 4-1/2 or 4-3/4 percent I think the chances are that we will be pushed at least to 6 percent, the upper limit We have had base drift raising the whole level of the aggregates over time So, I find it hard to believe that we'll get quite the same pressures in terms of restraint that are seen in the [staff's] outlook I do see that we're going to get strong budgetary pressures My impression is that the risks are very much on the up side and much less on the down side That would encourage me now to want to accumulate such reserves of restraint as we can We're lucky in a way to have undershot the [targets], at least with respect to the narrower aggregates And I'd husband this reserve We'll probably be pushed off that point later in the year There's no reason to volunteer [to go] in that direction now Thank you   I was for "C," and I would like to see the funds range a little higher than it is there   Higher   As to the lower level of 12 percent [for the funds rate], if we get there, it would have to be below that on several days before we say that over a period of time it has been below that And then we would have done about three-fourths of the drop that we had in 1980   No, I want to make it substantially higher   Without accepting it?   Could I ask?   Have we tried alternative seasonal adjustments of the kind that in the past gave us these wide variations?   Have we tried different systems of adjusting the same data?   But always on the X-11?    4/28/81   This is Henry Wallich I think we need to show a strong effort to get the aggregates back on track We want to do a good job Also, we don't want to lose further credibility The question is how we should do this One way is to lower the nonborrowed path The other would be to increase the discount rate and surcharge That clearly would be a more visible action  SPEAKER(?) Sure   Henry Wallich I've always argued for a higher upper limit on the funds rate, and this may be my chance for testing your feeling on that It's now 13 to 18 percent, isn't it?   Well, I find the economy very hard to read, as do others Some things don't quite seem to fit together For instance, we've had this strong surge in the first quarter, which may be revised up But it doesn't seem to have led to a great increase in capacity utilization; it may have in materials but not in other areas And it hasn't led to a reduction in unemployment, as one would figure Now, if we are looking at this first quarter, it really means that GNP from here on out will be about 1 percentage point higher than it would have been had GNP grown at something like 3 percent or so--spreading the difference roughly over the rest of the year, or dividing it by 4 So, the whole picture is somehow tighter And that I don't quite see reflected in the capacity utilization or the unemployment figures; but it must be there I also am asking myself Why, in an economy in which no single thing seems to be outstandingly strong, is there so little room? Why, when we've got some distinctly weak sectors like housing and automobiles, has the economy been expanding so rapidly? Is it because the saving rate is so low that we're now at a much higher level of consumption than we normally would be so that leaves less room in the economy for other things and is squeezing things out? I find all these things difficult to reconcile, but there seems to be no doubt that the economy is not going down even moderately as much as thought; it may not go down at all and is overall very strong   And how about the large CDs that might run off? If this calculation is that easy to make that you can string them on a line, as Ed says, then others would be doing that, too, and would be cutting off their support  -12-    5/18/81   It seems to me that they can block, in effect, the use of the swaps for intervention, but I don't think they can compel us to eliminate them   I think he was confirmed after 260 questions or something like that   And the current account deficit We're already predicting that   When we have a swap drawing, we usually want to know where it is going to lead With the Swedes we knew that there was a big European loan coming, which might take us out With the French, one doesn't know where that's going to lead, and I think one has to look at the situation at the time it develops The swaps are not exclusively for the purpose of intervention anyway They can be for the purpose of a balance of payments financing in a broader sense I think one can say that with regard to the Swedes, who have a fixed peg One can't so easily say that the French have a fixed peg with the EMS, too So, again, it becomes more a matter of financing a deficit than arbitrarily intervening in the market I think that makes a pretty good case for the continuance of the swaps  -16-    5/18/81   I have a question   Peter, knowing only what we've learned from the incoming data, had we responded very strongly to the upsurge [in the growth of the aggregates] in April would it have been possible to make much of a difference in the course of the aggregates? What would have to have been done to do that?   But not being omniscient, just getting the numbers as they came, I presume we could have acted more immediately We could have relied not just on the automatic mechanism that moves the funds rate; we could have dropped the nonborrowed path and raised the discount rate and so on   I think they believe this I have heard this now for a week from Beryl Sprinkel Everything will be easy, if the Fed just keeps the money supply--   That's exactly it   Well, I see the economy lifted to a higher level of [activity] and, with a given rate of money growth, we have a higher level of velocity than one would have expected Certainly, we have to [get money growth to] come back [toward our] midpoints If we don't do that, I think we will have continuing pressure from high interest rates for a long time, with the economy being held down by always bumping [up against] the admittedly very tight-fitting money supply ceilings I find that uncomfortable to contemplate for the future So, if we could create a little breathing space in the real sector, letting out some of that steam that built up during the first quarter, I think we would operate more comfortably with our existing targets and in the long run we'd probably have less high interest rates Conceivably, maintenance of these high interest rates would give us this [result] anyway through some sort of financial crunch But we don't want to provoke that So, I would lean toward exerting a good deal of pressure now in order to get [rid of the imbalances in] the economy and [in] the relationship of the aggregates to the economy That suggests that "C" is the appropriate alternative To the extent that one can [anticipate] these things, if "C" will allow the funds rate to come down later even though it may mean a higher funds rate immediately, that's what I think we should aim at, ie somewhat less pressure in the economy for the longer run  I would say one other thing Given the way we were surprised by events in April, we ought to examine whether we couldn't respond more flexibly to such developments I realize that means responding to the weekly data in a way that the data themselves don't really justify Nevertheless, it has happened again and again that we were overtaken by events and, in the light of hindsight, probably would have wanted to move faster I don't recall so many instances in which we did move fast and then regretted it or didn't move and then found that that would have been the right thing to do On balance, I think our failures have been on the side of actions [that were] too little and too late   On the down side I do have my reservations, yes In short, I would lean toward "C"   Couldn't we perhaps say specifically that the Manager's operations are not to be constrained by the funds rate but that if the funds rate moves outside etc, the Committee will consult? Then it is clear that it is not a constraint   On [some] grounds I'd vote that way, though not because I like what we have now But I don't like the change to which we're going, and I suspect we're not going to change it again soon, so we're losing an opportunity to improve it permanently   I would stress the deviation from the aggregates and then come in from the funds rate  MESSRS PARTEE and SCHULTZ But that's what Lyle's version did   No, I don't think he mentions the deviations from the paths   No   Do you mean that it naturally has a higher growth rate or--   So it ought to have a lower growth rate? I'm just trying to understand the thrust of your remark   The analysis that only a very small fraction use the account actively and that, therefore, it is like a savings account may be misleading That's because [if] only 5 percent or so of the holders use the account as if it were a checking account, that part really ought to be added to M-1B   Would you think that if we did operate in the market, we could have changed these [exchange] rates much or could have kept them significantly lower?   That would imply a very sharp rise in the D-mark against most other currencies   Basically it is a matter of supply and demand in the market You may change some people's minds and thereby shift the demand and supply schedules, but if we have a $25 billion deficit, it has to be financed from somewhere It isn't going to come because traders take positions supporting the dollar It will have to be financed either by central bank action--they once bought $35 billion in one year and it didn't accomplish much--or it has to be financed by our borrowing abroad and putting that into the [exchange] market   Well, it's the possibility of affecting that psychology that I don't feel very optimistic about   Well, one has to consider, in addition to the arguments that Tony has made for German nonintervention, that they would be buying dollars at a very unfavorable rate if they bought any [ahead of] a near-term decline So, that's not--   I would be very happy to support it   You'll hear more about that soon   Well, as long as the short-term rates are significantly above the long rates, people have an expectation that rates will come down And that is why they're willing to pay very high rates temporarily If they ever gave up on that expectation, the [yield] structure presumably would flatten out, and it's only then that we would see the full restraining power of those interest rates   During the 1920s   It seems very logical in terms of the structure People expect rates to go down and they do go down; but in order to hold short-term securities, they have to be paid a premium Otherwise, they do like Merrill Lynch and start buying bonds   What would happen if the M-1B estimate is really, in effective terms, much too low? In other words, if a substantial shift in the demand schedule were ahead because of the use of substitutes, would that lower interest rates in your context or--?  -19-    7/6-7/81   And it would mean lower interest rates, then   Which is what has happened to us again and again, hasn't it? We set what looked like a very low M1 target and then a shift occurred and it turned out not to be very low   Yes, but aren't you arguing in effect that because we've had such a large shift in the first half of the year, we're therefore unlikely to get any in the second?   An average of 1 percent growth or 1/2 percent growth over a period of two years is historically very rare I don't know if it has ever happened I think that's the kind of scenario one projects when one doesn't know whether [economic activity] is going up or going down So, you have the economy growing very slowly and unemployment rising But it doesn't have a very high percentage probability, as Otto Eckstein would put it   I do think it can be said in favor of M-1B that transactions balances are a unique concept There's a logical reason why they might be related to GNP Once you go beyond that to M2 or M3, there's really no place to stop All you can do is stop with total credit, like Henry Kaufman, because changes in credit presumably indicate the degree to which people and businesses are overspending or underspending their income If you measure all forms of credit, then maybe you can measure excess demand or deficient demand But by just measuring what is related to depository institutions, such as M3, you don't capture the whole There still are possible substitutions for depository institution credit and open market credit, and one may be misled   Well, I was away so I didn't put in any numbers My only reaction to the staff forecast is that I'm skeptical of the favorable inflation developments I can't prove that outcome isn't likely but it seems more optimistic than I would expect in light of the details of the situation, both in terms of the particular developments in food and energy and what I see on the side of costs As for the slow growth, I have no sense of which way it's going to go It seems to me that Chuck is right in saying that we have a governor  -30-    7/6-7/81  on the up side Any time the economy breaks out on the up side it will be pushed down again by rising interest rates If we have a symmetrical policy, that would be true also on the down side That is to say, any time the economy slows down interest rates will be pushed down if we keep the money supply on track So, I wouldn't anticipate any very severe recession But the economy could fluctuate between moderate expansion and moderate contraction Now, I hope the analysis is true regarding this quasi-equilibrium of [the economy] moving something like 1 percent for two years as a result of strong private demands It would give us an opportunity for the future It would be equally well rationalized in terms of there being a very strong demand for credit on the part of the government through a rising deficit that keeps interest rates high rather than the strong and unsatisfied private demands If we get out of this inflation, it's unlikely to be by what Lyle calls some mythical relationship I think it will be because costs are coming down And costs will come down in the [usual] painful and unpleasant way--falling profits, rising excess capacity and, unhappily, higher unemployment There is some tradeoff, I think, in terms of lowering the level of unemployment, excess capacity, and the duration; the lower level and longer duration will accomplish about the same But I think it would be surprising if we got out of this inflation without more sacrifice than is implied in the optimistic interpretation of our situation   The 1982 ranges and the changes for 1981 are somewhat separable topics We can separate out the very short run and separate out the rest of year, and then we can talk about 1982 I think those three topics are more manageable than if we try to get into all of them at the same time   It doesn't have to collapse; it just needs to ease a little   Well, I think Lyle has given us a very sophisticated argument against the proposition that the way to get inflation down is to keep pulling the aggregates down I get the similar argument from a very theoretical side The people who are examining the post-World War I inflations conclude that at the end of the inflation [the monetary authority] can enormously increase the money supply without rekindling inflation because that is what happened then But I share the Chairman's view that we are far from that point Moreover, typically when one has had declining interest rates, velocity has not changed back to its previous behavior but has remained high because there's an underlying trend that increases it So, I would be very hesitant now to move in the direction of allowing higher targets  There are two things we need to bear in mind One is the substantive point about what we want to do; the other is the strategic The two substantive things we need to do are to avoid the repetition of 1980 by going to a very high rate from a low level, perhaps in order to get back on track, and thus conveying the impression of a massive expansion That suggests to me that we ought to keep M-1B growing slowly the rest of the year, if necessary by changing the target range downward But that can also be done by specifying that we're aiming at the lower end of the range That's what the Germans have been doing, and recently they actually have changed the target The other thing we ought to do is to get M2 and M3 more or less on track Yesterday's discussion shows that M-1B is increasingly regarded as unreliable I say that very reluctantly because I've favored transactions balances as a criterion But it doesn't seem to be a feasible criterion, at the present time at least So, I think we need to focus on M2 and M3, and that suggests to me again that either we lower the M-1B target or aim specifically at its lower end In either event, I come out with something like the alternative 2 growth rates for '81  Now, for '82 I see Tony Solomon's point that if we make a big move on anything in '81, we can't make a very large move in '82 That's the strategic aspect of the matter But I think there's still room for some reduction in the target for M-1B this year and a smaller reduction for it next year I would go somewhere along the lines of the ranges in alternatives II and III on page 14  -44-    7/6-7/81   That's a tighter fit for M2 than is proposed by any of the alternatives I through III on page 14, isn't it?   He'd leave it unchanged at 6 to 9 percent   But the alternatives here all raise it, you see   I wasn't disagreeing with your proposal; I was just trying to point out that you were really making a very tough proposal   But the substance of it is that we shouldn't make M-1B grow very fast; whether we express that in terms of a target or by saying we expect its growth to come in low is a matter of strategy   I share the view that we have to avoid a repetition of '80 but we also have to avoid a repetition of '79 It would be the third year if that happened I don't think M-1B by itself is all that important, but the appearance that it is rising rapidly would be very damaging I think we ought to stress that more weight is being attached to M2 and, in that context, I would say M2 growth at 8 percent seems desirable with M-1B at 7 percent, let's say, and the funds rate range at 17 to 22 or 23 percent   But why start with what seems to be an unrealistic relationship between borrowing and the funds rate?   I suggested a high funds rate, but I didn't know what the borrowing assumption was that would match it   I didn't put one down because I don't have the relationship in mind But it seems to me that it should be closer perhaps to $2 billion than to $15 billion, or somewhere in the middle there   That's really between "A" and "B," when most of the discussion has been for between "B" and "C"   I think M2 is the more critical variable now   I mind very strong numbers in M-1B   I think that would be more a reflection on M-1B than on the economy   Let me give you an argument that's against my own case If interest rates should come down, M2 probably would accelerate because money market funds would gain relative to market investments That gives me some pause in the mechanics of the constraint   Will you qualify your M2 constraint in the sense that unless there are special factors causing it to rise--   And let it overshoot if it does? M2 at 8 percent would suit me   If we don't, aren't we saying that we now think we're not going to reduce it?   I thought theory said that the income elasticity for transactions balances was a good deal less than unity   Then we would expect a continuing rise in velocity, wouldn't we?  SPEAKER(?) Why?   Right   We used to do that--nibble at the upper edge of one and then next time at the lower edge of the other I figured out it took ten years to bring about a moderate reduction I think we have to go across the board   I think, barring technical inconsistencies, all of them   We seem to assume that growth in velocity is a special event due to definable changes in technology But if people are circumventing the need for transactions balances right and left by using money market funds and overnight arrangements and so forth, then really all that is happening is that M-1B is becoming a smaller part of the transactions balances And its velocity isn't really a meaningful figure; it's just a statistical number relating M-1B to GNP But it doesn't exert any constraint That is what I fear may be happening, although one can't be very sure But that makes a rise in velocity more probable than thinking of it in terms of a special innovation   They'd think you want it easier   This is Henry Wallich Usually waiting has turned out badly for us We have established some reputation now for moving in a timely way, and I wouldn't be very happy about delaying Maybe we could wait for the funds rate to respond and see if there is a substantial response But in the absence of that, I think we have to move on the nonborrowed path   Sam, in describing the concerted intervention of the Germans as "organized," do you have any information as to whether there was anything more than their urging others to do something? Were there rate ideas or quantity ideas put out?   Does it look as though they have started something, so to speak--a kind of [organized effort] that can be revived any time?   Could we get a little more information on this disorderly market? Were you able to observe whether spreads widened drastically, whether the two-way market just disappeared and there were no bids at all?   Did we ever make clear that this means at book value and not at market value?   At cost, yes If we didn't [use cost], we wouldn't have to raise the D-mark limit, but we might at some time have to raise it without--   I'd be inclined to welcome that, wouldn't you? If the funds rate were more detached from other rates, the immediate impact of [a move] in the funds rate resulting from tighter monetary control wouldn't communicate itself so fast and so strongly to the rest of the market It happens that in this case the rest of the market went in a very expensive direction for the Treasury, and that's not good But I think there's no damage in looseness   Yes, I'm aware of that point If there were no movement of other short-term rates in response to the funds rate, it would be more difficult to control the aggregates   Peter, without implying anything untoward in the future, what is the part of your portfolio that is reasonably saleable without great loss or without market disturbance?   That seems to imply [unintelligible] that is something on the order of 1/2 of the portfolio   Well, that would get us about there   But then one would really have to--   Well, I think there is some way of looking at M-1B and trying to find out how much it is misleading us The adjustments one can make by adding the money market mutual funds in some degree and overnight RPs and Eurodollars are pretty arbitrary, but they give us some guide But more than that, if we assume that velocity is moving at a reasonable rate with respect to what M-1B really is effectively--that is, after adjustments--by holding velocity on a constant trend, allowing for interest rate changes, then we would find out what M-1B would be if there weren't these shifts; and the rest I think logically should be ascribed to a demand shift Steve has described that something like this may well be going on It seems very characteristic that when M2 is very high and M1 very low, there obviously is something happening to one of the two; normally they move closely together Something could be distorting both, but it does not seem implausible that it's M-1B that is being distorted by a rapid velocity change, a reduction in demand due to the substitution of other assets, and that, therefore, we have to treat M-1B very cautiously  Another check of the same question is to look at interest rates If interest rates were behaving in a totally outlandish way, one would assume that they were being pulled away by the aggregates But that doesn't seem to be happening; they're very high, but not all that out of line with projections So, whatever is distorted about the aggregates is probably a distortion of the aggregates and not a real effect, if I may put it that way Now, the rates we have  -17-    8/18/81  evidently are too high for some sectors of the economy and are not very restraining on others That is what leads me to think that they're not outlandish and may be regarded as about normal for this level of inflation Lyle makes the point that at falling rates of inflation these same nominal rates are becoming heavier in real terms; and that's certainly true if inflation is coming down Against that I would look at the expectations seemingly embodied in rising bond yields; the buyers and also the sellers of those bonds don't seem to have much confidence that inflation is coming down, so they're prepared to tie themselves to what seem to be very high real rates, possibly on the expectation of rising inflation Thank you   It doesn't seem to correlate very well with interest rates   There is one factor in the level of interest rates that we seem to overlook sometimes At the time we set these targets [for the aggregates], we looked at GNP projections We first made these decisions in July of 1980 The projections were under [the actual outcome] for the first half of '81 by about $170 billion, of which $50 billion was due to a revision in the numbers The other $120 billion or thereabouts was the result of a stronger economy in the fall of '80 and early '81 So, the economy is much bigger [than we projected] And the money supply also has slipped because we used the base drift at the end of 1980 to start from a higher base than we could have anticipated when we set those targets Nevertheless, the economy has moved well beyond the targets as we thought of them when we set the ranges in July 1980, so that has probably introduced some continuing interest rate pressure I say that just as a comment on why the rates are so high   Well, I think there's some reason for thinking that because if the growth acquires any momentum, it will take more effort to break that momentum If we now have 8 percent growth, let's say, for a month or two in order to get that down, interest rates will have to go up So, I think we have a choice possibly of being a little tighter now or being a little less tight later on   When it does, they're [unintelligible]   Well, I have no desire to raise interest rates at this time I think they're high enough now   I'd like to qualify that [by adding] "but barely"   They're high enough, but barely, because the economy is bearing up very well under these interest rates There is one sector that is very badly damaged and it is bearing up poorly But the rest are curiously unaffected and on the whole the economy is standing up remarkably well So, I can see no grounds for going down on interest rates I can see the danger of a great boom as these tax cuts take hold later in '82, and I think we'd be a lot better off if before then the economy had been slow rather than beginning to move, because it will get enough or more than enough movement out of that tax stimulation So, keeping [economic growth] at zero seems to me about right One can't positively look for a reduction and feel good about it, but we certainly ought not [foster] any stimulation at this time We just have to sit with the high interest rates, painful as that is  Now, I am concerned about a repetition, on a small scale, of last year namely, that we start below the lower end of the M-1B band and shoot through the band It would be the third time that we've done that It doesn't seem likely at this time, but it has happened twice before And that makes me concerned about anything that looks like a rapid growth of M-1B, suspect as that variable is I'm also concerned, if we imparted to it any degree of momentum, about how we would bring [that pickup] to a halt once growth has gotten more or less back on track At that time we'd have to have higher interest rates And that's something we had better avoid So, I lean toward a low growth rate for M-1B, as described in alternative B One could mitigate the interest rate consequences of that by being cautious about setting the borrowing requirement In any case, I think the setting of the borrowing requirement is a much more powerful instrument than the change of the path by 1 percentage point up or down That would get me to alternative B, possibly rephrased as it is in the second version of the directive [shown in the Bluebook] where the possibility of accelerating M-1B is allowed I'm really not happy about the acceleration I just don't want to put too much of a burden on M2 because of the doubts that are attached to it at this time   We seem to get very little credit for our earlier shortfalls All the public sees is the rapid rise in that particular month  -45-    8/18/81   You could have changed your mind   Do you find that the closeness of contact and quality of information with European central banks and with the market in general is being maintained at present?   I would think we could perhaps [say no] on the basis that this is not the right time I don't want to preclude this for all eternity   We have some data on bankruptcies and failures which throw some light, don't they, on the degree of strain? My impression is that they are up significantly, about 40 percent, but that this is also influenced by the new bankruptcy law Certainly [that affects] the bankruptcies; less so perhaps the failures Do you have any more data? Is 40 percent unique historically?   Well, it has to be seen in the light of the fact that there's a big tax cut in 1982 Nobody seems to take that as a reason for having a lower wage increase There would be more of a real income increase than one would otherwise expect   Well, it seems to me we're seeing again what is the nature of a stable money supply target It leads to very wide swings in interest rates That in turn leads to possibly wide swings and very quick swings in the economy, with a ceiling placed over expansion and a floor probably placed under any contraction, but unfortunately with a great deal of damage being done to the machinery while these gyrations proceed So, I'm concerned about a move to get back on track with M-1B I think we're better off considering that as progress against inflation and money in the bank and not trying to undo it I think we're in danger of repeating 1980 And back in 1980 I said that we were in danger of repeating 1971-79 We didn't do that; we did much worse [I'd] preclude any risk on this score here I do have to say, contrary to the implication of what I've said so far, that if I understand Steve correctly about M2, it sounds as though he is saying it's perversely interest elastic That is, the higher interest rates go, the faster it grows For that there is a precedent in the British experiment with sterling M3 They made that their number one target and it kept growing very fast The implication seems to be that it attracted funds from outside the monetary aggregates, out of non-monetary assets, and so it grew faster the higher interest rates went and, therefore, substantially misled them Evidently the aggregate they should have looked at was more nearly M1   Well, that's exactly what happened in England Income was affected so much by high rates that M2, which after all is largely a function of income, slowed down as they achieved their sterling M3 [objective] They got it under control but precisely by the route you described   It was a big recession Now, on the other hand, I see M-1B--   No, it worked excessively In other words, had they been guided by M1, they probably would not have been as tight as they were in pursuit of an ever rising sterling M3   Well, I have the same doubts about M-1B However, I think it is underspecified, whether you call that a very strong demand shift, high velocity growth, or whether you say that some part of money market mutual funds or other [liquid assets] ought to be included as transactions balances In any event, it seems to me that it is potentially misleading to take it at face value and, therefore, some undershooting of M-1B as now specified doesn't seem to me to be as important as it would otherwise That gets one back, of course, to looking at the real economy and looking at interest rates Now, as I see the real economy, I recognize that we've had a very poor growth performance But we've not had that bad a performance in unemployment; 75 percent is bad but it isn't as bad as one might have thought we would get from this degree of restraint; presumably, productivity is the main cause So, I think we have to resign ourselves to low and occasionally negative growth for a while Interest rates presumably will come down somewhat I think if the public perceived that as an easing action, we would throw off altogether the wrong signal; we would get people saying that we've stopped fighting inflation and are starting to fight recession And, I think the businessmen and bankers who say "We're hurting, but hang on" are precisely conscious of that Then we would get another round and face the same problems at higher rates of inflation and, therefore, higher rates of interest It's better to sit it out this time   Well, I would go with "C" I observe that there is no alternative this time that would allow for a tightening from where we are now It's not offered on the menu and I wouldn't know how to go about producing it   But 6 percent on M-1B is a slight reduction from the 7 percent we were aiming at last time--though, of course, not achieving--and it seems to me fairly safe from being misconstrued On the funds rate, I would note that a survey of 38 market people projects the funds rate by the end of 1981 at 15-1/2 percent, up slightly from where it was when the survey was taken So, the market doesn't seem to be expecting a large decline, and the 13 to 18 percent range of alternative C, therefore, seems to me quite reasonable I'm also reassured that these paths are likely to produce reasonable looking--in fact very tight looking--paths for nonborrowed reserves and total reserves In retrospect, this 20 percent growth of nonborrowed reserves for the last three months looks peculiar, even though there were reasons why it had to be so in constructing the path But a nonborrowed path of 4 percent and a total reserves path of 3 percent look extremely moderate I think that's a plus for this alternative My inclination for borrowed reserves would be on the high side of the $900 million to $12 billion range Thank you, Mr Chairman   It was up to 229--   It's a very high number anyway  -44-    10/5-6/81   If we do all this, we may get to a position very similar to last year where it looks as though we cut the funds rates in half; other rates won't have moved quite that much, but it will look like a very big drop   Cutting interest rates in half is just showing that we are giving up on inflation and are starting to fight recession; that's very much what it seems to me we are tempted to do   It was 21 percent, I think   We are letting it go to 12 percent before we consult, which indicates that we are willing to let it go very far   It moves pretty fast   No, I'm concerned with the picture that we present if interest rates drop sharply You can say all you like about the fact that we are below target on the money supply, but the public will perceive this as easing and 90 percent of the commentators will say that the Fed has eased very substantially   Second   Well, in every recession there is a period where one becomes alarmed if it looks worse than one had expected And that is the period that I think we're passing through now But I think the staff is right that there is a foundation under the economy It's partly the tax cut next year I think the pent-up demand in housing, automobiles, and investment, as it gradually comes alive, will prevent a very deep drop So, I think concern of a very severe recession isn't justified If the economy is worse than it seemed a few months ago, so is the inflation outlook, or at least it hasn't improved  If I may go back for a moment to the targeting problem that Larry Roos raised, the way I understand this is that the Committee sets the money supply path and the borrowing assumption The staff derives from that a total reserves path and a nonborrowed reserves path given the borrowing assumption [and] we then target the nonborrowed And a change in the nonborrowed [path] would simply amount to going back to total reserves targeting A change in the nonborrowed [path] is the analogue of a discount rate change It's a major decision and it should be made by the Committee, not just made routinely because we're not hitting the money supply target The same could be said about changing the total reserves target That too, it seems to me, can miscarry as a result of excess reserves building up or being drawn down, and the target should not be changed without a Committee decision  On the aggregates, I share what has been said about M1-B It's not a sacred number; it's a very profane number It has been misspecified There's a member of the Shadow Open Market Committee in New York who has an adjusted M1-B that is growing at a 10 or 12 percent annual rate All he does is put in 50 percent of money market mutual funds and overnight Eurodollars and RPs You can--   He's not complaining He has been complaining about our excessive reserve expansion, you see Everybody can find something wrong with us   Heinneman I think that Willis is perfectly right that the bank in Ohio is in effect making it possible to have a zero balance checking account And I think we're moving further in that direction So, M1-B is highly suspect Well, I guess I won't say any more on the aggregates Just a word on interest rates What has been said here is exactly what I think If we stick firmly to an aggregates target, we're going to have very wide swings in short-term rates After a while long-term rates will cease to follow this rate race and will probably remain high because people have the experience, if they ever buy bonds, of losing money as bond prices rise If we get a V-shaped interest rate [move], we'll lose credibility I think our credibility is really much more linked to interest rates; many millions of people are more interested in them than in the monetary aggregates in which, at least in Washington outside of three buildings not including this one, there isn't all that much faith   I'll tell you the addresses in a minute There are two buildings on each side of it I'm simply trying to say that I think we ought to aim at a saucer-type movement of interest rates I recognize that we need to have some compromise between not completely letting go of our aggregates targets and avoiding excessive moves in interest rates That's what we need And in that process, we ought to avoid getting to negative real rates, as Fred said Thank you   In real terms? In constant dollars?   Well, I'm concerned mostly about the possibility of the funds rate falling below the discount rate and of very low borrowing Then things could get out of hand and confront us with the need to keep lowering the discount rate in order to prevent that For that reason, I would start off with a [relatively high] borrowing assumption and I would like to consult at a somewhat higher [funds rate] level on the way down Consulting doesn't mean that one stops there But at least at a time when much higher mobility of interest rates is a possibility, we ought to look at it earlier rather than later So, I would go for $400 million for borrowing and 12 to 16 percent on the funds rate without any expectation that it would go to 16 percent But neither would I like it to drop below 12 percent without talking about it   But the range really doesn't mean that it's being held there It's a checkpoint for consultation   Because it should be $1 billion   It could be $800 million   Well, very soon we'll have done as much as we did in 1980 We will have cut rates about in half This would seem to be doing the same to the funds rate and bill rate   Well, the risk is that it might drop very sharply below the discount rate, and in that case--   Set the borrowing requirement high to be safe Set the path, however, so we get some addition to reserves during the period and some downward pressure on rates   Why do we need to specify? One sort of inference [about] interest rates here is the borrowing assumption The Chairman may consult the Committee, so the funds rate constraint isn't even a binding action   I'm wondering why we need to expose ourselves to the charge that we're managing interest rates when we're not doing that?   Take out the whole sentence   If we move to plain M1, then we're back to the unadjusted and that's right in the middle of the range So, we'd start right from there   We got rid of the base drift   Then do we accept it if gets higher?   I can see myself accepting if it gets higher, but I wouldn't want to set the few steering mechanisms we have to accomplish that   Well, if we start with a sufficiently high borrowing assumption, I could go with that   Why can't we just say "After taking note of the movements of the aggregates," with no specification as to what they were, "the Committee decided"   You have to decide   But you're saying here "after noting the shortfall" or "after accepting a shortfall" I don't think we need to say that   How about "set the reserve path designed to achieve X percent growth"?   Well, then it is, what--2-1/2 points below the discount rate? That must mean that there's practically only frictional borrowing   Then it's very unstable already   That's something one would like to be able to decide while not under the pressure of a collapsing funds rate   Well, that's what I had in mind   We certainly shouldn't wait a week and establish the average that begins breaking the lower level   Well, do you feel constrained from consulting before we reach that point?   How about 11 to 16 and consult at 15?   Sometimes we can afford to be symmetrical   Did we overshoot on M3?   A higher aggregate   When we say "somewhat more," does that mean we freeze the funds rate at that level?   And the continued high level of M2   I think we're making it needlessly difficult by pointing to M2 as the balancing item that keeps us where we are Why don't we just play down M2 in this?   Yes, but now we've mentioned the shortfall in one and said nothing about the other except--    At least it wasn't that an assassination  attempt was needed to intervene       They might have to proceed differently with respect to the 1981 maturities that should have been rescheduled but now have fallen through They might have to write off 50 or even 100 percent But most of it, of course, is into the future   Were they unionized?   In the midst of this gloom, there is one substantial difference and that is that a major tax cut is already on the books I think this lends a certain support to the [expectation] not in the first quarter, but looking to the second and third quarters, that the economy is going to come--   They never had risen that much Inflation had not become imbedded in ways that--   Do you need your pipe?   But why is that?   I am perfectly willing to wait 'til tomorrow   Yes, I was All I can think about as I look at what we are proposing to do [is whether we are] setting very tight targets We are proposing to finance a 7 percent growth in nominal GNP, which is all inflation and has a little minus in real growth, with a 4 percent rise in M1-B, [using] the midpoint of the target In other words, we are relying on a shift in the demand function for M1-B We are also accepting some base drift that we are carrying over from 1981, which adds to the tightness But the fact is that we have had base drift from time to time and sometimes in very durable form And the reason that our policy in the mid-1970s, for instance, now looks so poor is not that the targets were not very tight; they looked extremely tight But we got an amount of shift in the demand function that made them very loose The growth of effective money was much higher than we realized It was again much higher than we realized in 1981 We got a very large shift in the demand function, on the order of 6 percent, which meant that the very modest nominal GNP growth that we got was financeable  So I would say that our main risk is really on the side of getting new additional shifts in the demand function We have analyzed these and how they work We have a theory that they come after peaks in interest rates We can now foresee them institutionally, with the sweeps out of demand and NOW accounts into money market mutual funds All that suggests that we are going to see, if anything, greater economies in M1 than we have seen in the past and that, therefore, the seemingly very tight targets ex post will not look nearly so tight One can see the same thing if one looks simply at what is in M1 It does not contain that part of money market mutual funds that clearly serves as transactions balances today, which I think must be quite considerable And it doesn't take account fully either of the liquidity enhancing effect of the existence of money market mutual funds that people can write one check a month on; that saves them half their normal bank balance in that they can replenish their bank balance in the middle of the month out of their money market mutual fund So, again, I think one can see that in practice that makes the tight M1 target of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent much less tight than it seems  Now, I think the wide range that we are proposing is all right because there is so much uncertainty here that one cannot operate with a very tight target We do have to realize that these tight targets probably condemn us to quick, short swings in business If we follow a tight money supply track and stay on it, interest rates will move up and down sharply We have not accepted the full decline in interest rates that would have come had we stayed exactly on M1-B, and we didn't because we knew that in 1980 when we came close to doing that we got a very sharp drop but then a very quick snapback It didn't do us any good against inflation this time by not allowing quite [as] extreme a [shortfall from our] money supply target Hopefully we will get a more lasting effect We do need a period of slack in the economy if we want to wind out the inflation Our problem is whether we are going to bounce back and forth going up and  -29-    12/21-22/81  down to the very top peak of the ceiling and then to the floor as a result of these techniques; to the extent that we can avoid that, we clearly should  Now, just a word about M2 M2 [growth] has usually been in line very roughly with [that of] nominal GNP So I would view with alarm any increase in [the] M2 [range] It is true that there are some practices [in train] that may make M2 rise abnormally, for instance the IRA and Keogh expansion that may be ahead But broadly speaking, M2 tends to expand faster in contractions and expands more slowly than nominal GNP in expansions because of the way the fixed rate deposit interest rates compete with market instruments So, we are going to go through eventually a period of expansion I would think that would hold M2 down, and I don't see much harm in a relatively tight M2 ceiling I think the removal of institutional money market mutual funds and addition of retail RPs would be a reasonable adjustment We shouldn't be in the posture of never mending the structure of our aggregates Thank you   Or we make another shift adjustment   It doesn't have to come into the money market fund Merrill Lynch lets you draw checks against your securities and puts the money into a bank account that has a money market fund associated with it; that fund is up to $12 billion now You can draw a check for fifteen cents   You'd turn it into another M1-A   Money is supposed to lead the economy with a long and variable lag   You know that when we set something and accept a higher amount that it has the effect, really, of pegging the funds rate Is that what you want?   Well, I find myself leaning toward the easy side this time because what we have done is to avoid following the aggregates as far as we might; had we done so, interest rates would be a lot lower Not having done that, I think we ought to give the economy a chance to recover at this interest rate level and try to string that [level] out as long as it will last, giving [firms] a chance to issue more bonds and so on I would not welcome a further drop unless the economy weakens substantially because that would simply be what I think has been the error that we have avoided in the first place But we have to compensate somewhat for not having let rates drop that far by now smoothing them out for the future So, I would go with the higher aggregate [growth rates] proposed--that is M1 at 5 percent and M2 at 10 percent, a low borrowing assumption of $250 or $300 million, and a funds rate range of 10 to 14 percent I wouldn't see any advantage in letting fed funds get into the single- digit range; I'd try to hold it here for a while if circumstances permit There is a cost to this; later in the year we may have to accept higher interest rates to stick by our overall targets That cost I think we have to be prepared to pay   Suits me   Well, there were some who wanted to accept an overshoot   I would prefer 5 and 10 percent with no such understanding, even though it may produce what I don't want--a rise in interest rates I think it is just bad in principle that we have fallen into implicitly targeting the funds rate only   We've done that repeatedly   I'm just being consistent I didn't want to let [rates] drop too far; I don't want them to rise too fast   It is the principle of it that bothers me   That we're now beginning to fudge the difference between 4 and 5 by saying "around" The next time it will be around 4 to 6 and then around 4 to 7   It becomes increasingly realistic   But the borrowing assumption is generally viewed by people who look at these things at all as a proxy for the funds rate So, if we put this into the directive, it will be interpreted as having taken a step in the direction of at least initially targeting on the funds rate Now, it is true that borrowing shifts thereafter; but quite often we take steps to prevent that, like forgiving low volumes of borrowing or redistributing borrowing over a period of weeks These are all ways of focusing more fully on the funds rate than a pure money supply target   Well, that would reassure me The second thing that would reassure me is if we left the borrowing more fully to find its own level during the period   Oh yes, we need a starting point   Aren't we somewhat in a minority in regard to a hopeful outlook for inflation in '83 and beyond? I see that outside models we review seem to feel that in '83 inflation will pick up again with recovery I look at our own alternative long-run strategies and the easy strategy, number 2, has inflation virtually leveling off in '84 It still goes down in '83 Now, is all this due simply to differences in assumptions on monetary policy or are there more real sector things built into these estimates?   Thank you   Could I pick up on that? We often find ourselves saying that we cannot control interest rates except maybe very temporarily at the short end And here we see that apparently we're supposed to be able to bring down Treasury bill rates for three years and make that stick I find it hard to see the consistency of what one finds oneself saying about the difficulty of providing interest rate relief and these numbers here   Jim, isn't your model in a sense vitiated by the fact that you have data going way back into the '50s when inflation wasn't very important but fairly sizable actions were taken both to curb inflation and to get the economy going So, you have a history of large actions, large swings in the economy, and modest reactions on inflation The model then gives you these same answers for the present period when it would seem to me that large swings in the economy would also have large effects on inflation   I think what is happening to the variability of money suggests that our ranges in a sense are narrower than this variability And the variability is also greater than the difference between expansion and contraction in the economy, so that interest rates really become the one meaningful check on what the aggregates are doing Another possible but not very reliable check would be to say "Let's go to a single number for the target, which would be the midpoint of what we've had so far" Then we'd get rid of the problem of having a wide target and still missing even that But the basic problem is to make a decision as to whether this January number is meaningful or not We do not have worthwhile guidance on that That leads me to the conclusion that we ought to do something about the base I listened to Chuck and I listened to Fred; I can see the danger of manipulating these things I think it is perhaps less dangerous to manipulate the base than to manipulate the ranges, because we've always accepted base drift We had upward base drift in '80 and we're going to have downward base drift now if we're accepting where we came out Therefore, I don't feel that the base is very sacred I think there's something to be said for the Bluebook version of basing it on the lower edge of the band that we had because that was, after all, one end of our target We're not going to have the base drift that events gave us but we'll take advantage of that much That seems to me acceptable Another acceptable rationale, it seems to me, is to say we will go back to July of 1981 when we set these targets and use where we thought we were then We've shifted in a probably fortuitous manner since then and if we go back to where we set the tentative targets and reaffirm them on that basis, I think we have the rationale I looked at the possibility of going even further back in order to eliminate past base drift, as it were If we go back to late 1980 as a base, of course, we have to accept that we don't get the benefit of the upward drift that occurred during 1980 If we go even further back to 1978 and follow all the midpoints of the various ranges we've had, we are now within $100 million of the target It's really quite a success   Of all these various devices, the Bluebook version strikes me as the most plausible We do accept that something has happened We don't take it fully into account We have a reasonable rationale I think on that base we can probably live with    2/1-2/82  the [tentative] targets that we have and that's the [lesser] sensitivity than having to face a change in these targets   The Bluebook alternative for the short-term ranges where the base takes off-- Where is it?   Which page is it?   The arithmetic is messy, but the concept is a reasonable one   That doesn't sound--   I don't think there's an absolute logic that we have to do the same thing for the two aggregates, particularly when they clearly have been moving in opposite directions    2/1-2/82   Which is a bigger drift   It depends on supply and demand   One has to distinguish whether a movement is the result of a shift in the demand function or a shift in the supply function We assume the demand is constant and, therefore, an increase in the supply of money--just as of potatoes--increases supply and reduces the price Now, if it's the demand function that changes while the supply function is constant, then price--that is, the interest rate--and quantity move in the same direction That is what you've observed and what you commented on But the Bluebook targets are based on the assumption of constant demand and a change in the supply function   If the price of potatoes goes up and you know that there has been no change in supply, it must have been because of a change in demand These markets work just the same as every market  -51-    2/1-2/82  in the economy and one has to distinguish what is the source of the movement   Is that not accurate?   Well, all that says is that supply is pretty stable and demand is the source of most changes This is what I and others normally say about the money supply and money demand It's the demand that is the more unstable variable And that's why we get movement of prices and quantities in the same direction   But, Larry, we're the controllers of supply; we're not the controllers of the demand   Not using a funds range makes a lot of sense because that range is always misunderstood in the market They all believe that it cannot be breeched, but actually it is a checkpoint at which consultation begins I think we'd do ourselves a lot of good by removing it   That doesn't mean that we can't consult under any circumstances, I take it   Now, if we use a borrowing assumption, which we don't publish, and which is a much more operationally important thing than the consultation ranges--   There's a different base in StLouis; we know that   I have nothing to add I would go along with zero and 8 percent I prefer not to mention the funds range, not because I think interest rates are unimportant, but because I think it's misleading But 12 to 16 percent is fine as is $15 billion on borrowing   I think we could do this on the grounds that there is an element of disorder when the market pays little attention to fundamentals like inflation and--   But we have never said anything other than that we would fight disorder Now, disorder is in the eye of the beholder   I think we can make our point in the market without giving away the statement that we do it for disorder   Sam, do you observe that the yen is more sensitive to interest rate differentials now than it has been in the past?   M2 is very hard to control in a direct sense; we can control it by controlling GNP essentially Savings is a function of GNP and in that sense, if we get a good M2, we have done a good job on GNP But I would not get too firmly ensconced on an M2 target precisely for that reason   Well, it seems to me that if one is uncertain and later may have to say that we need flexibility because things have turned out differently, then one would strengthen one's position by showing this uncertainty a little earlier rather than coming in [firmly] early and then having to backtrack I think we would have a harder time making that change   The central banks that have the most credibility, such as the Swiss National Bank and the Bundesbank, are pretty relaxed with respect to their targets Sometimes one of them even abandons its targets And yet they do not lose credibility because there is that basic belief that they will achieve better stability   We have rebased every year through base drift only we do it nondeliberately rather than in this way   It seems to be a pretty widespread view that it is the budget that is responsible    2/1-2/82   I think the market looks ahead; and interest rates went up for no particular reason other than the budget   We do expose ourselves to [heavy] pressure if we say we are flexible And one has to take that into account I really prefer the flexibility, provided we can resist [the pressure]   The target is not too low; the base is too high   Well, I shall undertake this heavy responsibility I propose and nominate Paul A Volcker   Well, I propose and nominate in his absence Anthony M Solomon   I propose the Federal Reserve Bank of New York   I nominate Peter Sternlight and Sam Cross   Sam, could you expand a little on your statement that other countries felt that when they sold the dollar it had little effect, but that if the United States engaged in the same operation, it would have a major effect on market psychology?   Thank you   I note that we have had a relatively rare event namely, that the March projection seems to show an improvement both in progress on inflation and in growth Now, that by itself is almost implausible One would think that inflation is wound down by more slack in the economy And here it looks as though inflation is coming down more than previously expected, while growth is a little better than previously expected; it may be the effect of oil prices, which is an exogenous element  I would certainly agree that there's a great deal of uncertainty about any estimate now But other than that, it seems to me that there's a considerable degree of consensus about the most likely pattern namely, a bottoming out in the second or third quarter and then a rise There's some disagreement about the strength of the rise, but our projection now is coming closer to that of the Administration than it used to be So, in terms of the most probable course of events, there is a high degree of consensus The dispersion around that consensus is something else There is a high degree of uncertainty, but that is part of the process of winding down the inflation If everybody were completely sure of what he expected, there would not be a great deal of pressure on wages, prices, and financial behavior; and I think we have to accept this as part of the cost of the process and part of the cost of making progress [on inflation], which really has been quite remarkable to date   I would say it would be a good deal higher than I would have said a year or two ago I would have said a year or two ago, 1 or 2 percent Conceivably on a small issue it might even be negative because some portfolio managers would like it to diversify But today I think there is a realization that real rates, before taxes anyway, are pretty high So, I would say 3, 4, 5 percent, maybe   I'm starting from the premise that we're not going to get inflation down much more unless we can sustain some degree of pressure So, I think some degree of pressure is consistent with a moderate rate of growth I doubt that it's consistent with the 45 percent rate of growth of the GNP, not money supply, that the staff has forecast for the second half That is really quite a good growth rate, and in that environment I think concerns about excessive wage payments will yield very quickly to a feeling that now is the time to catch up--that people have made sacrifices and they need to be rewarded by compensatory higher increases Now, a policy of about 3 percent [real GNP growth] should allow for possibly some reduction in [un]employment It depends on productivity I think it carries some risks that a financial crisis might hit But as we look at the interest rate projections of the staff, they don't seem to indicate that the problem of the thrifts will be greatly alleviated no matter what we do There's the danger also that the dollar may go higher If we do damage to our exports, we may do damage to other countries that reflects back on us I think that danger is less because they are now beginning to realize that a high dollar is not so much of a risk for them and that they can afford to reduce their interest rates Now if one accepts, as I do, aiming at something like 3 percent real growth, then I think alternative A really lacks credibility It lacks credibility, anyway, in terms of our [long-run] targets because it    3/29-30/82  means that we're going to be above our targets for the rest of the year And we're going to have that held against us continually   Target [M1] would nevertheless be the key target that people will look at We will look at the M2 increasingly; I agree that we want to put greater weight on M2 partly because of the uncertainty surrounding M1 If one thinks that the growth of M1 is very low, one might conceptually add some of the money market mutual funds to it--10 percent or 20 percent of which surely are transactions balances--and that would produce a much better growth rate in M1 Now, there is a danger of making the same mistake Mrs Thatcher did that is, chasing an aggregate that is actually positively interest rate sensitive The harder you lean, the harder it blows; as sterling M3 grows, the more they tighten There is some danger, I think, in our situation of falling for that with M1 So, I would put somewhat less emphasis on M1, but I wouldn't ignore it   M1, because M1 contains a saving component   Well, it may have the same defect Either way, it would lead me to somewhere between "B" and "C" And I would not like to see interest rates go up at this point, so I would hesitate to go with a rise in borrowing But something like the present level of borrowing would seem to me appropriate and would move us toward getting back into our target ranges over the year   M1 could also be influenced by other things that change velocity We've been more often deceived by underestimating velocity gains than overestimating them And right now we see ahead of us two sources of velocity gain One is the continued money fund expansion; the other is sweeps We can't be sure we'll get that velocity, but I think it's less dangerous to bet on that than to bet on the opposite   It may be giving a false signal; the rate may go down first and then [go back up]   Well, if we have to support the long end of the market, I assume we can undo that at the short end so that we don't change the volume of reserves?   Well, before we depart massively from our targets, I think we ought to be very clear that that is the situation We can't start off with that assumption without evidence   This [problem] isn't happening because of high interest rates; he's having losses because he was short and rates have fallen   Gretchen, when you described the reaction of foreign central banks to the decline in the dollar, would that reaction be indicative that their concerns over high interest rates really are less based on US interest rates and more on conditions in their own countries?   Thank you   It's difficult to evaluate the qualitative gloom against the quantitative evidence, such as it is I wonder whether one reason for the great gloom is not the disastrous profit [experience] that people have been through in the first quarter Profits collapsed in the first quarter, as one can see from our data, and that is bound to impress people when the details come out; when corporate reports go out we may get some further impact from that But it seems to me we experienced this kind of psychology too in 1980, and then we were in the worst recession since World War II The economy was going down 10 percent per year Nothing seemed able to stop it As we know, it was "coldest just before daybreak" and it may turn out that way again There was a big difference in 1980 We had allowed interest rates to fall very sharply and that turned housing around very fast That [sort of rate decline] has not happened this time and to the extent that it was [induced by] policy, I think it was the right policy It is somewhat surprising that we're not getting the declines in interest rates that one would expect, given the rate of inflation But if the economy continues weak, that in itself, of course, would be a factor making for lower interest rates and for an improvement in housing  Now, the elements of strength in the situation, I'm sure we're all are familiar with I wish we didn't have to count on the  -21-    5/18/82  large tax cuts and social security increase as a kicker to the economy The upshot of all this is that hardly any forecasters are seeing a decline even for the second quarter After all I've heard here, one would expect the second quarter to be a disaster like the first, or worse Our projection is coming down, but is not yet negative; even if the second quarter were a small negative, which wouldn't surprise me, the decline would be slowing I find it difficult, with all these elements [of strength] ahead for the third quarter, to think that we are facing a great risk of continued decline [in overall economic activity] What we're facing, I think, is the prospect of a very moderate advance and the possibility of choking that off The possibility of the economy going down, barring a financial crisis such as we've talked about here today, seems to me the lesser probability Thank you   Well, I would like to remind you that this is probably the low point on inflation that we're going to reach in this cycle From here on out visible inflation--[as reflected in] the indexes--is going to rise I know that the underlying inflation rate isn't as low as the indexes show and that that underlying inflation is likely to continue coming down Nevertheless, from now on out the newspapers are going to be reporting that inflation has started again Who was it that did it? I'll give you three guesses!  So, I fear that we're in some danger of repeating past performance and that we may shift to an accommodative if not expansive stance too early And things need not improve, unemployment wise, under such a scenario Mrs Thatcher now has 12 percent unemployment and she had up to 20 percent interest rates That may happen to us the next time around if we start the next expansion from the present level of inflation I do agree with those who say that our job is to get interest rates down We need to get credibility for what we've been doing Interest rates in real terms are surprisingly high and I think this is largely because people don't trust what has been accomplished so far They see inflation accelerating again They look at inflation as something on the order of at least 10 percent per year over the long run I don't see great [problems] in maintaining a degree of pressure at this time Monetary policy really hasn't been very tight given that it is operating at very high interest rates We're above our M1 target We have not made a dramatic effort to get back into it as we did a year ago in April The concerns that the targets might be too low to accommodate a reasonable rate of growth of nominal GNP have been largely removed We're now looking at nominal GNP growth of 6 to 7 percent; a target at a peak 5-1/2 percent plus a normal gain in velocity of 2 or 3 percent clearly would accommodate that and even would allow, possibly, for some decline in interest rates  Finally, the danger of provoking a severe downturn seems to me to be protected against--not guaranteed against, obviously--both by the endogenous workings of the economy, such as the inventory turnaround, financial endogenous factors such as the possible drop in interest rates if the economy stays very weak, and the exogenous factors of the tax cut and social security increase So, it seems to me that we could continue to pursue a policy of moderate restraint until the economy turns I would lean--I'm not always to be going for "C"--toward something like "B-" That would mean to me a funds rate range of 11 to 16 percent instead of the 12 to 16 percent associated with "C;" I'd shade the range on the low side because we do want to get rates down And for the borrowing assumption I think $800 million is peculiarly low and I would opt for something around $1 billion Thank you  -39-    5/18/82   I would stress the difference between the law and the resolution If they pass a resolution, it seems to me clear that they didn't want to pass a law   I see a recovery as much more likely than continued stagnation I guess I don't differ too much in that from what others have said There are risks on the down side, perhaps in the form of unforeseeable financial shocks or perhaps in the form of a gradual attrition of investment spending I would remind you that, unfortunately, this is going to be the shape of the future if the budget doesn't come into better balance There will be less investment in the economy than we normally would expect and more consumption, which we will get as a result of the tax cut So, a shift to that posture is not all that unexpected On the other hand, there may be some factors that do help sustain investment The financing gap is moving toward zero Cash flow is strong, although unfortunately not from profits So, I see a greater prospect of a continued recovery than of a resumption of the downturn We are probably at the bottom of the recession At that point everything looks very bad in absolute terms, in level terms In terms of rates of change, obviously, things have improved a great deal Things are flattening out now And I think one ought to look at them in terms of the rates of change rather than in terms of the levels Meanwhile, we're shifting from a situation where we've done better so far on inflation than on growth and employment, which again seem to be    6/30-7/1/82  becoming the less achieved objectives I fear that we're reaching the low point of inflation and may find it rising from here on out and in this I differ somewhat from the staff forecast We will get to a stage where we'll be telling each other at subsequent meetings that we did better on growth and the unemployment rate, but unfortunately worse on inflation That leads me to think that we need to maintain a degree of pressure in order to continue wringing out the inflation   Well, we do We miss every conceivable goal but in the optimum manner of what we can do with one tool; we can't hit them all As for the strategic decisions, it seems to me we should not be rigid If we need an increase in the ranges, we need it and should do it It's not clear to me that the loss of our credibility from overshooting is any less bad than the loss of our credibility from raising the ranges when it looks as if [we are] caving in There is a reason for thinking that these targets may be too low The logic of our approach involving a steady money growth and, therefore, cyclically varying interest rates is that in a recession interest rates should come down very sharply They did in 1980; they have not done so now And that raises the question of whether these ranges are indeed too low But on the other side, I see factors that are likely to make them more adequate First, going into recovery will accelerate velocity Second, various technological changes that may be ahead ought to tend to accelerate velocity Historically, we've been fooled more often by underestimating velocity gains than by overestimating them I realize either risk is possible, but if I had to make a decision, I would bet on the rise in velocity Accordingly, I would be cautious in changing the ranges   Who signs the Mexican letter?   Is there evidence that the president has changed his mind on going to the IMF--that he isn't just going to fire those two people?   What is $600 million going to accomplish, granted that we owe them good relations and have ongoing relationships with them? They need nearly twice that a month And if they don't get money from any other source, particularly until late in the year, I don't see how they can avoid either a devaluation in very chaotic conditions of inflation already, default on the debt, or exchange control   It is a very broad political objection in Latin America They are not at all positive with respect to the IMF, to put it very mildly So, I don't think the president, either this one or the next one, has a great deal of leeway He has to face a hostile political opinion   It's a futile question   Well, I don't think this is the time to make a fundamental change in policy We may come to that; it may turn out that we can't stay our course But right now we have an expected recovery; it's not in the bag but there is a broad consensus that things are turning around So, why at this time convey signals that I think would be deeply alarming to the market? Now, I agree that interest rates are too high But I see them as too high to allow the economy to operate at a decent level of investment I don't believe that these interest rates necessarily are going to bring on a financial crisis If there is a financial crisis, I think it will come as a result of some specific circumstance--whether it's the Home Loan Banks or something that happens in Mexico or something else But I don't think the present level of interest rates is unsustainable for somewhat longer for a great majority of businesses Furthermore, I'm not convinced at all that we would get very much benefit on interest rates if we eased now in a way that is visible to the market At the short end, yes, for a while But what do we do then next year when rates begin to rise again and we have to pay the bill for what we are trying to buy right now? At the long end it's very doubtful what would happen to rates Maybe a signal that we care about rates--a signal that we're not going to tolerate an increase in rates--would be favorable, but the market could just as well react in the opposite direction if people think we are pegging rates again They will think we are going to flood the economy with liquidity as we've done in the past; and we may be shooting ourselves in the foot I have a similar uneasiness about announcing a tolerance for an overshoot It's very  -50-    6/30-7/1/82  difficult to decide whether it's better to change the ranges, which I said yesterday I might be prepared to do, or just to keep overshooting If we declare that we're willing to overshoot, we're going in the direction of the temporary debt ceiling--the permanent debt ceiling is hundreds of billions below the temporary one--and we'll always be looking at the tolerated range, which may be very high, and have a formal range that is low I don't think that would be a viable posture  Given all this, I think we have a chance now of getting back on track somewhere by the fall or by the end of the year If these new numbers hold, we could even do it by September, but I'm not all that bent on doing that I favor alternative B with, say, $1 billion of borrowing and M1 at 5 percent--and the path set to accommodate the expected July bulge so that it doesn't drive up interest rates immediately--and the funds rate range as it is here It wouldn't be the end of the world if the funds rate went to 16 percent I do think that things would change very dramatically if it were known that we have capped the rate and are willing to put in any amount of reserves in order to hold it there So, an 11 to 16 percent range seems reasonable to me   But if it got there, we would provide unlimited reserves?   On a net basis you're saying?   It's going to reduce our exports, which is going to reduce the value of the dollar   Eventually; we don't know exactly when   Well, since Nancy mentioned the dollar, I should mention inflation It has been mentioned no more often than the dollar has in our discussion The economy has turned around--I'm looking at Joe Livingston's list of 54 economists who say it turned around in May--and we're now getting ready to do what we weren't prepared to do all the first half of the year   That's right   Well, the explicit reference to liquidity preference is reasonable since we're banking on a rise in velocity here If that doesn't come in, accommodation is appropriate   I don't think anybody will go broke over the difference between 15 and 16 percent The one area where there has been steady and really disastrous pressure of interest rates is the thrifts, and that is where precisely the least has happened   If we trigger what seems like a severe bulge in the money supply, interest rates would go up anyway   People are sensitive to bulges not only for the week [If we] say we will tolerate [bulges], they may be sensitive even to our saying that we will tolerate them   Would it be a temporary overshoot so that it wouldn't in principle raise the base for next year?   We usually look at the midpoint and we're operating already at the upper end conceptually   To follow up Mr Solomon's point, in your judgment how often were there cases of disorder in the market?   [Unintelligible] meaningful reduction   But easing under this framework can only mean a constant monetary policy with interest rates falling because of smaller government borrowing Looking to the distant future, any    6/30-7/1/82  increase in money growth that isn't for a very short period can only lead to higher interest rates via higher inflation   In the long run there's very little support for that view because even the people who would argue this for the short run believe in the long-run neutrality of money and that more money therefore just means higher prices, not higher output Now, if we are told to do this for a year and then everything changes and we go back to the old targets, that is at least intellectually defensible   And there is no way we could cure that situation by accelerating the money supply   You can write your Congressman!  -95-    6/30-7/1/82   You may get a technically oriented question along these lines If stimulus is withdrawn through a lower deficit, is the reduction in interest rates that follows from that sufficient to counter that withdrawn stimulus? And you'd have to stretch a point considerably in order to say yes You really have to assume that investment is enormously responsive to a decline in interest rates for that to happen So, on a temporary basis, one cannot deny that a reduction in the deficit generates some reduction in expansion But the difficulty of getting back on track with monetary policy is always the primary thing And the fine-tuning that we can do for a half-year or a year seems to lead us back to where we used to be   It's not true in the long run  SPEAKER(?) I'll agree with it   We help by not absorbing that by a faster reduction of the money supply   Perhaps we could offer not to cut the aggregates the following year   Well, I listen a great deal to the accord of [1951], which is--  SPEAKER(?) That's a profane remark, Henry!   This tradeoff of fiscal versus monetary policy exists, of course, in the old framework where monetary policy is interest rates and fiscal policy is fiscal policy But when monetary  -98-    6/30-7/1/82  policy is money supply, there's only one thing that influences interest rates, and that's fiscal policy   Real [interest rates], that's right Yes   We want to bear in mind that Mexico a few years ago was a reasonably viable country without oil At the same time there is a basic economy that can function; the oil is an addition   Well, I certainly agree that we need to do all we can to help the economy and to help the markets At the same time, we have to look ahead What we do now will affect the economy with a lag anyway I don't think we've seen the end of the effects of the tax cut I don't see any reason to change the basic projection even though things are coming in more slowly than one would have thought I think we are in some danger of doing what we have done very often at the depth of a recession, at the trough, which is to stimulate more strongly than turns out in the course of time to have been wise Now, we ought to avoid a rise in short-term rates or reversing the present low level To me that suggests not pushing for a lower level at this time I'm not too concerned about lowering the M1 path for the three- month period that we're in from 5 percent to 4 percent because even that still leaves us almost exactly at the upper end of the 5-1/2 percent M1 range [for the year] And M2 and M3 are very high [in their ranges] anyway, although they have particular reasons for being that way I also want to remind you that, historically, a period of relatively low interest rates leads to an increase in money growth some months later, which is the last thing we need to have happen at the end of this year or early next year  I am troubled by the gap between the funds rate and the discount rate A funds rate below the discount rate is always taken as a signal that there ought to be a cut in the discount rate But all that happens is that the funds rate falls some more and the signal remains in existence I would, therefore, prefer a higher borrowing level to reduce that gap or eliminate it One could offset the consequences of that, in order not to get tightening effects, by lowering the discount rate There must be some drop in the discount rate that would offset a moderately higher borrowing level I'm not thinking of anything sensational, say, $400 million perhaps  Finally, as to the longer-term rate of money growth, I would like to point out that if you look at the projections in the Greenbook throughout 1983 there is hardly a quarter over 8 percent for nominal GNP; it runs from 6 to about 8 percent In other words, with [growth] at the upper end of our existing targets and really very moderate increases in velocity, we'll be able to accommodate that rate of [GNP] growth Now, this may be optimistic with regard to the inflation forecast implicit in these very low nominal GNP growth projections, but that seems to be at least a possibility So, I would vote for something like "B" and particularly a $400 million borrowing level But I would predicate that on the possibility of reducing the discount rate   I think we're giving altogether too much emphasis to the range It's the intention that lies behind the range that matters I understand perfectly well what the intention is and I think it's the right intention at this time Maybe Chuck's problem could be met by the Chairman declaring his intention to call on the Committee if these conditions arise   They will only know that [in October]   Well, they probably will think when they read this seven weeks from now that we thought the banking system was even more delicate than it had appeared to the market I'm not sure that that is a good signal to give them ex post   You have an impressively low inflation prediction In evaluating the impact of interest rates on investment, business, and housing, does that mean that you're also looking at a higher real rate and consequently a greater restraint on investment than other observers?   I think a fairly persuasive way of answering a question about how all those countries are going to pay back all the money is to say that basically these countries--and I'm speaking not of the East bloc--are viable They can produce enough to take care of their needs They may go through a difficult time, but it's a question of the policies that they pursue and, therefore, how they can be influenced by the IMF rather than whether they can It is possible for them to meet their obligations   I'm sorry I feel like turning it around and saying it is a sufficient but not absolutely necessary condition We can find equilibrium at the level of some degree of recession   That is true [The world economy] doesn't have to keep going down all the time   Well, it's very doubtful that we can change the [exchange rate] level substantially unless there are policies that support it   One would think that the market would observe the outlook for [some period] to come and tumble to the implications of that after a while   There was still some hope then that we could get within the target ranges for the year This time it looks very doubtful that without a self-defeating effort we would get M1 within its target range   I think we have to detach temporarily from M1 because it has become so uncertain both because of the all savers certificates bulge and the new instrument coming along Even if that bulge were not to occur, we would have the new instrument and we    10/5/82  simply don't know [its likely effect]; all we know is that it could be very major We can put more stress on the evidence of rising liquidity preference, and that gives us the opportunity to target on M2 with a proviso that if it exceeds [our expectations], we'll take this as evidence of an increase in liquidity preference and not follow up with interest rates That seems to me perfectly defensible substantively and still within the formal framework of our policy   We have made that switch, though not quite as explicitly; nevertheless, we've made it from time to time We have placed more weight on M2 at times   Well, I feel very much that we would be better off if interest rates were lower The question is How do we get from here to there? The wisest thing, if we wanted to get there, would be that we shouldn't start from here That option isn't open to us We have to get there without sacrificing all that we've created in the last year in terms of credibility and a framework for giving people confidence So, I think we should still have a money supply directive not, as this looks to me, a money market or interest rate directive I think we should give up temporarily on M1, which is beset by all the uncertainties of the all savers certificates and the new instrument That doesn't mean we wouldn't go back to it Logically, M1 is the best of the aggregates We should stress liquidity preference more than the alternative directive does by putting a reference to it at the beginning of the last sentence, indicating that there is mounting evidence that exceptional liquidity demands are upon us   The last sentence Instead of starting with "Somewhat more rapid," I would say "In the light of mounting evidence that economic and financial uncertainties are continuing to lead to exceptional liquidity demands, somewhat more rapid growth in the broader aggregates would be tolerated" So, we allow for an overshoot of M2, which is the one thing I would suggest that we target   Well, I think there is   It seems clear that velocity, instead of rising as had been expected, is--   As you look at the behavior of velocity over the year, it does not--   Well, I think it is a defensible argument I would suggest that we drop the reference in the first sentence of the second paragraph to the expansion of bank reserves and reduced pressures but shape the M2 path in such a way that we would have a gradual decline in interest rates We would have to formulate the borrowing assumption to make that feasible I can't do it off the top of my head; I don't know just what that would be I would make the funds range narrow to reflect the fact that we are backing away from money supply targets And we could cap it at 10 percent, if that were really necessary All it would mean is that we would consult, and at times like this we ought to consult more frequently anyway That's how I would structure the directive   Depository surprise   We might say, "suggest that no substantial weight be placed"   It has to be small enough to justify not having a target for it, which is really very small   Well, the last sentence of this paragraph leads into M2 and what one expects in the following paragraph then is an M2 target Now, if that's not what we're going to do, it seems to me we  -59-    10/5/82  ought to modify the last sentence of the first paragraph But I really would urge you, if it isn't tampering too much, to put the 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent M2 range early in the next sentence and then after that to say "taking account of the desirability of somewhat reduced pressures"   I think that's a great improvement That mitigates the appearance of a shift in policy priorities   With the sentences at the end it can run over or it can run under; nothing makes any difference   I would prefer to leave them in They balance each other and they justify an overrun or an underrun   I would have put the second part of the last sentence first so that the sentence would read, beginning with the middle of the second line, "In the light of evidence that economic and financial uncertainties are continuing to lead to exceptional liquidity demands"   Well, I meant to say that there is evidence and that is--   I don't want to press this very hard There is a parallelism between the two sentences The first says "somewhat slower growth" and the other says "somewhat more rapid growth" And that makes it look more understandable I would like to see something about rising liquidity demands Granted, there are some questions about that But that seems to me to give us a better argument for being flexible about the targets  -64-    10/5/82   If we drop it, that would convey less of an interest-rate-oriented directive And I think it's desirable to avoid being very specific about our interest rate [objective] here   I think that might mislead the market Following our past practice, we aimed at the middle of the range and, therefore, if we said 7 to 10-1/2 percent, we really meant 8-3/4 percent as the starting point   We are at a time when we are softening the money supply aspect of the directive; it would be a fair balance if we also soften the interest rate aspect of it   It would mean that we would be on the phone tomorrow if we say 10 percent   Well, I hope there's a strong presumption--  SPEAKER(?) That's too long   Well, the nature of this deficit is that it is the result of a high dollar, and the high dollar is the result of people wanting to get into the dollar, forcing, as it were, the financing of the deficit on us for the time being instead of wondering whether they ought to finance it That is what I think keeps the dollar up in the face of this prospect of a huge deficit   Well, one way of putting what you said is that the funds rate is now an endogenous variable Is it the result of trying to restrain M2 with reserves, or is it the other way--that we move the funds rate and try to restrain M2 and that more or less gives us the reserve level that is needed?    11/16/82   We at one time had a Committee on the Directive which got together when there were changes of this kind Conceivably, we could revive that   Do you think an amount of that magnitude would affect the yield structure?   I think some people will say "I hear the Treasury is issuing these bonds and the Fed buys them"   I am a little skeptical of this What would happen if you postponed this?    11/16/82   I think you should do a mixed bag of short- medium- and long-term issues   If we're going to do it this week, it would be better to do it today   I think I'll vote against it if it's pure coupon purchases If it's just to add a billion dollars [to the intermeeting limit], I can't be against that   No, I'll withdraw my objection   Well, we're not thinking in terms of interest rates very much We should remember that when we used to do this we allowed for a lag of 6 to 9 months before [the economy] turned I would think these lags have shortened, particularly in housing, and expectations tend to shorten them But this fall in interest rates wasn't all that long ago that we could expect very great results by now   I, like everybody, would like to see lower interest rates But what is the way to get them? The basic reason they are so high, I think, is indeed that the targets were too tight; they were calculated on the expectation of something like 3 percent velocity gains and we've had the opposite So there is less money in  -26-    11/16/82  the economy than there should be unless this turns out to be a temporary situation, as it quite conceivably may We have suspended M1 temporarily; I think targeting on M2 is a good thing to state as a principle, but it's not a very easy thing to do operationally The basic decisions we have to make are about the funds rate and the borrowing assumption I think we have a certain degree of leeway as far as departing from the targets is concerned The market has responded, I think, very well to our statement that we weren't going to adhere closely to M1 It hasn't had the effect of causing the long-term rate to go up, which would be the interpretation of a strict monetarist position; the long-term rate has come down How long this condition will continue is a real question Bob Eggert asked this question of his forty economists and got a response that no doubt ranges from 0 to infinity But eliminating the [outliers], he arrived at seven months as the period of time over which perhaps a departure would be accepted by the market before people would begin to become uneasy and long-term [rate movements] would begin to become perverse So, we have some leeway and we must make the optimum use of it I'd be reluctant to spend it all right away and reluctant particularly to do what the market seems to want and to expect us to do right away, which does look like throwing the book at the recession now So, I would like to postpone a more drastic action and would go with "B"   I would like to see that phrase removed   That's very important, because otherwise we are in fact implicitly still giving weight to M1   I think we should say "continues to be" to refer back to what we said earlier   That includes telephone meetings?   I have been sympathetic to this proposal in the past It has a lot of merit What gives me pause is the argument in this memorandum about the impact on the policy process We have some experience with open meetings The public sits right there They scribble, but they're not allowed to speak and, as far as I can see, have no real impact on our deliberations It certainly doesn't embarrass me to say what I say I have a sense that if I knew the next day there might be a hearing or that there might be a great press reaction, I would find it more difficult both to think and to decide, [particularly] to decide to do something drastic Most of the time there's nothing to it It's the critical instances where one worries   It's very desirable to discuss this Maybe we should take it up again at a future time when things are not quite so tense I think we are doing something that we shouldn't be doing if there weren't strong reasons We owe the public That is the key more than the leak issue is the key But I think the reasons against it are persuasive at this time  -68-    11/16/82   The not helping speculators is a better public posture It is a less good argument   Well, I share Bob Black's comments on the paper I think it's a very fine paper, and not only because I agree with most of what is in it But it does not make it very obvious where we should go from here   I would like to note that if you want a survey of targeting possibilities, some are not in the paper While I    12/20-21/82  wouldn't recommend these, I think there are serious contenders One, on the basis of the research done here at the Board, is that the use of intermediate targets is inefficient and that better and more precise results can be obtained by targeting on the real sector directly On the other hand, there are many arguments against that, including the political one, but it is something that one ought to bear in mind as one makes these choices Also, I note that there is nothing in the paper about exchange rates Again, while I don't think exchange rates are a proper target for this economy, they are targets that are used in other countries, in the EMS countries for instance That again is something to think about I would think certainly that exchange rates might play a greater role in our targeting in the future than they have We have a little sentence [on them] in the directive but not much attention is paid to them Finally, there is a reference to nominal GNP You may recall that Martin Feldstein came here a few weeks ago and gave us a talk recommending that we target on that I think that's dangerous advice It means playing God, and the central bank should be a humble technician administering the aggregates and not trying to say what nominal GNP is to be  On M1, I share all the points made in the paper I think we have to wait and see if we should use it, if it becomes viable again What I hear from the market is that the money market deposit accounts may prove more attractive or may be made more attractive by the banks than the Super NOW accounts, but we will have to wait and see Certainly M1 is the one element in money supply targeting that to me carries any real conviction; with M1 we are dealing with transactions balances and there is some reason to think that they do guide the economy--of course, always through interest rates On interest rate targeting, which is rejected in the paper, the way I feel is that they are what we should target on if we had the knowledge and no political difficulties But we have a great difficulty, of course, in deciding what the right rate is and it would be difficult to sustain it in the face of opposition But since I believe the economy runs on interest rates, not on money, it is in one sense better to target directly on interest rates than it is to target on money and let money determine interest rates  Well, to come to what is doable, I think M2 is our best bet in the short run We have to keep it very flexible with a wide range around it It is attractive in the sense that trying to control it produces large changes in interest rates which control the economy effectively even though we do not control the M2 aggregate itself very effectively We may have to accept considerable deviations The base, I think, perhaps deserves a little more support than we've given it here, particularly the nonborrowed base Fundamentally, of course, the base is currency and it's hard to believe that the economy runs on currency However, currency is about the best behaved variable we have because it's the one about which the least is known! Most of these $500 dollars per capita that we have in the form of currency presumably isn't active in the American economy--[it's in other countries such as] Mexico or destroyed The base, because it is a fairly stable aggregate, is a safe aggregate to target on and one that would not give us a great deal of trouble, particularly because we can make allowances for misadventures to currency such as [possible] large shipments to Argentina or a boom in the underground economy But other than that, I think the nonborrowed base has something to commend it On credit, I feel the same way as the paper does It is  -17-    12/20-21/82  informative; it has meaning but it is technically difficult The data are poor, late, and subject to revision And it is difficult to control So, I would go for a credit aggregate larger than bank credit as an associated device Thank you   Well, as I contemplate setting a price goal, were we to put the CPI at 350, then aim at it for five years and overshoot, we would then have to bring that price level down   Yes, the price level, of course, is a part of the real sector and that's what we need, I agree But I think that is where the emphasis on using instruments protects us against the failures that are almost certain if we were to target on prices   We seem to be talking about the difference between the proviso and the rule We've switched from this in the past, as you know We had an interest rate rule provided the aggregates or reserves didn't violate some constraint; then we moved the other way We had a money supply rule provided the funds rate didn't violate some constraint I think we're somewhat in this area here There is a difference in saying we have an M2 target, which we qualify by a number of other things, and saying we are looking at a lot of things but we hope that M2 or some other monetary target comes out right and we will try to effectuate that There is a difference even though the two [approaches] meet somewhere in the middle   I might have to state the associated increase in inflation   Well, in comparing ours with those, I hope we can stretch the ranges as against the central tendency   Well, this is partly a reflection of the fact that we don't participate in situations like Hungary and very marginally only in situations like Yugoslavia So, they feel they have their clients and we have our clients; that is working out to our disadvantage right now, but it was to our advantage earlier   It would open up a new swap relationship?   That wasn't the language that was used   The IMF programs have always been on the assumption that they do not finance the country fully but they turn the country around so that it becomes bankable again Now, what is happening here, as I would interpret it, is that they are pulling that moment somewhat forward rather than waiting a year until the bankability is demonstrated They ask for the money right away   It's the reserve path that decides--   Building the shift into the number in alternative two seems to me to take away some of the virtue of alternative two, which is that it allows for what we think ought to be the right number but then allows for an overrun in case [a shift occurs] It seems to me that is in many ways preferable But if we also raise the number, then we've taken the high number from alternative one and we still have the overrun of alternative two   I would prefer the 8-1/2 or 8 percent for that reason It keeps separate the original unadjusted number and the shift   Do you figure $100 million [in borrowing] is equal to 25 basis points [on the funds rate]?   What would be the evaluation of the market if they could perceive this correctly? Is this somewhat similar to the latest discount rate action?    12/20-21/82   Well, that is what I'm asking Is it that or will it be seen as another push and does it run the risk of being counterproductive at the long end?   Paul?   You remember that the textbook says that when there's a shock to the money supply side, go with interest rates In a way this is what has been happening Now, the shock may settle down at the new higher level and then one can demonstrate that the demand for money has increased, everything else constant One can go on from there and go back to the aggregates If it turns out that the demand for money comes down again from this shock level, then one would have to take account of that and settle on new aggregate targets at a lower level It would be very difficult to diagnose But right now we're clearly in a situation of a money supply shock situation, which we shouldn't allow to feed through to the real sector   Aren't the swings in productivity in manufacturing larger than they are for the whole spectrum including services?   Aren't these past data very much influenced by interest rate patterns? In the past we've had sharply rising interest rates early in recoveries We don't assume that this time, so we ought to get rather different--   I think this expansion in 1983 is, to perhaps an unusual degree, a composite of strengths and weaknesses And from rather modest strengths, a picture of an expanding economy has been put together in the face of some very powerful negatives, especially a weakness in exports and a slowness in business fixed investment The only unusually strong element that one wouldn't have counted on in other expansions is what Governor Teeters mentioned We have a very large deficit and we're adding to it, and that is a somewhat unusual feature Now, if you look at the things that are slow, exports and business investment, there is something in reserve that at some point is likely to kick in--for exports, I guess, with a fair  -12-    2/8-9/83  predictability, and for investment depending on interest rates and how businessmen feel and how cautious they're going to be I think we have at least the makings of getting much more strength on the up side than seems likely That is, the error, if any, might very well be on the down side Maybe we are not giving enough weight to the possibilities of a combination of stronger factors But on the down side I would say we have a variety of small elements that have carried a very modest expansion so far and seem likely to put a base under what we're likely to achieve I don't see the danger of sagging or falling back, as it were The caution of businessmen in the investment area to me looks more nearly like an element of strength-- something that's going to change And if it changes more in the upward than the downward direction--if we can get a rise without that happening now--I think we certainly have the makings of a continued expansion   I wanted to follow up on this While I basically share the staff's view about the dollar, nevertheless, one has to bear in mind that our prospective current account deficit is not the kind of deficit that historically has caused currencies to go down It's not the result of domestic mismanagement, inflation, and so on It's the result of forces that otherwise strengthen the currency--reduction in inflation and tight monetary management So it's not quite clear that under those conditions a current account deficit is bound to depress a currency the way it does when that    2/8-9/83  deficit comes from other factors I still think the chances are that it will, and so I share the forecast But I think one has to bear the other possibility in mind   I'd like to put forth just two or three very simple propositions I think the case for money supply targets remains that they are a better protection for the central bank than other forms of targets or no targets at all Even though the experience we've had in the past year might disillusion one quite substantially, and even though one might have believed all the time that it's interest rates and not the money supply that govern the economy, I think the Congress has given us this mandate to use money supply targets and an opportunity to do something that is publicly much easier to defend than an arbitrary setting of interest rates So, I would continue with the targets  I think the uncertainty that has been revealed during the year in terms of the behavior of velocity is so great that we do have to give ourselves more leeway But I would look for that leeway in a wider range around the midpoint that continues to be whatever we think is the most likely single course for that aggregate If instead of 3 percentage points we have 5 percentage points [as the width of the ranges], it seems to me that under the circumstances, given what has been observed by the public about the aggregates, that would be acceptable and understandable Our task, then, would be to arrive at some conception of what the midpoints are of the aggregates on which we want to target I think we can either put M1 on ice temporarily or make it relatively innocuous by having a wide range around it that gives us flexibility And we could have additional flexibility by saying that at midyear we may want to review that That may be a trade-off, so to speak, for a lesser width of the ranges   I feel the same way It seems to me flexibility appears at all margins, and here's one more--the width of the range--where we ought to allow for it   I think 6 to 10 percent would be a little more--   Well, it gains you two things One is the greater leeway and the other is a lower midpoint   But the uncertainties are so great on M1 that if we don't want to express them by some qualification of it as a target, then I think we need a wider range   The previous midpoint was 4 percent, with the 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range We can achieve that midpoint by the admittedly rather extravagant range of 1 to 7 percent Then we haven't raised our target any time   I think that's the right way of looking at it The question is How much credit expansion can the economy stand without inflation? And the sad fact is the government limits the amount that the private sector can have We have to recognize that by limiting the total credit expansion   Well, we have the other targets that would prevent that anyway But I think what you're saying, Lyle, is that the deficit really is cutting very deeply into permissible private credit expansion There's no way of getting around that by saying that we will have more private credit expansion anyway That would let the total become excessive   But those were years of much higher rates of inflation, weren't they?   It's the percent that counts here and not the dollars   To give it a 2-point range when the others are mostly 3 points I think gives it a special status that will be regarded as being particularly confining when we really mean it's particularly loose   Well, the aggregate responds very little to inflation Otherwise, it should be 5 percentage points lower now than it was at its peak   It's very hard to say anything about the balance of payments; still, something should be said And then we'll in effect have to say something about the dollar   I think we ought to say something here to indicate that these ranges are more uncertain than in the past since we haven't quite said that except for Ml   No, I think this states that--   Where we ought to be guided in choosing these options is that for a while we'd just be looking at it and it may be very high It can't go on very high indefinitely   Yes, the degree changes over time    2/8-9/83   I find confusing the reference to credit flows Is that specifically what we mention as total--   It's on page 4 We have "Credit flows, while not directly targeted, will be evaluated" Are these credit flows the total domestic nonfinancial debt? If so, then I think we ought to repeat that because the way it is stated in the earlier paragraph, it looks like a quasi-target And here we are saying we are not targeting it directly   But the distinction is that "associated range" is the same as "not directly targeting"   Yes It's only known to this group   Exactly   That leads to this--  -79-    2/8-9/83   I would agree with that    2/8-9/83   I think it would take a real collapse of the growth rate of the aggregates to justify reducing interest rates under present conditions That could happen; we shouldn't preclude it But if the aggregates remain half-way strong and the economy expands moderately, I don't think that's the time to reduce interest rates   If we can find language to define the aggregates   If the issue is posed "Do we look at the economy or do we not?" we have to say we look at the economy and not just at these aggregates So, that's why when that issue comes up I can't vote any other way   I would not put numbers in here because it's so uncertain, but I would refer to the longer-term ranges and say if the actual numbers fall significantly below most of those and we have a collapse in the aggregates then, yes, [we would ease] But if they are just more or less in the ballpark, I would want easing precluded   If we refer to the totality of our many targets in a broad way so that M2 can be seen as being exempted if necessary, one gets a sense of what I think we ought to aim at amongst the aggregates   Is the holding of a foreign currency resulting from interest receipts defined as intervention or is the nonholding-- that is, the disposing of that--defined as intervention in your report? You know what I mean   But it seems to me sensible to provide for that in case they give us a little leeway   Yes   And in the process that would create problems of protectionism and a larger current account deficit for us   You know, we have a directive--   And it is always directed against countering disorder, so you're--   It seems to me that fragility is almost inherent in this kind of expansion and one should not be too surprised to see that The sectors that can move up at a time like this typically are interest-sensitive; that is, housing and automobiles typically start up at this time since they've become very much a matter of interest rates So, to find that those are the areas that have been moving the economy more strongly than others is not surprising It doesn't seem to me to suggest that it is fragile in any sense other than that other previous expansions have been fragile If we had all the other factors moving right now--if consumption were moving forward on a broad base, if we weren't losing from exports, and if inventories were turning around strongly--we would have a very booming situation and that wouldn't be conducive to sustainability So I think as far as we've gone, with rather limited impulses, we've done quite well We should be concerned about the possibility of excess [spending] as well as the possibility that it might weaken I don't think fragility is a particular warning at this time   I think that Steve has posed the issue very correctly We have the evidence of a very strong monetary expansion On the other side is a high real interest rate Which of the two is what really drives the economy? Now, if I were to follow through the monetary implications of the recent monetary upsurge, I would have to say that the monetarist view is that half a year later the real sector would begin to move strongly If that were to be the case, then we'd see something stirring now and certainly have very strong second and third quarters, which we don't seem to expect, and a couple of years later prices would begin to expand This is an empirical finding There is no logical reason why that should happen unless over two years we reach a level of unemployment at which prices do begin to react to a continued monetary expansion So, the analysis of what this bulge in the money supply is likely to do does not seem to me to be very plausible at the present time We don't see the real sector effect before us now And the price effect farther down the road would occur, it seems to me, if by that time unemployment had come down to an inflationary level But that is not very likely, even over two years So the bulge in the money supply to me seems to be less persuasive as a predictor of what is going to happen than is the level of real interest rates The level of real interest rates does seem to be high It may not be as high as present indexes indicate I think  -43-    3/28-29/83  people like to think of long-term inflation as well above 5 percent, maybe 6 or maybe 7 percent That seems to be the findings of the Bache-Prudential survey So, real rates may not be as high as they seem on the basis of present indexes, but they are still substantial And that, I think, is what dominates the situation and is giving us probably a moderate recovery  Why it is that we're experiencing these great increases in the aggregates is something I don't understand [I don't know] why the model predicts so differently what shifts may be taking place But it doesn't seem to me to be the kind of thing that is likely to generate the usual future consequences of high money growth So, I don't see an immediate need to bring down the growth of the aggregates sharply to within their ranges On the other hand, I like the idea of going back to a money supply target even though I recognize we can do exactly the same thing with an interest rate target We can have a money supply target if we qualify the money supply target adequately The way the [staff's draft wording] is formulated in the square brackets does seem to qualify the money supply targets in a very complete form That is to say If we undershoot, resist that; if we overshoot, let it run One could not be more accommodative than I interpret that formulation But I would prefer going back to the aggregates because I feel very uneasy with interest rate pegging just on general principles It has been an unfortunate thing in the past Tony may have confidence that we can shift gears in a timely way--and I take it that that's your ultimate intention--but interest rate targeting has had a bad history It will not look good in the record and is I think in the long run surely inflationary So, I'd rather get away from it as soon as I can   That's right We have flexibility   I don't think we want [to target on] free reserves in principle, whether positive or negative, because they really reach far back into the Federal Reserve's past and are associated with some outstanding misconceptions   Is this your interpretation of the qualifications in alternative II that is, that somewhat faster monetary growth would be tolerated?   Well, I could go along with that  -65-    3/28-29/83   Whether we committed any--   We're proposing exceptions to that   6 to 8 percent is getting a little high   It's more than I like   I would favor something that points in the direction of consultation rather than automaticity if the case arises   Yes That's what it does and why I favor it   We've been at about $250 million for a long time, so it doesn't hurt much   I would like to hear at least the previously bracketed sentences   Mr Chairman, this is Henry It seems to me we've reversed ourselves here The main concerns of the present time are on the international side and there's quite a bit of reason for trying to get to lower real rates Domestically I see very little The economy seems to be moving slowly but fairly stably So we have now a situation where international considerations urge ease but domestic considerations do not In short, I think we ought to wait    4/29/83   You refer to variations in the level of borrowing and in the demand for excess [reserves] Can you say what the market tends to think is our present target? Do they think it is any part of the money supply or do they think it's the funds rate or the level of borrowing or free reserves?   So they attach more importance, apparently, to excess reserves than the FOMC technique seems to give them    5/24/83   I think one needs to factor into the exchange rate situation the possibility at least of another boiling up of the international situation and the impact on the banks As things are developing, our banks are likely to be more vulnerable if something like that were to happen, partly because of the heavy involvement in Latin America and partly because they seem to have made less preparation in provisioning against losses than some European banks So there might be deposit withdrawals in such a case Now, whether that means also withdrawals out of the dollar into another currency or just a move into US Treasury bills, that is what one has to try to think through as one tries to anticipate the effects of such a crisis   I share the view that the risks this time are for excessive boominess to the economy I just want to make a very small point In the Redbook--   Well, I interpret this as a getting into the 5, 6, 7 percent range at some point and I would think that would be excessive Now, what I wanted to ask is The Redbook contains a special exercise on the construction industry To me it showed the enormous diversity of conditions and how much of an artificial number, essentially, the average of all these different local conditions is I was wondering whether it had been of any use to the staff   German banks wrote off $4 billion and that's probably not including Luxembourg Now, that's a [banking] system about 1/4 the size of ours   Most of that is for domestic [loans]; 1/5 is for international and 4/5 for domestic   I think we have to distinguish between giving different weights to the different aggregates and watching them If we give different weights, we say that each of them is potentially misleading So we give more weight at the present time to M2 and M3, put a little weight on Ml and, therefore, are saying that we are not going to trust M2 and M3 and the debt variable fully either They are all slightly wrong and the most likely right number seems to lie somewhere in the weighted average This doesn't seem to me a very logical procedure when you have specific reasons to distrust one of the aggregates such as we have, I think, to distrust Ml There are reasons why people will hold more of their money [in Ml], whether in demand deposits and currency or even in NOW accounts, than they would at much higher rates of interest and higher rates of inflation And I would be willing, while watching Ml and not ignoring it, nevertheless not to give it any weight   No I think the time may come when the argument that now leads to ignoring Ml loses some of its strength; and then if Ml still continues strong, one would have to say one had made a mistake and that there was something to it But at the present time I think that the more reasonable argument is that there is something amiss with Ml and that therefore, while watching it, one is not acting on its signals The strongest reason for proceeding that way, it seems to me, is the high level of real interest rates If Ml were effective in the usual way of generating expansion, it would be by driving down interest rates It hasn't done so So I conclude that the usual transmission mechanism from Ml to aggregate demand somehow is not operative at this time There is a further very minor point to be made on that same side The divisia aggregates, which compute money on the basis of the moneyness of the aggregates rather than just adding up demand deposits and savings deposits and calling it all money, in the last few months universally seem to have shown a lower rate of growth than the unadjusted regular aggregates I have no particular faith in this technique, but it is an interesting device in that, since it seems to support what I think reasonable for other reasons, it is something worth factoring into this   At the present time I would follow Bill Poole's old rule that when the aggregates are not very clear follow interest rates That rule, of course, leaves open the question of which interest rate--the one that happens to prevail or a different one At the present time I wouldn't change interest rates, so I would go with the same borrowing assumption   There's a certain inconsistency between saying we want to snug up because the economy is strong and then saying moreover that that's going to hold down the long-term rate or bring it down That isn't going to slow the economy that needs slowing   I find it troublesome to chase a number that we can't have confidence in It seems to me the weight should be on real interest rates If the inflation continues to come down, real rates are going up anyway at constant [nominal] interest rates And to have a rise in interest rates at a time when the whole world hangs on whether these rates can be kept down I think really incurs a very large international risk   Insofar as the economy is influenced by these increases in interest rates or the absence thereof, it'll give a little more stimulation to the rest of the world if we keep rates where they are, and to that extent the international situation is eased a little   Well, for the short run, I think they move together But then we see that after the short rate has been established at some level, long rates may be drifting down; we've had quite a bit of that   We could say that we will keep it at the level at which on average it has been in the last few weeks   On average   We can't really say transactions balances because we don't know what is in Ml   It just may not be in Ml   We're very close to targeting on real growth   Well, it seems that we maintained a higher level of restraint than we were aware of or than we decided last time  -45-    5/24/83  Why can't we say that we accept the level of restraint that has developed for the last few weeks?   Well, the question is whether "existing" means what we decided last time or what we actually have   And it still bases the action on accelerating M2 and M3   Well, the case for adding that increases, I think, as we shift to increasing the degree of restraint   Two are going down; one is going up strongly   We seem to be saying that we're tightening because M2 and M3 are expected to remain below the rates--   It seem to be putting all the weight there on Ml   In a sense the snugging is already behind us We're now going to aim at what we accidentally hit   Not if we keep borrowings at $350 million   Anyone who names this Ml number should mention the associated funds rate   Well, only slightly below--   This is Henry Wallich The question is whether the borrowing is going to remain at these levels In that case there has been an implicit move, which I think has been in the right direction   I think there would be some merit in this case in having a public record There is enough of a movement so we should recognize it--without changing the directive, however   That's when it stops getting worse   When I look at your chart on GNP prices and unit labor costs, they've been moving closely together since 1977 and that suggests that there's a basis for your declining inflation projection But there are many other forecasters who have a projection of rising inflation Do they have different assumptions as to unit labor costs that are necessary in [arriving at] such forecasts?   That's why the saving rate goes down!   If one does a sufficiently poor job of taking out the cycle, one would find that the high deficits are associated with low interest rates If you take out the cycle properly, I don't believe you get that result   I would like to come in on the other side As much as I believe that monetary policy is effective, with a $200 billion deficit and no increase in savings I don't see how we could help but get a very strong economy   Regardless of who holds the debt   I think we ought to keep pulling them down first, because according to the staff nominal GNP growth is slowing and second, just as a general anti-inflationary action   That [reflects] the amount of interest added If people sit there [earning] 8 percent interest and do nothing, that's how much it grows   Isn't the projection going through 1983-84 and then 1985-86 for the unchanged [alternative] 85 percent for M2? It seems to produce a so much better result that I think it is somewhat implausible Doesn't that reflect the low sensitivity of the model, which throws all the weight on a reduction in real income and gives very little to a reduction in inflation?   If that is the case, don't you think we should have a declining target?   It's hard for me to believe that a more anti- inflationary posture should have a long-run effect of raising interest rates It might have an immediate market effect, but the setting of these targets isn't really an immediate market factor   I think the main principle here is that we ought to bring the targets down and avoid fine-tuning We don't know  -35-    7/12-13/83  enough about it [Unintelligible] the lower end and the upper end, just mechanically bringing them down   Well, if we don't lower credit by a full point, we're not lowering it relative to the other aggregates I thought we had--   That is, I think, the logic of the situation   Some people think it doesn't make much difference; other people think it does So, I think those who think it does should be allowed to set the--   It seems to me that under alternative I we're saying we're not going to pay attention to it because we can't get it back into the 4 to 8 percent range this year, so we have to monitor it, not target it If we set it at 7 to 11 percent or something like that, we do something that has to be changed sharply for the following year and brought back to 4 to 8 percent or even lower, and I would prefer lower for '84 Now, wouldn't it be possible to rebase instead and not have these vast changes in targets?   Well, another alternative would be to widen the range even further We have widened it from 3 to 4 points; we could go from 4 to 5 points I agree with you when you say that whatever we do, we are increasing the emphasis if we change it from 4 to 8 percent If we rebase we may be increasing the emphasis beyond what we would if we went to 7 to 11 percent Widening the range I think offsets that   Rebase on a shorter period   We know in any event that this is a function of interest rates; to keep emphasizing the velocity factor confuses the situation We don't refer to the interest sensitivity   I just think that there is such a thing as Ml and the market watches it And [if] we ignore it, we're losing credibility as well as probably [unintelligible]   That seems to say that you are accepting that the causal influence goes from GNP to M1 and that there's no counter- flow of causality   But looking at this as a target, suppose M1 were growing at 9 percent but unfortunately velocity was growing at 4 percent, as it could That is what I see as the problem of this target   It seems to be mainly accommodative and much less leaning against the pressures   This could be a period of somewhat rising interest rates, possibly, and that would accelerate velocity The cyclical pattern certainly is one of some velocity gain   When this is compared with the old range of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, people aren't going to keep in mind that this is a different Ml   Well, it gets to be very close to saying that Ml has become like M2 and M3 One reason I can see for saying that is that M1 now accumulates interest as a result of interest being paid [on NOW accounts] and so it has an upward bias that it didn't used to have Whether that is very important, I don't know But I think there is a difference between Ml and M2 and we ought to show that in the range   We are pretty far into the expansion and it's a very strong expansion Interest rates have gone up very moderately Historically [speaking], I don't think it's a very tough policy that we've had   Whether that is a very major thing [unintelligible] I wrenched myself away from that on the grounds that we're contributing a good deal more to the world expansion by having this bigger growth rate   Well, you remember the old mechanism If you keep net borrowed at a given level that the banks don't find consistent with prevailing interest rates, the money supply will get away from you as you try to maintain that net borrowed level It's a very tricky, slippery target   If we don't act somewhat now, I think we're repeating what we've done many times before That is, we let it run too long and we then confront either inflation or excessive interest rate increases Both put an end to the expansion   I could go with alternative B shaded a little on the low side--not as far as $1 billion of borrowed reserves or 10 percent on the funds rate I'd use lower limits--$850 million and 9- 3/4 percent   Well, we're supposedly now in the 6 to 10 percent range and funds are at 9-1/4 percent   Well, that is an instruction to the Manager whereas it is an expression of the intention of the Committee subject to our evaluation--   That's right I think we should deburden--   I would say out   Historically, Ml has been about 3 percentage points slower than the other two Now that velocity has changed, it may be 2 percent slower, so that 8 and 10 percent are still reconcilable   I'm willing to rebase on June   It can't go above 9 percent   From 1983 to 1984?   And this would be about a constant real rate, given some decline in inflation?   Do you assume that velocity will grow at the same old rate hereafter or is it a reduced but stable rate?   This isn't the time, really, to make a change Two weeks ago, I must say, I would have thought we should tighten up a little, but the data that have come in have made me think we'd better wait--as Steve said in his final remarks, wait and be cautious It looks almost too good to be true that we can get off this bulge of Ml with no further increase in interest rates And, if true, it makes me think that something is happening to M1 in that it fails to send us a very useful message But both from the point of view of the monetary aggregates and the point of view of the economy, the right thing to me seems to be to go with "B," leave things as they are, and hope that [the forecast] as projected here is true   Would that be matched by higher excess reserves than usual?  -20-    8/23/83   It is true that we don't operate on the automatic system where a rise in money supply and, therefore, demand for reserves automatically leads to a rise in the funds rate   I think that is what Roger is saying, if I understand him correctly  -24-    8/23/83   I think there is an enormous catch-up demand in all these areas where concessions have been made It's natural that they regard that as a temporary calamity and will try to catch up again Chrysler showed that   It's hard to make a coherent case one way or the other that differs from the staff position I would say that the staff forecast differs [from other forecasts] in one significant respect namely, that it has lower inflation If it has lower inflation, then given interest rates that are somewhat similar to what other forecasters have, we would have a higher real interest rate I don't know to what extent that in turn enters into the projection of investment spending But as for the present level of investment spending, as has been pointed out, it's very bad in the heavy capital goods area I think overall we can't say that the business fixed investment is bad On the contrary, it seems to be a little larger than it has been in other expansions Evidently, there's a great shift in the nature of the investment away from the smoke-stack type goods that one observes in the middle of the country to high technology-type equipment But secondly, and this was very interesting, maybe the heavy equipment area is additionally hit by the large current account deficit--that is, the weakness in our trade balance which, of course, takes the form of imports of things from abroad that we didn't usually import previously I think the net export area is really the greatest [source of] weakness in the economy If we didn't have that, we would have a much stronger expansion I'm concerned in the same area as Nancy is but maybe about the opposite things Suppose that the dollar does not go down as projected and as has been projected many times by now In that case, of course, that gap in the trade balance becomes worse Now, I agree that we're subject to the possibility of shocks from the developing countries or from wage developments, perhaps incited by large profits These things are unpredictable We're getting into the area where professional economists tend to see a lack of demand over the horizon As far as one can see, things are not too bad Beyond that, one can't tell what is going to keep the economy going I would say that this is probably an economic recovery cyclically like all others If it lasts two years, it would have been short; if it lasts over three years, it would have been very good And if we cannot see it clearly lasting longer than three years, that would not be a great surprise   If countries defaulted on interest, since the interest is more than what they've been borrowing, they would actually be able to import more, assuming that nothing else intervened Our banks would not get their income and the consequences would be tremendous But just in terms of what the picture is for them, they feel that they could import more if they stopped borrowing and paying the interest   Do you think we'd deny them imports?   It's not very convincing to them that they would not in some sense be better off if they defaulted They will have tremendous difficulties They'd be sued; they'd be taken to court; planes and ships would be attached Whether it would really become impossible to import, I don't know   I find it difficult to rely on velocity as a measure of the usefulness of an aggregate because if velocity is variable but determined by factors that can be measured in relation to it, principally interest rates, then the demand function for that aggregate will be stable even though velocity is not And it seems to me that we have to factor that in before we judge the aggregates The demand function I guess is pretty standard in the profession but has lately been buried among researchers And I think efforts should be directed toward getting a better grip on what is the right money demand function than on the stability of velocity   Then we have to explain how we came to seek a different one than we said in the previous directive   Well, would the path then also have a range of $100 million?   This cost of capital of over 30 percent Does that include depreciation?   Can you tell me a little about the period over which the data in the model reach? My impression is that the model derives its data mostly from a period in which nobody believed that inflation could be reduced to 7 percent, and so it naturally has built in a very strong resistance to that Now, if we could have a credible policy--if it were believed that your alternative assumption, the last one [listed], is possible and will be done--wouldn't that invalidate many of the assumptions underlying the past data?   This theory is based on the assumption, isn't it, that there's some limit to the volume of government bonds that the public is willing to hold and that, therefore, necessarily a continuing deficit leads to monetization? I don't know what that assumption is based on, but the ratio of debt to GNP has been very stable over a long period of time regardless of how the debt was made up The debt was large in terms of public debt, and private debt was small; and later it changed to less public and more private debt Now it has been changing back to a greater proportion of public debt and smaller private debt Throughout, the relationship of total debt to GNP has been very stable   Well, doesn't that mean that private debt creation will be very small, which is the phenomenon referred to as "crowding out"?   That's exactly right  -19-    11/14-15/83   The general impression I get from this model, frankly--aside from congratulating you on having the courage to remain at zero inflation, which was by request--   [Unintelligible], which I think people believe would change the nature of the problem I see this, as Tony Solomon does, as a cyclical problem The economy probably will go into recession one way or another after two or three years or a little more after the last drop And what your model seems to say is that it will take more than one more recession in order to get to zero [inflation] The next recession will start from 5 or 6 percent inflation and we can cut inflation in half again But that's not enough, so we have another expansion of two to three years from a lower starting point And then maybe the next recession will get us close to zero   It drops each year Eventually, velocity drops because the nominal GNP is less than M2   It does unless interest rates-- If you let interest rates rise as you seem to [assume] here, velocity ought to increase   Well, I think the main thing is to be skeptical with respect to the model even though it has tracked very well in the last two years, because the very fact that it has tracked well and inflation came down is a surprise to people And from here on out there may be less resistance because there was a lot of resistance to bringing inflation down built into the numbers of this model   Is this a controlled set of rates? Is that the difference?   It is reported that the German banks have written off enough in Latin America so that they would be amenable to one of these solutions where the interest rate is lower and the principal is funded into a long-term security   I'd like to ask whether, in terms of our capacity limitations, the labor supply limitation is more or less severe in your judgment than the capacity utilization As I look at the numbers here, you forecast that by the end of 1984 we will get to 825 percent capacity utilization, which I would regard as close to the flash point, even though that's hard to define And at that time we get to 8 percent unemployment, which is still well above a reasonable range for the noninflationary rate or non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment Does that mean that we have a tighter capacity ceiling over us than a labor supply ceiling?   Well, I've been troubled by the great deal of stability that we've had in the funds rate, which does seem to harken back to olden times But the error that was committed in olden times was not that we became too tight as a result of holding the interest rate but that we became too easy The natural tendency in an expansion, it seems to me, is to generate that kind of pressure Inflation expectations rise and, therefore, the real rate falls, and at a given [nominal] interest rate we have really less restraint than before Then the aggregates have tended to expand too rapidly We have not had that this time, if we discount the earlier behavior of Ml But I think one can't discount it completely; at least one has to give it a chance to unwind now, as Steve said If too much of it went into the economy earlier, there's a good reason why it should move more slowly right now I think the whole picture of the economy that we're seeing is one of much greater strength than we expected Half a year ago we talked about the fragile expansion Now, each time we meet the expansion is a little stronger and the forecast is raised a little more We're not borrowing from the future and cutting down the amount of expansion we see hereafter; but we're more or less maintaining the projection for the future, which means that the economy is moving at a higher level and, therefore, a potentially more inflationary level The tendency to approach the capacity ceilings early is part of that general picture So, if I had to make a move right now, I would certainly want to make it in an upward direction But I think we don't really have to make a move There are a lot of factors on both sides and enough leeway continues to exist so that we can wait; I don't know whether we should enjoy but, at any rate, we can wait   We could say "further evidence of strength in the economy"   Wasn't there a reason for that--namely that the interest-bearing checkable deposits went up? So, you can't look at M1A in isolation anymore   There has been some change, at least in my thinking, and I think in the broader perception, of the desirability of very tight money control since we adopted CRR We went to CRR, I think, in order to achieve this tighter control of the aggregates; we've seen that it can miscarry I have become more concerned about wide fluctuations in interest rates and, therefore, more concerned about the possible consequences of a rigorous application of contemporaneous reserve requirements on an M1 basis and on a fully automatic basis We made this decision and I think we have to move somewhat in that direction Also, I don't think we can be quite as relaxed about Ml as we had a right to be while it was misbehaving I think it is beginning to establish somewhat greater credibility but it's certainly still under some degree of suspicion So, since CRR does point toward Ml, with the relevant reserves that are contemporaneous being for the most part against Ml, I think we can't avoid giving more weight, though perhaps not full weight, to Ml I think some automaticity is desirable because that's the nature of the whole operation If we didn't have automaticity, why have any form of contemporaneous or lagged reserve control? But I would not make it total; something in the range that has been suggested by the staff strikes me as a reasonable compromise    12/19-20/83   Mr Chairman, since you asked us to address ourselves to uncertainties, I see some very critical ones in the wage area, the dollar area, oil, and developing countries But even though most of these happen to be risks that fall on the down side, they are not of a kind that one can guard against by leaning toward the up side So, I think that the principal risk is really of more inflation than we anticipate I agree with Bob Forrestal that these profits are almost bound to convert themselves into wage increases, particularly later in the year--September, I think--when we get to the UAW contract With productivity gains diminishing quite abruptly early this year, capacity utilization diminishing at a surprising rate, and unemployment diminishing at a surprising and a very gratifying rate, all that points in the direction of upward pressure Now, the other side is what may or may not happen to the dollar If the dollar should go down abruptly, our exports will rise with a considerable lag Our interest rates will rise very rapidly--not necessarily because the Fed does something about it but because capital imports  -23-    12/19-20/83  can be seen in advance to be diminishing and the benefit of keeping interest rates down will disappear--and that could produce a considerable downward bias [in the dollar] The LDC situation, [though] much improved, is still with us It is still a major uncertainty The oil situation I mentioned because people who watch what is happening in the Persian Gulf seem to think that the danger of a closing of the straits [unintelligible] is greater than it has been in the past That would [result in] an increase in prices and a reduction in economic activity--the same [sort of effect] as [that from] the other oil shocks That [potential] situation has a very [low] probability but very high risk if it were to occur On balance, if you add these up, we have a number of risks on the dollar side; we can't really guard against them by leaning in the other direction And the danger of wage increases and price increases is one that we can take into account and should guard against now   Could I ask you a question, Steve? When we set these targets tentatively in July, I think all of the aggregates were at the tops of their ranges That is still the case for M2 and M3, more or less, but Ml has dropped to almost the bottom of its range So, in effect, we've had a base drift of about 3 percentage points, haven't we? If we took this not just as a monitoring range but as a target, and if we wanted to arrive at the same level of Ml at the end of the target period, the end of the fourth quarter of 1984, we would really have to go not to 4 to 8 percent but 7 to 11 percent I say that not because I intend to propose this, but just to indicate how base drift seems to change, if I'm not mistaken, what one thinks is the right thing to do   But something of that kind is the case, isn't it?   Yes, then we drifted up; we're drifting down I think the down is money in the bank, so to speak And we shouldn't let go--   Well, it doesn't change the calculations, does it, because velocity may still change? We can't expect that the--   As for the 1984 targets, I see no reason to change what we did in July As far as the Ml target is concerned, we already have an implied reduction of 3 percent in those targets through the base drift, as I said before I see 4 to 8 percent as meaning 6 percent on average; that implies a velocity gain of 3 percent and nominal GNP of 9 percent, and that seems to me about right I would like to restore Ml partly but not fully yet and I would like to maintain the wider range, given the uncertainty I have nothing to say on M2, M3, and credit  As regards 1985 and the possibility of some sort of reciprocity between fiscal and monetary policy, I think there's an element of realism here, as Tony says Analytically, if we raise the rate of growth of money it would just lead to higher prices in the long run But it's also true that if the budget is tightened and money remains on course, the drop in interest rates is not going to be sufficient to overcome the reduction in demand So, what we ought to have is a temporary acceleration, if one could do that, of the aggregates I am quite skeptical of that degree of fine-tuning And I really would prefer, tactically and strategically, to say that our collaboration comes from allowing this interest rate drop to take place that a reduction in the budget deficit is bringing about, recognizing that there's some risk on the down side that the interest rate drop may not be enough to keep GNP on track Looking further, [beyond] 1985, I think we should aim at ultimate price stability I think we're all aware that there are high costs It's not very likely that we will achieve that on a steady trend It's much more likely to happen as a result of another recession before which there will be some acceleration of inflation that will then lead to a sharper drop in prices, hopefully to the neighborhood of stability But we can't plan on that, so we have to plan on some kind of downward trend in the aggregates to achieve reasonable price stability   We might consider targeting the exchange rate   One would have to ease, and that is why it's not a good idea   No, the theoretical point is that the exchange rate should carry some weight along with total credit I'm not saying that we should do what the Canadians do now   It works pretty well It would at the present exchange rates; we wouldn't want to stabilize those   Is the result the cessation of capital imports? Capital imports can't cease overnight, of course, because our exports aren't going to go up overnight and imports aren't going to go down   So in that sense while we unwind this $80 to $100 billion current account deficit we will have upward pressure on interest rates all the time but not the full pressures at the beginning of the process   The sum of the deficits is $100 billion in excess of the sum of the surpluses   How often did the Bundesbank operate in New York directly?   How often did they do that, more or less?   Peter, could I ask you Is it right to say that that $50 million peanuts was sterilized automatically the same day or the next day?   But you wouldn't have done anything on that day, I suppose, if you hadn't been planning to do something anyway?   I would go to $750 million on borrowing and I'd be quite satisfied with 8 percent growth of M2 and M3 And if that leads to 6 percent on M1, that would seem to me in line with the ranges that we are about to set, possibly On the funds rate, I do not particularly want to see it higher, except marginally But I think we have to have a little more room on the up side, if it's not going to be totally confining So, I would say 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent   If you wait until you see it, you've missed it   If we're going to raise the borrowing, even though that number is not published, the text of the directive will  -67-    12/19-20/83  indicate that it is consistent to have some reaction in the funds rate It is peculiar to leave it unchanged when the rate is so close to the top anyway   I would   Well, there is the fact that interest rates would be going up That is, foreigners would be [buying] bonds, so there is a sustaining element Inflation--   Inflation is low and it's not going to rise very much as a result of this movement; it will rise some So, I don't think one can take this as a foregone conclusion It's a risk   The market sees all this as much as we do and for some curious reason doesn't respond I think they anticipate two possibilities One is that we will put our [fiscal] house in order Then the budget deficit would go down and the United States would become a more dependable place to keep one's money The other possibility is that we won't put our house in order Then the opposite of these things would happen Nevertheless, interest rates would be high, so the dollar might not come down very much I can't believe we are going to continue on with $100 billion in capital imports for very long; that I understand   The 1/2 percent is inflation or level of    1/30-31/84   The dollar price of oil may rise   Well, the current account implications of that decline in the dollar come mostly in 1985 and after, so the interest rate implications of that--at least as far as the financing of capital needs is concerned--also come at that time, although movements in the security markets of course might make them come at any time   If throughout 1984 the crowding out goes about half against the balance of payments and the other half against domestic investment, that's one reason why interest rates don't seem to have to rise   Well, if you have a current account deficit of $100 billion and a budget deficit of $200 billion--which produces, let's say, $200 billion worth of crowding out--half of it goes against the foreign sector, hurting exports and import-competing industries The other half goes against investment, hurting housing and so forth   I think the fundamental fact in the outlook is that we have a $200 billion deficit Now, we would take back, so to speak, $100 billion of that by sending the money abroad That leaves us with $100 billion of net stimulus; and to get a weak economy we really have to argue that that much stimulus is not adequate to keep the economy growing That seems to me like saying that the economy is inherently very recessionary, that the expansion or impulses for investment incentives and so on are very small I really don't find that plausible After all, high interest rates and the high current account deficit are the result of the expansion that we're getting from the deficit; they're not independent factors that are cutting into the expansion   Well, since the structural component of the deficit is rising and the cyclical component is falling and by the time you get to full employment it's all structural, I would think-- although I haven't studied this--that in terms of the full employment budget deficit we are increasing the stimulus   But they have to be consolidated   I favor giving more weight to M1 I think there is some presumption that it is regaining a stable relationship Now, with more of it being subject to interest, I think its velocity is likely to rise less than it used to In other words, instead of having a 3 percent advantage in velocity gains relative to M2 and M3, it might have a 1-1/2 or 2 percent relative advantage As far as its interest elasticity is concerned, I recognize that it is important It seems to me that that depends on how market oriented NOW and Super NOW accounts become If NOWs remain at a fixed rate, then they will be highly interest elastic because the opportunity costs of holding NOWs as compared to the cost of market instruments will be important If there are market oriented rates on M1 predominantly--they all have different components--then I would think that indeed the interest elasticity will diminish and one ends up controlling the aggregate by controlling GNP Nevertheless, that is [done] through interest rates I think M1 is the one aggregate that has some plausibility of having a causal effect with respect to GNP whereas for M2 and M3 and debt it seems to me the causation runs more from GNP to the aggregate As for the choice among these ranges, it may seem inconsistent having said that I think the velocity of M1 is likely to increase less than in the past, nevertheless, I lean in the direction of alternative I And I would prefer widening the range there on the down side so that the range would read 3 to 7 percent I wouldn't be greatly concerned if M1 were running on the high side of that range Also, I hope that going to contemporaneous reserves does not mean that we are going back to some form of immediate automaticity--doing what Lyle Gramley implied, where as soon as M1 overshoots we immediately rush after it to capture it I think the kind of approach that other central banks use to control the aggregates--bringing them back on track over a period of a quarter or two--is feasible and less disruptive With those specifications, I would also say that M2 could possibly be reduced on the lower end; but I feel less strongly about that and    1/30-31/84  would leave it stand the way it is in alternative I Thank you, Mr Chairman   I meant to say that if we're driven off path, we shouldn't rush after it by sharp changes in the volume of borrowing and, therefore the funds rate, in order to bring it back on track but we should do it gradually the way we did in a way early last year Interest rates were allowed to go up 1 percent maybe and that contributed to bringing M1 back on track and not overshooting I don't know how influential this move in interest rates was, but it seems to me that that was about the right way of managing M1   I would be reconciled to that Of course, that really means funds rate management It's what we did before 1979 We would have a little more flexibility and we wouldn't intervene in the securities market in order to peg, or almost peg, the funds rate or hold it between narrow limits We would intervene in order to supply or drain reserves regardless of whether the rate is at a particular point And it seems to me that that is a pretty good form of management provided it is guided by looking at M1 And if M1 gets away from us continuously and for a long period of time, then it seems clear that the interest rate and the borrowing level that we established weren't the right ones   Well, I think we can say that price stability is becoming the orphan of this expansion We're having a lovely expansion if nothing sensational happens to the dollar But inflation continues to mount And the suspicions around this table are that it is going to go up more than projected That is why I think we ought to lean a little on the side of price stability, recognizing that we're not going to get there, of course   Well, I mean from here on out   If you get very flexible, somebody will come and push you   Well, I'd like you to look at chart 3 [in the Bluebook] It doesn't say so, but in retrospect it was not a happy  -37-    1/30-31/84  move, I think, from the earlier 4 to 8 percent range to the 5 to 9 percent It proved unnecessary We're in either range now, and--   I'm looking at the M1 chart If you draw a 4 to 8 percent range in there--   [M1] is in there   Well, it's also where we came from We had 4 to 8 percent--   We rebased at that time and I took the same base here But I don't know that it would come out differently if we went back to the fourth quarter of 1982   Yes, well, that's right   It violates Ben Friedman's law  SPEAKER(?) Yes, but if you compete--   That says specifically once the dollar is down--   But I think "improved" would be a good change   Well, we might have little velocity growth without volatility And why should we denigrate a good aggregate?   More than M1 or more than in the past?   You've dropped "at least"   There seem to be four elements that are weighted in favor of lesser restraint One is the phrase "lesser restraint would" whereas the other says "greater restraint might" Also--   I don't care about the order and whether the lesser goes first or not, but the asymmetry in the words does strike me as meaningful I would rather not have it   Well, either "would" in both cases or "might," but I prefer "would" And I'd eliminate the "somewhat"   Then we could add "somewhat" on the easing side   I would favor that The lesser restraint without some business signal seems to be an almost purely monetaristic reaction   We can write that in if we have business news   Do you mean the Managers' weekly reports?   I just wanted to comment on one aspect of the Greenbook projections As we look at the very high first-quarter real growth and the tapering off very rapidly for the rest of the two-year period, one gets the impression that perhaps not too much has happened But there is a distinction here between the level at which the economy operates and the rate of growth at which it operates And we have now raised the level very substantially If we have 8 percent instead of, let's say, 4 percent for the [first] quarter, I think that [produces] 1 percent more GNP at an annual rate And if the 6 percent [projected] for the second quarter were to materialize, that would be another 1/2 percent of GNP over a 4 percent growth rate That means there's $50 billion or so more GNP in the economy The capacity data seem to bear that out from the fourth quarter to the second quarter; in the forecast we're chewing up almost 4 percentage points out of capacity and we're really getting into the range where pressures become strong The same is true of the unemployment rate We're now moving close to what is technically known as the equilibrium rate of  -51-    3/26-27/84  unemployment And at the same time we're encountering a very substantial speed effect in the sense that unemployment is coming down very rapidly So that factor adds to inflationary pressures It seems clear, finally, that inflation expectations have increased over the last few months That means that real interest rates, despite the rise in nominal interest rates, may not have increased They may indeed have come down, if one could make so precise a calculation So on net the economy is operating at a higher level with greater pressures, perhaps less interest rate constraint and, in a sense, more momentum even though we see that the projected rates of growth from the summer on are now lower than they were in the previous forecast   Well, I think we are in a critical phase There is some danger of the economy getting away from us on the up side in the mid-passage If this is a long expansion, this is the middle of it and the economy is accelerating when it ought to be moderating I think the market sees that and expects some kind of action And unless we do something, we're going to lag behind rather than be with it I'm not arguing that we ought to lead the parade but we shouldn't be hanging back Moreover, if we do less now, we have to anticipate the possibility that this economy will continue very strong and we may have to do more later on So, we would be saving ourselves some agony later if we take action now I realize all this isn't targeting on the aggregates; it's targeting on the economy I do think the aggregates should be our focal point I would not want to go back to automaticity of M1 The idea of having to chase after some blip, as we did at one time, is just too alarming But then one has to be a little firmer on the other means by which we steer We've already allowed some tightening and if we now move up a second step, I don't think the second step needs to be a very big one We would be taking two steps in succession We could at least afford for a while to see if this doesn't work Like Lyle, I feel that's somewhere between B and C I would say M1 at 6 percent, M2 at 7-1/2 percent, M3 at 8 percent, and the funds rate range at 8 to 12 percent I don't want to discuss the discount rate but it's like the word "hippopotamus" in that once it is dropped into your mind it's very hard not to think of it So, I do make my borrowing assumption with some thought about that; if we go to $1 billion on the borrowing, that probably would produce the right effect overall   50 basis points for $200 million on borrowing   Only on the condition it seems to me that one billion dollars borrowing is right For that reason I like your paragraph   That would be contrary to expectations and very confusing   Some tightening I think has to come or [the funds rate will] fall below expectations It doesn't have to be a very large one, and I could see that there would be another step some time in the future But I don't think we can just stabilize things because the rates have gone up somewhat   But they expect it   You said, Mr Chairman, that in the case of a discount rate increase [there would be] no automatic change in borrowing   I agree We need some move and the only visible thing is interest rates   I think there's some merit in referring to the increase in reserve positions that has recently emerged But it doesn't swear that we'd maintain that I think it should be increased above that recently emerged level   Well, putting a range around these short-term money aggregates I think would make sense I'm not very happy with going back to M1 in first place   Because we might miss it?   "Maintain" suggests that there was no change   I would prefer that, although it's very small symbolism To put M1 first has some meaning   Shouldn't it be "or credit aggregates"? Otherwise you're diluting it; everything has to go up if you say "and"   Sam, what I hear about negotiations with Argentina isn't very positive right now Is there any time limit in terms of the Treasury's arrangements on when they need to arrive at a letter of intent?   At the Basle meeting there was considerable questioning, at least by some central bankers, as to the adequacy of our arrangements There was a considerable lack of understanding about what the Federal Reserve does--providing liquidity on a secured basis--and about what the FDIC does--providing solvency support And the question really was whether these arrangements were adequate   I surely did   Doesn't that seem to you an abnormality, contrary to the usual tendency of the rate structure to flatten out toward the end of an expansion? Doesn't it seem, therefore, that there is some doubt about what is going to happen to inflation?   First, I would like to support what Bob Black said about not worrying too much about small temporary changes As I look at our directive and policy record, we've really been through a mini-cycle since the last FOMC meeting At that time we had not seen fully the weakening of March It was March 27th or thereabouts when we met Had we known the March data we might have said "Aha, things are slowing down" However, in April they picked up again So meeting now in May we've had the weak March and the strong April and we can just take off from there The same applies to the aggregates Had we known the weakness of the aggregates for April, we might have worried about that but now we see that for May there probably is an expansion ahead So, again, the interim fluctuations don't mean very much As I listen to the discussion around the table of the tapering off, I ask myself What is it that businessmen really pay attention to when they evaluate conditions? Is it the rate of expansion of their sales and activity or is it the level at which they proceed? Now, the rate of expansion may be tapering off somewhat but the level that they have reached must be taxing their capacity or be giving them a sense of very high activity at least generally I think this slowing that seems to be taking over ought to be regarded as a success of our policy--a success in avoiding overheating, to the extent that we've done that It certainly is not a reason to resume some kind of stimulative policy  In thinking about what we should do now, we are financially very much constrained If we wanted to restrain more, we have the situation in developing countries We have the situation of Continental I find these things very hard to weigh The wise advice is to say that financial fragility should be handled by structural devices And perhaps that is not quite as foolish as it sounds because this is the time to fix the roof--it's not raining That's the time when one should fix the roof and not wait until it rains again So, that would mean strengthening the capital of banks, doing something about LDC loans along the lines of our conference for finding ways of limiting the effect of interest rate increases, [imposing] penalties for poor banking That again is more possible in the domestic area than in the international area where we're dependent on the same banks that made mistakes to continue making loans So, this disciplinary supervisory action is somewhat stymied I think this is the principal choice we have to make right now In terms of economic activity, it seems to me that further restraint is still desirable; in terms of the fragility of the environment, there are obvious fears and inhibitions How to weigh this, I find very difficult But I continue to lean in the direction, if I have a choice, of a little more restraint  -16-    5/21-22/84   It seems that we're sliding somewhat inadvertently into net borrowed reserves [targeting] from what I understood to be a gross borrowing posture I think there is a substantial difference If at any given time the Desk sees borrowing moving one way and excess not changing, they have to make up their minds whether they are going with borrowing or are going with net [borrowed reserves] So, I hope we're going to differentiate between gross borrowings, which is what I think we've done so far, and net free reserves as the conversation seems to be going As far as the levels are concerned, I think we ought to raise the gross borrowing level a little precisely to avoid a relapse in the markets, which would give a false signal In a sense the markets have done our work I don't think one could have anticipated these increases at the time of the last FOMC meeting So there is justification, I think, for a wait-and-see attitude but not for an attitude of appeasing, which could be misinterpreted in many ways today Also, I think one ought to hesitate a little before one takes for granted that financial fragility is necessarily a cause for relenting The rule about the lender of last resort operation is to lend freely but at a high rate In the case of the thrifts and the LDCs and the farmers, I see that the nature of the fragility is related to the level of the interest rates In the case of Continental it isn't quite clear to me whether  -34-    5/21-22/84  they would be in a more fragile state if interest rates were a little higher than now   I would interpret you as saying that it's worthwhile to make that differentiation as to where the fragility lies The Continental situation is not so sensitive to it, but other aspects are As far as the funds rate is concerned, it would seem to me that this is a good opportunity to make the range a little more symmetrical around where we expect it to be, so I'd raise it to 8 to 12 percent Hopefully, it [would] move to 10-3/4 percent rather than 10-1/2 percent or below This puts me at "B minus," as it were, as far as the alternatives are concerned   It seems to say that we wouldn't respond to the aggregates at all unless there were these other features and I don't think we want to preclude that completely; we just don't want to rush after them   Do you mean if there were no change in the economic situation from now and the aggregates were going very fast suddenly--which they might do--that we wouldn't respond at all?   I'm startled by the implication of this "only" now This is a declaration in principle that we are changing our attitude toward the aggregates at this time   I think that really means something more than I had understood That's very difficult   If we said "would continue to be considered" in the context of all these things, then it would indicate that we're not changing anything   "Would continue to be considered"--   My numbers are on the high side of the forecasts, but not extraordinarily so I ask myself If these numbers come out approximately like this, what happens at the end of 1985? Do we then level off forever at a moderate rate of inflation and at a moderate rate of unemployment? Do we go on up toward higher rates of inflation? Do we encounter on the way--either before or after the end of 1985--a downturn? The answers, obviously, are unknowable But if the numbers turn out pretty good through '85, as they are projected here, the chance is that it means we will be into a rather long and continued period of expansion that will carry us to a very low rate of unemployment and considerably higher rates of inflation That seems to me the likely outcome of the present numbers being true At most, the staff projections would get us to a growth rate below 3 percent, which would suggest that we are tapering off toward an even lower rate of expansion than potential that theoretically could be sustainable for a very long time It's contrary to history The economy either expands or contracts over time And I'm concerned that the makings of a stronger and longer expansion are likely to leave us eventually out on a limb with high rates of inflation Well, I guess I've expressed no more than my usual prejudice on the subject   I would certainly be reassured, but I would prefer then to try to modulate that rather than run into it helter skelter   Could I just ask the role that the midpoint of these ranges plays? To me, the upper end is generally the important one But I realize that if the staff works with the midpoint as something to base projections on, for instance, then it makes a difference whether one also pulls down the lower end or not That's a technical item that I've never found the answer to   So, in that sense, 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent is the same as 4 to 7 percent?   It's a question of whether it's a forecast or a target I think of it as a target   If it's a forecast, I would say we made a bad forecast, but--   It concerns me that this injects a degree of optimism, not to say euphoria, into the approach that could mislead anyone who forgets the assumption One really then always has to make another 1/2 or 1 percent adjustment to one's inflation expectation in order to be reasonably realistic   Well, if it isn't, then one can say one deserves the dividend and bonus and perhaps one has missed a little bit of growth as a result of that   Let me mention something This technique of no change in the exchange rates is one that the OECD has adopted [and followed] for many years as a result of a resolution It is being questioned increasingly because it leads to conflicts with respect to projections made by the countries themselves, which contain all kinds of assumptions about their exchange rates The same is true with respect to monetary policy They are not allowed to make an assumption that their monetary policy--that is, budget policy--would be changed, whereas the countries that put in their projections have made whatever assumption they want to   Well, I think we are moving in the direction that the OECD now is considering abandoning   It made countries angry to have their policies preempted, so to speak, by suggestion of the OECD Secretariat It looked like implicit policy advice So to do it that way was the neutral and simple thing to do I'm not sure what the IMF does   After all, what is the mental process by which we ourselves arrive at these numbers? I would say there is a fair chance that the dollar will decline I don't know by how much and I don't know how great the probability is I pushed my numbers a little in the direction that reflects this possibility It's all a matter of probabilities and of having some ranges in mind, but I don't have a fixed assumption that the dollar will or will not depreciate   I would like that   Well, historically, I think we have made these moves at midyear That is, we have changed the ranges at midyear and then confirmed them in February I could visualize the market watching us and saying "Well, they've decided not to continue [to move the ranges] downward" I think this could send a wrong message   Oh, you do want to go down?   But wouldn't you say that M3 at any rate has a lower velocity than M2?   I'd say M1, 4 to 7 percent; M2, 5 to 8 percent; M3, 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent; and debt, 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent When the chips are down, I think it's the upper end of the range and not the midpoint that really sticks in peoples' minds Four to seven percent, therefore, means--if we're lucky on velocity--nine percent on the nominal GNP, or it could be ten percent And I think that's too high That does not give us a chance for a soft landing As between M2 and M3, I would like to introduce the old differentiation there because I sense that there is a difference; but I don't have a very strong conviction On debt, it troubles me very much to see this rapid expansion The consumer credit numbers are not the results of any buyouts or mergers So, I would be very reluctant to see that raised simply to adjust to what may be a reality We ought to indicate that this is a target rather than a projection   I wanted to ask Sam How much support do you think there would be in the market for a projection that the dollar will drop 15 percent over the next year, ignoring the immediate short- term situation that causes people, of course, to take the positions they do take   Yes   Well, it seems that the banks have not only had to finance their domestic operations but apparently also their branches abroad, because those have no longer brought in money but    7/16-17/84  apparently have needed money That suggests that there are those funding problems   Paul, could I ask you a question? The last few weeks seem to have produced an example of the relative workings of a borrowed reserves target or assumption versus a net free reserves target or assumption We seem to have stuck more or less with a borrowed reserves assumption That has led to an increase in net free reserves So, had we been on a net free reserves target, that would have led to higher borrowings and tighter policies Is that the correct way of looking at this?   So there is a difference between the two policies and, in this particular case, it has meant an easier approach   That's what I say It was an easier policy and, given that interest rates were rising anyway, was preferable to a policy that would have driven rates up more I just want to bring out the analytical difference   Well, we seem to be close to the situation where the central bank has the choice of facing the threat of a financial debacle or risking inflation It's something that has often been talked about, but it never looked quite as stark and immediate as now On the side of forbearance and status quo, one could argue that we've had a rise in interest rates and its effects may not be fully embodied in our projections It may slow down the economy There are financial difficulties that may be on the rise and may themselves exert a restraining effect on the real sector So it seems not unjustified to wait and consolidate, as Tony said, the recent interest rate increases But, of course, there is the risk that if the aggregates and inflation expectations do expand, then the need to act is only postponed and the level of action may have to be higher Six weeks or twelve weeks from now we may be sitting here and wish we had done a little now in order to forestall the need for more later One thing that leaves me unsure about the proper action is that, with $1 billion of borrowing, the funds rate may drop back to the 10 to 11 percent range from the 10-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent range, and I think that would be a mistake--to give a signal of the rate dropping If the present relationship of $1 billion of borrowing and 11 to 11-1/4 percent holds, that would be a reasonable thing to do But I would then want to see flexibility in our assumptions with respect to excess reserves that would offset any effect of $1 billion of borrowing in the direction of depressing the funds rate On the aggregates, all I have to say is that "B" seems consonant with these general propositions, and I have no particular exception to make with "B," always bearing in mind that the projected funds rate there is 11 to 11-1/4 percent Thank you   I think the symmetrical solution, in the unlikely event that the aggregates or the economy slowed down, would not be bad But the possibility of a fortuitous move down without any real change in the situation could be very adverse and would then be reversed Subsequently, rates would go up again and we would have given the wrong signal I don't think we ought to take that chance   Wouldn't that have a substantial market effect?   We wouldn't intervene That might be the conclusion of some   But I was thinking of supporting the dollar   But even if the dollar stays where it is, since it has been rising over time we have some benefit for inflation from that rise if it stops   It troubles me that most of the good news about inflation does seem to be reversible over time--not all of it, but most It's reminiscent of the early '50s when we were telling ourselves that we had finally achieved price stability and what was happening was that food was coming down for several years and everything else was going up and the net was stability This is likely to catch up with us again after a year or two   I hope that will give us some boost I was just assuming that the economy would be growing at a stable rate   Well, I was speaking about an even more distant period In the early '50s we had no particular oil shocks; we had a food shock As I look at the numbers for the future, capacity utilization now has been upgraded in this staff projection by almost 1 percentage point for the end of '85 Nominal GNP is about the same, but real GNP is significantly higher in the latest projection I don't know what happens to unit labor costs but they certainly rise very sharply from '84 to '85 And in that environment, to think that inflation will rise by only 1 percentage point is on the optimistic side   Right There is an increase of $20 billion in the full employment deficit--in other words, something we would have regarded as enormously stimulative some years back   Why is it that the projection for the output per hour--that is, productivity--is so pessimistic for 1985? I missed that; it goes from 25 percent in 1984 to 8 percent   That was in '79 and in '74 we had one   But that was not oil, I think Oil came after that, in '79   Well, I think we're acting under the impact of somewhat temporary factors We've had a bad month and we are very much concerned about the banks, the thrifts, the LDCs, and the farmers If we weren't acting under these constraints, I at least would favor a tauter policy That seems to me appropriate for the situation where we have a strengthening economy--looking ahead for 1985, anyway We have a lower rate of inflation, which to me suggests that the money supply should grow more slowly on account of the lower need for money The staff sees ahead that interest rates will rise in '85 So, the question really is Should this happen earlier or later? And if it happens earlier, wouldn't it reduce somewhat the degree of the rise? In that sense, we're really just buying time now by taking account of the undoubted problems that the System faces I would favor something like a "C+" alternative and I would go to borrowing of $1-1/4 billion I'd raise the funds rate range 1/2 percentage point at each end, to 8-1/2 to 12-1/2 percent I think then it would be logical to be symmetrical again If that [range] is lower, it seems to me we ought to stay asymmetrical   What would be a "basic approach" short, say, of changing the annual ranges?   Well, it seems to reflect that M1 is not as reliable as we had hoped it would be  -43-    8/21/84 -44-   I find it hard to believe that with this budget deficit--even though we have very large negative net exports--we could have the economy sagging There is just so much purchasing power put in There's also the stimulation of [business] investment, which surely dominates housing It's about 3 times as big as housing So, as I look at the underlying factors, it seems to me it's a picture of continued [unintelligible] pressure--not certainly strength   Well, that I could see The things I'm talking about don't point to any particular quarter, but I do try to look a little further ahead and ask myself Where are we going?  -10-    10/2/84   I feel very much the same way Of course, I am in some way impressed by the immediate events, but we can't influence them very much In other words, what we do now is not going to have any immediate effect even on the fourth quarter except maybe for housing And looking at the longer run, it seems to me that inflation continues to be the main problem I know it's boring to talk about inflation since it is finally doing so well But really, that is to be expected Here we are well above the natural rate of unemployment and inflation is going down, and that's what it's supposed to do What puzzles me is that so many people expect rising inflation at a time when we have a very high level of unemployment Maybe these expectations are [related to a view] that the dollar will go down or maybe to the fear of financial calamities But basically we seem to be taking 5 percent [inflation] for granted If it stays that way, then the problem is out of the way I think we're living on borrowed time here with respect to the dollar We don't know when it will come down It's very unlikely to me that it will always stay at these levels We have had remarkable wage moderation; it's hard to explain Most expectations were for very high settlements, and surely that underlying feeling of "restore and more" must still be there I am grateful to have had such good settlements If you look at our money supply target, we have pulled that down on average 1/4 or 1/2 point at most for 1985 Nominal GNP is likely to go from about 10 percent growth to about 75 percent So, if this change in the relationship of money to nominal GNP isn't going into output, maybe it will go into slower velocity but maybe it will go into higher prices At least the makings of that are there As I look at the outlook, I look more at mid-1985 and later in 1985 than at the fourth quarter [of 1984] I think there's enough reason to believe that the fourth quarter isn't a cause for immediate alarm and to allow one to take this longer-run view Thank you   Well, I would go with Alternative B I'm puzzled by the behavior of the aggregates There has been more than the usual variation in very short-run velocity I know that short-run velocity doesn't mean anything, but it is puzzling to observe the ups and downs over the first half So, the specifications seem all right to me and borrowing of $750 million seems all right to me On the funds rate, I would like to put a lower limit on it I recognize that doing this in the public record might have adverse repercussions For instance, it might affect interest rate expectations adversely So, perhaps we could have an understanding that we would have a telephone conference As for symmetry, I would prefer to stay symmetrical   I think it would indicate a real policy shift if we dropped the up side of the symmetry   Other than "possibly"   "Conversely" strikes me as balancing it in the right direction   On this foreign issue If the spread first went down and then went back up to where it was at the time of the issue, is there any justification for any bank to say that they would have lost money had they gone in on that and that they were smart not to go in on it?    11/7/84   Well, I am agnostic on the outlook I think it has deteriorated somewhat I made a list for myself of strong and weak factors and I stopped when I reached 12 on each side and had a number more But I think the nature of the choices that we have is a little different Expansions don't go on forever; at some point there will be a pause--a growth recession, hopefully not a real recession If we had the choice of a growth recession in the near future or a real recession a year later, for instance--    11/7/84   When unemployment rises but GNP still rises--in other words, growth below potential If we had that and it were reversed subsequently, that to me would be a less ominous thing than a new real recession And that might well be a choice because the things one would have to do in order to make sure that there is no growth recession may very well generate imbalances or maladjustments and set in motion [forces] that a year or two later might produce a real recession They might also, of course, get us back into inflation Starting from 5 percent inflation, it seems to me one ought to use special caution in dealing with that prospect It's not as though we were starting from close to zero   I think the underlying inflation rate is of that order if one removes all the temporary [influences] If we look at the probabilities of what is going to happen, they may be evenly balanced between a resumption of the expansion or a growth recession I doubt that it would be a real recession If we look at the risks that lie beyond that, action to keep [the economy] growing at all costs might produce a much worse situation later and might conceivably relaunch us into inflation I think those possible costs are much higher than if the economy wants to take a short pause and then resume [growth] again   Then interest rates would have had to rise   I mean if you didn't supply enough money and demand was constant   Well, the economy was visibly strong   On cyclical grounds, I really find it very hard to make an argument for any kind of easing I see the risks of making the same old mistake of easing in the latter stages of an expansion But the discussion of M1 may provide a justification for how I can perhaps get myself off the hook of being--   I think that has been what has often happened   Cyclically, I see--maybe it's inadequate tightening But your remark, Mr Chairman, that if we overshoot on the down side we could catch it again and tighten, does encourage me a little in a different interpretation of the situation We obviously have very high real interest rates As Chuck said, each time inflation expectations come down real interest rates go up Over time we have to bring these down The main way of bringing them down is to reduce the budget deficit But I think it also has something to do with monetary policy in the sense that there isn't enough money in the economy to allow interest rates to be lower Now, the difficulty is getting that money into the economy without going to a very high growth rate of the aggregates--which looks terrible, sends the wrong signal, and may never be caught up with and never be stopped When you have a temporary reduction in demand for M1, or maybe a permanent reduction, that does provide an opportunity without seeming to gun the aggregates to increase the amount of money in the economy in a limited way and thereby put pressure on real rates So, with that analysis, I could go somewhere between "A" and "B" I think $600 million would be the maximum, given the danger that borrowing could become too low and the funds rate might be destabilized   That would be as far as I would want to go And for the funds rate range, if this is an effort to bring rates down by increasing the stock of money and not the rate of growth of money in the economy, 7 to 11 percent would be acceptable   I see a case for alternative I because I don't think we want to show a very high rate of money growth If we do ease some, we would be doing enough I don't think one would want to signal on top of that that something is being done that is really irrelevant [to our decisions], which is the sense [of the difference] between alternative I and alternative II   Has anybody on the other side suggested any modification [in our swap line agreements]?   So moved   Peter, you said that non-reduction of the budget deficit was not likely to have a great rate impact unless the economy rises Does that imply that people believe that, yes, a reduction of the budget deficit would have a substantial rate impact?   It would seem to me that it locks us in, in the sense that we're accepting the path of the previous year, which may or may not have been right But if you extrapolate this [procedure] into the distant future, we'll always be on the midpoint of every past cone   Well, we seem to be having a low key version of the discussion of rules versus discretion To me good discretion or good judgment is always bound to be better than a mechanical rule The question is whether good judgment is more likely than not We went to automaticity in 1979 because we felt that in the past discretion or judgment had caused us to move too little and too late so, in effect, we forced our hand by automaticity That, it seems to me, has not been our problem recently We've had a great deal of discretion and the discretion I think has been sound So in terms of recent results, there isn't a great deal to be said for going back to rules or automaticity I do have a sense that this need not always be the case Sometimes judgment can be right; it can be wrong Maybe there is always a danger in this Committee, as in others, of doing unpleasant things too late and too little Against that I think one  -15-    12/17-18/84  can guard by having a small injection of automaticity The upshot of my points is that we have fewer meetings a year than we used to have and we don't particularly want to have conference calls, but I certainly wouldn't want to go back to where our hands were tied excessively and where the automaticity of the rule got the better of our judgment   It's a matter of the magnitudes of everything else If the economy collapses, I would not go with M1   On the outlook, my views have been a little more optimistic than those of others and that has not been very successful so far I still think there are reasons to think that '85 might come out a little better than the staff forecast We have the very large budget deficit; we have the diminishing probability that something will be done about it We've given the economy some kind of a push with lower interest rates in the last few months But it's also true that one can look at each sector and find something negative Consumer debt is rising; in business fixed investment there's the tax program and the obvious slow-down; there's the heavy drain from exports So wherever one looks, there are considerable doubts That leaves me somewhat agnostic and willing to assume that we are most likely to do a little better than 3 percent but with no great assurance  Now, as to what is desirable, I would rather not couch that in terms of a rate of economic growth I would prefer to couch it in terms of certain conditions that are desirable to achieve Unfortunately, the various conditions, which are very familiar, do not all pull in the same direction I think we should get the dollar down At the present level of the dollar we are ruining our trade and we're burdening the country with an international debt, the service of which is going to be a continuing burden on the exchange rate itself The longer this goes on the lower the dollar will have to be in the long run in order to get anywhere near making income and [outgo] meet We also, I think, need to get interest rates down While I agree with Chuck that one can never be sure what interest rates are right--that's why we have aggregates targets--I think it is fairly clear that interest rates in this country and around the world are very high in real terms They are a drag and are problems for developing countries and their debt I would like to see something happen that would bring interest rates down These are all things that call for expansion  But on the other side there is the inflation rate situation I share with Jerry and you the view that 4 percent is not good enough We have to keep bringing it down and we have to realize that this has a cost both in terms of real growth and in terms of the level of    12/17-18/84  unemployment, capacity utilization, and also in terms of the objectives that I just listed That is to say If we want to get the inflation down, it is not helpful to do something that gets the dollar down If we want to get inflation down more, it is not helpful to do something that brings interest rates down It is a very difficult compromise And I lean for the long run toward doing what brings the inflation down, although in the short run I think we may have a window here in which the combined fact that we have a weak economy and weak M1 and weak inflation gives us an opportunity for doing something that would give interest rates a downward push But that's a short-run evaluation; it's not for the year In terms of the rate of growth, I agree that over time we have to get unemployment down But we're in the third year of an expansion and historically it has proved dangerous to try to accelerate [economic growth] in the late stages of an expansion It has been tried before and it has led to inflation Sooner or later we're going to have a pause; this economy is cyclical Whether this pause comes in the third year or the fourth year and whether it means a growth recession or one or two down quarters it seems to me is not unimportant but it is less important than to do the structural things right--that is, inflation, interest rates, and the dollar  Turning to the ranges, I would keep them as is, recognizing that that means tightening them relative to [those we adopted in] July because we didn't anticipate the down-drift of the base This will be helpful for inflation It will not be helpful for growth or the dollar or for interest rates I think that is the right thing to do, nevertheless As far as the aggregates are concerned, intuitively, like many, I always look to M1 It's published every week So, there it is I think we need to look at each aggregate each time it makes its appearance and ask ourselves whether there is anything untoward about it There is surely something untoward about M1 at the present time It looks like an incipient shift in the demand function I do think that at this time the [broader] aggregates, particularly debt, deserve a careful look I would weigh all of these and I would give them different weights at different times Usually I'd give M1 the highest weight but at the present time I would like to have some understanding of why it is weak--whether that is really a weakness that deserves to be corrected or a weakness that has some [causes] that will keep M1 at a lower level  Finally, as for the international aspect, I think it's enormously important from the point of view of the world to get the dollar down and avoid a situation in which the dollar later may collapse in disorder That isn't going to be helpful to the world in terms of our current account deficit because our locomotive function in good part depends on the dollar being excessively high But it's for us an unsustainable and intolerable situation, and the world too in some respects would be better off with a more sustainable level of the dollar Moreover, I'm not convinced that what we do has all that much of an impact on the dollar We can, of course, conduct monetary policy in a way that targets on the exchange rate by trial and error If a little expansion doesn't bring down the exchange rate, a little more expansion can be tried and still more and there is no doubt that eventually monetary expansion will bring the dollar down But that's not the way I think we want to do it If we do it in a moderate way, we have to realize that whatever we do is of doubtful effect in the short run as we've seen in recent months when interest rates came down    12/17-18/84  and the dollar rose If we could bring interest rates down, that would be the greatest thing we could do for the rest of the world in terms of investment--for other countries in terms of their expansion and in terms of their debt This is something that we can do only very marginally If something happens on the budget deficit, I think we should be prepared to respond to that--not by a permanent increase in the rate of growth of the aggregates, which would just mean more inflation, but a temporary increase that would increase the money stock and help to depress interest rates somewhat more than the mere action of a reduction in the budget deficit and in the Treasury's borrowing could be expected to accomplish   Some kind of downward push on short-term rates I think, is a good thing, but it depends very much what happens at the long end It depends also, of course, on whether it would have to be reversed What are the chances of a sharp drop in the funds rate being followed by a rise?   There is the other question Would one have to anticipate a substantial reversal at a later time?   But you wouldn't say that simply by putting in reserves now one would generate a situation that tended to reverse itself at a later time and made a rise in interest rates likely, independently of how the economy goes?   Well, I must say that the slowing in business fixed investment is one of the big disappointments I don't know if it fits into the exact flow of the data, but in that sense I think it is a major factor   Well, I think this is an opportunity for giving interest rates a push because none of the immediate penalties that we usually face in relation to money supply, and in fact on the exchange rate, seem to apply at this time I think interest rates have been stuck at levels that in a broad sense are not equilibrium rates but have been carried over from the past So a push may get them to a fractionally lower level that might last, if this isn't immediately reversed by something that happens in the market And I think it would be worth trying It would have to be accompanied, probably, by a discount rate cut I just wouldn't want to prejudice what we should do for the rest of the year in taking a year-out view But in this immediate window, I think we have an opportunity for lower rates By that I mean that if we do what you propose and [also] cut the discount rate, we might have a chance of lowering the level of interest rates in a structural underlying sense And then when they move again, as of course they will, they might not make up this particular drop altogether   I think a discount rate cut, if it came, would look now like a following action, not like a strong policy signal   "And in view of the strength of the dollar"   I voted thinking 7, 9, and 9   Sam, after listening to the conversations in Basle, would you get the impression that if sentiment on intervention is moving in any direction at all, it's moving in the direction of doing something more drastic--perhaps without the United States-- [say], accumulation of some resources from interest and hitting the market hard when the dollar is already declining?   Well, if I may pursue this a minute Didn't you get the impression--I did myself--that the German intervention of September [1984], which was massive and to us appeared very heavy handed and clumsy at the time, is regarded much more positively over there as having been a really successful operation? Maybe that's [why] they seem to think it's the way to go--to wait until the dollar is softening and then push it down   Yes, that's the point that several of them made   I'm simply saying that we took a negative view of that operation; we viewed it as being contrary to good practice of not driving the rate but leaning against the wind They seem to take a more positive view of it And they seem to be of a mind to repeat it even though they know that they wouldn't get our cooperation on an operation like that   Well, I think there is something to be said for what we've done so far Yes, it would be better if we could operate effectively; but after a long time of doing virtually nothing we've now taken a few small, modest steps It seems to me that that's something one could build on   Well, before you become effective you have to be ineffective   If we have a money supply target and at any one time in any one day we don't act--in order not to drive up the funds rate because of what that might do to the dollar--then that has to be made up some other day Otherwise, we miss our target and it may then mean a larger funds rate increase than if we had done it right away We can't tell in advance   You have a near doubling--well, maybe not quite a doubling--of unit labor costs but very little increase in [the rate of] inflation Is that the effect of offsetting factors?   At lower profits?   Could I ask a question on that? The greater probability is the number on a skewed distribution Presumably, the  -10-    2/12-13/85  probability distribution of inflation is that it can't go much below zero but it can go up quite far; it has a long right hand tail Are you thinking in terms of the mode--the most likely single value--or the mean, including the tail?   I think as one looks at the evolution of our projections, it has been very favorable Growth projections have been upgraded and inflation projections have been reduced I'm a little uneasy about the inflation projections but there are reasons for them When you take the absolute levels, the rate of growth is very close to what we might consider potential and the rate of inflation is still way above what it ought to be The staff has it coming down in a pretty satisfactory way; I doubt that [will happen] In any event, I think there is much more to be done on that score   Oh! Hasn't it been coming down in recent projections?   That's what I had in mind Well, I have one other comment We're in the third year of an expansion and there is no reason why expansions should come to an end after 3 years But neither do I believe what the [Administration's] economic report says that there is no relationship between the age of an expansion and the chances of it coming to an end So I think the risks, as others have  -22-    2/12-13/85 -23-  pointed out, are that something untoward may happen and may interfere with this reasonably good evolution We have no serious imbalances other than, of course, the terrible one--the budget deficit But we have a number of danger points, mainly financial So, again, there are potential sources of the evolution being disturbed To me this suggests that the risks are more on the side of excessive expansion than of going down unexpectedly, and our policy ought to be [formulated] accordingly   Well, I don't see the setting of these targets as a means of accommodating the economy We're setting the targets so as to shape the economy   Well, that's not my objective   I continue to think we ought to have our monetary targets and try to make the economy, and mostly inflation, conform to them I think we are in some danger of adapting the targets to what we think is ahead in the economy The only reason for doing the latter, it seems to me, is a concern about high interest rate problems for farmers, developing countries, or the dollar Those are important But somehow it seems to me that if we now raise our  -40-    2/12-13/85  targets, we're in effect saying that we're going to maximize as best we can the expansion of the economy and maintain interest rates as low as is consistent with continued rapid growth rather than focus on the objective of inflation I think inflation is the least achieved of all of our objectives even though it has been better than we expected But the same is true of unemployment and growth; we have done better on each front than we expected But in absolute terms we are farther from a good condition on inflation than we are, say, on unemployment and the use of the economy's potential So, I would stay with alternative II, and where there seems to be a misfit such as on M3 and total credit, I would nevertheless stay with these ranges I think they are telling us something; they are not just something that needs to be made to fit what the economy does If they don't fit, they're telling us that credit is expanding at a rapid rate which at some time in the future will cause us trouble And we should recognize that Neither, therefore, would I aim at the upper [end of the] range I would say that 7 percent plus 1 or 2 percent velocity gives us plenty of room I would, therefore, accept alternative II exactly as it is Thank you, Mr Chairman   I don't need to have a preference for either, do I?   Without committing, if I had to choose between the two, then I would take the first   I definitely would not I simply don't understand why we have to raise all the ranges, or almost all of them, when we've had lower inflation than expected It seems to me a devastating signal   Sure   You want to maximize growth and take the inflation that that eventually would provide?   It wasn't declining last year; and 7 percent M1 growth was associated during the '70s with rapidly accelerating inflation   In terms of the level of borrowing, this is surely a policy that can hardly be eased any further The borrowing figure is very low In terms of the funds rate to which this borrowing relates, I think it's true that that's still a rather high number relative to the rate of inflation I see no reason to want to raise the funds rate at this time, but neither would I want it to go down; nor would I want to do something with the discount rate So, I'd come out with "B"   Well, this is [unintelligible] the fact that I think of it in a deliberately asymmetrical manner Wouldn't "might" and also the word "substantially"--   That's right   I think the discussion shows the danger of the band The band allows you to go at any rate of speed during the early months   While I would ordinarily say it doesn't matter because you know what you're doing, here we're talking about it as though it really made a difference We give ourselves more leeway; we use it right away   If you connect the extreme points of last year's cone and this year's cone and make that the band, you'll find that you have a very low rate of growth in that connecting line You would be going from something that rose 8 percent to the next cone, which would be rising 7 percent And the connecting line, if that's the top of the band, will be a lot flatter than the upper side of either cone   Right   It sure does   Well, it'll be more comfortable throughout the year as far as how high up we can go As far as the rate of growth we can have, once we reach it, it'll be less   There is more room to go up There isn't more room once you're at the top   Limitedly   Sam, $10 billion is a large amount even relative to the US current account deficit Do you see this amount of dollars having been put into the market as having any lasting effect on the exchange rate or is the whole move of the dollar due to [the savings and loan situation in] Ohio and similar factors?   I find somewhat deplorable the way in which the latest number always dominates the year's forecast Earlier in the year there was a widespread upgrading of projections for the year Now we've had a month of relatively weak numbers and everybody is backtracking I think one has to expect that with a moderate rate of growth the numbers will not always be strongly in one direction or the other and perhaps restrain one's eagerness always to take the latest numbers into account I'm speaking to market forecasters I would be willing to say we have made what seems to be a reasonable projection Until there is pretty clear evidence that it is going off track we ought to stick by that and not follow the monthly ups and downs   Well, "B" means that all year we're going to be above the cone but we'll still be coming in approximately at the peak, at the [upper] end of the band We have said that we might come in at the higher end We have absolutely no margin here and this is what would concern me If we get a further overshoot, then we'll be confronted with a need to do something two months from now that might be more drastic than what we would have to do now to slow it down On the other hand, it--   Yes Well, it might well happen that we're taken off the hook by some development and we might wait for that, in that it is obvious that all the considerations relating to interest rates are adverse to any kind of tightening Just name them they are all negative except for the slowing of the money supply that I would like to bring about If we can rely on March perpetuating itself at a reasonable rate, one can take that chance   Well, at the margin I could live with "B" as is I would prefer it to be tightened a little to borrowing of $450 million and would accept a very mild increase in the funds rate and an M1 [target] at 6 percent   I think if we lower that, that would signal to the market that we've shifted to a different kind of approach In principle, I would like an early consultation; I think that makes a lot of sense--but not if we tell them we have narrowed the band and we are focused more on the funds rate   Well, not every report   Sam, this kind of information, I think, is substantially ignored by the people who are working on the exercise of the G-10 Deputies--the reform of the monetary system The discussion of intervention there continues exactly along the old lines of what was said at the time of the study--we can do a little but not much and so forth But there was no sense from any of the central bankers or    5/21/85  Treasury people there of a cumulative deterioration of markets, which I take it to be the implication of what you say   The war between the forces of the budget and the trade balance seems to have moved increasingly in the direction of the trade balance prevailing, which pulls the economy down, over the stimulus that comes from the budget deficit To some extent this will continue, as net exports are scheduled in our forecast to become increasingly negative for several more quarters But my impression is that it is slowing down On the other side, of course, if we succeed in bringing the budget deficit down, that expansionary force diminishes as it ought to It seems to me that there is a sort of stand-off in the economy between these two forces And they have very drastic repercussions on various sectors farmers, some parts of heavy industry, and the import-competing sectors So this is not a static situation; it is a situation full of great tension  Given that there is a [pause], as it were, this may be the opportunity to do something that in the long run is very important to try to reduce the structure of interest rates--not in the sense of stimulating the economy in trying to accomplish a short-run objective, but to bring interest rates down over time, as with inflation If I thought that a reduction in interest rates now would have the effect simply of a brief stimulus, I would think that could be a great mistake  Let me look for a moment at the mistakes that we might fall into We have always leaned toward fine tuning When the economy is going down, immediately one sees what one could do by monetary policy if one doesn't think too much about the long lags Long lags have    5/21/85  been mentioned and I think they are important What we do now in May may have effects early next year, at which time the problems we face may look quite different There has been a proclivity at the Federal Reserve to push harder late in the cycle, perhaps because the cycle tends to peter out, the natural forces of expansion diminish It's the nature of a business cycle And one tries hard to postpone the evil day and push back the moment when the economy flattens out so that we do not have to go into recession One stacks up problems, financial problems and economic problems, for the future; and instead of a mild growth recession, one may get a real recession a little later So, I would not press very hard to keep the expansion alive if what it wants to do is to slow down But that does not seem to me a very clear description of the present situation It may be more of a lull before the current account ceases to drag it down while budget improvement and lower interest rates give a certain stimulation Finally, as for the alternative of inflation and unemployment, I keep looking at that myself and I arrive at a somewhat different conclusion I think that inflation is still much above where it ought to be And I don't see it coming down other than in a recession, which we want to avoid So we do have to do something to bring it down during a period of good activity A 73 percent unemployment is not good and 2-1/2 percent growth also isn't very good I would still pay a price to bring the inflation down Thank you   Well, 2-1/2 percent growth for a year and acceptance of 73 percent unemployment   Well, the inflation should come down; the unemployment and the growth rate will be less satisfactory under that [scenario]   Well, as I said before, the chief monetary objective that I envisage is to overcome the stickiness of the long- term rate and to bring about more reasonable real long-term rates This can be done by steepening the yield curve--that is pulling the short-term rate down--provided that it doesn't lead to an excessive acceleration of M1 or the other aggregates Fortunately, that seems to be what is happening now, so our range of maneuver is very limited We have already reduced the funds rate, the short-term end of the yield spectrum And I think we've probably done as much as we dare right now One has to observe what the market does If the market accepts it and brings down the long-term end so that the yield curve doesn't steepen, well, then one has made a step forward and one shouldn't take any risks of the market rejecting the maneuver In practical terms I'm concerned also by how quickly one moves from the cone to the band The main virtue of the band that I see is that it seems to give us in writing a lot of leeway; it doesn't matter whether the money supply overshoots quite sharply in the short run; we don't  -32-    5/21/85  have to bring it back immediately But other than that, the band is not a good guide It's the cone that is the right guide So given the constraints, I can go with "B" and I can go with $350-$375 million on the borrowing and a funds rate to match, which would be 7-3/4 percent or a little more perhaps   [Unintelligible]   Yes   Gretchen, when you say that people holding dollars have many alternative techniques to protect themselves and so are encouraged, is it to be understood that the cost of that does not fully account for the difference in interest rates?   In the Greenbook you note that the capacity utilization has fallen by more than 2 percent Labor capacity utilization--that is, the rate of unemployment--has remained almost flat Can one put these two things together and say that there is increasing pressure against price increases constant pressure against wage increases and more pressure against industrial price increases?   Thank you   Having listened to the forecasts, which is the principal function, I do think that we haven't done a great deal in terms of evaluation of what these forecasts mean The rate of growth, at 2-1/2 to 3 percent, is not great It's not going to get us back to full employment But it's at about our long-term potential; at that rate we are going to continue to expand more or less with a constant rate of unemployment The rate of unemployment of a little over 7 percent is not good, but it is not very far from what most people think is the so-called natural rate of unemployment, the non- accelerating inflation rate of unemployment We can gain maybe 1/2 or 3/4 of a point to 6-1/2 percent or so, but that is all Now, the one number that I think is totally unsatisfactory is a 3-1/2 to 4 percent rate of inflation That is quite abnormal in terms of the historical inflation level of the American economy It's abnormal in terms of the inflation levels that are tolerated in industrial economies abroad, if they regard themselves successful in this respect I think the inflation rate cannot be accepted as satisfactory--inflation simply defined as a continuation of a going rate with the going rate being, in effect, acceptable I think the main shortfall in these three variables we are looking at--the rate of growth, the level of unemployment, and the rate of inflation--is the rate of inflation   There isn't much to be gained; unemployment is high in structural terms   Well, we're evaluating risks The risks on the down side seem rather impressive; the possibility of a breaking-out on the up side in real terms doesn't strike me as very likely Nevertheless, given the unsatisfactory inflation rate, I think we should not back away from the risks on the down side in order to get a lower rate of inflation--or particularly avoid getting a higher rate [of inflation], which is likely to be the consequence of aiming for a higher rate of growth   Could I ask a question, not having read the paper as carefully as I should have, because I just came back? The principal conclusion seems to be that we have had another shift in the demand function for money, that we have no strong reason to think that it will move back, and that we should in a sense let by-gones be by- gones My question is How likely is it that this was an episode such as we have had at times in the past and that from here on out there will be a higher degree of stability in the relationship of M1 to the economy--not necessarily at the old velocity, but maybe at a velocity that is rising less rapidly than before? Is it likely that we might have that so that we could go back to targeting M1 at moderate rates, or would we have to anticipate continued or repeated incidents of this kind that would make the variable quite useless?   The logic of Steve Axilrod's paper--that there may be successive future bursts of M1--suggests that even if we somehow got around the recent bulge by rebasing, the same thing may happen again That suggests that we should put M1 back where it was a year or two ago, on sort of a probation status   I would just suspend it, so to speak, because there is no point in rebasing M2 and M3 and we are almost forced to give those more weight, even though we don't think very highly of them, because of the failure of M1   I would agree with that It seems to me it's a mistake to chase half-heartedly after M1 If we really believed in it, we would have to do something very drastic If we don't believe in it, it makes no sense responding to it at all The other two [aggregates] and debt are still high, so maybe a little firmness is justified; but I think that it would be a mistake to subject ourselves to the need to work off the overshoot at a time when the economy is clearly not very strong   That is why I think we not only have to rebase, but in some sense qualify [M1] or suspend it because this may repeat itself   No   In my numbers I took the first quarter as a loss but then pretty much went on with the old quarterly figures I had; I think that is what the staff did too You could argue that, even so, the economy is somewhat smaller because it did not grow in the first quarter and, therefore, with regard to the money supply that there is more money relative to economic activity That doesn't seem to me to argue that we should further increase the amount of money-- M2, M3, debt, etc--relative to this smaller activity   Which is what we got   I don't quite see the consistency of saying that we suspend M1 in some sense and then we fiddle around with the upper margin by 1 percentage point I think it is better to leave it and say it was a bad job   I wouldn't rebase it either; I would just give up on it for the time being When we reinstate it, which I hope we do someday, then it ought to be on a rebased basis--after proving itself   I wouldn't rebase I wouldn't change the M1 range I would just let M1 sit there with a statement that it is not more than a monitoring--whatever the word is--variable I wouldn't change any of the other ranges That makes for a--   Well, we can eliminate M1 totally, but I don't see any purpose in doing that   I would find it hard to understand It's true that there's greater uncertainty, but also the number is higher The upper number is higher and it sounds as though we are yielding   It would be a very [specious] thing, though, to say we don't know what M1 is doing and now we're going to change the range by 1/2 point I would try to convey the sense that M1 is in suspense, and that is best done by an unchanged range for 1986   The principal argument in favor of "B," it seems to me, is that it is clearly and definitively inaction Any action that is possible here is very small relative to the distortion in M1 that has taken place So, one would seem to be making a half- hearted gesture trying to deal with M1 "B" seems to say we're not taking M1 seriously and we're suspending judgment   Yes   The symbolism is tremendous, it seems to me   7 percent   At least that says that--   Yes, that they're not taken to be quite so weighty   Well, I'd go with rebasing provided we stay with the 4 to 7 percent   I think there's something to be said for staying with 3 to 8 percent and carrying that forward But if we don't, then at least the midpoint should be preserved so that 4 to 7 percent is the logical thing   3 to 7   The drop that you described, which goes back to the peak, has been quite substantial--I think 20 percent against the mark and 16 percent [overall] Do people regard that as a very rapid slide in the market?   If I may comment on this The idea of shortening [maturities] is that they are more liquid and investors can get out more rapidly, which is a concern But the investors who believe that they can ride out a substantial fall of the dollar presumably look at the long end and they probably would be right   Peter, you mentioned the Japanese firms I have always felt quite strongly about national treatment but I see in the press a statement that Karl Otto Poehl made after the last Bundesbank meeting that he takes a very different line He refers to Japanese firms that want to come into the German market to assume this lead role; [the German authorities] have told them "no" until something is worked out with German banks in Japan That's just a sidelight on that   If you did a survey of 40 banks with a large expansion in NOW accounts, you might stop those the way you stopped demand deposits in your surveys!   He seems to have discovered one   Did the lagged study that you did differentiate between the impact of M1 on inflation and on the real?   I have very little to add but maybe a little balance on the up side The case for a resumption of growth at any rate of speed certainly has diminished Still, I think the predominant view outside this room is that [the expansion] will accelerate a little to the 3 percent--and some people think more-- range I don't think anybody is concerned about a cumulative downturn that in retrospect, if we hadn't done anything, would have required us to take immediate stimulative action Even if the economy weakens a  -18    8/20/85  little further and then turns around, it would be a great mistake to have done a great deal and found ourselves having to backtrack So I'd exclude from my thinking doing something expansionary Now, on the expectation of a stronger economy, I think we have something to look forward to in the longer run as the main cause of our troubles I think as the trade deficit begins to mend--at first stabilizes and then, God willing, is very substantially diminished--that that will have some expectational effects, though nothing very decisive in the short run But in regard to the possibility of an acceleration, which doesn't seem to be fitting very well into this conversation, the danger that it will run too far I think is also not very great because we have enough leeway In my view we are well above the natural rate of unemployment and if it were to happen that the economy speeded up, we could accept that for awhile But that is evidently not the main risk that is being discussed here I just want to argue that the risk of a significant slowing seems not very strong and the consequences of falsely assessing that seem to be quite great   I would not want to see a great change in policy I would like to lean toward the harder side just to demonstrate our good faith with having rebased and then set a new range I agree that M1 is very dubious; I think there has been a demand curve change Nevertheless, I think credibility is an objective fact It's not what people think; it's the way they are going to forge expectations and the way they are going to react to other things we do So there is an investment there and something is at stake I think "B," if I read the Bluebook correctly, would by the fourth quarter or the end of the year get us back close to the cone Is that right, Steve?   As of now, one could say that we aim to bring M1 back on track by the end of the year That, I think, is a respectable reaction to the overshooting of a not-very-reliable variable   I would not invest a great deal in the effort to bring it back I think there have been a great many challenges from sensible people to our credibility and I would like to establish a record of having tried, without doing any serious damage by doing so So, I think "B" and going to $500 million with the funds rate where it is now--it could be 8 percent--and the same funds rate range that we have now   Well, at this level of capacity utilization what would it do? Three percent of GNP would be about 4 to 5 percent on capacity utilization   Manufacturing   8-1/2 percent would be good   I'd like to stick in some way with the range that we set; maybe we can straddle it with 7 to 9 percent   In economic terms, very little seems to have changed Some non-economic factors have changed As far as the situation of the exchange market is concerned, I note your fears, Mr Chairman, but my impression is that some people in the market say that this is just another of a series of interventions that isn't going to get anywhere They are going to wait and see what happens If we don't follow it through, then they will just move the market back to where it was before, and we will have a defeat instead of an element of strength That could be regarded as a reason why a softening of rates would help to support the intervention There are other arguments on that side--the deteriorating LDC position, protectionism --but these are all very short-run developments, and what the movement of the dollar is likely to be doesn't seem to me to have much immediate influence On the other side there are two factors that are more longer term and that do seem of concern One is the seeming misbehavior of M1 I too make these calculations Is it interest? Is it innovations? What can it be? Nothing seems to give an adequate explanation except the explanation that the demand curve has shifted, which it has done several times before so one shouldn't preclude it The second is an even longer-run development If now the dollar does go down and over time we get an improvement in the current account and we do not get an improvement in the budget, then we are building up inflationary pressures, including ultimately higher interest rates, which will be quite a negative [factor] I think that is the most likely course of events that we will find ourselves from meeting to meeting hoping that the current account is improving and that it will begin to improve and, meanwhile, nothing else major in the economy will have changed I think that would be a very dangerous proposition So unless we can get [relief] from that situation, I don't think we should put additional stimulation into the economy But the end of all this is that I would go with alternative B because I see rather strong forces on both sides, which I can't resolve  -17-    10/1/85   I like the first variant Whether [or not] it's what we have been doing, I think it points to what we should be doing   Why should that be negatively viewed, in the case of negative interest rate [spreads]?   How long has the [economy been growing] at this steady rate of 3-1/2 percent--maybe four years?   Yes   Well, if it stops on the way down, it stops itself If it becomes a continuous reduction, I think we could get excessive movements from that I think that that could be dangerous   I would like to keep my [comments as brief] as I can I hope you'll [understand] my difficulty in expressing my intentions, which I think will be resolved in a month or two I would take the M1 range lower limit to 4 percent [unintelligible]   [Unintelligible]   I nominate Paul Volcker as Chairman Is there another choice? I take it that the motion is approved   I nominate Gerald Corrigan to serve as Vice Chairman of the Committee for the year ahead Is there a second?  SPEAKER(?) Second   Could I?   It seems to me that we hear a number of elements that are to some degree inconsistent If we don't get a strong move, which would be to my mind deleterious, we will get a small to moderate move that perhaps will not look very strong, but at least will give us adequate growth of GNP But the problems in Germany and Japan trouble me a great deal more than what is likely to be happening to us We're seeing countries that are burdened with difficulties, with balance of payments that they don't want to tolerate We seem to be willing to have $100 billion in one and another $100 billion in the other and say that it makes no difference if other countries are willing to live that way--our way But I do not believe that they will be And so I share the feelings that we will some day get into these problems Those--perhaps not in terms of the numbers but in terms of where the pressures are going to be-- strike me as more difficult than our own problems  -17-    4/1/86   Would you regard it as being much more robust if we had this additional extension in the way the economy is growing and then a year from now it was presumably going downhill?   $300 million and alternative B  -29-    4/1/86   Is there some presumption that this situation will go on and eventually--[not] immediately--that there will be continuing pressure?   Sorry, I was trying to say that [the dollar] was being held up temporarily, but over time--half a year, a year-- would this look toward continuing pressures on the dollar?   May I say a word? The [forecast for] the United States seems entirely plausible but it might be quite different from what many objective viewers think, and I think we have to take more account of [unintelligible] If we don't, we're going to get an increase in the negative trade [unintelligible] We're seeing it now    5/20/86   Well, I don't have much [to say] for the "B" notion because of the problems about the situation People are unsure about [unintelligible], and that is particularly the situation--when one feels unsure about the sensitivity of what one is doing--where it is better in that moment simply to go to "C" I know this could have a bad effect, but initially it will reduce some of the errors that one might make if one began with "B"   Yes, and I have had a hard time coming to this   In some sense it would I know not everybody reads it--not even I   Having it too high is one thing; but having it too low is another   I think the behavior of M1 is still going to be so [uncertain] that the main issue is whether it is a viable target, regardless of whether or not its growth is going to be very strong [Unintelligible] So I would argue, not to trust too much in what we can do in terms of the M1 numbers, but to in effect [monitor it] [Unintelligible]    7/8-9/86   I can't [unintelligible] normal Allow me next time to have a chance   You know that I have difficulty expressing myself, but I'd like to ask in this particular instance of either Mr Sternlight or Mr Kichline Does the view of the people in this group lean more toward one force or another on this issue? I'm not trying to settle something difficult; I'm simply asking on the issue--   The issue is where do you see the present view as you look at the business [outlook]?   Okay   I'd just [emphasize] the point that I tried to put out before It seems so simple to say but it still is very difficult for me I hope you'll just bear with me; maybe I will not say anything now   I think that what we need is a lower current account [deficit] and that means less favorable international relations   As I look at the longer run, I am more concerned about the inflationary effects of this--what it might be with a 6-year [unintelligible] So I would go with the monetarists and say we cannot go on with the M1 and M2 growth that we have been having That just can't go on indefinitely Easing, by the same    8/19/86  token, presents an element of risk So regretfully, I think that we have to work at the present level of operation   Not change it?   But it would be a pretty large increase   But isn't the long-term prospect more durable than the short-term prospect? I'm speaking now of half a year or two years?   Could I say something about how difficult it seems to be at this stage to [look] forward? It's difficult for me to [elaborate on] that, but I just want to make that clear   Well, having heard people, I have come to the conclusion that alternative C is what we are after   If you have to do something, you do something
