  Mr Chairman, we group ourselves with those that appraise the national  recovery as still pretty solid and the economic outlook as quite favorable  As evidence of this,  looking at the Sixth District, Florida is the state that had the deepest economic dips during the  recent recession, not only in this--    Well, [Florida’s recession is the] deepest in our District, and there are  those who would point to it as, if not the deepest in the country, among those  Its recovery is  ahead of what was predicted just a month or two ago  Single-family housing starts and general  employment figures are up in Florida     We had the responsibility this past month to put together the Redbook, which gave us a  ringside opportunity to watch the response which came in from around the country on the  question of capacity  And while there was considerable variation from area to area, the general  [impression we got] from that is that there is less excess capacity in the economy today than we  would have thought with the--    And while there doesn’t seem to be any great bottleneck in the economy  at the moment, looking on down the pike it would appear that we likely are going to have some  supply problems by, say, mid-1977  And so the way we read it, the issue for monetary policy  seems to be whether we should in fact, as people are saying, get a head start on facing up to the  price pressures that usually accompany those shortages, or growing shortages, or whether to  pause     And [our conclusion], all things considered, is that the balance of argument favors a pause  at this moment, since the growth in monetary aggregates seems to be moderate  So we would  certainly support your prescription  As far as the ranges are concerned, I would like to see the  fed funds range narrowed to 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 if, in fact, the Desk feels that they can operate within  that range     6/22/76 - 34 -             Mr Chairman, I’d give the Committee a little sense of the sentiment from  the Southeast based upon the expressions by our directors at their recent meeting  I’d say,  almost to a person, our directors expressed, not pessimism, but very cautious optimism about the  near-term economic future  And this is based in considerable part on the revived construction  activity in our District, which is pretty general     Real estate is moving actively again in all of the regions  We still have an overhang in  central Florida  In south Florida, activity has picked up considerably, based in part on purchases  being made by foreigners--mostly Latin American, I would say, although some Swiss money is  coming in  One of our directors who is an industrial contractor reported that, despite the fact that  it is not yet showing up in the figures, small, medium, and large companies are making  commitments in a big way now for capital expenditures  And that they will be coming online,  they’ve got all the business that can handle in the near-term future     Supporting what Mr Baughman reported, we are seeing shortages showing up now in oil  drilling, rigs, and in labor  There is a shortage of oil barges in the Gulf area  Quite active  activity on the Mississippi and Louisiana coast, but concern expressed for shortages that are  impeding that  But generally, the outlook is one of cautious optimism      Mr Chairman, we would support the alternative B  One possibility that  occurs to us is that [for] the M1, which has been excessive in the second quarter, the alternative  C ranges might be more appropriate  M2 has been performing much better, and perhaps the 6 to  10 range is more appropriate there    We certainly see no signs of impending recession  in the Sixth District, and this view is supported by almost all of our  directors at our head office and branches who seem by and large to  feel that their own areas of business are apt to fare better than the  national economy This attitude is particularly prevalent in Florida  which, unlike the situation in '73 and '74  has seen little or no  speculation or overbuilding  however, in that our projections on the economic outlook are somewhat  less optimistic than the Greenbook's We expect real growth more in  the 1 to 1-1/2 percent range and we think 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent on  unemployment seems more likely But our chief disagreement would be  on the inflation outlook where we see it somewhat worse than the  Board's staff; we estimate that it will probably be in the 8-112 to 9  percent range   I would add our voice to Bob Mayo's,     2/6/19 -16-   As for the long-term ranges, for M1 we would be inclined to  go with the 1 to 4 percent that Paul Volcker and others have  suggested But we'd be inclined to support the ranges in alternative  C for the other aggregates; those somewhat higher ranges I think would  be consistent with our appraisal of the outlook   Yes, for M2, M3, and bank credit
