2733,1984-07-16,SEGER," May I ask another productivity question? I haven't seen your model but I've been very interested in the productivity issue and I too have seen a lot of people with fundamentally different ideas about what is happening to productivity Did your model forecast the size of the improvement of productivity last year?  Perhaps because I live in Si Keehn's District, I'm inclined to emphasize the uncertainties that we seem to face today and the lack of our ability to hit bull's eyes with forecasts Therefore, I think it makes sense to go either with alternative I or possibly to pick up for M1 the 4 to 7-1/2 percent range, which would be simply a signal of narrowing the range a bit This would leave us with the option in February to review the situation and at that point take off another half point from the upper end It leaves us more latitude to move  My basic reason for going this way is that I'm impressed by the slowing that I see in the economy Certainly, at least in the Detroit area, [economic activity] is way above where it was two years ago and yet the rate of increase is definitely slowing And I'm also impressed by the chances for an auto strike this fall No one knows for sure, certainly, but I think that definitely is a possibility; and if it does occur, chances are good that it would be [against] GM which would put a big dent in overall economic activity So that's on my mind Also, I think we have made some tremendous changes in the economy that are not showing up yet in the econometric models, etc In terms of our basic inflationary problem, I think the capacity figures are underestimating what the capacity is in this country; therefore, I believe the capacity utilization rates show us operating much more closely to our ceilings than, in fact, is the case Also, looking in a very microeconomic way industry-by-industry, it's hard for me to find one that's in a boil or is really bumping against or even close to its ceiling So, that influences me  On the productivity question, I think there are changes going on in the business community that are really dramatic a great commitment in manufacturing to modernize, to adopt the latest  -41-    7/16-17/84  technology, and to gut existing factories and put in more modern kinds of equipment I think management today realizes that they either have to do this or they are not going to survive very long; that commitment is really there Also, with the improved profits, they are able to fund some of these improvements, which is very important It probably doesn't show up in our productivity numbers right this minute, but I think it definitely will show up In non-manufacturing industries also, I think management has a commitment to greater efficiency The profits squeeze back in '81 and '82 and a little in '83 really punished them There's a bottom line discipline in business that maybe people in government don't understand And I think that also is going to show up more and more Finally, in terms of wage settlements, there are obviously the union settlements that the Chairman referred to, but there are also a lot of nonunionized workers and a lot of small businesses that Mr Boehne's personnel department doesn't bother to include in its survey And many of these employers haven't given any wage increases for the last couple of years; a lot of people were just darn happy to hold onto their jobs which, again, is a big change in attitude And the fact that we have had good inflation numbers in '82 and '83 and so far in '84 is convincing management that they can be tougher Furthermore, they are doing more discriminating in the good sense of the word; that is, they're trying to reward the producers and the high achievers very well and the ""dud"" types can get zero or something less than zero So, all of this to me suggests that the inflation outlook for next year is probably somewhat more optimistic than I've been hearing around this table Thank you  What I see is a difference of opinion between the Sun Belt and the Rust Bowl Coming from the Rust Bowl, as I said earlier, I think the economy does show signs of slowing--not that we have gone into a decline, certainly, but the rate of growth is slowing Also, I don't feel that the participants in the economy have fully adjusted to the interest rate increases we've had so far--for example, the last increase in the prime rate, which was rather recent Business people don't adjust overnight and not even in a week or two weeks; I think we have to factor that in Also, like the Chairman, I'm extremely concerned about the condition of banks I don't think it's just Continental Out in the other states there are banks with  -63-    7/16-17/84  problems and there are also tremendous problems with the thrifts The ones that squeaked through the '81-'82 period by holding their breath have certainly had a little chance to get healthy, but they need more time to get healthy And even with that 25 basis point increase on what they have to pay for funds we're going to have a lot of them in the soup very quickly Also, there are tremendous consumer risks I haven't heard this pointed out, I don't believe, but more and more consumer loans have become variable rate loans While that has helped the financial institutions get rid of some of their interest rate risk, it has also enhanced the credit risk by a great deal I think many consumers don't realize what they signed on for I'm not just talking about ARMs; there are other kinds of variable rate consumer loans--car loans, etc And I think there is tremendous vulnerability as I look at this whole package here So, if I had to vote for ""A,"" ""B,"" or ""C,"" I would go along with the ""B"" [specifications] and with the idea that the fed funds rate could range around 11 percent I don't think financial market participants would think we had gotten sloppily easy if the fed funds rate were to drop, say, to 10-3/4 percent on a given day  Yes, I'm voting for ""B""  Yes "
2758,1984-08-21,SEGER," [Unintelligible] in the early '70s  I would like to make a couple of comments about the auto negotiations, following up on Si's comments I know most people seem to be betting that there won't be a strike, but there is also a chance that there will be I think the primary risk is that the cast of characters has changed dramatically Doug Frazier, of course, has left as head of the UAW and this has triggered a lot of movements within the union Mr Beaver is not Doug Frazier and no one knows exactly how he will come down in the final days of negotiations next month Furthermore, if there is no strike and if they settle for a ""modest"" in quotes 4 to 6 percent, maybe the auto industry can make that up with productivity gains; but to the extent that these settlements are duplicated by other industries that cannot make it up by productivity gains it can have an inflationary impact I think, by the way, that the auto executives are more aware of that this time around than they used to be when they just went zipping along on their own, not giving a darn what they left in their wake I think they have come to their senses a little  Actually, if you compare what some of them make to what some top people in banks make, including some banks that got into trouble, I don't think the comparison is that adverse! [Laughter] Also, if there is a strike--as I said, the jury is still out--I think we will have to pay some attention to this in our forecast for the remaining months of this year I know that the econometric models show that that is quickly made up, but those of us in the trenches who don't just go by models know that there is an adjustment period that isn't smooth necessarily It does mean a loss in momentum, particularly at the time of the year when the new models are being introduced, and this could have an effect I generally agree, Jim, with your forecast on auto sales, etc but that's assuming there isn't a strike  A second point about inflation prospects that I don't hear mentioned very much around this table involves the changing attitudes on the part of business management A lot of these people were really beaten up in these two recessions we had back to back and I think they have gotten new religion about cost control Again, the old notion of who cares--the attitude of write a blank check to the unions or to anybody else because we can always pass these higher costs along--if it hasn't been completely eliminated is 90 some percent on its way out I think we are going to see the effect of this different attitude, In line with that is a greater commitment to improving the efficiency of production This is tied in, by the way, to the good capital spending numbers A lot of those capital expenditures are for  -19-    8/21/84  equipment that will allow them to operate more efficiently-- expenditures on robotics, for example I know it's nice to look back at historical trends but when things of this nature are developing that are different from history, I don't think extrapolating past trends is necessarily going to tell us what's coming up So, on the one hand, I'm more encouraged about inflation prospects than some of you; on the other hand, looking at the auto side, I'm concerned about what that could do  They toned down the formula--not the last time around but two times ago--so that they don't get a complete percentage [passthrough]  But when the auto industry talks about their costs they have to think in terms of total costs  I would go along with the idea of keeping the specifications the same as they were at the last meeting As I read Steve's words here on page 5 [of the Bluebook], they suggest that alternative A comes closest to those adopted at the last meeting So, that would be the one I would go along with For reasons of concern about the health of the financial system, I would be reluctant to have the fed funds rate go above where it currently is, again because I think there are some special and technical reasons that are keeping it up there If it could be allowed to back off a bit, I would certainly welcome that In terms of the borrowing target, I would go with Mr Partee's $800 million number  Since I'm still intrigued by this fed funds matter, would it be possible to request the research people at the individual Federal Reserve Banks to call around to some commercial banks to see if, in fact, they are more carefully analyzing the banks that they will sell fed funds to or if they've changed their approach in the last couple of months?  Yes, I've talked to two individual banks that have I have not done a survey  I didn't mean a written survey, just some-- "
2783,1984-10-02,SEGER," As someone who was pessimistic rather early on, I guess I'm pleased to see the statistics finally supporting my woman's intuition in that the statistics across the board are certainly looking much weaker than they did back in July when I arrived here I'm also viewing this as a good sign, as are people in Philadelphia, and not a bad sign I think it's healthy that we are looking at some downward revisions in our forecast for the rest of this year and for 1985 because it's important to keep inflation under control and having these signs takes some of the heat off here to jam on the brakes So, I'm pleased to see that this is happening Also, I'm optimistic-- maybe more optimistic than most people here--about some of the fundamental changes going on in the economy I have mentioned these before, particularly those things that are influencing productivity favorably There are other [developments] that influence the management of companies and increase their commitment to doing things efficiently, which of course is tied in to productivity Their stronger moves in labor negotiations, some innovations, and more emphasis on R&D are the kinds of things that I think will pay big rewards longer term I'm also concerned, though, about the problems of the thrifts Maybe it's because I just gave a talk a week ago to some treasurers of savings and loans and I'm carrying those cards, but there are big problems there There are big problems there even if interest rates don't rise, but the numbers I heard with even a modest increase in interest rates in the future are terribly scary I think a very large group will be going down the chute rather than a somewhat smaller group So, those are my concerns But, as I said, overall I'm rather pleased with what is going on  -13-    10/2/84  I'm leaning toward the A alternative, with my first reason being the performance of the monetary aggregates in the third quarter When I look at what the various alternatives are expected to produce in the way of monetary growth in the fourth quarter and for the 12 months in 1984, it looks as if even with alternative A the results would be within the longer-run targets with the exception of M3, which would be just outside by a very small amount Also, as I mentioned earlier, the economy is definitely slowing I don't believe we are heading straight for a recession but I think there has been a significant slowing I happen to agree that it's going to continue to be on the moderate side of the spectrum and that would suggest that some easing, as in alternative A, is appropriate To repeat what a number of people have mentioned, the strong dollar is a consideration here and I hope that we can do something to maybe at least stop its strong advance  Finally, I repeat my continuing concern about the thrifts and the health of the financial system in general When I look at where the fed funds rate would likely go based on alternative A, as I read the statement here, it looks as if it would go somewhere between 10-1/4 and 10-1/2 percent; and I don't see that as a precipitous drop in interest rates Maybe it's my bias, having seen a lot of volatility in interest rates, but from where the fed funds rate is now I would say that's on the modest side Also, I am thinking of the signals that we sent to money market participants this summer when many of them assumed that the Fed had in fact tightened I don't remember sitting here and voting for tightening [That was] the conclusion that many of them drew from asymmetrical language Consequently, I think we got an upward movement in the fed funds rate that in fact exceeded what we were talking about here at the time--at  -31-    10/2/84  least what I thought we were hoping for Having said all that, I would prefer to go with some easing and in general what is shown here in alternative A "
2807,1984-11-07,SEGER," I have been somewhat concerned about slowing business conditions for several months and I still am I won't repeat all the signs; I heard them earlier and you have also I will just  -13-    11/7/84  add two things that I haven't heard mentioned so far One is that in talking with a number of business economist friends who are neither kooks nor politicians I sense a big change in their attitudes in the last six weeks or so In general their confidence in their forecasts for next year seems to have diminished Frankly, if I had to point my finger at one factor that is responsible for this, it would be the signals that we have been sending from this building They are looking at the slower monetary growth in the last four months and as a group are not interpreting that as poor marksmanship or the inability to hit our targets They are interpreting these numbers as an actual tightening, particularly when they saw the fed funds rate shoot back up in August So, I think that has led to some of the changes in attitude Secondly, I was talking to a top economist for one of the Big Three auto companies who said that when they were doing their modeling and trying to forecast auto sales for next year they looked at the usual relationships among employment, income growth, credit availability and all the things that they know influence auto sales They came up with a particular forecast, yet because of their lack of faith in that number, they peeled off about 300 to 400 thousand units from that because in the pit of their stomachs they didn't think they could hit the number that came out of their model I am mentioning this to suggest that if there is a risk, I think it is that these numbers [forecast] for the fourth quarter and for 1985 will be too high rather than too low I am not saying that there is a recession around the corner; I am not that good a forecaster But I think there is the risk  I am voting for alternative A for two basic reasons One, of course, is what I see as the slowing in the economy and the sobering of the moods out there in the business world Secondly, although I am not obsessed with what happens to M1, I am depressed with what has happened to M1 growth in the four months from July to October In fact, what is shown even under alternative A for the final quarter this year does not look like red hot growth Also, looking at M2, whose expected growth in the fourth quarter is 7-1/2 percent, which would be the midpoint of the long-term range, that doesn't seem excessive either And then getting to where this would put us at year-end, we would be below the midpoint though within the long-term ranges for both M1 and M2 So, this doesn't strike me as easing irresponsibly Also, when I look at the reserve figures, I am not surprised that monetary growth was as slow as it was in October I guess I am surprised it wasn't slower when I see the dive in nonborrowed reserves and total reserves So, I would vote for alternative A In terms of the directive, I would use the number II alternative I don't feel that the relationship between borrowing and the fed funds rate is clear enough to me to know what kind of borrowing numbers would come through It seems to me this is somewhat of a crap shoot; there is obviously a number out there some place that is the right one, whatever that is, and it will give us fed funds in the range of 7 to 11 percent and would satisfy me "
2833,1984-12-17,SEGER," I admit to being confused--to make a general statement The second thing that strikes me is that whether or not I think M1 is important, there are a lot of Fed watchers who do So, maybe it's like gold It isn't the theoretical matter but whether a lot of people assume it's important that makes it important It's hard for me to divorce the slowdown in M1 growth from the very dramatic drop in total reserves And just hearing Jerry Corrigan's remarks about the slowdown in the economy--that this is what produced the M1 slowdown--it is as if the Fed had nothing to do with the slowdown I think it is pretty hard to argue that either we had nothing to do with the slowdown in the economy or the slowdown in M1 Also, I heard in the past couple of meetings concern about allowing the fed funds rate to drop much because then we might have to retrace the steps and jerk the economy around and or jerk the markets around; yet when the funds rate shot up from 10-1/2 percent or so to 11-3/4 percent, which did jerk the markets tremendously, I didn't hear the same kind of concern So, again, I don't know the answer to this, but somewhere along the line I think we've got to make some changes  Yes, but I think the slowdown in the economy is real That's all I'm saying And I think there is some association between that and what happened to monetary policy, particularly if you want to look at total reserve creation since late spring  Versus the Ms or including total reserves?  Okay  I don't want to repeat what I have said the last couple of months about my concerns about the slowing economy because it would just be boring I have hoped that the pause that we might be going through would certainly disappear and that the growth rate would speed up, but it hasn't so far I've not felt that we really were risking a recession, although I do think we were flirting with one or skating on thin ice, you might say, where we'd need a lot of good luck and a strong tail wind to get across in a hurry before the ice breaks through And that's sort of the way I feel I think the staff forecast that Jim and his people prepared is probably about right, given what our policies have been I would like to see more in the way of economic growth, certainly Also, I think the staff is relying heavily on the revival of consumer spending and I would hate to look at the advance monthly retail sales figure or the auto sales report for the first 10 days in December and conclude from that that  -55-    12/17-18/84  consumers are back on a spending spree because I don't put much faith in either one of those statistics  In terms of what we should be shooting for, I would like to see economic growth that's closer to 4 percent than to 3 percent The reasons are a whole long list One is that if you look at our commodity prices just about any one I could pick--copper, lumber, oil, and even gold, which is getting down close to $300 an ounce--has been weak and they are still weak And I think having faster growth in this economy first of all would stabilize some of these prices that have been falling rapidly and in effect would help the industries that produce lumber or copper, for example Also, I think that faster growth amazingly would help corporate profits--maybe not so amazingly, since that's the way it usually has happened in the past When you get faster economic growth and more rapid growth in sales volume, since companies today tend to have a tremendous amount of more or less fixed costs, the additional volume tends to drop through to the bottom line That, in turn, relieves some of the pressure on businessmen or women to raise prices because their profits are rebounding without the benefit of higher prices Believe it or not, this also helps productivity If you look at corporate balance sheets and income statements over the last 20 years in which this move toward a larger chunk of fixed cost and capital investment has occurred, when there is more rapid growth and faster output, the person standing there is not [only] pushing a button that starts a machine but the machine [also] produces 10 percent more an hour and the one guy is still standing there This does tremendous things for productivity growth as well as for profits By the way, both of those factors, I think, would be a positive in the capital spending picture With the negatives in the capital spending picture--namely, the question mark about possible tax hikes or how the tax reform measures will actually shape up when Congress and the Executive branch get through--I feel that the uncertainties have been forcing many businesses to set their plans on the shelf until they see exactly what is going to materialize But I think we can offset some of that uncertainty by having the better profit performance And, for sure, a lower interest rate would help to get some marginal projects, short payoff kinds of projects, approved and through the mill even with the uncertainties about taxes  It seems to me that we would have to change monetary policy more toward ease in order to achieve the 4 percent or 4 percent plus growth that I would like to see There's no doubt about it But if we did, then I think the declining interest rates would have some additional benefits besides helping on the growth side--namely, we still have to deal with this problem of the fragility of the financial system worldwide and particularly in this country where we still have thrift institutions with big problems We have the third world debt situation which, as I understand it, has not gone away I just visited both Kansas City and Dallas and those people tell me there are problems [in their regions] with agriculture and with the oil industry This is a minority view, but I also think lower interest rates would help on the dollar side It may not help immediately, but if we drop our interest rates or pursue an easier monetary policy here, then that would allow other countries to pursue an easier monetary policy Even if they matched us on the down side basis point for basis point, it still would help each of our economies even if the differential did not change at all Ultimately, if that did lead to a speed-up in the economic growth of, say, the major European countries,  -56-    12/17-18/84  I think that should help our export situation and eventually might even have some positive impact on the so-called super dollar  Let's see, there's one other thing I wanted to mention Should we emphasize M1, M2, or M17? As I indicated yesterday, I'm not particularly a narrow monetarist; in fact, I'm not a monetarist at all But I've talked to a lot of people who do follow what the Fed is doing, the so-called Fed watchers Many of them advise major investors They are movers and shakers on Wall Street and in commercial banking And my feeling is that, as long as they think M1 is important and they emphasize it and they hang around every Thursday afternoon a little after 400 pm with bated breath waiting for that number to come out, then it has achieved an importance even when we don't want it to Certainly, I would never argue that we should look just at M1, but I think we should pay plenty of attention to it and particularly when we set the targets for next year make sure that the bands for M1 growth are adequate to give us some faster economic growth I would argue, too, at least in the early part of the year, for viewing this in a parallel line fashion rather than as a cone just to broaden out those numbers and for suggesting that it's okay to hit the upper end of the range rather than shooting for the midpoint or cruising at the low end That's a lot; I think I've hit everything I wanted to say Thank you  Well, I'm an ease advocate and I could certainly support you in alternative B and wouldn't be upset if you pushed over into the dimensions of alternative A, using the $250 million or so borrowing target Also, I'd keep an eye on total reserves to make sure that they go along and allow the kind of expansion we need I realize we don't set the discount rate here but I would like to encourage a discount rate cut of about 1/2 percentage point soon to go with this because I'm afraid that if we don't, we are going to have the market disappointment Furthermore, if we cut it immediately, it would nudge some of the commercial bankers who have been flirting with the idea of cutting their prime rate into adopting the 1/2 percentage point cut that was launched yesterday  They are waiting for us  But I think this would push them to act  And the economy  7, 9, and 9  When the popular magazines call it the ""super dollar,"" people are looking at it  $300 million with a 7-1/2 percent discount rate  What is the question?  Yes  Yes  Maybe in the spirit of Christmas we can give him $50 million  That's what I put down I voted for 7, 9, and 9 "
2876,1985-02-12,SEGER," I just have a question Hearing your comments after hearing Sam's, I wondered How much coordination is there between the two--[the foreign and the domestic operations]? I heard you talk about tilting, which would lead to a higher fed funds rate etc, and yet I heard [Sam talk] about the problems of the dollar and how when rates ticked up the--  I guess what I'm saying is If, as you saw the fed funds rate tick up you also saw a rather immediate impact in the foreign exchange markets, if we're concerned about a super dollar and we're concerned about whether or not we're intervening enough, I just wondered if we ever close the loop or get any feedback in here?  But it never made you think that it might be inappropriate to allow the fed funds rate to continue to move upward?  I'm just trying to educate myself  Just hearing the one presentation following on the heels of the other made me connect the two  Second  First, in terms of the inflation outlook, I came up with 3-1/2 percent without taking into account the value of the dollar; then Ted Truman convinced me that the dollar is going to depreciate so eventually I rounded my number up to 4 percent If I had assumed it was going in the other direction, I would have rounded it down to 3 percent because I just do these in whole numbers; I don't have the confidence that I can do it any more finely than that In terms of productivity--and this is something that I'm very interested in--one factor I think we're soft peddling, if not ignoring, in this whole productivity discussion is simply the commitment of business managers to be more productive I deal with some of the same kinds of people that Si Keehn does out in the Rust Belt and they are viewing this as a very high priority item It's shape up or you're going to be dead; it's as simple as that Therefore, this has given them a strong incentive to be more productive I understand that, unfortunately, that doesn't fit very well into the econometric models, but that doesn't mean it isn't a factor and that doesn't mean it isn't a very important factor Furthermore, I think this notion ties in with what we're seeing in plant and equipment spending that in order to get the kinds of productivity gains they feel they have to have to compete with the imports, they have to bring in state-of-the-art equipment I just saw a plant on Friday that had robots all over the place at $90,000 per unit It's not a small investment but they have to do this to improve their productivity I think we're going to see more and more of this even in offices; maybe not in Washington, but in other parts of the country they are having to be more productive They are having to use word processors; they are having to stretch clerical help by giving them better tools I think we have to pay more attention to this because, as Jim said, it is important with respect to inflation possibilities and also to our growth potential  Finally, [I am concerned about] the continuing strong dollar, the agricultural problem that Si has already referred to, the third world debt situation--I went to a meeting last week at the State Department about the latter and that doesn't seem to me to be a problem that has gone away--and the thrifts, which are still hanging on the edge of the cliff Looking at all four of those factors, I find it very difficult to think in terms of interest rates going any higher at all, because I think that would push all of those problems into a still more serious mode And heaven knows they are bad enough!  May I just ask a question? I haven't seen what it would do to the numbers to have an average of the months for the preceding year used as the base I think that was one of the proposals that--  I think they have it two ways  I support alternative I I'll just say ""ditto"" to Governor Partee's comments plus add another observation about M1 And that is In 1984, using the revised numbers, M1 growth was 52 percent, which was 08 below the midpoint of last year's goal, if I did the arithmetic correctly I know we decided not rebase Still, if the targets for last year were appropriate and if that's the way M1's actual performance came in, then I don't think we should ignore that when we set the targets for this year Therefore, I would like to add that to all the other reasons for having the M1 range at 4 to 8 percent Also, as I listen to comments--and I also went back and re- read materials for the last two years--I'm not convinced that we really have identified in any exact way the relationship between money growth and the economy I don't think we always know what's going to happen to velocity; we may think we do, or would like to, but I don't think it works out that way So, maybe it's more honest to send a signal that we don't have these precise measures and, therefore, we will go with broader bands  Did you say 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent?  That's what I want; I want the 9-1/2 percent high end  I would too  I can handle no change from the present [stance], if that's what alternative B is I would be concerned, though, if no change brought about a substantial rise in the fed funds rate because of how that is interpreted in the markets as a signal of what we're doing and also because of the very severe problem with the super dollar and some of the other special factors that I've mentioned before  Those that have checking  Just to educate me, if we go with the 4 to 7 percent for M1, can you tell me why we can't tie it to the midpoint of the fourth quarter--that is, the range for last year that we shot for?  Making that up was one of the reasons why I wanted to have a wider band So, I can go with the narrower band if it's calculated from a higher level  Are we supposed to make a certain assumption about the value of the dollar to be consistent?  The staff have [M1] at 6-1/2 percent in their assumptions "
2900,1985-03-26,SEGER," I want to thank the Chairman for visiting with some of the same people who have been talking to me for the last six months If there's one theme that I get from these individuals, it's basically that their concerns involve the strong dollar--the surge in imports and the loss of export markets These people include anyone from farmers to manufacturers but are primarily manufacturers I heard within just the last couple of weeks, for example, that Ford Motors is closing the tractor plant that's right near where I have lived in the Detroit suburbs because they can no longer manufacture profitably in this country They're going to move the operation overseas I would just like to point out that once these movements are made they don't quickly reverse course The dollar could take a dive in six months and it's unlikely, in my judgment, that they would then move back So, I think the longer this goes on the more serious the consequences And I don't think that we should take them lightly  Another thing I'd like to mention involves what I see as the risks in the staff forecast As a cynic looking at consumer spending, what I see besides a lot of the spending going to imports is a lot of spending supported by credit--those magic plastic cards and things like that In the auto industry, particularly, there are special terms--extending from 4 years to 5 years the term on a new car loan in order to get the monthly payment down sufficiently to qualify a buyer You're living on borrowed time when that goes on to a very great degree Also, there are tremendous special rate inducements; 88 percent is one number that you see, again as a means of trying to drag the people in off the streets and to get the monthly payments down so that they qualify I think this is producing some good auto sales numbers at the moment, but it is the kind of foundation that to me looks like mush The risk in business fixed investment has been mentioned by numerous people but I will repeat it There are high vacancies in office buildings; there are major lags here and I don't think we've seen the full impact of these tax reform proposals on  -24-    3/26/85  business spending In the multifamily residential area, I would say ditto There are substantial vacancies in apartment buildings and, also, I don't believe the tax response has shown up entirely  In terms of the dominant factors I think we should look at-- and maybe this reflects my background, having held their hands and nursed the sick thrifts in 1981 and 1982--I see this fragility of the financial system as going far beyond Ohio It is not that Ohio was an unimportant event It certainly was a media event and made a lot of individuals aware of this problem But I think there would be a lot of sick people around this country if they knew the condition of the rest of the thrifts and if they knew that probably a good 10 percent will go in the soup between now and sometime next year And that's not because of somebody dipping in the till or a governor acting overly enthusiastically These are fundamental problems with solvency and insolvency And think what that does to FSLIC To me it's like being reinsured by somebody who is three weeks from bankruptcy rather than bankrupt already But I don't think that that word is generally out and that the problems are generally appreciated  The other factor I think we ought to give primary attention to in formulating monetary policy is this dollar strength that I've already referred to I would be extremely concerned about any further rise in interest rates I don't care if M1 growth goes to 37 percent next month, which I don't think it will But this is the one thing-- in case people haven't followed the thrift situation carefully--that does impact on thrifts very directly It is the one thing that we do have an influence on that does hurt them or does influence them If the increase in money market rates that has occurred since the last FOMC meeting--30 to 75 basis points or whatever it was--would just go on to total one percentage point and if that were factored into the cost of funds for thrifts, it would put somewhere between 50 and 75 percent of the industry in a loss situation And that's on top of the ones that are already staring at insolvency So, I think that interest rates are the connecting link and I don't think that we can ignore them if we're really concerned about this fragility problem In fact, if I had been told at the last FOMC meeting that Steve and Peter would have been producing interest rate increases of 30 to 75 basis points, I would have dissented So I hope that our move today will be moderate and that whatever we do we will take careful notice of what our steps are doing and will be doing to interest rates  I guess I would like to begin with a question Is the borrowing target really a target or isn't it? I sit here and I hear these numbers; yet at the next FOMC meeting I see what we come in with--  It's higher than I thought I understood at the last meeting  At some point, though, do we at this Committee meeting have to take into account these changing attitudes toward excess reserves?  Well, okay  It still seems that we're getting more of an interest rate impact than we expect or plan for at these meetings  I understand that we're not operating on an interest rate target But when we're trying to look at the various alternatives, one of the things I look at is what the expected interest rate impact will be given one choice versus another And that's all I'm saying  In terms of the alternatives, if I had to choose among them, I'd take alternative B but with a tilt toward ""A"" rather than a tilt toward ""C"" because of my concerns about the impact of any additional increase in short-term interest rates on the financial system  I wanted $350 million; I don't think I said it  Right  And put the ease first "
2924,1985-05-21,SEGER," I have been very impressed with the size of the downward revision in the official staff forecast since our Humphrey- Hawkins FOMC meeting in February That shows a far more significant change than just the change from the March meeting to this meeting I must say that I concur with those downward revisions because of the problems with the manufacturing sector of this country and the import competition The fact that imports are hurting not just the auto industry and not just textiles but a broad spectrum of companies in many, many different industries really depresses me Also, I see the kinds of people who are aware of this individuals I would expect to be unsophisticated and not even know what exchange rates are But they are tuned in to the super dollar; they also are tuned into why it's super; and they know that it is hitting them very directly I think that we have not seen the full extent of this yet  Also, I continue to be very concerned about the fragilities of the financial system I got on this jag early; unfortunately, it has been going on since '81 and '82 and I don't see it getting better I see it getting a lot worse because it is not just a couple of states that have had specific problems, namely local depressions; it is now a lot broader Unlike Jerry, I don't think this is because free markets don't work I think the problems with the financial system go back to poor public policy in the '70s namely, a very inflationary policy that sent bad signals to financial institutions and participants in financial markets Then when the gears were shifted and we went into a more moderate approach to public policy, ie, fighting inflation and producing deflation in certain sectors of the economy, it was a real adjustment for those people to make Also, I think we have to be candid and say we probably have not regulated them as well as we could have Supervision has left a lot to be desired That is the message that I think comes through from Ohio and Maryland It isn't that free markets don't work but that the supervisor did a crummy job I think further that if you really started to dig into the asset portfolios of many institutions that have not been looked at, you're going to find a lot of water in there to squeeze out We haven't seen it all yet And when that squeezing takes place, I think we are going to see many, many more insolvencies I am not just talking about thrifts; I am talking about banks This is, of course, a problem for those institutions themselves but I am more and more worried about how that will impact on consumer confidence in general and on business confidence--and particularly how it will impact on these little towns in rural areas If you want to have some fun, go back and read about  -16-    5/21/85  the 1920s and the problems in the agricultural community in that decade and what that did not just to agriculture but to whole sections of the country when the problems with farms brought down farm banks and the result was tremendous local recessions or depressions I think this is one thing we have to take very, very seriously  Finally, I just want to mention that I talked to three of the highest level economists in the auto industry and I'll just relay to you a couple comments from them because I think they are rather interesting In general, their sales forecasts are below what we are talking about One is using 105 million units or possibly slightly above that as total new car deliveries for calendar year 1985 Some of the sales that used to be in the form of autos are now going to be for small trucks, so there might be a little more in there; they think truck sales will be about 45 million The big point this fellow made was that it takes a lot more marketing money to move cars In other words, consumers are not coming in and beating the doors down to buy; they are having to be dragged in to purchase Interest rate incentives are being used very heavily The customers are interest rate sensitive, and the special promotional rates of 85 to 88 percent for slow moving cars have worked to move those specific cars Auto makers are putting those incentives on some other cars--small cars--because they want to help their ""cafe"" ratings with the US government The penalties are going to be severe if they don't average out okay for this year, so they want to move more of these fuel economy cars to help that Another chief economist is talking about 106 million deliveries for the year and truck deliveries of 44 million But again, he mentioned this interest rate incentive to move new cars It is substantial He said that the going regular rate for new car loans would be about 145 percent and they are using 88 percent on selected lines The third fellow says that the market at the moment is the strongest in this recovery if you just look at sales volume, year-to-date According to his numbers they are coming out with 109 million [currently] but for the whole year he still thinks deliveries will be down somewhere around 106 to 107 million And they're having to buy the business He said the incentives provided on some of the big car purchases are $2,000 He also mentioned the competition from imports, such as Mercedes Benz, on the big car lines, and he brought up the matter of the strong dollar In his view, we have not seen the full impact of the rise in the dollar in lower auto prices and, therefore, they have a lot of room to cut prices if they want to go after sales because this has just been going into their pockets in the form of profits If they really wanted to go after sales more aggressively, he thinks they could Anyway, [these economists] are not complacent about the economy as a whole and they see a slowdown being something that would cool off their numbers still more  As I reviewed the table here and the charts on the various monetary aggregates, it seemed to me that what I saw for M2 and M3 was, as Chuck said, that as of April we were already not only within the parallel lines but within the cones Also, as I look at where the various alternatives A, B, and C are plotted for the end of the quarter, they are not really that far apart They are within the cones at that point For M1 I see that as of April we're a touch above but with each alternative--A, B, or C--we are going to be above the parallel line So if we're concerned about how the financial market participants would view this, I don't see that it makes more than about a nickel's worth of difference I don't think that they just look at M1 to begin with; and secondly, I don't think that they would be that sensitive to these short-range positions we are taking So I guess I could practically roll the dice here and say that if everyone is going with alternative B, I certainly can But I hope if there is a way to lean that we would lean toward alternative A rather than toward tightening, particularly because I think we have to be very careful about what our actions do to the fed funds rate and what message that sends to market participants about what we did today In terms of the borrowing target, frankly, I'm so confused about how the thrift numbers come in here that I really don't know exactly what  -31-    5/21/85  number to pick up But I think I would rather have it lower than higher, which is a very vague way to put it  Yes, that's high  Zero to 12 percent "
2949,1985-07-09,SEGER," I would too I would tilt toward something to reduce rates below where they are now  That's a good idea  But our forecasts are running 1 to 1-1/2 percentage points below what we were talking about back in February If we thought then that these targets were appropriate, then don't they look sort of out of line?  Can we ignore, though, the changed forecast for this year? The staff has cut its estimate of real growth from 36 percent down to 2-1/4 percent for 1985 and has cut it slightly for 1986 from 27 percent to 25 percent And comparing the estimates of the Board members and the Presidents in February to today, those also were cut rather significantly It would seem to me that we would have to take that into account that what was appropriate for monetary targets back in February ought to be reexamined if we are perking along that much more slowly and the expectation is for continued sluggishness, using our own numbers here  There's a limit on withdrawals  Recession/depression?  [Their question is] Do they have a job?  Minus 2  What if it isn't a one-time downward shift? What if it's going to happen again?  You're a purist  I guess I'm more concerned about the health of the economy than most of my colleagues The sluggishness in some areas is actually almost to be described as a recession, if you look at certain parts of the industrial sector And Mr Guffey's farm area I would almost call a depression Looking at the strong dollar and the effect that it's having on the manufacturing sector, I would really like to push for something that is considered easing; if that's alternative A, then that's what I would vote for  I'm for 8 percent also  3 to 8 "
2977,1985-08-20,SEGER," Peter and I discussed this a little because I think this is a bigger issue than just the Open Market Desk in that how we deal with Japan has general public policy interest We have so few levers to use on them, and people I know on Wall Street tell me [the playing field] is not even Maybe it is in a narrow government dealer sense; I don't know But certainly, looking at the financial markets across the board, we treat them a lot better in this country than they treat us I think we ought to consider a lot more angles than whether or not the dealer in securities is well capitalized and does a big volume of business I am a competitive person, and I think it is only fair that it go both ways  I hate to make this a bias of the Supervision and Regulation Committee, which I think is the way it will look since--  --since I am on that Committee with Governor Partee, but I agree that there is a risk of recession I think the real vulnerability is the financial system; I just don't know what will be the specific trigger to ring the bell there I don't know whether it will be in farm credit, whether it will be some fallout from what is now going on in Maryland, or whether it will be something more in the mortgage-backed securities area, but my stomach tells me that [the financial system] will be the trigger that will cause the unwinding  I had a couple of conversations recently with some people about the import situation, since imported cars from Japan are a very big portion of that total number You might find it interesting that Detroit, at least, does not see any big fall-off in imports In fact, they are surprised that the Japanese reacted so quickly to the ending of the ""gentlemen's agreement"" or whatever you care to call it that had been on the books for four years Apparently, they would have sent more cars over faster but they could not get them on the ships Now they are [on the ships] and the sales of imports would have been still stronger except for the strike of the car haulers; the import dealers are far more impacted by that than the domestic dealers because they have to get the cars from the ports to the dealer lots Anyway, I don't see this import issue going away I see it getting a lot worse And the ""big decline in the dollar"" is in terms of weighted averages; if you look at the dollar vis-a-vis the Japanese yen, the decline isn't that much These people out in the trenches do not expect the Japanese--even if the dollar were to decline further-- to quickly adjust the prices of the autos upward In fact it would not surprise them to see the Japanese cut car prices to get a much bigger chunk of our market That did not make me feel terribly good I don't care what the theory is, but what may go on in a business strategy sense is very, very key to this in my judgment Also, a couple of people I talked with are in the process of cutting their total sales expectations figure Before, they had a decline of 300,000 units between the expectations for 1985 and for 1986; I don't know what they will come out with when they get through the revision process This is something that already is a big drag on the economy and I think it is going to get worse Maybe I am just being a parochial Midwesterner, but I think that this is a really significant sapping of economic strength, and when the foundation gets termites in it the house eventually feels it So, that is my concern, and I do think that lower interest rates help in these particular situations  I was thinking about the objectives set at the last meeting and the fact that a position of no change in reserve pressure produced borrowing going from $350 million up to about $800 million in one of the maintenance periods and an average above $500 million in the other periods, and short and intermediate rates crept up something in the neighborhood of 35 to 50 basis points, depending upon which series you look at So, if that is what no change produced, then I guess today I would like to vote for alternative A, which is an easing My thinking is that maybe an easing position or less pressure on reserves will produce no change in rates, which is what I think is really needed In fact, I would like to see the recent uptick unwound or undone and the borrowings back to the target mentioned last time So I guess I will vote for alternative A with a borrowings target of about $300 to $350 million  But I thought it was in the context of some other--  What if today's levels of exchange rates are consistent with still higher deficits in the balance of trade?  Well, the American banks would buy government securities and make less consumer loans and tighten up their standards there Is that all bad?  Well, you have to look industry-by-industry too  It was a ""might"" and a ""would"" "
3003,1985-10-01,SEGER," What did you think of the NABE forecast of a recession late next year or early 1987, since they're having their annual convention right now?  Many of my points have already been made, but I would just like to emphasize that I believe the risks are on the down side The consumer spending numbers that look very robust and retail sales that look good are being supported by very generous use of credit cards and other kinds of credit I picked up some numbers from the treasurer of one of the captive auto finance companies and the terms of auto credit really did something to me 45 percent of their August contracts were for 60-month loans Almost half of the contracts were for five years, which means that they needed that incentive plus a very low rate of 77 percent to get a monthly payment that was low enough to drag these people in off the streets I don't read that as a terribly, terribly strong demand situation Also, Si and I may talk to different people in the auto industry, but I haven't found anybody out there who doesn't think that this temporary burst of sales is going to be reversed, that in fact they are borrowing from the future, and that later in October we will see a very big and significant drop in sales as they pay the price for moving these '85 models out very rapidly So I think we are going to see some distortion in the numbers here for a while that will make it very difficult to get a handle on what is really going on But I think that there isn't as much strength basically as one might conclude Secondly, on the housing matter, as the standards of the mortgage lenders and of the mortgage insurers are tightened, I think we are going to see that show up eventually in [a drop in] new housing starts I admit it hasn't happened yet, but I think it will and, therefore, starts may come in a little below what the staff is now estimating On plant and equipment spending, here again I think more and more companies are having profit problems, and that does feed back into their capital spending decisions and doesn't make them very positive about it So, I think there may be some downside risk there  On the inflation front, like most of the others here, I think the numbers look pretty good I also would like to emphasize that there are sectors of the economy where there is actual deflation, which doesn't seem to get mentioned much Also, I certainly would read the M1 numbers, but I would be much more concerned with what's going on with M1 if M2 and M3 also were going off the top of the chart, which they aren't--particularly M3 Having just met with the Decatur Chamber of Commerce yesterday and the National Association of Manufacturers, you would need to give me a bullet-proof vest if I suggested any policy change that would lead to higher interest rates or a tightening, because both of those groups are very sensitive to the financial side of the economy They are tying that to their own problems So I am torn between supporting ""B"" with a tilt toward ""A"" or just going straight to ""A"" I would be very, very concerned about any uptick in interest rates at this point for the reasons I mentioned--the impact on agriculture, the other areas that have big debt problems, and furthermore the possibility that that would undermine the recent G-5 agreement So I guess I am somewhere between  -22-    10/1/85  ""A"" and ""B"" with the borrowing down to the level we were talking about at the last meeting  Maybe we can sabotage computers! That would be worse  They are just profit-maximizers "
3029,1985-11-04,SEGER," I do too  That isn't recorded as consumer spending though, is it?  It's the lags  I just had two comments One involves housing and the comment is that the tightening of terms and lending standards is there and that it is going to get more prevalent We haven't seen much of it yet in the statistics but that doesn't mean it won't show up in 1986 I just hear too many comments from specific lenders about either tightening on their own or being forced to by the mortgage insurers; so I think that that may knock 100,000 to 200,000 off the  -14-    11/4-5/85  numbers we are showing Also, a comment on office building financing If you get into some of the details, what you find is that the banks are doing the construction financing and they are willing to do it because there is permanent financing being supplied by the life insurance companies Also, there is still a lot of syndication going on There are rich doctors, lawyers and dentists who haven't adjusted to the new economic realities of a less inflationary environment and, also, they view this kind of investment as a good tax shelter If tax reform measures actually get passed and the marginal rates are cut, I think that will kick that in the head real well So, again, the combination of the financing facts and the agency rates suggests that sometime this is going to peak out, although I am not smart enough to know when  One final comment about the value of the dollar The business people I talked with in the Midwest are certainly not sitting there worrying about the inflationary impact of further declines of the dollar because they long ago ceased believing their economists' forecasts But one thing they do know is that the appreciating dollar nearly killed them and they are making decisions right now on things such as closing plants or moving production abroad So time is of the essence here to get the dollar down, because these are decisions that are not going to be reversed quickly if they ever are reversed Somehow or other I don't think that we necessarily appreciate that fact They are not that concerned about what the declining dollar will do to inflation, but they are very concerned about what will happen in terms of their survival if it doesn't decline  They also buy supplies, though, that are imports, It's a very competitive world out there  I thought you were going to say that they got a couple of bankers to serve  Like Farm Credit?  It would narrow that spread, if they knew the Fed was in buying the Farm Credit ones  M2 and M3  $300 to $500 million  I do  Peter, are you more sensitive to rate movements again? I know we are not targeting them, but are you more sensitive to what happens, say, the first day or two after an FOMC meeting because every Fed watcher in the world is hanging over his or her telerate and over the various machines?  Well, what if tomorrow at 1100 am--the day after the FOMC meets--the fed funds rate is at 10-1/4 percent?  If we are forced by Humphrey-Hawkins to talk in terms of GNP growth and unemployment and inflation, it seems to me, though, that sometime it has to be tied into what we do, whether we are targeting it precisely or not  But the monetary growth numbers are cut back from what we talked about at the last meeting "
3056,1985-12-16,SEGER," I just wanted to ask Steve a question about the likely moves by financial institution managers once the deregulation is completed Would there be any chance at all that they would try to radically simplify their deposit structures? It has gotten pretty expensive to keep all of these different permutations and combinations of accounts As I was sitting here listening to your explanation of some of these other changes, it occurred to me that there might be some rationale for simplification I am old enough to remember when they had checking accounts and savings accounts and time accounts, period--not 17 varieties of other things I just wondered if there might be some move in that direction  Mr Annunzio said to cut up your credit cards  There was a conference just held that would suggest the price of gold  No, I didn't say that I just said that there was a conference just held that would suggest the price of gold  What would happen if we were to publish the monetary aggregates less often?  -25-    12/16-17/85  Well, I think the economy has grown too slowly in 1985 I went back and looked at the information we put out at the time of the February Humphrey-Hawkins meeting and the July Humphrey- Hawkins meeting Looking at the central tendencies that we published [in February] for real GNP growth for 1985, we had 3-1/2 to 4 percent So it looks as if there are some other people who must be disappointed also in the performance By July we had cut it back to 2-3/4 to 3 percent, but again that's above what we actually seem to be achieving for this year Then I look at 1986 and the staff forecast of a rousing 21 percent growth rate and again compare that to the central tendency for 1986 as published in the July Humphrey-Hawkins Report That was 2-1/2 to 3-1/4 percent So again, it seems to me that we are running short of a number of our expectations I guess what concerns me is that even to get this 21 percent in 1986 we have to assume additional monetary ease, a significant decline in interest rates And we also assume--I think I heard Jim say--that about half of the improvement in real GNP next year will come from net exports That means to me, anyway, that we will need further declines in the dollar We all have our pet samples of people we talk to, and the group that I check my ideas with suggests that they have noticed the decline that has taken place, but they are not going to be in pig heaven without still further declines I am also concerned about the impact that the tax reform proposals are having on the economy I think it has created a lot of uncertainties and I am afraid, as Chuck said, that at some point the activities that had been based on beating the tax reforms in certain areas are going to evaporate and that will yank the rug out from under certain sectors of the economy So having said all this, what I would like to propose is that we get going with this additional monetary ease and that we try to get interest rates moving down, in line with what the staff forecast is assuming I would like to suggest that one reason why short rates haven't come down is that the discount rate is preventing them from moving down That's just like an anchor, and I would hint that a one half percentage point cut in the discount rate would do great things to move a number of short- term rates down, including the prime rate  You put them in ARMs  Well, as I indicated earlier, I am concerned about the slow growth in the economy that we've had this year and the staff forecast of a continuation of that next year While I'm not one of the recession crowd at the moment, I think as we stagger along at a slow rate there is a vulnerability to a recession I don't know what would push us in a major financial institution failure or something I don't know exactly what Anyway, I think there is an underlying vulnerability there Also, I agree that the short-term rate decline came to a halt some time ago and that it is not going to resume until the discount rate is cut I would hope that we could take that step sometime soon I think that this would help the dollar to drop somewhat further I don't want it to drop 30 percent over a week's time, but I think it would help our basic industries tremendously to have some further decline in the dollar Also, to the extent that we cut our interest rates, I think it would allow some of our trading partners to cut theirs I don't know if it has to be absolutely coordinated, but I think it would at least give them the opportunity to do so, particularly the Japanese So, my preference in terms of the alternatives would be something on the order of alternative A with a 1/2 point discount rate cut sometime soon, and the borrowings specifications in some fairly broad range because I'm not that impressed with my ability to identify specific narrow ranges with monetary growth outcomes  You mean that we don't have any courage  -57-    12/16-17/85  5 to 10 percent?  That's true?  How about ""will likely grow at some unknown speed""! "
3081,1986-02-11,SEGER," It depends on the composition, though, doesn't it? At any one time, they will be short of capacity for a certain    2/11-12/86  model or a mini-van or something and have space to accommodate other kinds of cars  One nice thing about being last is that so much of what I was thinking has already been stated; but I will just make a couple of points One is that my forecast for this year's real GNP growth is a touch below the staff's The main reason is that, although I would like to see exports respond very rapidly to the deteriorating dollar, I am not convinced that they will Also, I would like to think that imports would respond negatively to the deteriorating dollar but, unfortunately, I am not convinced that that is going to happen either So, I don't think that we are going to have net exports contribute as much this year as our staff numbers suggest Also, I am a little more negative about plant and equipment spending I am concerned that questions about tax reform and what the proposals will do to business tax bills will discourage a lot of investment of that type; as long as those proposals are out there and as long as they look as negative as they do, that's going to happen So, those are the two places where my numbers deviate from the staff's On the inflation side, I am a little more encouraged about the impact of the deteriorating dollar on inflation I just don't see these higher prices being passed through quickly I am very convinced that the foreign competition, having gotten their toe or foot or whole body in this market, rather love it here, and I think that they are going to want to maintain market share and are not going to do themselves in through hasty price adjustments That's what my sense tells me; I hope it's not just wishful thinking  If we are off on velocity as we were last year, should we have [higher] ranges for all of them--Ml, M2 and M3--to allow for that?  Well, we were in for M3 and we just barely got in for M2, didn't we, by the end of the year?  As I went over these various alternatives in the last couple of days, it seemed to me that there were really very narrow differences between them  That's right I kept going over the alternatives and then I would reread the expected outcomes from the various alternatives They suggest to me a degree of precision in forecasting that in my 20 months here I'm sorry to say I just haven't seen So, I think the way we retain credibility with the financial markets is to level with them I think the way we do that is to say that we don't hit both sides every time We are not perfect forecasters, as no one is even on Wall Street So if we set wide bands, that really would be a positive factor for our credibility; it would not be viewed as our turning into inflationary ""wackos"" It just would be a more honest indication that we're impressed with the uncertainties in the economy, with the changed relationships between the various monetary aggregates and nominal or real GNP growth, and all the things that we discuss here regularly Whatever we do, if it's explained in this way--and, of course, the Chairman has a good opportunity next week to go through all the explanations--it can be handled Therefore, I would like to suggest that we use all the information we can and present everything we can so it will not look as if we're holding back any information, whether it's on Ml, debt, or whatever I think we should present [the ranges] but have very broad bands and not suggest that we can [be precise by using] 1/2 percentage points I think that's ludicrous For Ml, I could live with either 3 to 8 percent or I could live with 2 to 10 percent Today I just don't want to suggest that any sort of nice bull's eye targeting is possible For M2, I could even go 6 to 10 percent Again, these are ranges; that's not saying that we're shooting for 10 percent For M3, I'd favor 6 to 9 percent or thereabouts I would keep some sort of debt measure, but clean it up as Frank Morris suggested for these various events that are going on in corporate and state and local government finance that really are not tied to economic activity So, that would be my preference    2/11-12/86  But we don't control it I think that is the point  I just want to take one minute to bore you with some ancient history I was looking at some of the numbers that we looked at a year ago and, at that point, we had seen a surprisingly  -56-    2/11-12/86  strong performance of real GNP in the fourth quarter At the time of the December FOMC meeting we had been expecting real GNP growth of 13 percent Lo and behold, it came in at 39 percent--or the Greenbook was showing 39 percent for the 4th quarter of 1984 As I recall, our reaction to this was somewhat like I sense our reaction is today to the strong employment numbers Fasten your seat belts, we are about to take off As I look back at 1985, other than that big expectation at the beginning of the year, I didn't see much of a takeoff I read the numbers as a rather sluggish performance; I think real GNP growth for the year was something like 2-1/2 percent I just mention that because I think it suggests that we can put too much emphasis on a current number and sort of extrapolate that, whether it is a strong number or a weak number That is a risk In terms of a specific vote, when I look at the actual numbers I have the same problem with these alternatives as I did with our long-range ones We really don't have major differences between ""A"" and ""B;"" in fact, they are the same numbers, rounded, for M2 and M3 As for Ml, I don't have great confidence in our ability to control that, period So I am looking at the borrowing target I prefer something closer to alternative A where the borrowing target would be closer to what we actually have been achieving If we accompany that with a discount rate cut, I think we would find that the fed funds rate would not be hanging around 7-3/4 or 8 percent but would be down probably to 7-1/2 percent or below So that is what I would like to vote for In terms of a specific number for the borrowing target, that would be something in the neighborhood of, let's say, $250 to $300 million  You would use $300 million to calculate the path either way, wouldn't you? If it went from $200 to $400 million or a little on either side of $300--  You predict that that would keep the fed funds rate in the same neighborhood as it has been Am I reading you correctly? Is that close--  What has been the daily high on the funds rate in the last couple of weeks?  We won't see it at 7 percent with the discount rate at 7-1/2 percent  If you used approximately a $300 million borrowing target but accompanied it with a discount rate cut, what kind of fed funds results would you expect?  I think I'll still stick with ""No"" "
3106,1986-04-01,SEGER," I'll second  I'll move them  SPEAKER(?) Second  Did you see the article in The New York Times Sunday by Bergsten suggesting that the yen should appreciate still further to about 150?  You don't think he has a very typical view then?  Ooh!  I thought 160 was a little extreme; 100 is worse  Second  I certainly agree that there are these three very basic positive factors that should be helping the economy but, as Jerry and Bob have said, a couple of them can cut either way-- particularly the oil price decline Maybe when we feel good, we tend to emphasize the pluses of that rather than the minuses Now that we actually are seeing lower gasoline prices at the pumps, that normally would be viewed as a plus for auto sales; yet in the auto market we are seeing constraints coming from the consumer debt burden I have actually heard some bankers in the last couple of weeks--these groups that pass through town here on their circuit to visit people--say that they are beginning to pay attention to the delinquencies in the consumer credit area and that there may even be a bit of evidence that they are going to look at credit standards So that can be an offset, or at least a partial offset, to the lower gasoline prices  Also, I certainly would expect the lower long-term interest rates to help plant and equipment spending; yet at the same time there are these questions about what is going to happen to tax reform Until the [lawmakers] do something--either kill it or pass it or act  -12-    4/1/86  on it decisively--many businesses are going to postpone making decisions on expansion or replacement of equipment because the tax considerations are simply too important to ignore I can't quantify that, but I think it is a real drag and, in fact, will tend to offset some of the good interest rate news until businessmen and women get a better reading on that  Despite the lower value of the dollar, import competition is tough in a lot of countries I hate to admit this, being from Detroit, but not everybody buys a foreign car just because the price tag is lower than the price tag on a domestic car I don't happen to drive an import but people tell me that there is a quality matter So, I don't believe we are going to see import competition necessarily knocked out immediately by the change in the exchange rate It would be nice to think that that would happen, but I don't assume it Also, in the case of machine tools, I think it was my friend from Atlanta who pointed out that there is more import competition in machinery and machine tools, and I hear that also In addition, there is this commercial real estate problem that is even spreading into the Midwest It's no longer just the people down in Bob Boykin's area who like to put up buildings and keep them unoccupied; there are some around the Detroit suburbs and elsewhere, where buildings are popping up like mushrooms on corners Again, this can be a drag, I think Therefore, while I am fairly optimistic, I am not as optimistic as I might be if I didn't think there were these somewhat offsetting drags on an otherwise very placid picture  I have been trying to check that What I heard is that all of his advisors told him not to do it, but that he is very bottom-line oriented and he felt that they could get this much of an increase done at this point He thought it wouldn't cost them that much in sales, so in terms of their overall profit picture they would actually benefit slightly They are going to reinstate the incentive programs My personal opinion is that he probably just didn't take the advice that was being given  Except the higher sticker stays after the incentive financing goes  Well, but the--  The discount [price] is the true sticker, right I think the price hike is from sticker  -13-    4/1/86  I agree with you  I would vote for alternative B and if there is a shading needed, I would shade a touch toward alternative A The positive factors we have talked about extensively; I am still impressed, though, that there are some drags on the economy that we have to be aware of I would like to suggest that in a technical way we look for opportunities to cut the discount rate I am not talking about fiddling with the reserves, but if foreign countries such as Japan alter their discount rates again and if our long-term rates decline a little more, I think we will have a yield structure in this country that is unsustainable And the rate that will prove to be out of line is the discount rate To the extent that we could cut that a bit, following market movements, I think that would help without gunning the economy So, I would go for something like ""B"" with a range around the $300 million borrowing target, or $200 to $300 million "
3132,1986-05-20,SEGER," Peter, do you sense that commercial banks have cashed in a lot of their paper profits in their bond holdings? Or have they just been playing it by ear and taking their time?  Oh, I didn't mean that they're weren't staying invested but--  How about their trading accounts? How are they running?  Thank you    5/20/86  Second  Yes, but they attract a lot of retired executives    5/20/86  machinery, and oil fuel equipment are all depressed sectors Again, it's a mixed bag Commercial construction in Kansas City and Omaha looks very good and suburban Denver is still going pretty strong Downtown Denver, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa aren't [unintelligible] like Houston and perhaps Dallas will be someday Residential construction is following that trend; that is to say, in the urban areas in which there has been low unemployment and good activity--for example, Kansas City and Denver--residential construction is very, very strong But it is severely depressed in Oklahoma, whether it be Tulsa or Oklahoma City  One of the things I would like to call attention to, and Martha has already referred to it, is the revenue shortfalls that are coming out of this depressed agriculture/energy economy Oklahoma, Kansas, Wyoming, and Nebraska all are experiencing shortfalls in revenues And this is sort of a double-barreled effect in the sense that the revenues are not coming in and the states and other municipalities are looking for revenues and are increasing taxes, whether sales taxes or otherwise It is impacting those states and will keep them largely depressed--unless some other good events such as Chernobyl happen, I guess!  Okay Another thing that has suddenly started to bug me is the feedback of these weak sectors on the Treasuries of various states and what that may do to their urge to spend I understand that several states already are noticing the problems with tax collections Is this not something else that could change and contribute to some sort of drag on the economy? Also, the revenue sharing, I believe, is continuing to be attacked here in Washington For many states--at least the one I am from--the revenue sharing has funded many, many different activities My final question involves what Manley was mentioning about trade and how quickly the improvement will actually show up in the data My gut reaction is that the lags may be longer than any of us would like to see I am not disputing your forecast at all; I am just suggesting that maybe these are some of the matters that could in fact [unintelligible] on it Thank you  Well, I won't repeat the comments I have heard about the unevenness, the 2-tiered or 3-tiered [economy] or whatever it is, and the lots of tears in Dallas I agree with the staff forecast of a pickup in growth in the second half of the year What I would like to concentrate on are some question marks that I see-- things that may prevent that pickup from happening, even though I would like to see it happen and I don't know that it won't One thing is this whole issue of tax reform Practically every business person that I have talked with seems to be discussing that Last week I chatted with a homebuilders group They had done a survey and it may be interesting to hear what they concluded--this was based on the Senate Finance bill--about the impact on the overall economy The impact on single-family housing would be positive, but they thought that the impact on multifamily housing for sale and on rental office building and commercial and industrial construction would be negative And a substantial group thought it would be very negative Anyhow, it is impacting on a lot of decision-making and is causing many decisions to be postponed I don't know how that will work out for the rest of this year--whether in fact it will bring about some extra activity late in the year If we know, for example, that certain changes will take effect on January 1, maybe we could get a blip late this year followed by a little hole the beginning of next year I just think it is something to look at As Jim said, our econometric models don't give us good answers as to what this will do, but I think it is worth considering  In the auto sector, I believe Jim mentioned that the auto [production] cutbacks had cost us about 1-1/4 percentage points in this quarter I wonder, given the size of the inventories as of May    5/20/86  its asset holdings from short-term paper into bonds We see this in M2 also M2 has been depressed in part because the public has shifted into these mutual funds that President Morris has commented on  Well, I would support maintaining the existing reserve pressure but I have the same problem with the alternatives presented today as I did a few months ago, and that is that there seems to be so little difference among them I would like Bob Parry to give me the model that shows the impact in 1987 of a difference in M1 growth in this quarter of 3/4 percentage point at annual rate between ""A"" and ""B"" and another 3/4 percentage point between ""B"" and ""C,"" and 1/2 percentage point between the alternatives for M2, and 1/4 point between those for M3 I would like you to tell me how those marginal changes will impact on inflation, trade, auto sales, housing, etc in 1987 I think these are very, very, tiny differences As I say, I'm totally willing to go with maintaining the existing reserve pressure; but ""A"" doesn't send a message to me that it is a big change in the easing direction, nor does ""C"" seem like a big change the other way, particularly when we are talking about [a quarter point on these] numbers Maybe I am missing something or maybe you are hiding those equations from me, but I haven't seen that kind of forecasting ability around here Anyhow, in terms of the problems in the economy, as I said, I doubt that ""A,"" ""B,"" or ""C"" will solve our trade problems immediately or take care of manufacturing or third world debt or all of the other ailments we talk about So, for that reason I will stick with the status quo On the directives, again because we are going to take a fresh look at this in July, I would just go with alternative II "
3158,1986-07-08,SEGER," Second  I have another dollar question for Mr Truman I have heard business people say that comparing the current value of the dollar to the absolute high back in February of 1985 tends to overstate the amount of the decline in terms of how they benefit from it They say it is better to look at something like the current level versus, say, the average for 1984 or the average for 1985 because they point out that they didn't do a lot of transactions at the exact peak of the dollar So this comparison we use overstates the amount of the deterioration and suggests more of an improvement than they, in fact, would be likely to get  Also, I couldn't hear Mr Kichline's comment How much of a downward revision did you say we had made in our collective forecast for real GNP in 1986?  You have a summary of forecasts--I think it's chart 19 or something like that--where you show forecasts for real GNP of Board members, presidents, and staff Sitting this far away, I thought I heard you say something about the downward revision  Okay Thank you  I really think our credibility with financial market participants would be enhanced by admitting what is obvious that we don't know what is going on with M1 and we can't really explain it The relationship between monetary growth, as measured by M1, and economic activity has certainly broken down Therefore, we are better off not coming up with a quantitative range because regardless of what we call it--a monitoring range or something else-- the Fed watchers still look at the numbers and they still plot and compare actual Ml figures to whatever range we have mentioned Also, the media pick these numbers up and do the comparison regardless of our warnings about how risky it is to make something out of it They still do I think we would be better off dropping it--maybe ""dropping"" isn't the proper term; maybe ""putting it on ice"" or something like that would be the terminology to use I think we are  -16-    7/8-9/86  just misleading people when we keep a numerical range for either 1986 or 1987  Well, I think business is sluggish and I think it has been sluggish for most of this year Economists, both within and outside government, that I have spoken with in the last week or so seem to be busily revising their forecasts--mostly downward--probably in reaction to the recent rather weak indicators Back in February, I think Wayne Angell and I had the two lowest forecasts for real GNP growth for this year; mine was 2-1/2 percent And after hearing all the bullish comments at the table, I was feeling guilty about it so I took advantage of Jim Kichline's offer to accept revisions and I put it up to 3 percent Now I have moved it back down to 2-1/2 percent; I'm going round trip on this Unfortunately, I just don't see what is going to cause business to pep up I would like to see it happen; I would like to see stronger growth in the second half of this year I would like to see a very healthy, dynamic economy next year too, but I just have doubts about our ability to pull it off I know we are relying very heavily on a trade turnaround, but the people in trade that I speak with have convinced me that it is going to be very difficult to do We have already seen that the lags are longer; they are going to be still longer I agree with the comments of President Keehn and Governor Rice and some of the others about the impact of tax reform Just the uncertainties that have arisen from the proposals have tended to curb businesses' enthusiasm for expansion and modernization And if what is in the Senate bill actually becomes law, the disincentives to investments are very, very great That is the way I read it, and this--  -38-    7/8-9/86  Yes, but what I am saying is that even what is in the Senate bill will provide major disincentives to investment, even though we desperately need to modernize our manufacturing sector, particularly Anyhow, I also sense that there is some deterioration of confidence The latest survey done by the National Federation of Independent Business, done in late June, showed a significant slipping in the optimism among their members, particularly in their expected gains in real sales for the rest of the year Also, they have revised downward their inventory and capital spending plans I sense too that some of the inventory numbers and some of the new orders numbers were distorted by these labor negotiations; individuals were building up additional inventory to hedge against strikes in copper, aluminum and steel and now it looks as if those strikes will not take place They will have to work these inventories off In the auto industry, I think some of the strength in sales is more apparent than real because they are having to make such tremendous efforts to get these sales-- very great interest rate incentives are required, or cash rebates to customers, or additional rebates to the dealers themselves--and it is just very very difficult to get these [sales] Their inventories are also hefty, particularly at General Motors I can't imagine that this won't eventually lead to some pruning of production schedules I would like to be a raging bull but I guess I can't quite do it today Thank you  Kill two birds with one stone  I am for alternative A with a $300 million borrowing target and a swift cut in the discount rate I do think that lower rates would have some beneficial effects on the economy, particularly in the capital spending area With the changes coming from tax reform--assuming they materialize--there would be lower returns on investment Therefore, to the extent that funds can be borrowed at a lower rate, that would increase the number of projects that become feasible; so, I think it would have that impact Also, I think it would make it easier for debtors to carry their existing debt burdens at lower rates, whether they are farmers or home buyers or whatever So, I favor ""A""  Typographical error! "
3183,1986-08-19,SEGER," Is this tax reform package going to cool the commercial banks' enthusiasm for this kind of thing even further or am I reading press accounts wrongly?  How low are their reserves likely to be at the end of this month without this infusion? Is there any feel for that?  I'll second it  Are you saying this is a new policy, Jerry? I missed something  Especially if we never do it!  Have you sounded out many primary dealers on this matter?  Well, both sides being in the coupon market period, as a buyer or a seller  What would your maturities be in an average week? I can see what your total bill holdings are, but when you're talking about being prepared for the failure of XYZ bank in short order-- Without selling, I would suspect that you have some sort of laddering in your portfolio that each week you must have bills maturing and also--maybe not every week but fairly often--some of your existing coupons coming due  I wasn't going to comment on this, but since it involves going back and forth to Canada, people from Detroit  -26-    8/19/86  understand all this because they've gone back and forth to buy gasoline when it was cheaper there than back in Michigan and the same [is true] with automobiles They really watch this very carefully; they run over [the border] for meals, etc So I'm sure they psyched it out  I just want to report on some empirical research I did a couple of weeks ago by strolling through some local department stores and appliance stores When you do that you see a lot of merchandise, at least in women's clothing, say, that is from Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and even China So, again, I think that looking at the typical series we look at for the weighted-average value of the dollar is just not that illuminating because the currencies of these countries have not appreciated against the dollar So there hasn't been a big advantage for us here In appliances, I was stunned to find the inflow from Korea I used to think it was the Japanese that were providing all these TVs and so forth, but the Koreans are sending in a lot Also, I saw quite a bit from Taiwan So, I don't think that we're going to get a lot of consolation from this particular distribution of imports And, in talking with a lot of industrialists whose main competition comes from Canada, they are not getting good vibes at all The Canadian dollar is continuing weak relative to the American dollar  Yes, but if you're talking to someone from Bob Forrestal's area or some Senator from South Carolina, I think that these kinds of relationships are significant because they have a lot to do with protectionist sentiment, even though it all may come out in the wash  Since I am concerned with the general sluggishness of the economy and the specific areas of significant weakness, I think that the risk in the staff's forecast for the next six months and for 1987 is probably on the low side, particularly because of questions about tax reform and the various points made about international developments I can live with alternative B, assuming that it will be accompanied by a half percentage point discount rate cut and a borrowing target of about $300 million  How much of a move is it going to require in [unintelligible] move in the yen to 140?  I would "
3210,1986-09-23,SEGER," I'll move it  Did I hear you right that the Germans were on both sides of the market within a fairly short period? Are they trying to target the dollar-mark relationship?    9/23/86  I have one Why was it that we didn't know until the last day about this tremendous additional need for required reserves?  I have just a couple of comments since I have heard just about everything said that I was going to say In general, I am probably a hair more pessimistic than the staff, primarily because when I look at the auto industry I just have a feeling that we are going to give back more next year than the staff is assuming I am impressed with the current sales level--no doubt about that--which, I guess, shows what low interest rates will do and how inattentive a lot of consumers are But I think that this is not all a net gain I think the give-back will show up, particularly in the first quarter Also, I am just very nervous about the impact of tax reform on a whole lot of things, but particularly on business spending on new plant and equipment and on office buildings which, of course, are already under the gun I think that is just going to provide one more discouraging influence  We have been talking about this trade turnaround for a number of months and expecting that to provide quite a bit of support for the economy, and I certainly hope that happens But Senator Riegle sent me a little story which, with your permission I would like to tell, because I think it demonstrates how difficult it is to turn off the import competition This involves one of his constituent companies out in Michigan; they produce Being non- mechanical, I have no idea what those are, by the way, but apparently they are very important in the production of engines The company supplies parts for about three-fourths of the engines produced in this country and the Japanese had been their primary competition They have revamped their entire operation, they have spent heavily on R&D and on new equipment, etc, they have gotten wage concessions, and they have tried to imitate the Japanese in the labor-management relationship They have done remarkably well in dealing with the Japanese [competition] and they are now selling their main part for $550 Now, all of a sudden, the Koreans are calling on their major customers in this country and are offering them very similar products at $350 This isn't something I picked up; it came from Don Riegle But I think it is very indicative of how tough this job is going to be, particularly when we haven't seen the dollar deteriorate vis-a-vis the Korean currency I just hope and pray that we can get some movement in the currencies of these newly industrialized countries, particularly in the Far East, or I don't think we are going to see this big turnaround that we are counting on Thank you  That's somebody else's problem  No, they were for  -29-    9/23/86   Alternative B straight  Hasn't he been expecting that for three years, though?  Wasn't it back in May that we put in the asymmetrical language? And when those minutes were reported some people in the media were saying that we almost tightened and they made a big thing of that "
3236,1986-11-05,SEGER," Is it true that they were willing to cut their discount rate in August but the word got out so they were upset? There was a little article in today's paper to that effect  I second  Would you answer a couple of questions about the distribution of activity in 1987? Specifically, for producers durable equipment you have a rather significant pickup between the increase in first quarter of next year and the remaining portion of the year From your general comments I am trying to figure out why you would have it picking up that much  So you don't see a negative tax reform impact, then, beyond the first quarter?  I guess I am just more nervous about it, but I can't quantify my--  Also, on residential structures, you have quite a nice turnaround between the second and third quarters of next year and then additional strength in the fourth quarter, if I am reading this correctly  Is this an interest rate play or what?  Yes, I notice your housing starts are pretty level  A final question on the domestic auto sales Apparently you assume that the so-called ""give-back"" will all be accomplished in the fourth quarter of this year and then sales will be sort of flat and unexciting quarter by quarter in 1987  So, you are not assuming that GM has really been gambling on this approach and that without these incentive programs they will dramatically [cut back] their production schedules?  Thank you  Yes, but you had to get some work rule changes to improve the quality  As I've been thinking about this year and our different views as we've gone through the year, it seems to me that there has been some general paring of forecasts for real GNP, particularly for 1987 I still think, even with that, that there is some downside risk, particularly in the next 6 to 9 months or so I hope Mike Prell is right that the auto bulge is going to be straightened out this quarter, but maybe because I'm cynical about the auto industry and things can vary I just sense that they've borrowed more from the future and that it's going to take more time to make that up, unfortunately Also, I continue to be a worrywart about the consumer debt situation When I read the article about Sears and its experience with rising amounts of uncollectibles, and so forth, that didn't make me feel any better Also, in the multifamily housing area I heard a story--anecdotal but I think it may suggest that we have tremendous problems in apartment vacancies--that down in Bob Boykin's area they're giving free braces to people who are willing to sign two- year leases for apartments I guess that just shows that the dentists own the buildings!  Oh, you can get braces now up to age 60 I'd say the market is probably pretty big Anyhow, I think it does suggest that there's some urgency here to move people into these empty buildings Again, that didn't make me feel terribly good And that's without even considering the tax reform items I really think that the tax reform is going to hit the multifamily or the apartment area probably as hard as any sector of the economy It's sure going to knock off some of these limited partnerships that have been used to finance them And for offices the same is true there are lots of vacancies and it's very difficult to unload space I don't believe I've heard it mentioned at the table here but there's a real problem coming up with hotels because so many have been built It's not just in Washington, DC where all the lobbyists control them, but in many parts of the country there has been a lot of hotel construction and it's reaching the point where there is an excess of rooms and some real downward pressure on plans to put up additional hotels Finally, in relying heavily on the trade turnaround I certainly hope that it takes place I've heard some stories about additional orders for American exporters or soundings on the possibility of additional export business But I also continue to hear stories about how difficult it is to meet the import competition from the countries that we seem to ignore, countries like Canada and Korea and Hong Kong And it seems to me that if we're going to close this gap we've got to address both sides--not just expand our exports but put a damper on our imports I'm not talking about trade restrictions, believe me But I don't see a lot of evidence that the import surge is slowing down So I guess I'm just generally negative today  Getting to the plant closings if you look at the details I think you will find that they are not all assembly plants There is a foundry; there are parts plants, etc And the grim news is that as they close, they will be importing some of those items that GM now produces in Saginaw, Michigan, and so forth  Stampede "
3260,1986-12-15,SEGER," What about looking ahead on swap lines? One reads a lot about Brazil, Argentina, and the Philippines Do we anticipate being asked by them for swap lines?  Is there still quite a bit of activity in the foreign exchange markets around the year-end by multinational corporations? I remember that used to be the pattern  Did the other banks sign on yet for the Mexican credit? Or is that still a--  But the uncritical is still out there?  Could you just educate me on a rather basic point? It seems to me that when CRR was introduced--almost three years ago or whenever it was--that one of the points made at the time was that it would give the Fed the opportunity and the ability to better control reserves and the money supply And yet as I hear discussions on an ongoing basis it sounds as if we [still] have problems forecasting or estimating required reserves, etc So, did I get the message wrong almost three years ago or has something changed between then and the implementation of this?  I probably read some propaganda from somebody  Well, there are some people in banking who remember when [the reserve requirement] was contemporaneous the first time It has changed and changed again  I'll second it  Jim, could you supply me with some dollar numbers? It helps me to think of the real GNP change--to look at the total dollar change expected fourth quarter over fourth quarter and then to look at the specific contributors Mr Truman just said that net exports are expected to provide about a third If I am reading your numbers correctly, the fourth quarter over fourth quarter change in real GNP is expected to be about $102 billion On the right line, you say about a third of that would be supplied by an improvement in net exports Where do you--  Okay Looking at the $102 billion, where is it going to come from?  Okay, thank you  It is hard for some of us who are not mathematical whizzes to take the rates of change and to equate them to specific numbers  How is it handled statistically when these masses of people who are in middle management get pink slips and are given a severance package or are given psychological treatment for two months or something to help them adjust? Do they show up in the unemployment statistics immediately or do they have to wait to apply for--  I see  Okay We may be seeing some of that  Isn't DRI the major model that is also concerned about a recession?  Could you tell us more about the new model that you have that does a better job explaining the relationships?  Just because you added the additional experience  We ought to go back to targeting interest rates  Unfortunately, my view is the same as it was last July--which was that we should not publish an M1 target range because the aggregate was behaving so weirdly I felt that it would--and as a matter of fact it did--confuse the financial markets and market participants, regardless of how many qualifications we put out with it and despite our saying that we were not paying as much attention to it as we used to As long as it can be graphically presented every Friday by The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, people will pay attention to it Those footnotes don't get transmitted because newspapers don't transmit everything and the readers don't want all of that baggage They are looking for easy answers So I would go along with Governor Johnson's view that it's best not to establish a range for it now but to indicate that we are doing a thorough study of this and looking for some sort of narrow aggregate I would publish an M2 and M3 range  Will they let it in or will it have to sit on a boat for three years?  Perhaps the story that Si Keehn mentioned about the plant closings in the Midwest and the hit that certain states, including my own, are going to take made me feel a little less optimistic about both the current state of the national economy and also the outlook for next year I think that some of the apparent strength at the moment is related to tax reform and is primarily driven by businesses and some individuals trying to push their transactions into 1986 rather than do them in early 1987 Another portion arises from inventory building and, unfortunately, I think part of that is involuntary In fact, using our own staff estimates I believe that $25 billion out of the $40 billion or so increase in real GNP in the fourth quarter comes from the inventory swing So I'm just  -46-    12/15-16/86  wondering if maybe the first half of 1987 could be quite a bit weaker than we presently expect it to be  If you'll allow me, I'd like to give you some comments I got from a top automotive analyst yesterday about what's going on there I found them very interesting He thinks that somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 new car sales are being pushed into this year from next year for tax reasons, namely to get the sales tax deduction Some other unknown quantity of sales was generated this year by the tremendous interest rate incentives that we all know about Those too are likely borrowed from 1987 but the exact amount of the borrowing is not known The bottom line of his analysis is that total new car sales in 1987 will be about 75,000 below what they're running in 1986 and that import sales will be flat So the whole hit will come on the domestic side Also he made a big point--and he does not work for General Motors by the way--about the inventory situation at General Motors At the end of November GM dealers were already up to 85 days' supply of unsold new cars More importantly, if you look at some of the individual models, their stocks are running above 100 days' supply Earlier this year when GM had problems with excessive inventories their response was to launch another incentive program and try to ""buy"" sales, shall we say But that was a very expensive way to go in order to maintain production stability and their market share So the betting now is that when GM has this excessive inventory situation they are going to pare their production schedules I don't sense that we have enough of that paring in our numbers, particularly what will likely hit early next year Also, I'm not sure that we are taking enough out on the commercial building side I just have a gut reaction that office construction could be a lot weaker than we are presently estimating Salomon Brothers had an interesting presentation showing that over the past 12 months the new office construction put in place has been off about 14 percent and that the boom that has been running from 1979 to 1986 has raised the vacancy rate from 36 percent up to 24 percent in the suburbs and almost 17 percent in downtown markets Using their estimates and running with current demand levels, they think we'd have to get a 50 percent decline in new construction in order to bring back single-digit vacancy rates by the early 1990s I found that rather startling Finally, I really believe that the tax reform is going to take another bite out of business spending and that it possibly will be weaker--not just in the first half of the year but in the whole year--than we're presently expecting So, I just think that sometime we ought to ask ourselves if maybe we are running the risk of a recession sometime in early 1987 I'm not arguing that we are, but I think maybe we ought to consider that possibility  Well, based on my views of the economy, I should be voting for ""A,"" but in the spirit of Christmas I will go with--  I will go with ""B,"" but I would like asymmetric language allowing for some lesser reserve restraint should all heck break loose  How about ""about 7 percent""?  ""Fretted over""! How's that? "
3285,1987-02-10,SEGER," Export some credit cards to them and help them out  To be better consumers  I am saying we could export some of ours to them so they could use them    2/10-11/87  Where would the funds rate have gone if we hadn't--101 percent or something?  Doesn't it take pressure on reserves to move the fed funds rate as it has moved? I realize that there were unusual circumstances; nevertheless, there must have been some temporary reserve pressure to have pumped it up so I think you said the rate was 38 percent at one time; that doesn't sound like it was excessively easy  Yes, but maybe they needed $21 billion  What is happening to the administration of discount windows?  I see  No new personnel?  I am glad you said that because I told Don that I hear stories from bankers, too And he tells me faithfully that we haven't changed  Wayne Angell and I have been having a horse race in the last year to see who could be the most pessimistic And, believe it or not, looking at actual numbers for 1986, neither of us was low enough Wayne, do you realize that?  Well, having said that, I am in his camp again with a low number for real GNP growth--something on the order of 2 percent, which is below the staff's I have two main reasons for departing from the staff forecast One is that I continue to be concerned about the auto industry On the one hand, I watch the pricing behavior, as Governor Heller indicated; but also, I really think that the fundamentals of the auto sales picture are weaker than the dealer delivery figures may suggest There was a surge at the end of 1986, and I think much of that surge should be attributed to the tax changes that were going into effect January 1 We know that there was a substantial decline in January But, as someone pointed out to me, even that overstated the strength of true retail demand because  -24-    2/10-11/87  many fleet sales were processed in January And, of course, that's not a function of showroom traffic, and so forth; that is a deal that is struck between large purchasers and the corporations So, the fundamental demand for automobiles is probably even weaker than it looks Auto manufacturers are watching February numbers very, very carefully One person told me that they were in the process of revising down their production schedules as we spoke, which was this morning Anyway, I don't think that they are going to continue to wait for a miracle to occur that will somehow or other eliminate these high inventories, particularly in certain lines and certain makes, is the company with the worst inventory situation They have excessive--that's my word, not theirs--and extensive incentives out right now If they don't get the results they expect--and there is a great deal of concern that they won't-- then they will have to make really substantial production cuts I hope that isn't the case, but I am concerned that we may not have [forecast] enough weakness coming from that particular sector  The other area of my concern involves the trade turnaround I asked at the [Board staff] briefing on Monday where the additional exports in this country were going to go and what the products would be I also asked what imports were going to be curbed or curtailed, and I haven't gotten very good answers to those questions I just think it's going to be much more difficult to accomplish this The deterioration, I would remind people, went on for a number of years-- five or something like that And I think that there have been adjustments made in the economy to these changes and that they are not going to be easily reversed Although I would like to see a quick and substantial turn, my suspicious nature suggests that it won't take place So, I put those two differences together, and that's why I think that we are going to have a slower rate of growth  On the inflation side, I am just a touch more optimistic, perhaps, that we will be able to keep inflation under control Here I guess my main difference comes from what I view as a real change in business behavior--not in all business behavior but in the behavior of a number of significant businesses--in that they are finally addressing the efficiency question They are really trying to skinny down I just heard of one request by an organization that is working with its suppliers over a five-year time horizon and telling them that in order to be assured of business in this period ahead, they will have to agree to cut their prices, not increase them, by one percent per year over the next five years That's pretty hard bargaining And I think a lot of things like that are going on that have mainly resulted from the intense import competition I think it has been a [unintelligible] factor I certainly can't put an exact number on it; I don't pretend to know But I think that that kind of behavior is going to help us keep these inflation numbers looking better than they otherwise would  I don't see a big difference, frankly, between alternatives I, II, and III We're talking about 1/2 of a percentage point between each one When we discussed this last summer in July, one of the points I made when I opposed changing from the ranges we had for 1986 was that I didn't think we had the predictive tools to come up with these fine gradations of economic impact Six months  -31-    2/10-11/87  have gone by and I guess I'm still not convinced that we can readily say with great confidence that there's going to be a major difference in impact on the economy with ""I"" versus ""II"" So that leaves me with the psychological side I guess if you think that this is the kind of thing that will send a big message to the world out there that we're tough rather than weak on inflation--I happen to think they look at a lot of things and not just our ranges--I could reluctantly go with ""II"" But I still think a more honest presentation would be just dealing with round numbers, say, 6 to 9 percent  Remember a few months ago, though, we voted not to change policy but then when the minutes were released with asymmetrical language everybody jumped to the conclusion that we had So I think we have to be sensitive about what we say  How many weeks has it been, though, since the federal funds rate averaged below 6 percent?  That's when rates never moved anyway "

What if I recommend Kansas City, from the heartland--  And I will second  When you said that the Desk intervened when the dollar got to 187 marks, was your next comment sort of a suggestion that maybe we should [not] have done that?  At what point would you let the rising federal funds rate override your concern about a weakening dollar? If it got to 8 percent, would you--  I am not talking about a one-day shot    3/31/87  I was reacting to Peter Sternlight's comment that our own estimate showed a need to add reserves, but that apparently it wasn't done to the full extent because of the concern about what was going on I just wondered where those trade-offs come  SPEAKER(?) In relation to the borrowing target, generally over the intermeeting period you have at least [unintelligible]  So we don't have a contingency plan, then--that if all hell broke loose even more than it has so far--as to exactly what we would do when?  Maybe I misread it, but I thought that one of the major objectives was to use this playing tough to get the Japanese to knock down some of the barriers that are keeping our products out  What would happen if either Germany or Japan slipped into a recession? I am hearing about the weakening of their economies and their disappointments with their performance and the downward revisions [unintelligible] of their own governments  -15-    3/31/87  Do any of the exports go by ship or is it all air from Boston?  Does this include the steel towns that I read about?  Are you speculating in oil?  My own forecast is a little below the staff's forecast, at least in terms of the overall growth for the economy In going back to the time when the staff first presented its forecast for 1987, I have had this concern--which I have heard here at least seven times already today--about the ability of the trade picture to improve enough to make the contribution to our overall growth situation that we seem to have expected and we continue to expect Also, I must say that I am still not convinced, even with exchange rate adjustments and even with more American businessmen interested in exporting, that we in fact can do a lot more exporting--because of not necessarily having the kinds of products, or enough of the kinds of products, that are wanted in other parts of the world I have been lectured on this matter by some Germans over the last couple of weeks or months, so I hope they haven't unduly colored my view But I think there is some of that going on Also, I am not convinced that all the markets in the world are really open to our products; I think the events of the last few days have suggested that some other people have wondered, at least, whether the Japanese markets were open to our products So, that concerns me  On the domestic side my nagging concern continues to be the auto industry They already have very substantial supplies of new cars sitting in various dealer lots and showrooms There have been some cuts in production and there have been some downward revisions of production schedules But my woman's intuition suggests that maybe scheduling changes have not gone far enough and that we will see more of them Therefore, I hope that the staff's forecast does prove to be right because I do want a good healthy economy, and I like faster growth rates rather than slower growth rates But I really think we are putting a lot of our eggs in one or two baskets and I just hope we don't stub our toes  Is it possible to vote with a question? How much confidence do we have that getting interest rates still higher would, in fact, stop the decline of the dollar? I hear that come through in these comments and in the votes, but could someone just lay some probability numbers on the table for me?  Yes, and that is exactly my point I would hate to be chasing the dollar with higher interest rates and take down an economy that in my judgment is performing okay, but not terrifically Certainly, there's some unevenness about the performance The expansion is getting old by historical standards, and not knowing what that exact relationship is I just get a little nervous As Wayne keeps telling me, what odds do you play? Because I do find the uncertainties overwhelming, both currently and prospectively, I would vote for just staying put I would hate also to give the impression that just international considerations are driving what we do If you listen around the table, obviously, that's a major factor But when the directive is made public I would hate to give the impression that we've thrown everything else out  -39-    3/31/87  You'd have to pay along the way, too Right?

I'll move it  Jim, do you really think that the producers of durable equipment will snap back after only one quarter of weakness? Isn't the tax reform impact going to, unfortunately, last longer?  Thank you  The autos don't have [a] capacity [problem]?  I continue to be concerned about the sluggishness that I see in the economy I thought the industrial production figures for April showed widespread weakness Admittedly, it was concentrated in autos, but that certainly wasn't the whole story Even the March figures showed some weakness beyond autos I discussed this with Jim Kichline and I am wondering if we have enough weakness built into our figure for 1987 for the auto industry because, in my judgment, we haven't yet seen the impact of the recent runup in interest rates on most of these indicators since so much of it took place in April and so far in May So, I am concerned that the forecast may be a bit high there  Because I am interested in autos--and from the comments around the table some others may be too--I will share a couple of observations that I got from  They are basically very disappointed in the auto sales figures in April and, particularly, in early May At General Motors, they are using incentives selectively; generally, they have a combination of the rebates to consumers, the special deals on interest rates, and also some rebates that they are giving directly to the dealers themselves For example, Cadillac will pay between $1000 and $2000 per car for every one that the dealer moves of certain slow-moving models That's tremendous Also, imports for the first time are not selling very well The Japanese are not selling up to their quota, even with the incentives that they are offering, lost money in January and February; that's not a terribly good sign Inventories, of course, are extremely heavy The comment was that they have no more asphalt to put the cars on and now they are going to corn fields and wheat fields Also, it was pointed out to me that the statistics that have been reported so far this year may, in fact, overstate the strength of the true retail demand because the fleet sales were concentrated in the first couple months of the year and they have been running 25 to 30 percent of the deliveries so far Fleet sales do go through dealers and, therefore, are picked up in these numbers that we follow  A couple of comments again, they are very disappointed with the pace of auto sales, particularly in April and early May They point out that trucks also were showing some weakness They think forty thousand more units will be removed from production schedules over the next three months because of the continued oversupply of new cars They don't have the same attitude about dealing with their retailers as what to produce and then dumps them on the dealers, takes into account more what the dealers would like to receive Also, is using a negative real GNP growth figure for this quarter, about minus 1-1/2 percent seasonally adjusted at an annual rate, mainly because there is no inventory buildup They expect auto sales of 10 million units for 1987 versus 114 million last year If they are right, of course, that's around 400,000 less, I believe, than what we  -17-    5/19/87  are using But again, these are numbers that are  being reviewed because of the recent uptick in interest rates Across the board, there is a massive effort to hike sales because there are great economies to keeping the production lines running Therefore, where it used to be that auto production was cyclical, now the production is more stabilized and profits are cyclical A final point is--and this isn't a very good sign as I read it--that more and more people are taking the rebates, when offered, because they need it for the down payment In other words, they are that marginally in the market They are also going for the longer-term contracts in order to get a monthly payment that will fit into their budgets So, those observations made me even more concerned about the fundamental strength of the economy  In terms of what's happening on the inflation front, I think in a way maybe we ourselves are contributing to it because we talk so much about it I think it's wrong to read every wriggle in the bond market as a sign of inflation or inflation psychology Having worked with investments for 10 years, I can tell you a lot of people who trade bonds don't have anything in mind; they are just throwing pieces of paper around To attribute great analysis to the move, I think, can really be a mistake  What is happening in the money markets this morning?  I am in favor of no tightening I am not sure which alternative that is, the way these things drift As I said earlier, the real economy is very sluggish Furthermore, I don't see any sign of real life in any sector; certainly, I don't see any sector overheating at the moment As Manley said, we've already tightened What I think we have is something that is beyond alternative C last time; I believe that the majority voted for maintaining, which was alternative B Also, we have not seen in the real economy yet the effects of the tightening that we already did The world economy is sluggish, and even the staff has revised its projections of the growth in industrialized countries The important danger, I think, is that we will tighten monetary policy and the foreign countries are not going to offset with some easing on their side Also, the monetary aggregates have slowed and are expected to be weak I think a recession would be a disaster It would certainly not make our budget deficit any better It would hurt the lesser developed countries; it would make their debt burdens a lot heavier It would not help the financial system, particularly the savings and loans that are already sort of shaky And, finally, I don't think inflationary pressures can exist very long in an environment with excess capacity and commodity gluts worldwide I would like to vote for ""B"" but not a ""B"" that would drift  What are the odds for getting an increase in the discount rate and borrowing--not the borrowing target, but actual borrowing--around $800 million? Could you conceive of that?  -39-    5/19/87 "
3369,1987-07-07,SEGER," I'll move it  I have one When you refer to market sentiment, since there are obviously many hundreds or thousands of participants in the foreign exchange markets on any given day, are you talking primarily about traders that are commercial bankers in this country, or commercial bankers from abroad, or corporate treasurers, or central bankers, or all of the above? I'm just sitting here trying to get a flavor of what are you basing your sentiment comments on  Right  Yes    7/7/87  Right I sensed that last time  Isn't it true that they are more important players on the scene now than they used to be 5 or 10 years ago?  Second  Second  What do the relationships look like if you don't wash out the variations within a maintenance period? It seems to me that by averaging that you would knock off quite a bit of the variation before you do your statistical study  I have one question for Ted Truman and one for Mike Prell For Ted How is the rundown you gave of the growth forecast for these various major economies consistent with our expectation of a substantial pickup in exports? I keep thinking our exports have to go someplace and England isn't going to buy them all  Well, do you think that there is enough zip or that it's not so soggy that it will sabotage our interests--  But we were badgering Germany and Japan, I thought, to stimulate their economies so that there would be--  Okay, but it still makes me nervous  For Mike In reading the Greenbook and other materials that were distributed prior to the meeting, there's sort of an underlying tone of an economy that's about to go into orbit It's not stated that way, and maybe I just read it wrong, but the forecast suggests that private demand suddenly is going to explode and that there's going to be this inflationary surge I went through all the individual numbers and thought it through in my own mind, looking at the different sectors and so forth, and I must say that I can't find one that is about to go off in a bit of robustness  Could you just run the numbers by us instead of just saying appreciable? I don't know what that means  -23-    7/7/87  How about home mortgages?  I'll be brief I favor maintaining the ranges of alternative I  Well, just to take advantage of the full range of alternatives, I will vote for alternative I, primarily because the staff's beautiful forecast failed to convince me that the economy is as strong as we would like to see it and as they suggested it is I am also less confident about the outlook for the economy I would like, of course, to see the strong trade turnaround, and I hope it takes place; but I am not really convinced that it will to the extent that they are assuming So I would prefer to go with 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent again, with the understanding that we have another crack at this early next year If I am wrong and the economy is roaring along, then certainly it can be adjusted and I don't think anything will have been lost We'll have plenty of time to send signals to the markets, in my judgment  It was 7 percent for the year? Is that what you said?  Can we have a different tilt?  -54-    7/7/87  I'm not sure it would fit  We've always said that "
3395,1987-08-18,SEGER," And I'd like to second  I'll move that  I second that  I guess I just want you to play a ""what if"" game with me With respect to oil prices--I'm not an expert on foreign affairs or any kind of affairs--but the disruption in the Persian Gulf, I think, definitely has had an impact on oil prices, as you mentioned earlier But what if they sweep the mines away and the tensions are relieved Then, if we were to see oil prices coming down, let's say, to $15 or $16 per barrel--that's not my estimate, just assume that would happen--what would that kind of change in this one factor do to your overall forecast? It just seemed to me, as I read through this material a number of times, that the high oil prices, and rising oil prices, were driving many of our concerns on the forecast over the rest of this year and into next year  I think there's no honor among thieves As those prices rise, I think those people are going to be more and more tempted to cheat, and they will continue to cheat They're cheating now in that they're exceeding their own quotas--ones that they set among themselves I guess I'm not prepared to think that they'll get religion real quickly  That's not my forecast  Wouldn't that also help our trade balance? Again, it seems to me that the higher price of oil that we are importing has been a negative I would assume that that would cut current dollar imports, anyway, if nothing else changed  I hope that the staff forecast is right on target, but I do have some questions and some doubts, I guess One of them that I expressed yesterday at the staff briefing [to the Board] involves our emphasis on the trade turnaround I'm just not convinced that we will get as much of a boost to the overall economic picture from the trade turnaround as we are counting on in the forecast either for the rest of this year or in 1988 It was mentioned earlier that some of the trading partners have economic situations that are far short of robust So I think that's a key factor Also, no one has mentioned it, but there are trade barriers out there that business people tell me about And some of the obvious ones involve trying to get into the Japanese market Also, I'm not convinced that the dollar is going to fall as much as we're assuming in our forecast I realize it can be banged down but, as Governor Johnson said, there are things going on that may prevent that from happening Also, the staff is talking about some gradual upward drift in interest rates That may  -18-    8/18/87  happen, depending, of course, on what policy stance we take But I guess I don't see as much of a bite on the economy from that upward drift as I might have expected Looking at autos--and this would be more of a near-term situation than for '88--I think it's going to be a lot tougher to reduce those inventories than apparently you think, Mike Some of the specific makes have over a 100-day supply; that's not worked down easily even at 19 percent interest rates One of the reasons they have so many is they haven't a lot of sex appeal in the models; they may have to just give them away on some Saturday night, I don't know Anyhow, I think it's a lot greater challenge than --  That's right I don't like it myself My final comment involves inflation, and here Governor Angell made my point about commodity prices I don't think it's guaranteed that these are going to just keep rising We all know that commodity prices are very volatile and influenced by many, many things above and beyond monetary policy And I believe, as he said, that there are factors at work that may, as a matter of fact, keep those under control Particularly when I think about the crude oil situation, I'm not certain that we're going to get what's in the staff forecast On the labor market shortage, I just don't think there is a labor market; I think there are all sorts of labor markets--for different skills, for different industries, and for different geographic areas So I don't know that it makes any sense even to talk about a natural rate of unemployment because I just don't know how to use it as a guide Finally, one of the things that I really don't think we're emphasizing enough is the real change in managerial attitudes I see more backbone among corporate executives in their labor negotiations than I've seen in my whole working career, which goes back a long time And I'm really delighted to see that they no longer assume that they can just pass through these higher labor costs--which they used to do, particularly in the major industries Also, the company heads are more and more aware of import competition, more and more aware of the need to be efficient and to get even more efficient They're pushing the employees for moves that would enhance productivity This is going on all the time in the auto negotiations The emphasis is on job security; there is even talk of freezes on actual wages To the extent that there are pay adjustments, in a number of major companies they are making sure that the productivity gains do offset them because the 11 percent--or whatever the overall national number is-- is not what the productivity gains are in specific companies And so, I think, they are tending more and more to tie their own wage settlements to their own productivity enhancement moves And I think that's all to the good I put all that together and I don't see zero inflation, but I don't see 4-1/2 percent heading towards 14 percent either Thank you  I'm in favor of no change, which is alternative B, $500 million borrowing target, for three main reasons One is, as I think Governor Angell emphasized, the uncertainties that we are facing Another reason is that there aren't that many weeks between this meeting and the next FOMC meeting; we have another chance, very    8/18/87  soon, to look at things and change our approach, based on additional readings of the economy The third reason is that I just don't see that the economy is currently boiling The forecast certainly does look pretty good; but, again, I question whether or not we're going to see the hit from the trade turnaround in the way that many are expecting So, for those reasons, I would like to propose keeping reserve pressures as they are And, in the statement, I would deemphasize the impact of the dollar on what we are doing Also, I don't want to tilt the directive "
3421,1987-09-22,SEGER," May I ask just one question?  How much actual trading is going on in the foreign exchange market for what I would call corporate business use? In other words, not just trading for the sake of trading but for--  I remember before when there was all this turbulence, a lot of corporate traders did just sort of sit it out and hold off on decisions  That isn't what I would suggest at all I am just trying to sense what the attitudes in corporate America might be No, I don't think--    9/22/87  Second  Peter, did I understand you correctly when the question was asked about the market response to what might happen to borrowings before this maintenance period is up? Did you say you thought we could come in around $600 million without stirring things up? Isn't the arithmetic to get $600 million in this period such that it would require tremendous borrowings today and tomorrow? And if those borrowings occur in the context of the knowledge of this meeting date, I think [market participants] might make something out of that rather than just saying, well, it is one way to get the average to work out right I don't think they know what we are shooting for  Yes, but if there is all this nervousness in general, and if you average, let's say, $625 or $650 million, with $2 billion of borrowing on Wednesday--which happens to be the day after we meet here--there must be weirdos, anyway, who will think maybe there is a connection Maybe in New York they may figure all this out, but there are a few other market participants outside New York who might make something out of that whole sequence  Yes, I just have a couple of questions that are tied to a few matters that we discussed yesterday at pre-FOMC briefings These involve whether or not we have completely factored in the rise in interest rates that we have already seen, plus wholly factored in the increases that we think are yet to come In particular, on housing starts, which as of last month were at a 16 million annual rate, we know that there are problems with high vacancy rates in the multifamily area, at least in some parts of the country The incentives built into that kind of housing have been shifted greatly by the Tax Reform Act As for single family starts, at least some people say they are sensitive to interest rate changes I guess I have a hard time believing that for 1988 starts will not fall below 1-1/2 million I hope they don't, but I am sort of skittish about this  Is that true for both the single family and the multifamily?  What if it just means that the lags are longer? Maybe we haven't even seen the full impact of the spike we had back in April or May, which was quite dramatic  The other question I have again ties into yesterday's briefing, and relates to our heavy reliance on the trade turnaround to produce a good 1988 If I'm reading the numbers right, about half of the real GNP growth, fourth quarter of 1987 to fourth quarter of 1988, is expected to come from improvement in net exports Again, I think it's very, very difficult to get a $54 billion increase in exports in one year--namely, this year--and then tack on $57 billion next year That's just a lot to produce  In a prior life, I worked with corporate planning, so I was just sitting here thinking of that in our discussion this morning First of all, when you work with corporate planning, your bosses are always challenging your forecasts and they will not allow--at least mine didn't allow--you to utilize a single forecast Or, if you did, they were always wondering about where the weaknesses were and whether or not something might hit them that would put them out of business You are not allowed to bet the bank, or bet the company, on forecasts So, I just wanted to mention a couple of things that I think we have to look at as we look ahead One that I sort of hinted at it earlier is whether or not we are sufficiently incorporating the interest moves we have already had into this forecast And if we are, are we incorporating the interest moves that we expect are yet to come? Also, there's the question what if the dollar does not, in fact, decline more? So much of 1988 depends upon the trade turnaround; and if we think a weaker dollar is needed to produce at least part of that, then I think that is a vulnerability in this forecast Also, and this has been mentioned by Wayne Angell and Bob Heller, I really think we are not paying much attention to the change in fiscal policy When you go from a $221 billion deficit to $160 billion--and I've heard this morning that it might even come in below $150 billion--that's a major change from one year to the next I am not necessarily a Keynesian, but I do think there is such a thing as fiscal policy, and it certainly works with a lag I remember the summer of 1984, sitting around this table with many of the people who are here today, and it was very easy then to simply project the trends of early 1984, which looked tremendously strong And, frankly, we missed the fact that business was going to slow down; just about the time we thought it was looking most terrific was when we got the 90- degree turn I hope we are not doing that today  On the interest rate question, because I am an old lady I remember being in financial markets before inflation was a big deal, mainly in the 1960s And interest rates moved up; one of the reasons that long governments moved up involved simply the volume of financing, which is, of course, tied to the deficit And, as Bob Heller said, recently we have had these problems with bumping up against the debt ceiling and postponements of auctions Then, all of a sudden, Congress gets religion and takes care of this, and you get five auctions pushed through in a very short period of time, and this jerks things around And yet, if no one was talking about inflation, I think that would happen It certainly happened in August It's probably going to happen again in the next couple of weeks Also, there is just uncertainty about what's going on, uncertainty about what we are doing here I think we could help that problem if we released the minutes earlier so that people would not have to analyze every tea leaf to try to figure out what we're up to I think that  -31-    9/22/87  contributes to this situation Also, there has been improvement in communications and information flow If you go back to the 1960s and 1970s, not every person around America and around the world had a CRT on his or her desk Now every gunslinger sits there and, whereas they used to be told that the one thing to watch was M1, now they have been told that the one thing to watch is the relationship between the dollar and the yen or the dollar and the mark in the foreign exchange markets Most of these people are not economists; they are traders; and you give them two easy pieces of guidance and that is what they trade on So they contribute to this instability, I think, as you get this transmission from the exchange market into the bond market with the speed of light almost There are just a lot more players and I don't think they are necessarily really weighing what's going on in the real economy; and neither do I think that they are doing a thorough analysis of the inflationary forces at work or not at work  I am in favor of no change in the reserve pressure, which I guess is not really a stated option; I am somewhat between ""A"" and ""B"", $500 million borrowing target, and I would prefer symmetrical language  When the minutes come out do you think a lot would be made of the fact that the fed funds range has been moved? I can just see someone looking at that and saying ""Well, clear the decks for the next big tightening of the screws; batten down the hatches""  SPEAKER(?) Well, we really didn't  I know, but people pick at everything that goes down here; and I can just see a big deal being made of this move  So there will be an explanation? "
3454,1987-11-03,SEGER," I just have two questions in areas that I need to be educated on First, when you were talking about our policy of lending securities, did I hear you say that we had not been willing to lend for a short sale? Maybe I just didn't hear you  How do we know? Do you ask them in advance what they are going to do with the proceeds?  I see My second question When we have been so-called ""accommodative"" in the last couple of weeks, why have we done all these transactions with repos? I realize a million dollars worth of repos has the same reserve impact as a million dollars of direct purchases of T-bills, but I think the market perception of what we are doing is different in the one versus the other I guess I just don't understand why we have done it [that way]  Thank you  I just wanted to tell Mike that I admire his courage for attempting to put specific numbers down on a sheet of paper because, although I'm older than most of the people sitting at this table, I can't think of a time in my lifetime when we have had comparable events in the financial markets So I'm not sure I know how your econometric models can pick anything up when the data fed in are like what we have just been through in the last couple of weeks  One thing that concerns me, as I said before-- whether you formalize it or don't formalize it mathematically--is that not having experienced this kind of period, I just suffer from uncertainty about what it will bring Also, I wonder if a 20 some percent decline in the Dow on one day is really the equivalent of four months' worth of 5 percent declines each month I have a feeling that it's not comparable I don't know, but I have a feeling that there are a lot of things in here that, at least based on my inexperience, I cannot really judge  -15-    11/3/87  That's because they were giving things away that day  The two words that I think describe most completely what is going on are confusion and uncertainty All of the business economists and business people I have spoken with in the last couple of weeks admit to both of those Practically no one pretends to know exactly what the impact of the financial market disturbances will be, but almost everyone expects some sort of an impact Probably the most dramatic adjustment that I witnessed was at  where, unfortunately, the event caught them in the middle of the planning season for 1988 They immediately knocked 5 percent off their sales forecast up through the next year and also looked for  -25-    11/3/87  two plants to close--a truck plant and a car plant Their view was that back in the early 1980s, when the auto industry was going into the pink, they said they were cutting off a finger at a time rather than doing major surgery So, this time around they want to be prepared for more dramatic and significant adjustments if, in fact, they are needed They are watching very carefully what is actually going on so that they can do additional adjustments if necessary They also have made some dramatic changes in the management of their pension funds, which are very, very large They have cut back on the percentage invested in equities They also have cut back on the percentage in long bonds and have moved into a very liquid position I just mention that because I think it is one specific example that some people in the business world are reacting  Not knowing what is going to happen, I guess one of my nightmares is that what might happen is that consumers will cut back on their spending, as Mike has laid out in the Greenbook estimates, except that they will cut back a little more dramatically even than we are estimating in the next couple of quarters The rich lawyers will continue to buy Mercedes and Peugeots and Hondas and things like that that are produced abroad but they will cut back on their consumption of domestically produced items and, therefore, we will get sort of a double whammy we will have the weak consumption but, also, we will not see the import situation improving as much as we are expecting now, and as much as I certainly would like to see Yet, I am not saying we are going to get a recession; I don't really know But I think we ought to think about what the risk is, and ask If we do get a recession, is that going to help the problems that Jerry Corrigan has ticked off? I don't think so Going into a recession with a heavy debt load doesn't usually make the debt load any lighter; it just makes it look a lot heavier to service Also, I don't think that a recession here would help our trading partners As I read the growth numbers in Germany, Japan, Canada, and some other countries, it seems to me that they are not all that robust anyway They do depend a lot upon their business dealings with us and, therefore, I can't imagine that we wouldn't take many of them with us, which in turn, would make our new-found ability to export a lot more difficult to take advantage of because you have to have somebody to buy those exports that we now can produce efficiently So, to summarize, I just am concerned And I really think that we ought to watch the incoming data extremely carefully for signs of more weakness than we are now expecting  You think the markets know what that means?  Okay  I guess I can go with ""B"" but as I reread the Bluebook here for the seventh time, it looks to me as if Don Kohn was saying that all of these alternatives--""A"", ""B"", and ""C""--assume financial markets will return to conditions of normalcy, whatever that is  And down deep in my stomach I'm just asking myself What if, in fact, we don't? Which alternative should I vote for? Should I vote for ""A"" now because that possibly would allow us the greater opportunity to deal with abnormal times or do I go with ""B"" and assume that if the roof falls in we will at that point make a policy shift?  Then you go to ""E"" and ""F"" or something like that So having said that, I would go with ""B"", the Corrigan language, and the asymmetric language tilted toward ease And on targeting the fed funds rate, frankly, I would rather see it a little on the soft side of 6-3/4 percent rather than between 6-3/4 and 7 percent, because I think the fed funds rate is viewed as out of line now with other short-term rates If we are really interested in communicating clearly what market participants--  I would put a range in the statement, but I'm saying as an operating matter that I'd rather see us go to the low side of 6-3/4 percent rather than going 6-3/4 to 7 percent I would rather see us really targeting somewhere between 6-1/2 and 6-3/4 percent because I think that the funds rate is quite a bit out of line with other short-term rates  Since then it has changed  So we have to make this asymmetrical right?  I thought it was lesser reserve restraint would and slightly greater might Isn't that what we-- "
3478,1987-12-15,SEGER," I'd like to think of this in two stages One is what I think is useful in normal or typical times, if there are such things In those times, I'm perfectly willing to support an approach that emphasizes a borrowings target, even though I have learned that because we don't have nice stable relationships, we cannot predict exactly what a certain level of borrowings will produce in the way of fed funds rates But there are times when conditions are more unusual and abnormal, and I personally believe we are still in one of those modes at the moment And in times like these, I think that we ought to pay a lot more attention to fed funds because the markets are very, very nervous and skittish--not as much as they were October 20th through October 26th or 28th or whatever, but I don't think it's back to normal I would hate to see us give the message inadvertently that we were tightening or engineering a major policy change because fed funds rates shot up at the end of the year when we really didn't want to give that message I don't think that everybody out there in the real economy and in the markets is that comfortable with what's going    12/15-16/87  on Therefore, I would just urge us in the next few weeks to be triply sensitive, even though in two months or so we may go back to what we were doing prior to October 19th, emphasizing the borrowing targets But I personally wouldn't feel comfortable with going back to business as usual starting tomorrow  What if it comes in at 9-1/8 percent?  Yes, but having something like that in the context of having had flat reserves since April, a declining M1 in  -14-    12/15-16/87  December, and missing our M2 targets-- I think you have to look at it as the whole ball and not just--  Yes  What was the decision on the first?  I just wanted to make sure I understood what we decided  Okay  I just have one question as I sit here listening to comments about why bankers borrow on a seasonal basis Do we not administer the discount window in regard to requests for seasonal borrowing in the same hardnosed manner that we do for adjustment borrowing?  Maybe we should That's the answer to make sure that their--  -19-    12/15-16/87  I'm surprised  See, I told you Wayne, it's too dirty!  No, I just had a question  I just wanted to ask Don what would happen if all of a sudden Congress saw the light and allowed interest to be paid on demand deposits Individuals can go into NOW accounts and, in effect, receive interest on checkable accounts, but corporations or businesses can't It seems to me that part of the problem is having these two groups treated in a different way  Secondly, didn't you say--I read so much for this meeting I may have just dreamed it--that within the demand deposit category most of that is, in fact, business accounts? If that's the case, then I think the interpretation ought to be different, because I've never met a big business or small business that decides to buy a new dump truck or put an addition on a building because they have more money in their checking account I just don't think they operate that way Maybe I would as an individual, or my cousin would, but I think we have to look at how we interpret these things because of the change in the ownership of the accounts  I have one comment and one question In the last ten days, I've been at two different embassies for dinners and the dinner table talk among business people involved how they thought the dollar had actually become undervalued vis-a-vis European currencies Now, they were not talking [unintelligible], which I thought was interesting, because it wasn't a central banking group; it was a mixture of business people and embassy personnel My second point is a question You mentioned the Taiwan case and their gigantic trade surplus, etc I'm mystified as to the process of getting some of those devils to adjust their currencies What does it take? Does the Treasury have to lock them in a room? Does it take legislation or does it take negotiation of some sort? I honestly don't know the process  But, it has been pretty pathetic, when you compare it to--  What has Hong Kong's movement been then?  I still think that the trade statistics suggest that something has to be done about those currencies if we really are going to improve the situation with regard to imports without building walls  I can send them some alley toughs from Detroit  I was quite influenced by an article I read in this morning's Wall Street Journal about Marshall Fields, where Si Keehn lives, in the suburbs of Chicago He has to get out and do more shopping! Anyhow, it made me think about the retail sales report and your comment that the numbers were revised downward in September and October and showed only a modest gain in November You said this is causing some downward revision in your real GNP estimate for just this quarter You're not thinking of this as something that will spill over into the new year also? I wasn't sure I heard the--  That leads me to my next question If that's happening--if there are inventories building up that are not planned-- in the past that has often led to some sort of liquidation Maybe it is just because I've been around for a long time, but that's typically what happens at the retail level, wholesale level, etc So, at what point might that kick in?  My final question involves the trade statistics I guess the numbers were disappointing on both sides, but the exports ran quite a bit below what we had expected Again, at what point would you think that this might mean more serious trouble and not just a one-month blip on the screen? We have a lot of eggs in the one    12/15-16/87  basket next year--mainly an assumption of a strong trade turnaround-- in order to get the kind of real growth that we have for 1988, as I read the forecast anyway  It's just that I'm a cautious person, and when you put a lot of eggs in one basket I think you really have to make sure you check the assumption very, very carefully  Was $40 billion what we estimated?  I know we expected a big turnaround; I couldn't remember the exact number  What is well above?  Is that for one month?  I have just a couple of comments A few weeks ago I met with the chief financial officers of about 125 Fortune 500 companies One of the things that I asked them about was their reaction to October 19, both individually and corporate-wise Basically, they were sort of frozen in place They hadn't dealt with that kind of situation before so they hadn't recommended dramatic changes in plans to their CEOs nor had they changed their profit plans Most of them were right in the middle of the profit-planning season for 1988 Because most of them hadn't been through this  -62-    12/15-16/87  experience before--and, unlike us, they didn't have models that would predict the impact when there hadn't been a similar event--they were playing it by ear, I would say, and trying to get readings on what the sales of their companies were doing, and so forth They were going to continue to look at them and there might be changes forthcoming; but, at that point, they were simply not sure They said the biggest impact was on the bonuses and the value of the stock options As one fellow said, one of the biggest shocks was having to get his CEO out of a board meeting and tell him that their stock had stopped trading on the New York Stock Exchange That shook things up quite dramatically The one company that really has reacted to this, though--and I think I mentioned this before--is They have done such things as cut back on a major plant modernization job; pushed the completion date into the future for an addition that was going on at a similar plant and delayed a new tech center they were going to be building out in Also, they continue to fiddle with their pension plans, building more liquidity, raising cash, and cutting back on holdings of stock and also of long bonds In addition, they continue to fiddle with their production schedules As you know, Ward's announced that the auto industry as a whole was planning for production for the first quarter of about 14 percent below the first quarter of this year; but is making plans that are more pessimistic than that Also, I was told by them that some of the other auto companies probably would be cutting their first-quarter plans more deeply and that, therefore, the Ward's number would probably turn out to be a little overly optimistic Also, the inventory situation in autos is really, really severe As of November 30th, the days' supply was 86 days as compared with 73 days a year ago At the end of December, they think it will be 98 days That certainly is consistent with the idea of cutting production because these incentives that they have tried to use for the last year and a half have less and less ""oomph"" every time they drag them out And so, they just have to do something else The final point is that there is great concern about the deterioration in consumer confidence, looking both at the University of Michigan survey and also the Conference Board's One of the points made to me was that averaging the results of these two surveys, the latest number showed the lowest reading in this recovery after registering the highest level for this recovery in September So, they are concerned about what that will do to future consumer purchases of their products If you want a group that isn't rolling in the aisles with optimism, I would recommend that you talk to some of these people  [Unintelligible]  May I just ask one question about what Don said these new numbers were for the aggregates in December? I didn't hear what--  I heard him say revised down, but I didn't hear--  Yes  Thank you  Thinking back to the market reactions early in December when the fed funds rate passed 7 percent going north, I'm convinced that market participants are very sensitive to what happens to the fed funds rate on particular days So, I would prefer, short- term anyway, to stick with option (1) which really watches the funds rate very carefully If there's a decision to tighten that's one thing; but if there isn't, then I think the message that comes from a fed funds rate hitting 7 percent or higher is one of tightness and I'd be now very cautious about that Eventually, I certainly would be willing to go (3) or even (4), but I don't think that now is the time to do it And it may not even be the time to do it until we get to the February meeting In terms of the choices facing us here, I guess I'm going to be a nonconformist and go with ""A"", which gives us a slight easing I certainly hope that the exports stay very strong but I just feel that there is some risk there Also, I remember how difficult it has been in the past to read consumption events and consumer behavior It seems to me it was back in 1980, when I wasn't here but some of you may have been, when the credit controls were put on in March of 1980 because consumer demand was so terribly strong Of course, later on we learned that we were already in a recession And I think back in 1974 a similar thing happened when we handed out ""WIN"" buttons and that encouraged people to slice up their credit cards and so forth only to find again that we were already in the recession So, I am really concerned about misreading the retail sales reports We're all hearing different stories--some of strength, others of weakness And consumption is a big chunk of GNP, as we all know; so I think there is some risk here I also feel that maybe there's more of an inventory problem out there than we have yet identified And I'm impressed with the fact that the inflation numbers look far better than any of us thought they would if we go back to our discussions in the spring or even in the summer I think inflation psychology has simmered down The Dick Hoey survey, which I  -76-    12/15-16/87  didn't believe then and probably shouldn't now, nevertheless, for those who follow it, does show some cut in the inflationary expectations going forward So, I think that's good I'm not a monetarist but I am paying close attention to what's happening to the reserves and the monetary aggregates; and I think that is something to be slightly concerned about Having said all that, I would like to go with the modest easing identified as alternative ""A""  Well, because of the sloppiness of the relationships, I'm not sure what that would be I guess I would just concentrate on a fed funds rate of somewhere between 6-1/2 and 6-3/4 percent  But is that really what's going on? We put this broad range in there and it sounds--  Oh, I know that For 3-1/2 years I've--  I was just wondering whether there couldn't be some way to suggest that there might be situations where consultations would be helpful even if the fed funds rate were in the range  What if it does come to that?  Are you talking about a discount rate hike? I'm a little confused  I thought you meant monetary policy  I second it "
3491,1988-01-05,SEGER," I'm not convinced that we've progressed that much toward normality, myself That's just my gut reaction "
3515,1988-02-09,SEGER," It's the Employment Act of '46  Well, ever since your briefing yesterday, Mike, I've been trying to figure out why I can't understand your point that when the fourth-quarter GNP numbers came out--which showed weaker consumption spending and greater inventory accumulation than I believe you had forecast--how now that we have those numbers, you can have an upward revision in the forecast for the first half of the year I must say that the arithmetic still flies right by me So, maybe you can try once again to convince me of it; I'm sure it's my density today that's doing it  A second question--maybe this is for Mr Truman-- involves the assumption about the dollar What is it likely to do this year? And if that agreement that I thought we struck with the other major nations called for drawing a halt to the dollar's decline, am I supposed to take seriously the forecast of a 10 percent decline in the weighted-average value of the dollar this year, followed by [a decline of] 8 percent next year? I just am not sure how to match that with what I thought the basic objectives were  Ten from the fourth quarter?  I like the idea of alternative scenarios, but looking at these got me thinking about whether or not our assumption was flying in the face of that deal I have a final question on the estimate for real GNP in the other G-10 countries running below our forecasted real GNP growth in each year--1988 and 1989 That makes me wonder about our export boom, and whether or not that, in fact, can materialize to the extent we are talking about  Well, at one time, you remember, we were lecturing the other countries to speed their economies so that it would help us peddle more of our goods overseas  We'd better go to Dale Carnegie Okay, thank you  That's pretty big  I guess my main difference with the staff forecast involves the inventory situation Because I am more pessimistic about whether or not the current levels are considered excessive or right on, that makes me have a different point of view about what's going to happen to them I think that there's going to  -20-    2/9-10/88  be a lot more worked off in the first quarter, and also some in the second quarter, so I have a significantly weaker first half In fact, my personal view is that we are going to have a down quarter in this present period Therefore, because I have a lot slower first half, I also have been the proud possessor of the low end of the range [of the members' forecasts] for the whole year, but this isn't my only difference I also think that housing is going to be somewhat weaker in the first half Also some kinds of construction such as office buildings and shopping centers, those sorts of things, I think are going to be weaker than maybe is implied by the forecast I think that we have to be paying careful attention to this Whether or not we will see what's coming in time to adjust, I think, is certainly an open question  In connection with an earlier comment about why these businesses aren't expanding their capacity, I had two interesting conversations this week One was with the chairman of the board of a large chemical company and one was with the chairman of the board of a large paper company down In each case, the main point they made about lack of willingness to commit to a major new project is that there is all this uncertainty about what's going to happen about public policy They think people down here operate like whirling dervishes--you know, they can't keep policy stabilized for very long It's impossible for them to plan They have questions about what's going to happen to fiscal policy You get a cut for a couple of years; then you get tax reform--they're still trying to figure out what it really means Based on how they read the deficit numbers, they are assuming that we will probably get a tax hike; and because corporate America is not very popular, they think they will get a big part of that bill passed on to them It's just very, very difficult for them to plan They also have concerns about where interest rates are going They're not talking about whether they're too high or too low, but just about the volatility; and it makes it tough for them to do the arithmetic  And finally, in looking at the foreign exchange markets, here again the volatility makes life tough for them They are not assuming that the dollar is going to stay where it is over the next few years A number of them were really burned in the late '70s and the early '80s, when they had expanded dramatically based on assumptions of strong future growth And then just as the plants were coming on stream, the growth evaporated So they were badly injured and, at least according to my sources, they don't want to get into that predicament again That doesn't suggest that they're not doing certain kinds of capital spending, because they are; it's much more targeted to specific kinds of products and toward specific production problems, with a big emphasis on getting productivity improvements, rather than--I think the term is [unintelligible] expansion So, for what it's worth, I thought I would pass that along Thank you  Did they call the last one?  [Unintelligible]  I just have one  In regard to the width of the band, if there is all this uncertainty, the honest way to present that--if I remember from Stat 101--is to have the band of uncertainty identified And if we really think we cannot target within these 3 percentage point ranges, I think it would be more honest to bump the range out a point than to be below the bottom or exceed the top, because then you could explain it as indicative of the uncertainty rather than some sort of policy message  Well, starting with 1984, it seems to me that people either have been suffering from an undershoot--or rather, two years of overshoot followed by last year's undershoot Now, that's not going back to the '70s; but certainly, given recent history, it occurs to me that maybe you would get less trouble with the financial market participants if we put this up front  Last July I dissented when a proposal was made to cut the ranges back by a half [percentage point], not because I didn't want them cut, but because I thought we were firing our ammo too soon I felt that if we kept them the same, 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent, then we'd get a crack at them now, when we could do what was appropriate in the context of this period I think that was the appropriate way to go and, consequently, I am willing to go with a cut now, down to what's being called alternative II, I believe But I would like to go with a wider band, in keeping with what I said to Don Kohn about the uncertainties I just think that we are misleading people when we suggest that we can get it within a 3-point range If I thought we could, that's one thing; but at least many times we can't  So, I would go along with Messrs Forrestal and Melzer alternative II, with maybe a 4 to 8 percent range for M2 but staying with 5 to 8 percent for M3, so as to phase this in I still believe that the risk is on the downside Also, I think there are people out in the real world who think there are some downside risks and [this Committee] ought to be really, really concerned about doing anything with these ranges--even though, admittedly, they're longer-term ranges It would send a message to business people or money market or capital market participants that suggests a tightening Even though they might be reading it wrong, I would hate to have that happen, because right now I think that the mood is that we are easing I was just reading some money market commentary this morning and they think the Fed eased yesterday when the fed funds rate went to 6-1/4 percent If we send out a message when the Chairman testifies next week that we  -42-    2/9-10/88  are tightening, I'd like to crawl into a fox hole, because I don't want to be around when the flak flies Anyway, that's sort of where I'm coming from in general  On the rebasing, I've been in favor of rebasing all along In keeping with Mr Kelley's comments, I think we really ought to look at this And if we go to rebasing, we should do it come hell or high water, good times and bad--stick with it and not send the message that if it suits us we'll rebase, and if it doesn't we won't I think this is the time, though--and the chart here shows it--that it would make a significant difference whether we go with an average of where we thought we were going to be in the fourth quarter or where we actually were Also, if you don't rebase and then go to the lower ranges specified in alternative III, I think that could really give us problems On the monitoring question, I don't have a strong view on that; if you want to monitor M1 that's fine; if you don't that's okay with me too  I'll move it  I will move that  Should we be paying any attention to the structure of rates? It seems to me that the long rates have dropped dramatically in the last couple of months, as have private short-term rates The fed funds rate has dropped a bit, but it certainly hasn't kept up with the others And, of course, the discount rate has remained stuck Should we be looking at this as a factor or condition?    2/9-10/88  How about going back, though, to the October--  Having sat here for two days reminds me what a difficult job this is at the minimum wage Even at $4 an hour, the higher minimum wage, we'd still be-- But more seriously, I think one of the most difficult jobs that economic forecasters have is predicting turning points I sort of remember that from school and I also remember it, having lived a long time and through a number of business cycle turns I think policymakers also have a difficult time doing that--even identifying that the turn has occurred after the fact I just want to make sure that we are looking at every single thing here, and we have looked at a lot, certainly And we're very, very sensitive to the notion that there might be a bomb placed somewhere in this It's just this feeling of unease I have, I guess, that I would like to concentrate on I'll also repeat that I think there are risks on the downside both in this half of the year and my friend Governor Heller has convinced me that the bounce-back [in the second half] isn't assured either So that makes me doubly concerned I'd like to convey that feeling of risk and uncertainty and of having to watch carefully how we proceed  If I had to choose among the alternatives as stated, it would probably be alternative A If we can come up with something that's sort of a marriage between ""A"" and ""B"", then I could certainly vote for that But I am not convinced that the bankers are back to normal if they ever were normal I know a lot of them, and I had a feeling that those scars were going to remain for a while and I think they are remaining Therefore, I think it's more realistic to put a number in the borrowing path that, in fact, reflects what's going on--which is Bob Heller's $150 million I think that's what their behavior is really suggesting I think if we force the $250 million, we would put quite a bit of upward pressure on fed funds rates I'm willing to go with maintaining the current degree of pressure, but I don't think the $250 million would produce that Instead of putting all the latitude  -61-    2/9-10/88  on the Desk, I would rather give us a little vote in the process and let us suggest that maybe it go down to around $150 million  On the longer term, I would vote for alternative II with the broader band for M2--4 to 8 percent rather than 5 to 8 percent, and 5 to 8 percent for M3 A main concern I have is how these numbers will be received by the financial markets when they are announced Right at this moment I would be very sensitive about sending any message that we are tightening or even considering a tightening And I think one way to prevent that is to keep the upper end of this band where it has been So that's what I would vote for; I'm not sure that's specified exactly as an alternative  Would you say confirm the easing?  What we end up doing, though, is never voting for a policy change in this Committee I was thinking of last April when a snugging was taking place that we never voted on; but at the end of April we sort of confirmed the tightening that had occurred But we never actually voted at the FOMC meeting on a policy to tighten I was not opposed to doing it, but it just seems to me that there is a difference between our voting to ease, or whatever, and voting for no change with a tilt one way or the other--in which case the Desk can change the policy  Uh-huh  But I thought we were hearing it isn't back to normal  Or less normal  6-1/4 to 6-1/2 percent  That's trying to be on this side "
3541,1988-03-29,SEGER," I second that  I'll move it  I'd like to make a couple of comments as a person who was involved in banking most of the 1970s The image was that the policymakers just had no courage to fight inflation, because the Phillips curve suggested that when you fight inflation you're going to run unemployment up and policymakers couldn't take that heat I don't think people were focusing on whether or not fighting inflation by tightening monetary policy meant concentrating on one variable or another It was a bigger issue they just thought people who made policy were a bunch of weenies and couldn't handle the big job That was the view anyway  I share Manley's frustration with the operation of the Desk at certain points, and I think my frustration reached its peak this time last year I would just hope that the record of our discussions will really sensitize people to the concerns of some of us that when we think we've voted for a certain policy at an FOMC meeting and then we watch the numbers every day and see that we are getting away from what we thought the Committee voted on--I think maybe this has been a worthwhile exercise As I said a year ago, we went through a whole month where the daily explanation was that we couldn't predict Treasury balances or one thing or another, and that's why we were getting away from both the borrowing target and where we thought fed funds might be And then the light dawned well, in fact, we really snugged a bit And if that was going to take place--and maybe we needed to snug, by the way--then I think it should have been brought to the attention of the FOMC I think there should have been a telephone call or something I agree, certainly, that the Chairman needs discretion; I would argue that with my last breath But I thought that was a policy change Also, I'm very concerned about the messages that we send to market participants when we miss, for whatever reason, and when suddenly the fed funds rate runs up--or runs way down, for that matter I think we could take care of this    3/29/88  situation if we would release the minutes of the FOMC more promptly That way we would remove all this mystery about what we're doing and they would know They wouldn't have to dig through all these entrails to try to put together a message And I think that maybe this minutes policy is something else we could discuss sometime  I will shut up here by giving an analogy of whether you watch borrowings or fed funds If you think of yourself as driving an automobile, most of us, I hope, look out the windshield at the road ahead as we're driving along But we also have rear view mirrors And I don't want to ride with any of you who just look at either one or the other, because sometimes you have to move the steering wheel to avoid side-swiping when you see the guy coming at you in the rear view mirror I think the windshield, in this case, would be the borrowing target; but we have to take into account the information we pick up through the rear view mirror which is the behavior of the fed funds rate And because we don't know these relationships really well, or they change over time, I think we need to be very sensitive to these moves in the fed funds rate Not that we're targeting a number, because I don't believe in that; but at least we should give attention to it as an indicator of maybe something going wrong in these relationships--whether there's some little change in banker attitudes, or whatever Maybe this is a cop out by saying we should use some of each, but that's the way I feel  On the frequency of the meetings, I think that eight a year is just terrific, with the idea being that we can converse in between meetings We have these nice ""lightning rods"" they set up on this table and that makes telephone conferencing very easy when there is some policy change that might need to be considered or even a very major change in operations because of an event like last October 19th which, as you will recall, was handled by a whole bunch of daily telephone consultations So that's my three cents worth  That's all right  Yes  -31-    3/29/88  I have just a couple of comments, primarily based on some conversations I had with people in the auto industry Friday and yesterday As I looked at the general statistics, I thought the consumer looked as if he or she was pretty tight-fisted Certainly, the retail sales look that way; the consumption numbers for the last five or six months have looked that way, I believe People point to auto sales as some sort of exception, but at least the people I spoke with in the auto industry are not putting that kind of interpretation on this What they are saying is that they had to put incentives on 75 to 80 percent of their lines because they were sitting on this tremendous inventory, the dealers were squawking, and they had to help move the inventory out In connection with all this effort, they actually reduced inventories by 58,000 units between the end of January and the end of February We seasonally adjust and we multiply everything by twelve The dealers who are holding the inventories are paying interest on actual numbers; they don't get seasonally adjusted Anyway, there is this feeling that they have to move these things and that there is a big advantage these days to keeping your production lines running because your workers are happier and your suppliers are happier The auto industry has excess capacity these days, and therefore, the pressure is really on them to do everything possible to move these units I sense that there is real fear about what might happen if and when they remove some of these incentives; they don't  -49-    3/29/88  seem too eager to test the market real soon In connection with this, the production schedules are looked at each week They did announce some higher schedule amounts for the second quarter They look at these on an ongoing basis, though, so they are not stuck with the higher numbers if they don't believe the numbers are consistent with the sales results Also, in the context of the room in this economy for producing for export, when you nail down some of the numbers, it makes me think that we have more room than some people realize For example, one automaker is talking about a big increase in export opportunities for a certain make that we export to Europe 400 units this year and 1200 next year That's a mammoth percentage increase; I can't do it in my head But, in fact, getting 400 units this year and 1200 next year on the kind of base that they're talking about here is not going to cramp anybody's style or their production facilities Finally, I checked with two of the big three automakers on the price pressure issue and said ""I'm reading all this stuff in the paper; what's really going on?"" One of them, who had just talked to their purchasing agents last week, said that in terms of what they are actually paying, they're not seeing this I think the difference is that we are confusing what is happening to some of the list prices and what sharp purchasers are paying  My final point is this let's say the price of copper rises by a nickel That is a tiny percentage of the total cost of a lot of products There are all sorts of things that we [consumers] pay for, like utility bills and labor and so forth; so I think you have to keep this in some sort of perspective before you assume that the increase in copper prices will be approximately the increase in the CPI I am still not convinced that we are about to go lickety split at 90 miles an hour I hope you can convince me that there is more strength there than I am able to find so far "
3564,1988-05-17,SEGER," I'm in favor of ""B"", including the idea of adding $100 million to the borrowing target eventually, for many of the reasons that the Chairman mentioned The main reason is, again, that we have had these two tightening moves in very recent weeks and I'm not sure that the markets have fully digested those moves I'd be very surprised if the real economy has taken them into account or if the monetary aggregates have begun to reflect them Also, as I mentioned before, I think we ought to pay some attention to the stock market I think there is a lot of nervousness still there, at least among a lot of institutions In many cases, institutions and small investors have taken a walk I haven't heard anyone mention the thrift industry, but I think that that's a disaster area, and something we have to pay attention to Bob Boykin, I'm sure, can speak to that, as can a number of us; and too much tightening too soon, I think, would make it a greater disaster I can't imagine that the LDC debt situation would improve dramatically if we tighten too much Also, as I read that table on the growth of the monetary aggregates, it seems to me that those aggregates are expected to slow whether we go with ""B"" or ""C"" And I still think that some inventory correction is in the cards I don't know when it will be--I'm not that smart; but I think there is some excess there that is going to be worked off In fact, when interest rates get higher, it just gives business people stronger incentive to run with less inventory I could live with the asymmetric language as well I think that summarizes it  I just have one question  I read these papers with great interest Would it be possible to run something like this off the shelf? In other words, not publicly announce that we're going to change, but act internally here as if we were trying it for six months, and just sort of simulate what the decision-making process would be?  [We could try it] between now and, say, the end of the year or something like that; and if it did turn out to have real working potential, then put it in the Humphrey-Hawkins [report] next February  It's better than looking backwards, which is what you're doing statistically  Yes  Well, it's just an idea  Probably three days "
3589,1988-06-29,SEGER," I think this question is related I'm never quite sure about the decision-making process Is the quarterback on these decisions the Secretary of the Treasury? Are Treasury officials the ones who decide the point at which to go in, or were we doing it based on the suggestion of the Bundesbank? I just missed that    6/29-30/88  Thank you  I'll move it  Picking up on one of Manley's questions--if we hadn't done this recent +$50 million on the borrowing target, where would you think the fed funds rate might be today? Would it still be hitting 8 percent?  But I thought we took that move because we were worried that in the next few days the fed funds rate would decline below 7-1/2 percent if we didn't do it I guess that's what confuses me  Did we not expect these special factors or--  Those seasonal influences were greater than we had originally expected them to be?  Okay  Thank you  Second    6/29-30/88 -12-  It won't change next year either  I am in favor of maintaining the existing ranges for '88 and in keeping with my position this time last year, I think that it makes sense to maintain the same ranges for '89 because we do have another crack at this early next year, and it makes a lot of sense to keep our powder dry And if we need to tighten further, I would certainly go to II or III; but in the meantime, I don't think the markets, as a matter of fact, think we are paying much attention to the monetary aggregates at the moment We keep saying we aren't, so I don't know how it is that we are supposed to send this tremendous message to the financial markets by knocking these ranges down substantially at this point  -41-    6/29-30/88  Maybe we ought to consider announcing promptly what we do; then you could tell them  I'm in favor of maintaining the present degree of reserve pressure with asymmetric language, and reconvening via telephone in the next two or three weeks In fact, it seems to me we could even wait until that time to put the extra $50 million in the target because, as I understand it, the fed funds rate is running right around 8 percent at the moment  It has been up close to 8 percent even before today, though, hasn't it?  Thanks  I guess I don't have that much faith in the accuracy of our models  Or 8-1/4  Are you ending up with ""increase"" or are you ending up with ""maintain""? "
3608,1988-07-19,SEGER," I would support--  I was just going to vote in favor of keeping our powder dry for another two weeks or so to get a chance to look at the major revisions on the GNP accounts and also to watch what's going on in the foreign exchange markets And like Governor Johnson said, I have a feeling that this strength in the dollar is not just a flash in the pan but there's more there But at least this would give us more time to decide what's going on "
3631,1988-08-16,SEGER," So move it  Second  Mike, could you elaborate a little bit more on the interest rate outlook pattern? I know you mentioned fed funds are expected to reach 9-1/2 percentby next spring, and I think you said long-term Treasury bonds, 10-1/2 percent It's hard to hear this morning at this end of the table, but I think you said 10-1/2 percent by next spring Are you suggesting that this will be the peaking of rates for this cycle or that this is just sort of a run?  How about mortgage rates? I noticed in your commentary you indicated that you think housing is probably number one on the hit list, as we tighten further But when I went through and looked at some of the forecast numbers I didn't see really major downward revisions So, maybe you can tell me what kind of mortgage--  12 percent  Big tax increase  I have just one comment and a couple of anecdotes that I've picked up in the last few days The comment involves the drought-adjusted real GNP growth figures I too found these very interesting, particularly to see the amount of deceleration that it shows over the fourth quarter That's really dramatic--from 38 to 18 percent So it does paint quite a helpful picture Also, one thing I haven't heard mentioned in connection with the drought is the  -22-    8/16/88  fact that it motivated the people down the street here to rain about $39 billion on farmers in the form of cash That ought to do something for somebody  On the anecdotes, a number of people in home building have expressed to me concern about the latest upward move in interest rates I would say that their numbers are somewhere around 100 thousand to maybe even 200 thousand starts a year more pessimistic than what we are showing Also, one of the things that has been pointed out to me involves defense spending and the impact of this investigation that's going on here in Washington--looking at the [unintelligible] and procurement process--and what this means as far as the slowdown in the actual granting of new defense contracts and also the payout of some existing ones This may help your area, Frank; it gets a lot of this money up there  Also on the export side, a number of manufacturers are very concerned about this rebound in the dollar because they were just really moving forward to emphasize exports and to gear up for producing more products for export And now, as they see the dollar rebound, they're concerned that maybe they'll get geared up just in time for the market not to be there I think that that is something certainly to look at, particularly any increase that's above today's already higher levels And the final thing I've picked up is in the consumer area I was talking to a couple of days ago, who told me that the only strong area there was sales of air conditioners; you can all figure out why that has been the case And the sales of lawnmowers have been very weak  Snowplows are coming up  But it is sort of interesting that that was the exact comment made This person also mentioned the concern over the consumer debt burden and what that may do in the future, particularly if economic growth does slow dramatically I believe that some retailers are looking at this variable-rate loan issue and whether or not the higher interest rates in the market feed back into the consumer budget more rapidly, because even though ARMs are often adjusted only once a year, the variable rate credit cards and the home equity lines often are adjusted monthly Therefore, we would get a more prompt feedback And I know there is some concern out there that that would be another source of restraint on consumer spending So, that's just a little bit extra on anecdotes for you Thank you  I can certainly accept targeting a borrowing figure But it does concern me when the fed funds rate whips all over and then that confuses market participants But I think the way to fix this--maybe we can discuss this issue at some future luncheon--is to release our minutes more promptly so people will know what we are up to Then they wouldn't have to be going through all these little subtle signals trying to figure out what it is we are really doing And, you know, if the fed funds rate goes to 9 this afternoon at 300, some people are going to suggest probably that it's there because we put it there They won't know I think that getting the information out more promptly about what our policy moves are would help to calm the markets down and would really eliminate some of this confusion  Well, I guess I'm a ""B"", $600 million today It's not a new [unintelligible] First of all, I think the discount rate hike did catch almost everybody in the markets by surprise Everyone is on vacation, and I don't think that we've had the full impact, particularly in the stock market Also, we've had several rounds of tightening so far this year and I'm not convinced that all of those have been felt in economic activity yet Also, I think the foreign exchange markets are very, very important to this process And I would want to be sure that we didn't get the dollar moving so rapidly north and get it so strong that it would impede our ability to fix our trade imbalances I think it's important to get that done over the long term  I do believe money matters and I think the monetary aggregates--particularly M2--have been looking quite good, behaving very well In connection with that, I would go along with Wayne Angell's idea that we move it up I'm not sure that today I'm willing to put it in spot number one, but I am willing certainly to move it up [in the directive listing of factors] Some of the indicators of inflation and inflationary expectations, I think, look better than they did a couple of months ago, particularly looking at prices of    8/16/88  such things as gold, oil, certain commodities And I realize we have a weak producer price index and some of those, but I think the more sensitive price numbers are not looking necessarily worse As I said, I would go for a $600 million borrowing target, and I guess I would prefer a symmetrical directive, but I can certainly live with an asymmetric one "
3655,1988-09-20,SEGER," I have basically two questions One is, if we don't get the dollar coming off from existing levels, what will that do to our ability to produce these kinds of net exports?  Do you want to do them one at a time or do you want to do several?  Some business people are concerned about their ability to be competitive at existing levels, but maybe that's not a predominant view My second question is one involving a statement in the Greenbook that staff continue to believe that additional pressure in financial markets would be required to slow the expansion, etc And I guess this goes to Mike Do you think you've seen the full impact of the tightening moves that we've had to date?  Thank you  Can't be or you'd get in trouble  The most intriguing information I've had since the last meeting didn't come from an economist or businessman but from a psychiatrist who happened to be sitting next to me on an airplane coming back from Boston He was writing madly and I could see the word depression, so I thought he was one of the crackpots who writes the doom-and-gloom books about the end of the economic world After a few minutes we got to talking, and I discovered that he is a psychiatrist specializing in depression But the useful information to me was that as he counsels people, one of the first things he asks them is for information about their spending habits, particularly the spending that they do using little pieces of plastic And what he's discovered is that this is one of the early signs of depression--that people go out on these big spending sprees They buy cars--no, seriously--that they can't afford  I'm not smart enough to make this up They buy cars they can't afford, do all this spending, and run their cards right up to the limits--and this is just before they go over the edge So we decided that based on what he saw and what I had seen in the statistics that there are a lot of psychos running around  Yes, that's right, he's doing okay In that con- nection, though, anyone I speak with other than him suggests that consumers as a whole aren't on a big spending spree So I guess my view of the economy is a little less optimistic than the staff's  Also, on the housing side, some of the realtors I've spoken with suggest, first of all, that the recent increases in mortgage rates haven't all been felt; and, secondly, that consumers are beginning to react to the high prices on new homes Also, in certain parts of the country, like Mr Parry's enlightened California, there are these tremendous restrictions on growth; and it's very difficult to get lots on which to build houses despite the whining about the housing shortages So I think that our forecast on housing starts might be a touch high  -16-    9/20/88  Finally, as I think I hinted in my discussion with Mike Prell and Ted Truman, I'm a little less certain that we're going to get the export improvement that we are forecasting I would certainly like to see it because, while certainly some companies are still competitive at existing exchange rates and in [scenarios] that involve a slightly cheaper dollar, I don't think everybody is And that concerns me So those are the three areas where I guess I differ from the staff Thank you  You can include me, too I just want to mention one other thing that I haven't heard commented about this morning, and that is the risk to the thrift industry That industry is already very weak, with many institutions on their backs And a further significant upward movement in interest rates, as the Board staff presentation yesterday showed us, would add significantly to the number of insolvent institutions around So I think that's just another good reason for sitting tight Thank you "
3674,1988-10-17,SEGER," I just have two questions I guess they would be political but they're probably tied into the economics also You mentioned that the new president will take office December 1 In the context of this country, anyway, to what extent can an outgoing government commit a new government?  I guess I was thinking more of some of the funda- mental changes that Ted alluded to in his briefing I think it would be hard to get those all accomplished in the next 30-some days  Okay, that leads me to my second question Some of these kinds of policies might not be terribly popular with the    10/17/88  populace And as I understand it, the election was sort of a squeaker anyway, if that's a fair term So, are we maybe going to have to face some real political instability if interest rates shoot up?  I'm not opposed to a loan and I certainly would believe in supporting the government I just wonder if in 45 days we're going to be sitting around discussing this again  That is what I was driving at  Thank you "
3698,1988-11-01,SEGER," I want to make a different point, because I don't know how presidents feel, not being a president But I can tell you, if this were done right now, the media would pick this up and say the Governors are trying to get rid of Bob Forrestal because he's a ""meanie"" from Atlanta And we're changing this arrangement to get rid of certain people I can just see it  I didn't say whether that was true or not    11/1/88  Seriously, the media would just love to pick up this us-versus-them routine, and while I haven't seen the us-versus- them at work [on the Committee], this would be something else that they would seize on--on top of whatever other considerations there might be So I'm sure you can't keep this quiet  I just have a question; I hope it's a fair one What if you had done this project 40 years ago, and ran it and established your equations, and so forth, would that have given us good guidance going forward?    11/1/88  So this relationship would pick that up? Because often I see econometric models that cheat They have the advantage of what has happened, and they go back and say, well, this really would have worked Whereas in fact if you had done it earlier, it wouldn't have worked But this doesn't--  Thank you  I just want to make sure I heard you right This is the first time I believe I've heard the election introduced into this analysis of what's going on  But I haven't heard us discuss that here in terms of what, in fact, it would be  Okay  Yes, but I'm just saying that this is the first time I've heard this even  That they expect some tremendous change after the November  Well, that's the day of the election  Thank you  I'll move it  Second  This is just a fundamental question The day that this bridge loan was announced in the newspaper, I happened to have breakfast with a Congressman from the House Banking Committee and he said, ""What in the world is the Federal Reserve doing in that? Why would they be involved with the bridge loan?"" And I didn't know how to answer, I'll be honest with you And then, secondly, there were a couple of articles in the newspaper shortly thereafter that indicated the conditions surrounding this loan were so much different from the bridge loans in the past I would like comments on both of those  Well, I guess he thought the Treasury would be involved; I don't think he thought it was inappropriate for the country  Thank you  Yes  Well, maybe this is what we're talking about!  SPEAKER(?) It doesn't look too great, like the economy certainly--  Just two quick questions On the assumption about where we'll have to put interest rates over next year, you said plus one percent on fed funds between now and the end of next year, is that right?  -28-    11/1/88  Okay, how about the long rate?  Also the same, whether it's long governments or mortgages?  Run this by me again I think I asked this question last time; I'm getting more dense by the minute What are the underlying demand forces now that we're really trying to dampen, knock in the head?  I guess I just have a slightly different view of life in the streets Thank you  I read the Beigebook this time with great interest and all the comments about signs of slowing business I certainly agree with that I also think it will slow next year even without additional tightening I have been checking a great deal with all kinds of firms that actually deal with consumers, and the story is consistent that consumers need tremendous inducements to buy, a lot of coaxing; competition is fierce all over Also, if you look at the inventories expressed as inventories-to-sales ratios and do it in constant dollar terms--I'm thinking of the chart that I get from Goldman-Sachs all the time--it shows inventories are not in quite such good shape as I think we're assuming they are Also, if the sales part of the ratio weakens much, then what look like acceptable ratios can quickly become a touch high Also, with regard to business spending on equipment, I'm again hearing more and more decision makers comment on the uncertainties they have over future tax policy as we hear more and more talk about fixing the deficit and I think that that in and of itself is going to put a damper on this kind of activity Also, questions [they have] about sales prospects in their own businesses I think will tend to support that sluggishness On the housing side, I agree that sales of existing homes have been strong, but I also know that many realtors have been out beating the bushes telling their customers to buy now because home prices are going to rise and buy now because mortgage rates are going up And I think that there's some of that in these good results for the last three or four months  Also, I'd just like to take a minute to report on an interesting meeting I had yesterday with some Fortune 500 kinds of business people They had an interesting main topic of conversation, because they chose the subject of corporate takeovers That was their big interest, and I guess I shouldn't be surprised that one of the interesting things that came up was the notion that there are almost con-man types who are out running around and will actually go and approach management at very big companies and tell them if they go for one of these deals we will guarantee you so many millions of dollars,  -37-    11/1/88  etc And so these people are actually trying to play, I guess I'd almost call it matchmaker, before there is any action of another type taking place But there is great concern and the more thoughtful ones I believe were also talking about these two recent heavily publicized deals and saying that, sure, the debt can probably be serviced but that would mean that the cash that they thought they were going to have for R&D expenditures, privatization, etc, would be drained off from those good projects and would have to be used for debt service I think they were quite concerned about that The second big topic of conversation was this new National Economic Commission and they were very eager I'd say for that group to get its deliberations done and announce the results on December 15th And I think their expectation is very high, in fact so high that afterwards a fellow who works for  and has been attending these NEC meetings with him came up to me and said ""I just want to warn you, don't be too optimistic because first of all they're not going to have the report by December 15th; secondly, there's no guarantee they'll even agree among themselves on how to do it"" And, therefore, he thought that there might be some disappointment with the results And then finally, some of them did express some concern about the outlook for next year and whether or not the economy would make it through a seventh year of recovery But overall it was very, very illuminating  Did you talk to your retailers?  Did you talk to your retailers?  Oh, okay  Okay  Yes, I'm certainly willing to stick with alternative ""B"" I would note that my remarks about signs of less robust business growth and the performance of monetary aggregates have been pointed out by some others as well I don't think anyone has mentioned that there are financial market participants who thought, as of a couple of weeks ago, that we had tightened monetary policy somewhat when they saw the federal funds rate creep up to 8-1/4 percent or above So I think I can vote for alternative ""B"" but I feel fairly strongly that there should be symmetric language rather than asymmetric And if the $600 million borrowing target were to mean a federal funds rate of 9-1/2 percent, then I would have a problem with that  I wasn't sure  Yes, can I abstain? No, last time I went along with it and the asymmetric language even though I didn't want the asymmetric So, this time I'm willing to go along except that I have such a problem with the asymmetric I think I will dissent, since I can't vote 50-50  -50-    11/1/88 -51- "
3711,1988-11-22,SEGER," Yes I just had one question in regard to how religiously we will try to hit the $400 million borrowing if, in fact, this relationship--I mean the relationship between $400 million in borrowing and the 8-3/8 percent funds rate--doesn't prove to be too dependable I mean, would we go to, say, 8-3/4 percent? Is there some feel for that?  Yes  Thank you "
3736,1988-12-13,SEGER," I'll do it  If this is too silly a question, tell me and I will retract it How do you decide, when you intervene, whether to really come in like ""gangbusters"" or to make sort of an anemic effort? In your comments, it sounded to me as if you said that earlier in the month market participants were disappointed with our intervention--I'm paraphrasing--because it looked as if we were just trying to let the dollar down easily and we weren't really trying to hold it up Did we really intend that?  So, why didn't we go in and really hit it then?  Thank you  Second  I just have a question How bad does the relationship have to get, or how unreliable, before we should drop this approach?  So, as Manley Johnson indicates, it seems that the rule has been that the relationship hasn't been super terrific rather than that being the exception over the last four years or so    12/13-14/88  If you were a robot and you just had pushed for the $600 million and kept going until you got it, what would your guess be as to where the federal funds rate might have gone?  You don't think you'd go over that?  Thank you  Keep their import protection  What are you assuming on the exchange rate situation with regard to the NICs? You know they haven't necessarily followed the weighted-average G-10 that we [unintelligible]  Starting in 1985?  And the second question I have is for those people who argue that slowing our economy will help our trade deficit Have you run a recession through your models to see what that does? If slowing is good, then recession must be terrific, right?  Yes, that's what my question was  -26-    12/13-14/88  No, I'm talking about the trade [unintelligible]  I wasn't talking about comparing recession to what we have now, I'm just saying comparing a slow growth forecast with an honest-to-goodness resession  Thank you  Yes, I need help in the housing area, and this sort of ties into the issue of alternatives You have housing starts, if I'm on the right line, going from 14 million this year to 143 then down to 136 million in 1990 with a fairly significant amount of monetary tightening built into these numbers I know when you talked about different scenarios before, you had housing as one of the more interest-sensitive industries and therefore one that would respond most dramatically to tightening So, when I looked at these, I really wondered if you had enough of a decline; or looking at it another way, I wondered, if interest rates were to stay where they are now, if housing starts would rise?  -34-    12/13-14/88  So, you don't think we are vulnerable here then?  Yes  I hoped that you remembered that  Yes  Thank you  I've been sitting here listening, then trying to match the comments with what I read in the Beigebook Either some weeks have passed or else I just read the Beigebook wrong But it sounds as though the views expressed were quite different; namely, the views today are much more optimistic than what was presented as those observations Also, maybe Mr Hoskins can help me out on this, it seems to me the NABE runs periodic surveys of members, and it seems that roughly half of the members expect a recession some time next year And most of the remaining respondents expect one in 1990  It was 47 percent next year  But when I read these I'm trying to ask what they know that we don't know or what are they assuming that we are not assuming Again, in talking with some business economists, I think they are somewhat more pessimistic on the consumer side than our staff forecast And in the housing area, at least, again I think some of them might be a little more pessimistic A number are bringing out these stories of real estate problems, even in the Northeast I think  -48-    12/13-14/88  there are some banks in the Northeast that are now actually indicating that they are going to have to take some losses on real estate loans which is quite a change from what people were telling us a few months ago I think this is also true in some other parts of the country which have been doing extremely well and now are turning around a little bit I can't imagine that that's an environment in which developers are going to hustle out and start more condo projects and apartment buildings, etc Also, in the capital spending arena some of the reports that I pick up--computer chips, those sorts of companies-- it seems that again the situation has changed dramatically in the last few months In fact, in some cases they've gone from a shortage of chips to situations with almost an excess Also, some of the auto economists I know are a little more pessimistic about the inventory situation than I've heard expressed around the table here today In fact, I heard yesterday that the days-supply for one of the very large auto companies would be a little over a 100 at the end of January That's high Also, when you get that kind of inventory situation in autos, you do see them follow through with some production cutbacks They have used incentives to a tremendous extent as you know, but the ""bang for the buck"" from incentives seems to be petering out So, if I had to come down on one side or the other, I would think they would fix this through some production changes rather than trying more incentives  Also, in the export area I'm not sure that all the business economists I've spoken with and some other contacts I've made expect the strength in the exports to be as great They would certainly like to get it, but there is no real confidence that we will continue to make these tremendous advances that we have Also, in the area of inflation and price stability, etc, one of the things that I think econometric models haven't picked up or haven't captured is the changed situation out in the real world, particularly in manufacturing I mean the changes that are going on, the emphasis on efficiency, productivity, cost controls, knocking off layers of management, etc, I think that has been going on the last couple of years and I think it is still going on And frankly when you look at some of these relationships back 10 or 15 years, it was a very different America then I think we've learned something and I can't imagine that these improved attitudes are just going to suddenly evaporate Also, I think on the labor side some of those people too would rather be employed at $17 an hour than unemployed at $1825 Ask your friend with the building trades why so much of the commercial building is being done by non-union workers Maybe that's had some impact on the fact that unions haven't had those nice settlements that they used to drool over They, too, may have to pay attention to markets, Bob This is a shock to union people  But it seems to be going on, and particularly if construction isn't rocketing ahead, I would say that the bargaining power of management might be even stronger now than it was a couple of years ago And also, looking at some of the sources of the higher prices that we have seen, I'm not sure we are able to control them For example, looking at copper prices, what are we supposed to do about a strike some place? We are going to go down and pull the people back out? I mean, that has influenced the copper prices Wayne's farmer friends have certainly suffered from bad weather  -49-    12/13-14/88  conditions this year, and that has certainly put upward pressure on prices of agriculture commodities I don't know what we are supposed to do about it And also, looking at the prices of some the steel products, it seems to me that they have been influenced by these silly quotas that we've put on the imports of steel So, maybe we need some help from our pals down the street to fix some of these things  Now, I think the Federal Reserve ought to do its job And I know Roger Guffey says everyone is looking to us to do it Maybe we ought to tell them that we can't solve all the problems, though we can do our share certainly Picking up on one of Governor LaWare's comments, I think the problems in the thrift area are very, very severe I met Monday with a person who is I think pretty expert on thrifts  and he had some very negative things to say about thrifts He indicated that even building into their cost  of funds the existing level of short-term interest rates would do tremendous damage, because it doesn't feed in immediately You have CDs that have fixed maturities and it takes a while for existing levels to influence those He's not a crackpot on this subject, so I took his comments rather seriously And also on the LDCs, I think that that is something that really could give us and the banks that have been involved with those things even bigger headaches So, I just think it's a very difficult call My own personal conclusion would be that it's not certain that 1989 and 1990 would be excessively strong even without a 200 basis point advance in interest rates  I'm on the side of the gentleman from St Louis, President Melzer  The young boy from St Louis!  I was trying to flatter him It didn't work  Anyway, I would be opposed to a discount rate hike now I would remind you of what the announcement effect did in  -60-    12/13-14/88  the summer, or actually September, of 1987 when the discount rate was hiked and the idea was that long-rates would decline as a result and short rates would rise Instead, all rates rose as I recall And the only thing that didn't rise was Wall Street in October when we had a slight problem with the stock market Again, their ""gong"" was done in order to sweep up the heavy pile of paper, and the blood on the floor But anyway I think it would be bad now in that sense Also, we are right in the middle of the Christmas selling season And again if you want the announcement effect, I can't think of a worse time unless you really want to cause retail sales to go into a tailspin at a time when for many merchants, a third, 40 percent of their annual sales take place around the Christmas holidays And, frankly, I just don't think it's needed The monetary aggregate growth has I think looked pretty good, pretty responsible Si Keehn said we've had a number of tightening moves since last spring And I'm not convinced that we've seen all of those impact the economy yet So, as I said, I'm on Tom Melzer's side  Yes "
3761,1989-02-07,SEGER," Second  Maybe I'm missing something, but as you go through the alternatives is there one that would be comparable to, say, just freezing in place today's policy stance? I don't mean--  Yes But I guess that wasn't quite what I was thinking of And maybe I have the wrong view of what holding today's reserve pressures would do I sense that that might put a little more upward pressure on rates But maybe your ""more money"" alternative is going to be the status quo  Okay, thanks  But look at what it did for the economy  Look at what it did for the economy--all the beer sales!  I just want to add a couple of points to those made by Governors Heller and Johnson along the lines that some of the forecasts of people on the outside seem to be somewhat different from ours The purchasing managers' survey and the Bluechip forecast were mentioned before This morning I had breakfast with some business economists representing a wide range of companies-- forest products company, a large energy company, two chemical companies, these kinds of outfits--and to a person they don't see the capacity shortages that we all wring our hands over They also certainly are pleased that their businesses are doing well but they don't sense a [boom] taking place They are expecting prices of the raw materials that they will purchase this year to increase but at a mere fraction of the increase of last year And they also are expecting some slowing down One fellow who couldn't attend, the chief economist of  sent me a fax I mention this because we often mention as an example of a rust belt outfit that shaped up and is  now doing well I'm certainly not going to read the whole fax but let me just read selections He said business has slowed down and is declining in housing-related construction, with about one-third of models on allocation compared to well over one-half early last year The allocated models are large machines associated with a worldwide mining boom Industry is never tooled for these peaks; it would leave too much idle capacity in softer times It's customary to stretch delivery Then he says that sales outside the United States are up 33 percent over the last year but that business is beginning to slow down in Europe Then he talks about materials prices being up less than the PPI and he expects that to continue; suppliers are asking for bigger increases but their target is less than national inflation  Also, I got something from the National Association of Home Builders They have a forecast of housing starts of 800,000--a figure 800,000 below ours for 1989--and a proportional decline in multifamily versus single-family starts And they are only assuming an additional 1/2 percentage point increase in long rates, specifically mortgage rates The third thing that I haven't heard people mention is the impact of the restructuring It seems to me that I read that General Motors is going to be closing a plant near Boston, so maybe that will help the labor shortage there; that's going to throw about 3,000 people in [the labor pool] And it takes 6 hamburger flippers to be equivalent [in pay] to one of the jobs of those laid off Xerox will be laying off 2,000 in Rochester; that ought to help Jerry's area Also, I haven't heard anybody allude to the thrift mess and the impact that might have on the overall economy I can't prove it, but I sense that if it isn't handled promptly and smoothly there could be a negative impact Furthermore, as Mike Kelley suggested, if we tighten too much--if interest rates move still higher--we could also make the mess worse than it now is, taking some of the modestly solvent and  -21-    2/7-8/89  profitable thrifts and throwing them over on the other pile Also, to reiterate, the monetary growth numbers are good; at least as I read them, they are about the best since I've been here I haven't been able to quantify the impact of higher interest rates on monthly installment loan payments as more and more variable rate loans are used, but I just cannot imagine that it's not going to take place We now have had enough of a rise in the short rates to which many of these instruments are tied that I would think [the rate adjustments] would start kicking into effect and would produce higher monthly payments Maybe everyone who signed on to one of these instruments had their monthly incomes advance as fast; if that's the case, they're lucky But for those who didn't, they aren't represented by  in their negotiations Perhaps they will have to cover their higher payments on these loans by cutting back on something else So, I guess I'm just not convinced that the forecast in here is in the bag Thank you  I want to make sure I heard right what you were saying about our long-term objective for monetary policy relative to what the Humphrey-Hawkins Act had in mind Are you suggesting that we're not subject to their--  Okay  But you said it doesn't have it as number one, which is the way I saw the Act also  Oh yes, I understand that But it sounded as though we were departing from what they had in mind, but maybe it's just too early in the morning  Oh you really want to be popular! My second question is sort of a variation on my question yesterday about covering a standstill policy You say that alternative ""I"" here would encompass the Greenbook forecast of further tightening, right?  In our list of alternative forecasts, Mike said that we had one that would be a continuation of the existing, or constant--  Yes, right  Okay Where does that fit into these?  I still sense, though, that there's an option missing here You have number ""I,"" which is your base line, which is tightening, right? You have number ""II,"" which is additional tightening  And you have number ""III,"" which is easing  Well, at least that's what you read  Thank you  No, I was just picking up on what I thought Don said was in the Humphrey-Hawkins Act I didn't write Humphrey- Hawkins, but as it was written they put a higher priority on the employment side of things and mentioned price stability I was just saying from Don's comment that it sounded to me as if we were establishing priorities that were divergent from what Humphrey-Hawkins had That's all I was saying  May I pick up on the credibility issue? It bothers me to hear over and over again that we somehow or other just have to satisfy the financial markets I'm very respectful of the financial markets but it's a big country out there and there are a lot more Main Streets than there are Wall Streets And I think the screaming meemees up there shouldn't be the ones who dictate to us Establishing credibility is a much broader challenge We have to convince all sorts of people above and beyond the financial market types even though they are the ones--  Right  I don't know; I'm not Mr Greider  Now that I know the actual results [for the economy] and also what happened to monetary growth in 1988, I'm willing to support the preliminary ranges, which would be alternative ""I"" For M2, of course, it does remove a full percentage point at both ends of the [1988] range, which in my judgment is a sufficient message to the doubting Thomases Secondly, I would suggest that we're measuring from a point that is below the midpoint; the actual growth in 1988 came out below the midpoint of the range for last year  -37-    2/7-8/89  And so it seems to me we're picking up a little there, simply in measuring from a lower base On M3, again, taking a half point off from each end in conjunction with the full point off the M2 range should be sufficient to convince our followers  Yes, but commercial paper wouldn't be picked up in M2 or T-Bills wouldn't be picked up in M2  Commercial paper, T-Bills  Would it be possible to make the case at this point, given this continued uncertainty about the relationship, that we should engage more directly in targeting fed funds rather than having the flexibility in operations of the Desk?  Yes, I can support your recommendation, sir I won't tick off all my reasons because most of them have already been stated by someone or another I would just add one, and that is that if we were to tighten further I think there would be copycat actions coming from other countries And I'm not sure that that would benefit all the economies in the world long term Also, with the dollar so strong at the moment and our strenuous efforts to lead it down, it just doesn't seem sensible to be putting further upward pressure on interest rates at this moment So I would back your alternative, which I believe is ""B""  But not until it's discussed at the conference call, right? "
3786,1989-03-28,SEGER," How about Cleveland?  Is New York okay for a second choice?  Second    3/28/89  I just want to make sure I understood your comment about intervening and the Ministry of Finance Do we have a deal with the Japanese that we will not intervene unless they [agree]? What if we reached the point that it was in our interest to do so and the Ministry of Finance was still balking?  It was too subtle for me  Just looking at their gigantic trade surplus vis- a-vis our own situation, it seems that at some point we'd have to ask ourselves what is in our interest rather than having the Ministry of Finance decide  There was an article in the paper about Salomon Brothers taking big hits in their government trading  Given their level of expertise, etc, and what you said about the people in the markets expecting us to tighten further how could they possibly have taken such gigantic loses?  The only reason I mentioned Salomon Brothers is that that was the firm that happened to be featured in the news item But I imagine--  Thank you  Second  Maybe you can get rid of some confusion I have I always thought that the housing industry was very sensitive to credit conditions and interest rate movements, and so forth I see what has happened to interest rates in the last year and I hear the forecast of another percentage point to be tacked on, yet I see housing starts for the calendar year 1989 actually estimated at a touch above calendar 1988--if I'm on the right line, it's 1-1/2 million versus 149 million And then the following year it's 144 million, with the weakest quarter not being any worse than 143 million I guess I just need to have that put together for me How, with these interest rates, would you think that the home construction will not be any weaker than that?  Assume everyone's moving to California--is that it?  Yes, but the others--  My preference is for no change, which I guess is ""B"" with symmetric language As has been said by a number of people, we have had a substantial tightening over the last 12 months or so; interest rates have risen rather dramatically Because of these known lags, much of that tightening has yet to be felt by the economy Also, as Manley said, there have been some signs of slowing I personally would argue that there's going to be some more coming, particularly in housing and in the auto industry I haven't heard it mentioned but I think that the thrift situation is something we should be aware of, if for no other reason than we could easily do something that would make the cost of the bailout quite a bit higher Also, despite the Brady plan, I don't believe we've solved the third world debt problem; maybe it's coming but I don't think it has been done Too much additional tightening, I think, could negatively impact those third world nations Finally, I'm very concerned about the dollar perhaps not performing as Ted and his people think it will--that it will stay strong and that that will prevent this export expansion that we all want which, in turn, will make it even more difficult to narrow our trade deficit So, for all those reasons I would prefer to sit tight and have symmetrical language  That being the case, I'll say no  I would have "
3814,1989-05-16,SEGER," I will move them  I'll second it for you  I have three questions I may have missed the answers On the technical adjustment of the borrowing target from $500 to $600 million for alternative B, what do you think the fed funds rate would be if you didn't make that adjustment and you stuck with the $500 million that we currently have?  Sure  Do we have an alternative for no change in policy? It seems to me that what we have is an easing, which is ""A;"" a slight tightening, which is ""B;"" and more tightening, which is ""C""  -33-    5/16/89  But without even looking forward, doesn't the fed funds assumption in alternative B, at least in a relative sense, represent some tightening? I say that because we've already seen, as I read the numbers anyway, quite a significant decline in short-term rates And if you--  I'm sorry; I was up [on the Hill], having had a date with a couple of my Congressmen  I think you answered my third question when you talked about what the market impact might be in the future if they, in fact, are expecting an easing If it doesn't materialize--or I guess even more importantly if they're expecting an easing and then something registers as a slight tightening--I would imagine there would be even more of a market impact  Right  Thank you  I'm for no change and, again, I'm trying to figure out what that is To me it's either ""B"" with $500 million borrowing or something between ""A"" and ""B"" anyway, with symmetric language The main reason I feel this way is that, as I read the economic statistics for the last couple of months, I think there are growing signs of some sluggishness or slowing, particularly in housing and auto sales The first-quarter figures for real GNP are expected to be revised downward, according to the staff's briefing yesterday The second-quarter [growth rate] is expected to be coming in below 2 percent, which I don't view as particularly strong Also, we've done quite a bit of tightening over the past year or so but I don't think the tightening moves--particularly those taken at the beginning of this year--have been completely felt by the real economy I think there's some chance that fiscal policy is going to move at least modestly in the direction of restraint As for the monetary aggregates, Don Kohn yesterday told me that I can start paying attention to them, so I'm going to; and I think they look sort of weak, both currently and looking forward, based on their growth from the fourth quarter of 1988 to date Also, I haven't heard a lot of discussion of it, but I'm very impressed with the terrifically strong dollar--the fact that it's at its highest in over two years I'd like to see some manufacturing survive in this country and, therefore, I would hope that we don't do anything ourselves to make [the dollar] still stronger Thank you  With $600 million? "
3835,1989-06-05,SEGER, I support your move for the reasons listed by Governor Johnson and also Governor Angell; I agree with all of those 
3858,1989-07-05,SEGER," I'll move it  SPEAKER(?) Second  Second  Second  National is--  I've been sitting here thinking that I need a new hearing aid because I can't believe the change in the comments today versus the FOMC meeting in May or, for sure, the one in March Either I needed the new one then and not now, or vice versa Anyway, as you know, I've been somewhat concerned about the slowing economy for a fair while So, it is nice to have some other people who are on board with the same concerns Where I depart from the staff forecast is over the next six months or so, for a couple of reasons One is that in the auto industry, I think for the first time in three or four months, we're going to find that the auto manufacturers actually have some latitude to adjust production As they got into the late stages of this model year they were locked in because they had made commitments to suppliers to take X amount of materials and, therefore, they carried through with their production plans; but now they are reaching the end of that run and we're seeing announcements already of extended shutdowns from model changeovers And this is sort of the  -30-    7/5-6/89  first round Then Chrysler, for example, when it starts up the new models at one of its plants, instead of putting two shifts on is going to put one shift on I think we're going to see a number of these things Instead of just holding production constant and trying to ram the sales through the system through the use of these various incentives--which made the dealers very, very unhappy--I think we're going to see more and more production cuts I realize that the auto industry is no longer as important a share of the US economy as it used to be, but in terms of explaining cyclical wiggles I think it's still rather significant Therefore, I think over the next two quarters what's going on there may be really rather significant  I got some numbers this morning that I'll just share with you because, on the one hand, they were interesting; on the other hand, they were rather scary to me Chrysler sent some surveys to their dealerships and what they have discovered is that 60 percent of the people coming into their dealerships were not able to come up with even the downpayment to buy a car That's sort of scraping the bottom of the barrel, as I see it One reason, of course, is that used car prices have weakened; and [that hurts] those who, when they had trade- ins, could forget the downpayment I find the [unintelligible] system working; the others don't necessarily have trade-in difficulty but they just don't have the cash on the barrel head And this includes, by the way, the opportunities to use cash rebates for downpayments; even with that availability, 60 percent weren't able to get a downpayment together Also, the number of people actually coming into their showrooms is down about 10 percent from a year ago And what they call the closure rate is down So, of the people coming in, the number who actually go through and make a purchase is way down--I don't know by what percentage Also, 31 percent of their dealers are now losing money versus under 20 percent last year Those that are still profitable, though, have seen their profits drop to less than half of what they were a year ago Jerry, you mentioned that tight money hasn't had the impact you might expect; I think you can see it in autos And it works through the dealers, as the dealers have had to pay 3, 3-1/4, or 3-1/2 percentage points more to inventory this tremendous pile of cars; that's real money to them because they are the ones, as John LaWare knows, who have to pay these financing costs General Motors doesn't, or Ford doesn't The dealers have seen these financing costs soar and that has increased their unhappiness with the situation; it has also increased the flow of gripes back to the auto manufacturers By the way, auto sales picked up in April when these incentives went in but since then, even with the most generous incentives in place--to me these are the most generous incentives since they launched incentives back in '86--sales are viewed by people in the industry as disappointing in both May and in the sneak preview of the figures for June that they had received just before I talked to them That's one thing that concerns me  The other sector where I'm a little more negative than the staff forecast is in housing; I believe the staff has housing starts hitting bottom this quarter and then starting to percolate up I would like to think they would turn around that quickly but I'm not really that convinced that they will Therefore, as I said, my concern is how we are going to make it through the next couple of quarters before we see some of the monetary changes work through, because I think the very slow monetary aggregate growth that we have had is having an impact and, unfortunately, that it is going to  -31-    7/5-6/89 -32-  continue to have an impact for a while Thank you very much; I hope we're lucky  I would support sticking with the current ranges and carrying them over into next year I would use the arguments I used last year at this time that there are uncertainties and that there is no great [harm] in carrying these over because we do have another crack at them As I think Mike Kelley said, it's better to present the appearance of stability rather than zigging and zagging However, if we are going to change them, the direction I would go in, frankly, is toward alternative I--for a couple of reasons One is that I hope we do get some additional M2 growth as interest rates come down Secondly, talking about base-drift, I went back and looked at this table in 1987 M2's actual growth was 41 percent, which was outside the low end of the range; that was followed by growth last year of 52 percent, which was within the range but below the midpoint; and so far this year M2 is growing below a 2 percent annual rate So, if we look at this over a longer period, it seems to me that there is some point at which maybe we ought to say we should be making up a little of this growth that we haven't achieved in the past and that we did think at the time was a reasonable objective So, I could go with either carrying the existing ranges forward or alternative I Thank you  Since some people outside follow the reserve aggregates--I realize we don't target them but they have [dropped] more than we expected, I believe, since last summer--how would you expect them to perform over the rest of this year?  But you do think the decline in the reserve aggregates would cease under alternative B?  I know your preference is to go between ""A"" and ""B"" but I think I would go all the way to ""A"" First of all, I don't think that a 50 basis point change in the fed funds rate is all that startling Going upward we went 50 and 75 basis points without even winking or blinking at all Also, I'm not so sure that all the markets have incorporated only a 25 basis point easing by us This morning I heard the early financial news on TV and some of the stock market commentators were talking about the impact of expectations of lower interest rates on the stock market Again, I don't know if these folks are right, but they were building the stock market story on substantial declines in interest rates Secondly, we heard all these pieces of evidence presented yesterday about the slowing in the economy, and I certainly agree with all those Frankly, I think that there's going to be much more slowing going forward, regardless of what we do today, because I don't think the actions today are going to impact the economy one way or the other for probably the rest of this year  Earlier we were talking about the importance of announcement effects; probably there are a thousand people in the country who know what we do at the FOMC, and maybe 500 of them know what the ranges are for monetary growth But there are 500 and some people down at the other end of Constitution Avenue who are going to be following what goes on in the real economy If the economy weakens even further and they start hearing from the folks at home about rising unemployment rates and so forth, then I'm sure our Chairman here is not going to be the man of the hour when he has to go down there and meet with them-- because I think they will wonder why we didn't see what was going on, or if we saw it, why we ignored it and didn't react So, as I said, I would prefer alternative A "
3884,1989-08-22,SEGER," I just have one question about profits As I've read some of these profit reports the last couple of weeks, basically, it just seems to me that for the second quarter of the year there are a number of very soft stories that came out Now, maybe they weren't  -17-    8/22/89  any softer than we expected; I don't know But I just wondered if in fact there is a significant deterioration showing up, particularly in the high-tech area That was the one that surprised me the most And I wonder if the aggregate numbers forecasted here are sufficiently weak to reflect that  I know you don't like me to look at quarterly numbers, but I'm going to do it anyway It seems to me on a couple of these quarters looking ahead that you actually show a slight increase in profits--for example, in the fourth quarter of this year I don't mean as a share of GNP; I'm just looking at the corporate profits with IBA and CCA adjustment  Yes, I knew that  Right  In the third quarter of next year, also, you have the decline stopping and a bit of a rebound--or more of a rebound than in the fourth quarter of this year  Don't you think, though, that this profits story is tied into the inflation numbers? Many of these higher costs-- whether they're wage costs or something else--because of the competitive environment are having to be eaten by the organization And where it's coming from is out of profits  In addition to just the cycle [phase]  Thank you  It hasn't yet?  Oh  Are you talking about cops?  I'll warn you that my views were colored by conversations with my brother last week who happens to be in the construction business I asked him how things were going and he said pretty good The latest big project he had signed on for was a new bankruptcy court in southern Arizona! Anyway, that aside, I do agree with the comments around the table about the deceleration that is showing; certainly, the Beigebook referred to it and the Presidents here have alluded to it, and a number of individuals I've spoken with suggest the same thing I have a little difference of opinion about where we're going I think we are going to see more slowdown, despite the fact that there have been some upward revisions and some surprises in certain of the statistics for the last month I don't think that establishes a new trend by itself A couple of things concern me greatly and one is in the housing arena Again, I realize that starts have shown some uptick the last two months but the real estate markets in more and more parts of the country are weakening Builder friends tell me that eventually that does show through to new construction It certainly impacts the attitudes of developers and builders Also, I'm sorry to be unduly cynical, but I have an awful feeling that when the RTC gets rolling they are not going to make this any better The markets are already having problems and I think the RTC is going to turn it into a worse disaster and probably create new problems where there weren't problems  Well, okay In the auto area, once these new 1990 models come in, if any people can be pulled off the streets into the showrooms to look at the cars, I think they're going to fall flat on the floor when they see the stickers I understand the adjustments that were made in trying to price the comparable options and accessories I understand all that technical stuff, but for the average person who walks in all they know is that the bottom line is that they are going to have to write a bigger check to get a car-- whether they want air bags or not they get them And I think that will discourage numerous people Also, there have been a lot of cars sold in the last 5 or 6 years and there doesn't seem to be any real demand stacked up that has been unfilled When I read that sales of light trucks are now starting to show some weakness, that gave me some concern because they have been extremely strong We had some plant closings announced in the area of heavy trucks--Si Keehn alluded to that One of the major producers of heavy trucks, had a pretty negative report out on what they were experiencing And I personally believe we're going to see some more of that looking ahead  -38-    8/22/89  Even using our own statistics on exports, it looks as if they are not going to be exceptionally strong I believe we're going to see less strength there because I'm not convinced by Ted that the dollar is going to perform as he thinks Even though we have the trade deficit reaching its low point in the second quarter of this year and then getting worse, I think it will probably get even worse than what we're showing Putting this all together, and also adding to it the concerns that Mike Kelley mentioned about the impact of a recession on many of our other problems, I certainly think we ought to be very, very sensitive to what's happening and to balancing these risks between inflation and recession--particularly when the inflation numbers do seem to be looking better I really believe that there have been some major behavioral changes out there in the real world that are going to help to make the inflation numbers come in even better than we're now talking about Thank you  I can support ""B"" if it has asymmetric language with the tilt toward some slight ease between meetings, because I do think that the economy is going to move in one direction or the other from where it is now and is slightly [more likely] to go toward the weaker side rather than the stronger Also, I'm convinced that we don't want the dollar to strengthen a lot more, even though it might produce good inflation consequences It would be very bad for our export industries and our ability to cut our trade deficit "
3910,1989-10-03,SEGER," I'll move it  Balance the budget, of course, Jerry  I just want to say two things, primarily because I've been one of the people concerned about the strong dollar--not because I don't like strong dollars on the face of it--but because I've been concerned about the impact on our manufacturers' ability to produce or to export But having said that, I don't believe the way to get the dollar down is to bomb it through intervention I think the best way to do it is to deal with it in a monetary policy way even though the [unintelligible] said we don't believe in that, I do In terms of Manley's concern over the possible market impact of this bombing effort, I think the reason we haven't seen it yet is that there are many people in the markets--maybe not in New York but in other parts of the markets--who really do think that there will be some monetary policy follow-up to this bombing And if that does not occur in the next couple of weeks, then I think we're going to get the bond market impact etc, in spades So you can write that down as woman's intuition speaking Thank you  What happens if they are not ratified?  Just abstain  Is that because  I thought he supported all expenditures that went into that area  Oh, excuse me  I can't worry about where we're going in two years because I don't think most of us can forecast even two quarters ahead let alone two years ahead Looking a couple of quarters ahead, though, I do think that the slowing that we have seen is going to continue What concerns me greatly is the weakness that I see in various manufacturing areas And the weakness in manufacturing, I think, is more serious than the overall weakness The Purchasing Managers' Survey for the last five months or so has indicated this slowing; I have other sources of information as well Just to repeat a couple of things that Si Keehn said about the auto industry using the current production schedules for the fourth quarter this will be the weakest fourth quarter since 1982 and you may remember that 1982 was not exactly a hot year for autos Even if you pick up the transplants which, of course, have become very big and very important over this last seven years, it still will be the slowest fourth- quarter production since 1982 Frankly, one of the reasons two or three of the auto manufacturers have announced incentives for their 1990 models even before they are readily available is that they are so nervous about the weak demand In some cases, they do not have enough orders even to start their plants running to produce the 1990 models So, I think the people who looked at the August auto sales numbers and read them as a sign of strength got the wrong message It was end-of- year close-outs that they really pushed It's just about 180 [degrees] away from a strong story; it's a weak story  Also, if interest rates actually perform as the Greenbook assumes--if short-term rates are basically flat during the year ahead and long rates rise slightly--I'd be very hard pressed to expect housing to improve Maybe I'm missing something and maybe consumers are interested in buying more, but the builders--at least in the builders' survey that I read--are feeling rather negative That's particularly true in parts of the country that have been alluded to here earlier The export situation really has to be watched I think the strong dollar that we have seen over much of the year, until the [unintelligible] began recently, has had an impact on export growth; I believe it's going to have an additional impact because there are long  -34-    10/3/89  lags involved here Also, there has been a rather significant deterioration in profits going on The IBM announcement a couple days ago of disappointing earnings in the third quarter and expectations of disappointing earnings for the full year, I think, is a great concern They have announced that they will offer early retirement to some more people, which is not exactly very IBM-like If you read the press release carefully, it mentions that the strong dollar was one of the things contributing to their deteriorating profits because of the translation problem--the profits that they are earning abroad and then bringing back into their consolidated earnings report for this country It's my personal observation that when a company experiences profit deterioration, that eventually impacts on its willingness and ability to expand and even to modernize dramatically So, I'm probably a touch more concerned than the average around the table And if the stance of monetary policy is what we're assuming in the Greenbook, then I think I would be a lot more nervous than the average here Thank you  I favor alternative ""A"" because I think we do need a slight degree of easing; actually, I believe the difference between ""A"" and ""B"" is basically a slight one  Yes I don't think the 25 basis points is going to pour rocket fuel into our engine Anyway, my main concern, as I indicated, is in the auto area and possibly in the capital goods area In regard to the impact on the foreign exchange markets, I think the demand situation there is one of great strength for the dollar, which is why we had to be in there doing this heavy intervening and selling of dollars along with the other central banks If we drop the interest rates slightly, then that would allow Sam Cross' people to take two days off and maybe that would be good So, I don't think that that would be a real danger Finally, just thinking back to our discussions here earlier this year about inflation, the actual performance of price indexes has been far better than any of us dreamed And I don't think the apparent shortages that were so worrisome are there now While I don't think inflation has gone away --and I say that so Lee Hoskins will understand--nevertheless, I don't think it is accelerating either So, I would be more comfortable with alternative A  I'm sorry, I meant 50  No, it wouldn't "
3959,1989-11-14,SEGER," I just have a couple of comments I think this quarter and the next two are probably going to be quite weak, possibly even turning in some red ink performance I believe the weakness will be centered in manufacturing--because we already have seen that--and also in construction to some extent Some of my contacts in manufacturing indicate that in their view manufacturing is already in a recession or within a gnat's eyebrow of being there To use autos as a specific example, I have been talking to people in the last few days in that industry and they are the most negative I've seen--not since 1985 or 1986 but since 1982 That is probably because production is running about what it was in 1982 While they expected a payback from the sales spurt in August and early September, which of course was a result of the very generous incentives, they didn't expect this much of a payback The very weak October and early November sales performance has come as an unpleasant surprise, at least to my contacts There were a couple of things I heard mentioned for the first time from these folks One was the complications coming from the weak financial condition of a number of the automobile dealers, including very large dealers The statistic given to me was that about half of the auto dealers in this country are losing money in 1989 We're not just talking about a small marginal group but a very major group And that tends to lead to an unwillingness to carry the same size inventories as previously because the dealers just don't have the wherewithal to fund it Therefore, at the moment you're seeing a very poor flow of orders to the producers from the dealers It's a combination of the weak consumer demand for cars and also the efforts of the dealers to cut back their existing inventory levels There are still apparently quite a few carryover 1989 [models] that they would like to dispose of but haven't been able to  Another interesting thing came up in the comments of He said a number of the dealers were  telling him that some of their would-be buyers of Cadillacs are saying that they are knocked out of the market at the moment because their ARM mortages had adjusted upwards and, even though they're ""in the bucks"" so to speak, they are finding their monthly payment going up-- these are people who don't live in shacks like I do--by $400, $425, or $450 and apparently that's just enough to discourage some of them from going ahead and buying a new automobile at the same time That's the first time I heard that comment Also, this unpleasant surprise is forcing a basic analysis of how much manufacturing capacity they really need Chrysler is looking at this and so is GM I think GM has four plants, although they haven't identified the exact four or five, that are going to be shuttered for good Believe it or not, we've been concerned about capacity constraints; well, on autos we've had excess capacity and new capacity coming on stream all the time So there are going to be these more permanent adjustments taking place--not in Roger's District; he's very lucky But the assembly  -24-    11/14/89  plant down the street from my old apartment in Detroit is getting it February 2nd So, I would change places with you if your business is too strong down there Also, I heard mentioned [by my contacts in the auto industry] concern over the strong dollar and what that is doing in the high-priced end of the market, particularly because expensive German cars are now coming into this country at sort of bargain prices And this is making it more difficult for the American manufacturers to compete with them Also, the rather feeble efforts of Chrysler to do some exporting of cars is now being impeded by the stronger dollar this year  Finally, I'd like to mention just a couple of things I've been picking up about construction and housing One is the sad impact of the FIRREA legislation on the ability of builders to get loans because S&Ls apparently haven't had the kinds of lending limits on individual loan size that banks have had Now with FIRREA they do; it's 15 percent of their capital So, a number of developers are having a hard time getting loans of the size they need to do these developments Also, the HUD parade of homes march is on and the competition from the foreclosed homes, at least in some parts of the country, is very significant And that is tending to keep discouraged builders from putting up new homes So, my personal feeling is that we're going to see further problems in both the manufacturing arena and in construction I hope I'm wrong We'll find out by fourth of July next year  I hate to be odd man, or woman, out again, but I feel fairly strongly that we are running the risk of a recession And if we are worried, as I am, about the waning strength of the economy going into next spring, say, the steps have to be taken now to influence it at that time because of the well known lags involved If I were convinced by my illustrious colleagues here that throwing us into the recession tank would solve our inflation problem I probably would vote differently But I don't see that a recession is going to offset the impact of unwise legislation--by our friends under the dome down the street here--that would put upward pressure on business costs I don't think that a recession is going to solve the medical care costs and the nursing shortage Maybe we ought to deal with recruiting more nurses and getting rid of some of the excess lawyers who are chasing ambulances and getting big settlements which are driving up costs and not try to deal with it through a recession These are the kinds of things that are contributing to inflation I have a hard time seeing at the moment that it's excessively strong demand and shortages of capacity So, having stated all that, I would prefer alternative A Actually, when I look at the difference between ""A"" and ""B"" as described here by Don Kohn it isn't as if the one is going to produce monetary growth double the other You're talking about really rather modest differences but sufficiently great, I think, to make a difference come next spring I would go for ""A""  It must be bonus time!  SPEAKER(?) It wouldn't be so bad "
3987,1989-12-18,SEGER," I have a couple of questions and a couple of comments First of all, in regard to using the Hoey Survey I know that you've all known him for a long time; I think if you administered truth serum to him he would be the first to tell you that this is a very shaky, flaky, sort of survey and he wouldn't want you using it as an indication of inflation psychology Although I understand the need for a number, that doesn't make it good Secondly, as I read through here, I'm trying to figure out the answer to the question Credibility with whom? What group is it that we're trying to impress or convince that we're committed to price stability? Frankly, if you get outside the Beltway, most people in America don't know who the President of the United States is! And fewer know who the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board is Other than 32 people on college campuses and 25 Fed watchers on Wall Street they have never heard of the FOMC  Well--  We sit here and assume that everybody is sitting on the edge of their chairs waiting to see what the FOMC does I hate to tell you this, but they're more interested in the Redskins football game yesterday  I don't want to be disillusioning; maybe I just come from an unsophisticated part of the country where they like football Also, when you had this list in Exhibit 1 of possible impediments to price stability, I agree about a jump in the world oil prices, fiscal policy miscues, etc But I'm more and more depressed by moves that are taken by governmental bodies that are inflationary that are not fiscal policy I'm thinking more of microeconomic things  I don't call that a supply shock putting in some regulation that has tremendous--  You would call the minimum wage hike a supply shock?  I guess to me a shock is something that just comes from out of the blue and not something that is legislated by people down the street here That is not the connotation  Okay Also, I couldn't sit here and listen very easily to the comments on the early part of this decade and how the disinflation costs were not that great Possibly from Washington, DC they didn't look that great; or if you were sitting with the security of a government job or a government paycheck, perhaps they didn't But I can tell you that there are a lot of people who paid dearly for that disinflation They lost businesses; they lost farms; they lost jobs, and they're still without them I'm not saying that the fight shouldn't have been waged; it probably should have Maybe nationally the cost was very marginal, but when two states assumed about the whole cost it looked a little heavy Also, in looking ahead at sacrifices, I think you have to be much more micro in your analysis and think far more about sectoral differences, because it doesn't all average out I can tell you--pardon?  I think that's something you have to look at, though  Well, [remember] some of the pieces of 2X4s that floated around this building that came in from builders in the early '80s! I think that suggests that at a certain point the sectoral burden gets a little heavy, and they speak out even if it's by flooding [us with] 2X4s Anyway, thank you It was a very interesting presentation  You'll find out next year  As long as they're all in Massachusetts!  I just realized as I sat here how old I'm getting because I took the first economic courses I ever took in the '50s, before any of you were born! But I will tell you what they were teaching then--especially Manley, pardon me  That's what I was referring to--1850! Seriously, first of all, in the '50s we were taught that deficit spending was not [only] okay but it was great because we had to prop up this weak kind of economy Secondly, some of the gurus of the day--people like Samuelson and Slichter--were saying that you needed to have inflation of 2 to 3 percent per year to assure prosperity Again, none of you remember this but you can go down to the library and pull out the books and check to see if I'm right  The other persons from [unintelligible]! Anyway, I think it does state something about how the pendulum has swung Frankly, as a conservative, I'm delighted to see this because I do believe in price stability I also remember the early 1960s; in fact, I worked in Washington in the early '60s when we got those quite good results with the inflation measures But the interesting thing, as I recall that period, was that it wasn't really planned It was like a eureka experience We got it and said ""Oh gee, isn't this nice!"" We had this good record thrust upon us, which we then of course lost in the mid-'60s with the escalation of the Vietnam War  Yes, but--  Yes, but we had better inflation performance in the first half of the '60s than we had in the late '50s Anyhow, my punch line in all this is that I think it's very good to state as a general objective that we want price stability And by price stability I mean just be that vague; don't say whether we want to cast the CPI for October in concrete and make that the base or whether we want to do something else Set a general target and move with our policies in that direction but without specific numerical targets because, as several people around the table have said, we're going to have this test every single week or every single month Even if we're making general progress, to the extent that we miss a specific target, the financial markets particularly are going to pick this up and run    12/18-19/89  with it and conclude that we're complete failures, whereas in fact we might be batting 800 instead of 1,000, which in most ball games isn't bad So, I would be opposed to setting specific targets or selecting specific indicators of inflation because I think it would be very counterproductive As to one of your points, Lee, about saying that we're going to impose price level stability even though maybe most people don't care about price level stability, these are value judgments And if we get too far our of line with what the people in this country want, it's going to be like the government of East Germany and you're going to be put out of office  Yes, but America is bigger than financial markets You know, we sometimes forget that The people who put governments in place are not all on Wall Street or in investment banking houses, etc Anyway, it's a very big challenge And I think we have made progress in going from the '50s when, as I said, it was sort of accepted and even thought desirable to have inflation So, something that's vague and general, in my judgment, would still make a contribution  He's on the other side of the--  -49-    12/18-19/89  Because they know they wouldn't win the debate!  I have a question Even though Mike can tell me never to ask about the quarterly distributions of economic activity, I'm sorry but I'm so confused that I'm going to have to ask anyway  -70-    12/18-19/89  In looking at the quarters for 1990, you have the strongest growth in the first quarter and--  Well, I think that's giving a lot [of weight] to both of those! As for the tremendous pickup in final sales from the present quarter to the first quarter, I hope that's accurate, but what if it isn't?  You have a big pickup in consumption expenditures on durables  Well, maybe that's where I should really part company with your forecast  I'm sure they're going to try the incentives We may talk to different people--we probably do--but I can tell you there's disappointment about the effectiveness of the incentives The bang for the buck seems to be less and less each year These incentives have been around for three or almost four years now And to show you how desperate things are, the incentives have been put on minivans by two of the Big Three, and minivans have been the stars of the universe in that they were selling quite well even when a lot of other models weren't As I said, I hope you're right; but I have a feeling that the first quarter is going to be weaker than what we're showing here  -71-    12/18-19/89  No What I'm worried about is--  The stories I hear are that the production schedules for the first quarter are written in pencil and are written very lightly  Thank you  We still have to live through these quarters-- quarter by quarter by quarter And those, in fact, produce the average for the model for the whole year  I have just a couple of comments First of all, I agree with the Greenbook statement that signs of substantial slackening in the pace of economic expansion have accumulated in recent weeks I think we're going to get more I'm particularly concerned about autos; the inventory situation is excessively heavy I think the days' supply is the highest level for the end of November in more than 10 years, which is quite a significant point I believe Given that we're going into the next quarter with this tremendous inventory and given the fact that the effectiveness of incentives probably is wearing off, I think we will get much more of the adjustment on the production side than on the side of higher sales We had the head of and what he and I discussed quite a bit was the impact of the liberalizing of debt terms on car sales some time ago That is coming back and biting the dealers because individuals who took advantage of those attractive terms earlier now find that they have no equity in the car They would like to get rid of the clunker--it's 3-1/2 years old--but they can't turn it in because they don't have the [equity] or the downpayment This apparently is a growing problem Also, he was talking about the financial health of the dealers That is one place where interest rates do enter in because the dealers have to pay the floor plan financing on all these cars; that isn't a gratuity from the auto manufacturers And that's a big part of their cost besides having to rent fields to park the cars in So I really believe that over the next couple of quarters we're going to see quite a bit of additional bad news from the auto industry; and I don't think it's going to impact just the Seventh District In fact, some of the announcements of plant closings have involved plants in places like Kansas and Georgia  And Delaware I figured I'd get at least a couple of the Districts!  I don't want to emphasize this too much In the area of housing, again, I'm very concerned As real estate markets have weakened around the country, my realtor friends tell me it's more difficult to move existing homes And for most people who are buying new homes, the purchase of the new home is contingent upon selling an existing home Therefore, that is a very major factor in the weakness of new home sales Again, the signals I get suggest that the real estate markets aren't about to improve dramatically soon, even in the Northeast Also, I pick up more and more comments about the fragility of the financial system, particularly from business people--people who are not in a commercial bank or an S&L, but who just seem generally nervous about what's going on And as Dick Syron said, there are more and more suggestions that this ultimately is going to impact the availability of credit, particularly for people who don't have a blue chip credit rating I was at a real estate conference out in balmy California a couple of weeks ago and there was substantial discussion there of the problems coming from the FIRREA legislation and what it's doing in the way of imposing lending limits on S&Ls The banks for some time have had limits on the size of loans that can be made to one borrower But with FIRREA extending that to S&Ls, it has become a big problem for contractors to get financing--at least the same way they used to get it So, there are a lot of things going on out there that in my judgment indicate that the risks--for sure for the next two quarters--are on the low side, the down side I hope I'm wrong, but those are my concerns Thank you  Maybe you didn't pay them on time!  I would support your suggestion of an immediate cut in the fed funds rate; in fact, I could even go for 50 basis points, but I won't be a hog and I'll settle for 25 As I said earlier, I think the risks are on the down side I don't see where the strength of the economy is coming from in the next two quarters, and beyond that I'm not sure what's going to provide the impetus for an uptick I'm very concerned about the financial fragility; I'm very concerned that so many people in the business world are sensitive to it It's one thing for me to be and it's another for them to factor that into their decisions And I do believe that lower interest rates would have an impact on the economy before six or nine months go by, even though it probably takes that long to get the full impact I think you would get some impact, particularly on the psychological side So that's my vote "
4015,1990-02-06,SEGER," John LaWare stole my script We're at the same end of the hall, so I'm a gloomy Gussie I will add just a couple of items to his sad tale One is that I really think the problems in the auto industry are more extensive and more permanent than a lot of people realize I don't think we're going to have layoffs for a couple of weeks and then a pop back If you look at even the transplant numbers carefully, I believe you'll see some adjustments For example, Mazda has cut back on its pace of production--and that's acceptable Japanese, not American junk So, I think one has to pay attention to that Also, I don't believe that the weakness in durables manufacturing is limited to autos Caterpillar Tractor, for one, is experiencing declines in orders from just about all categories of customers They are below the peak levels Also, appliances and [other durables], again these are not auto [unintelligible]  I'm getting more and more concerned about credit availability I think I mentioned a couple of meetings ago that part of [the stringency is due to] the overreaction of examiners; they are scaring the heck out of bankers But, in addition there's the problem in financing developers, and I mean the good developers not the scabby types They are having problems getting financing from the S&Ls and their old sources because of these limits on loan size [Regulators] have taken the national bank limitations and placed them on S&Ls and that's giving developers real problems I think we're going to see this impacting the housing numbers more and more Also, in certain parts of the country I think there is a problem simply in dealing with sick thrifts I've been going back and forth to Arizona to check on my mother and out there 60 percent of the S&L assets in the state are now under conservatorship When the grey panthers are talking about this kind of thing, you know it's a serious problem And dealing with the overseers at these thrifts and conservatorships is different from  -23-    2/6-7/90  dealing with other kinds of managements They have a different outlook Just the decline in real estate values is something that's very significant, and I don't believe it's going to go away soon Many of the gains in employment are in jobs like bankruptcy lawyers and ""undertakers"" hired by the RTC, etc So, I don't find all that growth an optimistic story at all I'm certainly not eager to see a recession but I really feel that over the next couple of quarters we're at risk I hope I'm wrong Thank you very much  No  I know that several times in the past we have taken into account how well we hit the targets in the previous year,  -26-    2/6-7/90  in terms of whether we should adjust for a miss Now, on M2 we came in about 1/2 percentage point short of the midpoint of the range Is that a close enough hit that it doesn't really enter into this consideration of what we set for '90?  I know we discussed this in the past without having an explicit policy for dealing with it Thank you  It was interesting to see these longer-term projections, but I'm extremely skeptical about our ability to get exact projections out that far In looking at the more near term, whatever ranges we select, we have to make sure first of all that the monetary growth we achieve fits in those ranges Secondly, I think it's very important to allow ourselves some maneuvering room in 1990 just in case the optimists here are wrong and the nervous Nellies are right about the strength of the economy in the next couple of quarters I was impressed by something that Don Kohn wrote on page 16 of the Bluebook which suggests that a 1/2 percentage point shortfall in aggregate demand in the first half of the year would require 7-1/2 percent M2 growth for the year in order to achieve the fourth-quarter level of real GNP in the staff forecast And it seems to me, if I'm  -35-    2/6-7/90  looking at these ranges correctly, that alternative II would not handle that So, I would like to vote for an alternative that doesn't even exist, which is the alternative I version of M2 (3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent) and then for M3 and debt I'd keep the tentative ranges that we adopted last July, just to give us running room through 1990 It doesn't mean anything in terms of my longer-term commitment to price stability  They're also not going to be held accountable  I would still prefer some modest degree of easing From where I sit or stand, I don't see that the slowdown that  -52-    2/6-7/90  we've had in either autos or housing is completely wound up and I do believe that some drop in interest rates, even modest, would help Looking at autos first, the dealers are very reluctant to add to their inventories One of the reasons is the cost of floor planning them One half of 1 percent may not sound like much to us here, but it's real money to those folks So, I think that would be significant I think that housing is very sensitive to the level of interest rates and that the credit availability issue is especially critical--not in financing Mrs Jones who wants to buy a condo but in financing the builders themselves That doesn't show up in these spreads between mortgage rates and T-bills or anything else because that's not what we're measuring We're talking about loans to contractors So, I think that somewhat easier conditions would help both of those industries  If we should tip the economy into a recession, Congressman Neal may still be holding hearings on the need for zero inflation but 434 other people in Congress in the House and 100 people in the Senate are going to be dragging us down there to explain why in an election year they're facing rising amounts of unemployment back in their districts And Congressman Neal--frankly, I don't know the characteristics of his district--may even get some calls Who knows? But I don't think there's that much at risk for this kind of move and it could help in the immediate future On the matter of inflation, I still maintain that we are not able through monetary policy to influence all of the sources of inflationary pressure and that we had better spread the responsibility for fighting inflation over more groups, including the folks under the dome down the street They do a lot of things that contribute to inflation and I don't see how we can offset here all the bad policy moves that come out of the Congress It may sound macho to beat our chest and pretend we can, but I think the cost to the economy of doing this is going to be very, very severe So, I vote for ""A"" "
4043,1990-03-27,SEGER," I'll move it  I just want to make sure I'm listening correctly to what you said about Drexel When a firm is a primary dealer do I understand that that gives us the authority to advise them on what they do in the area of corporate finance as well as securities? Is that what you're saying?  Right  Where do we overlap the SEC then? Isn't that their basic responsibility to oversee these firms?  Well, that's why I asked to see if I was understanding Peter's comment about junk bond financing correctly Because whether or not they choose to underwrite junk bonds is--  Second    3/27/90  I guess this is directed to Ted I still have a hard time accepting your idea that the dollar will depreciate, even though you're saying you expect it to depreciate less than you had expected a month or so ago I really can't go through this whole scenario and get a depreciating dollar to be consistent with a tighter monetary policy and rising interest rates I just can't seem to get that into my mind as something reasonable I hope you're right because, as you know, I have concerns about our ability to export-- little things like that! I don't have a problem with the outcome; I just am worried about the likelihood of getting it  I'm just nervous about the 7 percent advance in the dollar vis-a-vis the yen since our last meeting It reminds me how difficult it is to get these estimates right even over a short period of time  Thank you  Yes, but actual trade decisions usually are not based on the weighted average; they're based on movements in specific currencies and the arrangements between specific countries  Well, the weights are based on ancient history I think if you look through how they--  All I'm saying, though, is that when you look forward I believe you have to think in terms of a very micro analysis of the foreign exchange markets if you're going to think about what the impact is going to be on our country and our economy  Also, Bob, I think you'll notice that more of our trade is with countries such as Taiwan and Hong Kong, etc And the last I checked, their currencies were not picked up in the weighted average at all  No, I'm talking about that series we run on the weighted average; I didn't think they were in there Anyway, one final question for Mike With tighter monetary conditions assumed and rising interest rates and the FIRREA effect, how are we likely to get housing starts this year of about the same magnitude as last year?  Thank you very much  Coming up or going down?  Did you say auto employment is at a high in your District?  Thank you  You had a sneak preview?  Well, as I think I hinted with my questions earlier, I feel uncertain about the outlook and I hope that what's on these pages from the staff turns out to be right because I believe in having moderate growth I think it's important in many ways to have that happen But I would just like to tick off some concerns I have that I think are going to put these possible outcomes at risk I mentioned the first concern I have the dollar and the issue of whether or not it actually will decline in value relative to the other major currencies If it doesn't, I'm old fashioned enough to believe that that will have an impact on our trade situation on both sides of the equation And that, indeed, concerns me since we are counting on trade to help us, particularly in 1991 Also, despite the fact that  -35-    3/27/90  Russian tanks rolled into Lithuania, I think that we are still going to have some defense cutbacks and some actual cuts in the defense budget I personally don't know how that will play out; I don't know which contracts will be cut back or which bases will be closed, etc But I suspect that when that happens it will show up in somebody's District around the table here and also will impact the aggregates eventually  Also, there's the question of state and local government finance I hear more and more comments about the deterioration in state budgets from the Northeast to the Southwest--all over I met with a legislator from Michigan very recently and they're having to redo their estimates because they were too optimistic about the revenue forecast So, instead of having a comfortable situation, it now doesn't look comfortable I would think that ultimately that would impact either on spending by state and local governments or on their need to raise taxes, neither of which would be supportive of economic activity On the US budget situation, I heard the Rostenkowski name come up, but if we do get a tax hike I don't see that [unintelligible] Is that the correct assumption that you have not built in a tax hike in [your forecast]?  Well, if by some miracle it happens, I would assume it would have some sort of impact Also, I'm extremely concerned about the profit margin squeeze and what it will do; it's already going on and I think it will get worse In my judgment that will have a significant impact on plant and equipment spending of all sorts  Finally, with regard to the credit crunch matter, which we've heard about from a number of people, I think it is going on As Manley said, we talk to a lot of these banker groups that come through and we hear those comments; I also hear them from many business people I've observed recently that banks were even tightening terms on their home equity lines, which of course they have been practically shoveling out the door Now they're using a smaller shovel anyway Certainly, we are all hearing about the commercial lending tightness For auto loans, there's less enthusiasm for the [unintelligible] 6-year or the 5-year loan and the idea is surfacing that maybe you shouldn't make a loan that's longer than the life of the car So there's some tendency, at least among some lenders, to cut that back In the small business arena--I have a lot of friends who are small business people, including my brother--I'm not sure that what's going on is going to show up in the numbers we're looking at because so far a lot of the changes involve the terms or the fact that lenders expect personal guarantees If you have a small corporation they want your personal backing on a loan; there's this desire for extra security to protect the lender It is certainly making business people feel a lot more conservative and I would suggest in some cases rather nervous On the S&L side there's the FIRREA effect in the case of small and medium-size homebuilders and developers--I'm not talking about developers of big projects or major strip shopping centers but about homebuilders And I thought we had a housing shortage, at least in some parts of the country I think it's important to allow builders who have an active market to build those homes Yet these are the ones who are feeling the impact of this single-borrower limit that has  -36-    3/27/90  been imposed on the S&Ls to match the limit on national banks Frankly, I don't think we have much of that built into our housing forecast here And finally, in the case of the captive auto finance companies, they too have been tightening some of their terms and standards; and some of these marginal auto buyers are not going to be able to buy a car because they don't qualify under the new standards whereas they might have under the old, more generous, ones  Frankly, I don't know how all this will play out, but it's just a long enough list of concerns and question marks that I am uncertain and I wouldn't feel comfortable with a 90 degree swing in policy from where we are now I might [not] even feel comfortable with a 5 degree swing, even though I certainly am concerned about the inflation situation But I don't know how to pull out from these reported numbers what is transitory and what is really a fundamental change I'm really impressed with the degree of competitiveness out there in the real world I just don't think we can sit here and assume that every business can say ""Well, my costs are going up so tomorrow I'll just mark up all the prices of everything I sell"" They just don't think that the market conditions would [allow] that  Thank you  I would support your position of keeping policy at ""B"" with symmetrical language "
4075,1990-05-15,SEGER," I'll move them  I hate to sound like Ginny Dimwit today, but would you walk me through one more time the sectors that in the next two to four quarters would be taking off, or would be much stronger, with a status quo monetary policy? In other words, exactly which sectors are the ones that we have to restrain? I'm having a problem finding such sectors out there  I would just as soon see us export more, but that's a personal bias  Right  What amount of attention are you paying, then, to the availability of credit in the housing situation? I just hear so often that it's not the price of money or the price of credit as much as it is strictly unavailability  Thank you I hope you're right  It isn't Massachusetts any more?  John LaWare gave my talk, so I'll just piggyback on his Thank you  He's also about ready to retire  I would support your position of ""B"" symmetrical I don't think the condition of the economy is that clear Also, I'm very concerned about the fragility of the financial system I'm not just talking about the credit crunch angle, although that's part of it But there are many, many financial institutions out there--S&Ls and banks alike--that are pretty shaky, and there are more on the list of those that will be getting shaky I would like to support Si Keehn's point about the timing If we tighten today, the day of the budget summit, I think we'd look like we had no sense at all So, all that means that I would support your position "
4101,1990-07-02,SEGER," Move it  I'll move it  Somewhat related to Jerry's question How likely is it, if Congress goes for expenditure cuts on the budget and higher taxes, that that actually would produce a larger deficit because the impact of that fiscal restraint would be to slow growth even further?  And you think the timing would work out and all that?  My second question relates to what I thought I heard you say when you were talking about housing starts I believe you said that you thought the credit availability problems for builders were a one-shot phenomenon I hope that's true, but I'm not sure  Right  Thank you  The people are blase or the outside--  I have a couple of comments First of all, I do agree with Mike and the Greenbook that the economy is sluggish In fact, I would even use the word ""weak"" to describe some sectors I'm pleased to see some of the estimates getting down more in my neighborhood, which is a very low number for economic growth this year  -25-    7/2-3/90  and no growth next year Maybe I'll have some company for next year as well  I will note just a couple of concerns that I have Autos have been mentioned quite a bit, and I too was surprised by the announcement in today's Wall Street Journal about price hikes I checked with two friends of mine, including one who is  and his explanation was that they added on to the sticker so they can give bigger incentives I'm not a marketing person, so you can explain to me later whether that makes sense It still has a negative impact as far as the public is concerned And I don't think it's too bright, especially when some of these same people have been telling me for some time that there has been a problem with sticker shock, particularly in parts of the country where income levels are a lot lower than they are around Washington So, that's a problem Also, the consumer debt load is a growing problem and the auto companies have been having trouble getting some of the would-be buyers qualified to get loans even by their own captive finance companies You would think that they would bend over backwards to get the sale made, but I think that says something On the credit availability side, I picked up some comments that some of the dealers themselves have been kicked out of commercial banks for their floor planning So, credit availability is entering into autos in that way rather than on the individual consumer side I talked with people at has been expected to fill this void by providing funds for floor planning; but because of their own problems, they're not always able to do that And a growing number of car dealers are having financial difficulties, to the point of going bankrupt The number of dealers going bankrupt in the first 6 months of this year is equal to the number that went into bankruptcy in 1987 and 1988 combined and is 50 percent above the number that went bankrupt in all of 1989 So, I think this is getting to be a serious problem and it [unintelligible] in a couple of ways One is that they are not going to be around to make sales; the second is that they're unwilling to come up with a good order stream because they're just so stretched themselves that they cannot afford to carry decent-sized inventories Everything I heard I don't view as a temporary phenomenon--something that's going to go away in the next couple of months, unfortunately Then, of course, the auto makers have the UAW to negotiate with I can't get anybody to admit, by the way, that they're adding to production in order to stockpile; that just does not seem to come through In fact, what I hear more is that they're having a hard time getting enough orders from dealers to do their build out just so they can handle the production for which they already had ordered parts and supplies  Another area I want to say a few words about is housing I probably deal with less-than-spectacular builders, but I don't think the problems are all going to be resolved in a hurry--particularly in smaller towns I don't believe that it is easy just to walk out and find alternative sources of funds Even though it would be nice to assume that, that doesn't seem to be the case A person  just called me this morning from California with another whole raft of stories about small and medium-size builders who are having problems getting financing In some cases they are builders of single-family homes; others are builders of small apartments--10 to 12 unit apartments, not the big ones by developers who have been engaging in all sorts of wild extremes I would like to think that housing  -26-    7/2-3/90  starts have bottomed out, Mike, but I'm not necessarily convinced that that's the case  Finally, on inventories, even though the aggregate numbers may look pretty good, there are growing examples of firms in the retailing industry, and to some extent in manufacturing, whose inventories are creeping up above where they would like to have them So, these are the areas that I'm most concerned about at the moment In looking ahead for 1991, my problem is that I can't see what's going to give this rather sad-sack situation a boost and turn it around, particularly with the talk about the tax hike I had the TV on yesterday and it seemed to me that every program--every one of these ""Face the Nation"" kinds of shows--was going into this subject of the tax hike and President Bush breaking his pledge of no new taxes You would have to be deaf and a low-grade moron to have missed this And I think that is going to have a real impact going forward  On inflation psychology, I talked to the head of a big paper company and I'll just tell you what he said because I remember a year or year and a half ago paper was one of the industries that we worried about having shortages of capacity and that were passing out price hikes with abandon Anyway, he said that they have ample to excess capacity at the moment and that there's nothing in the way of price increases either in the works now or on the horizon Many prices of this particular producer are actually well below where they were a year ago and at the moment some prices are still declining He thinks the rest of 1990 and 1991 should be [a period] of price stability for their whole industry, not just for his company There has been new capacity added in the last year, year and a half, and there is going to be more coming on all the way through 1991 which, of course, will make it still tougher just to pass through any higher costs From his point of view inflation is not a big problem, and he doesn't hear other business people that he speaks with mentioning inflation as a big problem either He thinks the so-called inflation psychology is much more evident in the financial community than in the manufacturing arena And I think he's probably right Thank you  Is he in the Senate?  Well, like everybody else here, I think it's great to be a long-range thinker and strategist I'm also looking backward 6 years to the first Humphrey-Hawkins meeting I attended in 1984 Just to remind you folks, we had an M2 range of 6 to 9 percent and we have brought it down to 3 to 7 percent, which is quite a significant change The actual M2 growth ran 77 percent for 1984 and we are estimating it at around 3-1/2 percent this year I think that's very significant Also, these ranges have been moved down very consistently; we haven't had them popping around like popcorn, and I think that's good also On M3 we went from a 6 to 9 percent range down to where we are now, 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent, and the actual growth went from 10-1/2 percent down to an estimated 11 percent this year I'm just mentioning this because there has been a very significant amount of squeezing out of liquidity in the economy over that period So, having pointed that out and looking ahead with respect to the strategies, I'm a baseline strategy supporter With all due respect to the forecasters, I'm just not convinced, looking out 5 years at the additional inflation relief we would get from going the tighter route, that it's worth taking a chance on I realize that's a value judgment; but it's the way I feel I'm also not convinced that tightening policy will generate greater growth out in 1995 So, I would go with strategy I  In terms of the ranges for 1990, I've never supported changing the ranges in the middle of the year; I just don't think it's  -39-    7/2-3/90  a good idea I believe that these ought to be set with some idea of stability and [we should] just keep moving them downward; we can pause [in implementing the] decline, but I just think it's very disruptive to have too much volatility in the ranges themselves So, I would be for keeping the ranges where there are, including the M3 range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent And instead of just dismissing this [shortfall] as a technicality because of RTC activities, I think a big part of the credit crunch story is in here Maybe we ought to look at this and ask ourselves whether we should be satisfied with a 1 percent increase in M3 for 1990 If many people up on the Hill are continuing to get letters from their unhappy constituents, they might be asking that same question or a similar one So, I would support keeping the same ranges for this year that we established earlier And for 1991, I also would keep the same ranges for the main reason that we have another crack at these in February There are a lot of uncertainties about velocity and the economy in general--the RTC activities and a whole lot of other things Therefore, there's something to be said for hanging in there with the existing ranges and then, with six months' additional information and knowledge, if we're off we can adjust them at the next Humphrey-Hawkins meeting Thank you  Five to five  Obviously, you know that I'm in favor of easing I'm just sitting here trying to decide what we gain by doing it in a couple of weeks rather than now I'm thinking about the lags that I thought I had been taught about by Don Kohn and his pals Whatever we do today or in two weeks or three weeks is going to impact the economy some time in the future, not immediately The way I read the economy, I'm not sure we have until Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve to have some stimulus actually being felt The employment numbers are not my favorite numbers, but I do read them As I remember, in the April and May statistics the whole show was the hiring of temporary workers by the Census Department And from what I've seen previewed, those folks are leaving; a lot of them--something like 160,000--left in June That number came from Barbara Bryant who heads the Census; it isn't something I just threw out That's going to have an impact on the employment numbers again and not a very good impact Some more of these folks are going to be turned out on the street in July So, I think we're going to get some weaker employment numbers as we go along here Also, I read the retail sales numbers as weak I don't think we have had three months in a row [of weak data] that have been flukes or aberrations; I think there's something going on there I hate to repeat myself unnecessarily, but I believe that this so-called credit crunch has had a big impact on construction in many parts of the country; it's worse certainly in some parts than in others, but it's not confined to New England or Arizona And I don't think that is over as an influence I also believe that lower interest rates amazingly would help the strength of the financial system; it would provide some of the marginal institutions a better chance to make it because it would allow them to get a lower cost of funds rather promptly and improve their margins And I think we need to do that very swiftly I would argue that lower interest rates would help even on the liquidation of the S&Ls by the RTC So, I certainly agree with your notion of some ease, but if I wanted to split hairs--which I won't do; I will support your position--I would feel more comfortable doing it sooner rather than later "
4124,1990-08-21,SEGER," I have a different question about what I guess I would call a worst-case scenario or ""what if"" games Did you try in your model to see what the impact would be if we had one of these horrendous sequesters that I hear kicked around town--if they knock off $100 billion and send pink slips to the federal employees and things like that?  What is the decision date for this? Is it by October 1 that something has to be done under Gramm-Rudman? Is that the magic time?  With the existing Gramm-Rudman law, what would it take to derail it? Is it a forecast of two quarters of real GNP growth below 1 percent?  My second question in regard to worst-case scenarios involves oil prices Having remembered the difficulties of the 1970s and 1980s in getting even the direction of oil prices right, what would be the impact on the economy of, let's say, a tremendous additional acceleration in oil prices to $35 a barrel because the Iraqis also take over Saudi Arabia or some other major producer? Have you tried any of these scenarios in your model? I'm not saying these are terribly likely outcomes or high probability assumptions but--  -13-    8/21/90  What else could we face that would throw our forecast into the trash can?  Trash can is more appropriate  Well, thank you for playing my game with me  Iraq really needs it, doesn't it?  Every time I come to one of these meetings I am reminded of how difficult it is either to analyze the economy currently or to forecast it This time we've just come through a period of having received these major revisions in the GNP numbers which, at least as I read them, show that we had weaker growth last year than most of us thought we had had Also, the numbers for the first two quarters of this year look rather weak In doing our forecast, I think the uncertainties are really tremendous I mentioned a couple of them in my questions for the gentlemen at the end of the table primarily, the impact of the Middle East situation,  -31-    8/21/90  the budget summit or what might come out of the summit, or how Gramm- Rudman will work and whether or not we'll have a sequester All of those are key unknowns in our forecast I certainly don't pretend to have any answers that are any better than anyone else's It is interesting for someone who has been rather concerned about the signs of weakness in the economy, as I have, to be able to add some more indicators to my list this summer A number of them have been mentioned, so I won't repeat them Also, I think it's interesting that the US Chamber of Commerce has now come up with, and made public, a recession forecast for this year Solomon Brothers economists also are now forecasting a recession  As I compare my own views with the Greenbook presentation, there are a couple of things I would mention One is the area of consumer spending I'm somewhat more negative about that than our official forecast, primarily because of the debt situation Consumers are really loaded up to their eyeballs, I would argue And I think this Middle East mess and what that's doing to consumer confidence is going to result in a chance that their debt problems may even worsen with defaults and delinquencies and those sorts of things Also, I never hear anyone mention the impact of these declining real estate [values] on consumer spending John LaWare and I have talked about it in the past as an influence on the health of the banking system and S&Ls, etc But for the average person, at least the average person I know, the equity in their home is the biggest single item on their personal balance sheet And when the bombs dropped on the values of those homes--they actually are facing declines in real estate values in many parts of the country, except maybe where Bob Parry lives--it made them feel more poor I think that is a bigger impact on the consumer sector than the October 1987 stock market decline The latter impacted people who owned equities, but a lot of other people didn't even know there was anything going on on Wall Street I think the decline in real estate values is far more serious to the consumer and will be a future influence on consumers' willingness and ability to spend  Also, I'm somewhat more concerned about housing and other kinds of construction because I don't think the financing problems that are out there in the real world have been fully reflected in our statistics, particularly the needs of contractors to locate funds to do their construction work I know we've discussed the credit crunch primarily in the context of banks, but it also relates to S&Ls and to the closing of S&Ls and to the limits on loans to a single borrower That is coming in through the back door and impacting on the construction of single-family homes, multifamilies, etc I'm also more concerned about what's going on in state and local governments and their budgetary problems I think we're likely to see either cuts in their expenditures or still more hikes in their taxes We've already seen numerous instances of that but it wouldn't surprise me to see still more And that, of course, impacts those folks who have to pay the tax bills  In terms of why I would just as soon not let us go into a recession, the fragility of the financial system is certainly the big part of that I'm sure that the problems that already exist would be made much, much, much more difficult And a recession would make the US budget far more difficult to deal with and would make the budget deficit much, much bigger As for inflation, if you could guarantee  -32-    8/21/90 -33-  me that a trip through the wringer would cut our inflation rate in half, I might sign on for the ride But I haven't heard anyone try to make that argument Consequently, I am unwilling to take the risk of a recession to get what may be a very modest cut in the inflation rate So many of the sources of inflation that I see are just out of our reach, period--whether it's an action by government or whether it's something that has to do with OPEC or Mother Nature, etc I think we have some impact but we certainly don't have complete control So, I hope that we can come up with a good decision today--one that will help to keep us out of a recession if we're not already in one, though be responsible on the inflation-fighting side  I know these are very tough times and it's difficult to come up with accurate forecasts and it's difficult to make good policy And I appreciate your point about the need for stability and the need for some sort of anchor in Washington or something that is viewed as an anchor But having lived on a river for 13 years, I remember that even boats that are anchored move a little; otherwise the line snaps So I think we could move a bit and not be viewed as either irresponsible or reckless and also that it wouldn't turn the financial markets on their ear In fact, it seems to me that a modest move--to me 25 basis points is modest--would offset some of the availability problems that I see in the credit markets And at the same time it would make it easier to do further modest moves in the future as we see the need So my preference would be for some sort of a move that would resemble ""A""  -43-    8/21/90 "
4144,1990-09-07,SEGER," This is Martha Seger Even though I probably have a little dimmer view of the overall economy than the average view, I still would support the Chairman's position today to do nothing, mainly because I'd like to break the link between the BLS employment report and our actions I think we have made that link too apparent to the markets So even though I think, as Tom Melzer said, that the time will come in the not too distant future that we'll want to ease, I would rather not do it on the day of the release of this report Also, I'd like to make a significant enough move so that it really has an impact "
4165,1990-09-17,SEGER," I'll bring up the rear and vote with John LaWare and Ed Boehne, probably because in the last week I met with some of Ed Boehne's bankers from Pennsylvania along with a lot of other people I feel that the negativism is getting to be a very big problem in and of itself; the [negative] talk is just tremendous out there In New York I talked with some brokers, and they are seeing many of their customers pulling funds out of equities in the stock market and going into money market funds So, this is not money that's going to be supporting some big spending spree; it's money that people are scared about--they are escaping to something that's perhaps safer So the money market funds are a parking lot; therefore, I don't view this increase in the monetary aggregates as a sign of strengthening but rather just the opposite Also, there is tremendous concern about the overall health of the financial system, not just S&Ls but banks as well I had two days of meetings with small business people in Chicago and heard again the very negative feelings Many of the business people feel that they are in a recession at the moment it's not a forecast, it's a fact for them individually And frankly, I think they need some encouragement Also, there's more and more talk about the spreading credit crunch And it is no longer just from bankers who are complaining about being roughed up by the regulators and particularly by the examiners I think that the credit crunch actually is getting worse and that, as Jerry Corrigan said, we probably have not seen the end of it  Finally, in connection with the budget negotiations, I think we're really inviting trouble to tie our policy moves to what Congress does or does not do, because by delaying we will either produce a recession or, if we're heading into one anyway as some people argue, we'll just make it worse Whichever way it is, we're going to sabotage the efforts of those budget negotiations because a recession itself is going to make those numbers worse regardless of what kind of deal they strike I personally don't feel comfortable arguing that the existence of the negotiations is a reason to delay a decision So, as I said, I would support John LaWare's position that we don't have a lot to gain by delaying and that we should be easing I think much of a modest easing is already discounted in the foreign exchange markets and that that's one of the reasons we have seen the dollar decline in the last month or so That would be my position "
4189,1990-10-02,SEGER," I'll move  I'm just sitting here listening to Peter and Don talk about this fed funds fixation and the problems [that creates] Are you sort of making the case for prompt release of our minutes? Maybe that would fix it so we could tell people what we're doing rather than make them try to read it from entrails  It would still give them more guidance than they now get where they just really are flying by the seat of their pants  Maybe the Greenbook--  Well, I think we need to give them some more guidance so they don't have to hang on every basis point change [in the funds rate] and try to equate that with a policy move  [That's] why we need to tell them what we're doing  I'm back on my housing kick If I'm reading this page correctly, you are estimating housing starts for this present calendar year at 12 million, going down to 115 million next year, with this present quarter actually being the low quarter--although the next quarter is going to be about the same It surprises me that we see this downturn ending so quickly--unless you're a lot more optimistic than I am about the credit situation, which, obviously, you are  Mike, how about this heavy flow of horrible publicity about real estate problems, such as the latest Newsweek cover story If you [don't] own a house, it seems to me you'd get a slight case of cold feet about buying one because it practically guarantees a big loss on your investment, whereas a few years ago practically everyone--especially around this area--who stepped into the housing market expected to make a killing  Isn't that right?  Yes, a bleeding signal  It's small, but it involves a lot of small business people who write their Congressmen  I'm not; it makes no sense here  Thank you  I have just a couple of comments about two industries I've been following closely in the last several months One is autos Quite a bit has been made of the fact that deliveries in August and September have looked pretty healthy, and that has been used as an indicator of consumer spending not falling into a sewer  -31-    10/2/90  someplace What I picked up from some analysts within the industry were two things (1) that the seasonals are atrocious because the auto industry no longer has the regular seasonal swings that it used to, so that applying the seasonal factors that we do doesn't make a lot of sense; and (2) that the auto sales and these deliveries statistics really were distorted this time Si alluded to it, but didn't expand on it They were distorted by fleet deliveries, but these are fleet sales that are controlled by the auto companies themselves, primarily to car rental agencies All of the Big Three own car rental agencies and they use deliveries to them to sort of cook the books, if you want to say that They can more or less determine what kind of sales statistics they want to report by getting either more orders placed or fewer orders placed for their car rental subs And there was an exceptional amount of that done in September for a couple of big reasons One is that they simply didn't have enough orders coming from the traditional sources--purchases by folks like you and me--to get their assembly plants cranked up They needed to get more strength in orders, so they chose to provide it in that way Also, there is this continued push in the industry for market penetration There's a real horse race out there It's as if nobody wants to blink and no one wants to cut back and run the risk of cutting their market share statistics still more So, they are really trying to hold their production up Then there are the rating agencies--Moodys and Standard and Poors--and those folks are really checking carefully on the Big Three these days with threats of downgrading their debt obligations Apparently important factors considered are production and market share as an indication of future viability So, that's another factor entering in Anyway, I was warned by two different people that these statistics should not be taken at face value at all Also, I got an interesting statistic on showroom traffic, which would be the kind the consumer would usually think of; it has dropped substantially to about 15 percent below a year ago And what they call the closure rate, or the number of deals that are actually closed as a percentage of the individuals they deal with, has dropped by 20 percent just in August It was pointed out to me too that inventories are building and that the auto inventories themselves are probably about 4 days above normal and that truck inventories are getting up to about 20 days more than the dealers would like to have  Another industry that I was probing Mike on is homebuilding, because I've been talking to a lot of homebuilders in the last couple of months, and there really is a problem out there The financing situation is getting more and more attention; it started out as an S&L problem in the form of limits on loans to a single borrower but now it has spread way beyond that We are hearing of more and more homebuilders failing and closing their businesses or liquidating, etc Small business groups in general, I think, are showing a lot of nervousness They seem very negative Retailers who are in the small business category seem to be very cautious about their Christmas orders Again, as Bob Boykin said, small businesses always have gripes about getting credit, but I've never heard them as loud as they are this time because now they're talking about having had credit but then the lines were cut So, this is a little different from lack of availability initially And these credit availability problems are way beyond small business Again, we're hearing it from businesses of all sizes and in many different industries  -32-    10/2/90  So, I wouldn't be surprised to see the couple of negative quarters that are shown in the Greenbook I guess what I would be surprised to see is the kind of snapback next year that the staff is assuming I'd like to see it but, frankly, I doubt that it will happen  I think it's a holiday  Because they're scared to death of the stock market  I certainly support an easing move, basically because of the spreading weakness in the economy that I think was apparent even before August 2nd, the credit crunch situation, and the fragility of the financial system that doesn't seem to be getting better My preference would be for something called maybe ""A*,"" which would be an immediate 25 basis point cut reflecting those concerns, to be followed by another 25, which would be the reward to the boys on the Hill for doing the budget "
4214,1990-11-13,SEGER," I'll move  SPEAKER(?) Second  May I just ask one question?  When you alluded to the pressure being put on mutual funds to improve the quality of their--  I figured you meant bank CDs and commercial paper Is that correct?  I guess I didn't realize that the SEC has the authority to manage accounts I thought that the primary purpose of the securities laws required--well, that it was not to tell the managers what to put in their portfolios  But still, they will come back up and make financing problems for the issuers of those--  They figure that out  They'll all be on Christmas vacation so they won't notice!  Can I just ask one question? I think you said we've had this exact sentence since 1982 How many times in that 8- year plus period has the fed funds rate deviated more than 4 percentage points between meetings? It cannot be often  I can't think of one myself  But, Roger, that's not true of the suppliers That's the Big Three aspect Between the sub-benefit and the unemployment benefit the auto workers come up to around 95 percent But everybody who feeds into the auto industry--those producing widgets and nuts and bolts and all those things--is not necessarily that protected  -21-    11/13/90  At the beginning of the year when I was trying to get Mike Prell to tell me why I couldn't see the strength in the economy, he sort of suggested kindly that I needed new glasses So, I just wanted you to know that I went to the ophthalmologist two weeks ago and got an exam and a prescription for new strong lenses And now that I can read the numbers they look worse! But seriously, I do get concerned about the numerous signs of weakness in the economy I agree with the staff forecast that we should look at things more modestly than we have been I hope that the weakness doesn't turn out to be still worse than the staff is showing in the Greenbook forecast Business is so bad that I noticed that George McGovern, innkeeper, filed for bankruptcy; maybe that's not a function of the economy but more a function of his competence Also, Lipton is closing a teabag plant in Texas And Mr Forrestal's Peachtree Center in the Sun Belt of Atlanta is being foreclosed on I understand by Equitable So, there are some pretty scary pieces of news around Also, the regional sales numbers really bothered me simply because two major chains that are pretty strong financially showed sales in October that were actually below year-ago levels Even Nordstroms, which is considered a rather superior place and operates in the boom part of the United States that is Bob Parry's District, is talking in less optimistic terms  I'd also like to put in my two bits worth on the auto situation I believe what has happened is that the auto sales figures that are reported really are distorted by deliveries of police cars and cars for corporate fleets, etc Most dealers don't see those deliveries; they go through just a handful So, the average dealer is looking at a showroom which is devoid of much traffic People who do come in are not eager actually to close the deal And the dealer looks out the back door and sees all these cars on the acreage that are not being sold and he is paying interest to carry them So, I think there's good reason for most dealers to be very negative And they are the ones who have to send orders in to the manufacturers or the manufacturers don't have enough to keep their plants running I think that's what is driving these decisions They are not made unilaterally by the car producers; they are based on the orders received from the people out in the so-called trenches If you look at inventories that way, we are not in as good shape as the aggregate figures might suggest  I'm more concerned about the housing situation I think than Michael is, mainly because housing under construction is the sector that really is taking the brunt of the credit crunch, if you care to call it that Also, I think there is going to be a growing problem    11/13/90  coming from state and local governments Now that the elections are over we're going to see some more honest statistics presented They looked pretty bad even before the election, but now that that's behind us I think we're going to see still more states [and cities] that are in not very good condition Mr Boehne's Philadelphia is the greatest basket case, but it's probably going to have some competition  Exactly, the Rotten Apple! Those are some of my concerns Putting this all together, I would love to believe the staff forecast and would love to accept the idea that the improved oil price situation will turn the economy around in a couple of quarters But because I don't believe that the oil price hike is the main problem, I'm not as convinced that having oil prices behave well will turn things around I really think we are going to have to deal with this fragility in the banking system and the credit availability situation or we are going to have something that none of us has seen before Thank you  I'll support it, although I wish we could go 50 basis points, maybe just based on my having a negative-- "
4252,1990-12-18,SEGER," Gretchen, I've always wanted to know how much of the activity in the foreign exchange market involves corporate positioning as opposed to traders who work for money center banks I know that many multinational corporations are having to get involved with foreign exchange more and more as a byproduct of their real work Do you have any sense of how that proportion would fall out?  What made me think of it was that I was talking to a friend of mine who is a corporate treasurer and he was saying that in their shop, which is a very major company, they now have at least one person in the treasurer's office 24 hours a day monitoring what is going on around the world not only because of general interest but also because of their foreign exchange situation That's what made me think that maybe corporations as whole, particularly multinational ones, are more involved than they used to be, say, 10 or 15 years ago  Thank you very much  You mentioned the reserves that institutions would need for clearing purposes and that, obviously, the required reserves also have served that purpose to this point  Who actually will be determining that number? Is that a bank matter? It's not a monetary policy matter  Well, I understand that But I just wondered if the people within the Federal Reserve who are so concerned about the daylight overdraft issue are also going to get involved in setting the numbers or if it would be driven strictly by managerial [decisions]  I have a question that relates to Bob Parry's question involving the relationship between the discount rate and the fed funds rate and also the very low level of borrowing It seems to me that a big part of the so-called reluctance of banks to borrow could be explained by that If you can get fed funds for about the same rate as the discount rate why go through the hassle at the discount window? [Unintelligible] your favorite desk a call We probably will see borrowing go to zip, if we let the fed funds rate and the discount rate coincide  Yes, but I may know an atypical group that has made money--  So move  I'll move that also  That's an improvement down 40 to 50 percent?  Just so you'll know, I'm crying not because of the outlook but because I have a virus in my eye Last night when I was reviewing the staff forecast one more time I was reminded of something in my childhood Although it was a long time ago I do remember a few things from it! My mother always read to me every night and I had a strong preference for stories that had ""they lived happily ever after"" kinds of endings I feel the same way about the forecast I really do love the ones that are positive, optimistic, and happy So, I have no problem [with the forecast] And that's why I would remind you that at the beginning of the year, when we had the soft landing scenario which was marvelous because it accomplished all our goals with no pain, no strain, no sweat, that was terrific But it sounded too good to be true and what I have discovered is that if things sound too good to be true there is often a problem So while this forecast isn't [unintelligible] scenario, it still isn't a dismal forecast I hope that what is in the Greenbook turns out to be right But I'll just mention some of the questions I have about the numbers, even though, as I said, I hope that Mike's and his staff's assumptions are on target rather than mine  First of all, I really sense that whatever it is we're in now--I call it a recession--it's going to be longer and more serious than the Greenbook suggests One thing I'm more concerned about is consumption As you know, I've been taking a more dismal view of the auto industry for some months now, and I think that some of my concerns are [now] rather evident to the public at large And I don't see what is going to turn that around really quickly Also, in the consumption arena I am concerned about the nature of the layoffs that we're seeing around the country; it's not just Joe on the line at the Rouge, the blue collar types I used to assume would be laid off But that didn't have the same impact as when the sales vice president of some company who lives next door loses his job or a bank president loses his job or in some states bureaucrats are being laid off That sends a different message and I think it's having a big impact even on the people who are still working  Also, there is the deterioration in confidence I'm from a state where confidence is usually negative because the state's economy is very cyclical, so I'm used to a lack of confidence and nervousness and all that But I've never seen anything like what I'm seeing now And I'm not confining my remarks to Michigan at all; it's widespread and is impacting ordinary individuals who just have this feeling that something isn't right They don't necessarily know what it is that's wrong, but they just feel uncomfortable I know that it's nice to assume that that's a fallout from Saddam Hussein and the higher gasoline prices and the worries over availability of oil, but my sense is that if all those things were taken care of [unintelligible] this afternoon and whatever it takes to solve this problem were done, this would not go away completely Also, you don't hear much about it, but there is a real problem with the consumer debt load I used to nag our researchers about looking at the consumer debt load and was told that the two sides of the balance sheet were okay--that the assets were building at the same time as the debt load was, so forget it But it is a problem now, at least for a lot of individual consumers And I think some of the delinquency and loan write-off data suggest that In fact Sunday night I happened to have my TV on and one of the  -22-    12/18/90  PB evangelists came on and his wife was announcing that in January they're going to run some seminars for their parishioners to tell them how to get out of debt in 1991 Now, that says something to me It has even become a moral issue!  Also, we are being hit by very much higher taxes in this country I realize we've just seen a nickel a gallon increase on gasoline so far, but that budget deal has a lot more coming up That may help the budget deficit, but I don't think it's going to be a positive for consumer behavior And at various state levels, there are substantially higher tax hikes down the pike We saw a lot of tax hikes in 1990 and I believe we're going to see still more in 1991 because so many states and cities and other localities do have budgetary problems So, I just feel very concerned that the consumption side is going to be weaker than we're assuming  Housing has gone down rapidly We're now down again to where we were back in the 1981-82 recession--depression for my part of the world That's where we are already It seems to me that the so- called credit crunch has been especially tough in this arena; it has been centered on the home builder, not Mrs Jones who needs to get a mortgage to buy a house It's the financing for the person who wants to build the darn thing Again, I hope I'm not being too negative but I just don't see what's out there that's going to turn that credit availability problem around really soon for those kinds of folks If I'm right that that's a big constraint, then I don't know what's going to turn this around  On exports, I would just repeat what Jerry said In talking to people who actually export rather than to academic analysts, I think the opportunities for 1991 look a little less robust And when I think about the shape of the economies of some of our major trading partners such as Canada, which is already in a serious recession, it makes me agree with the folks who are in the business Also, I realize we're running a sort of war in the Middle East, but I think there are still some defense cuts coming through, which will have an impact on places like sunny California and have already had some effect in the Northeast So, those are some of my concerns And what I think is really unique this time, though--to borrow the term of my favorite peanut farmer--is this general malaise that seems to exist throughout the land It's hitting individuals as consumers but also as businessmen and women Personally, in my life time, I have never seen it that way  On the financial fragility issue, there is this drumbeat-- which unfortunately is coming out of Washington, DC--about the problems of the financial industry If we could put a gag or a muzzle or something like that on some of these people so they would shut up, maybe this problem would be less severe But we haven't, and the awareness of this is just becoming a big problem and in turn is tied into the so-called credit crunch And as I already have mentioned a number of times, there is the special situation in real estate, the deflation in real estate values Unless you go back to the 1930s, I don't think you will see anything like it My good friend Wayne Angell in his comments used +5 and +10 percent figures; you'd get some exciting numbers if you used -15 percent Thank you  You must have been in the Christmas punch!  I enthusiastically support a move toward ease, and tomorrow I will vote in favor of a discount rate cut because I think one of the reasons for the lack of confidence in business communities is the feeling that somehow or other a lot of people in Washington don't know what's going on I think this would be a kind of discreet action It wouldn't be so discreet that no one would know it, but it would be something that would fit on the front page of the newspapers and, therefore, would be communicated all over the country and not just to fed watchers And that would help a great deal I'm not a betting woman, but to answer Don Kohn's question If this goes across the wire tomorrow at 930 am, we'll see the prime rate cut announcements starting about 942 am "
4274,1991-02-01,SEGER," I have a question on the revision of key December employment numbers Do you know where exactly they lost those additional bodies?  Oh, I'm sorry  Friday, February 1 "
4298,1991-02-05,SEGER," As Mr Greenspan says--I shouldn't call him chairman at this point--we have to select a new chairman and vice chairman for this FOMC year I would entertain a motion for chairman  Yes    2/5-6/91  Okay, thank you May I have a second or some more nominations?  SPEAKER(?) Second  All in favor?  SEVERAL Aye, aye  Thank you  Right Now we need a nomination for vice chairman, please  All right Any additional nominations?  Thank you All in favor?  SEVERAL Aye, aye  Thank you I guess we have our officers  I was going to push Kansas City!  I'll move it  Second  Can you open the [discount] window at night so they won't been seen going in? Would that help?  I'll move it  They put it on the desert to keep down the dust!  How many people do they employ?  I think most of my points have been made--12 times--but I will start off just by explaining an experience I had when I dug into my files to see what I had sent in this time last year for a forecast because I try to key off that when I do the next go- around Last year I was the source of the low end of the range, in  -37-    2/5-6/91  case any of you have forgotten I had 1 percent real growth fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter, which was off the bottom of the chart And what is making me nervous is that that turned out to be too high; as you know, it came in at about 3 percent Anyway, having said that, I love Mike's forecast and I hope it is realized Even though I'm leaving, I certainly hope that this is what materializes But I must say that I'm a little skeptical that it will  I'll just mention a couple of things One relates to the assumed bottoming out of housing or the investment in residential structures I realize I'm biased because I just met with a couple hundred homebuilders last month, but I really think there is a problem there I think the credit crunch is still present in that industry, particularly on the side of builder financing The United States is a big country and housing markets are local; there are zillions of them They are not all like Boston or Denver or Dallas There really is a housing shortage, especially in low and moderate income housing We can use some more structures So, I hate to dismiss this as something that we don't need to be concerned about And I don't believe that we've seen the bottom yet on this; I don't think it's going to bottom out in the second quarter because of this credit situation Also, on the consumer side I would love to see the consumer come roaring back into the stores It used to be VE day or VJ day--I'm aging myself; I don't know what this would be--[VS] or something  VI or VIQ Anyhow, I would love to assume that [that will happen] I have no idea when the war will end but, whenever it does, I just don't think that in and of itself is going to cure all the consumer confidence problems because I think part of the confidence problem involves the war but another big part involves this continuing flow of bad news about the financial system It's like having cold water run down your back continually and a lot of people are reacting that way That's part of it, but also consumers are still very overloaded with accumulated debts I saw in one of the presentations the quality of consumer debt deteriorating, mortgage defaults growing, and that sort of thing So, I just don't think consumers are in shape to run right out and go on a spending spree if they feel like it  Finally, on the assumption that exports are really going to carry a big part of the load again, I would like to assume that I'm impressed with how we have gotten our exports turned around But as I hear about the conditions in other countries, such as Canada, that are our major trading partners and I think about their problems, I just wonder how strong those markets are going to be and, therefore, whether our exporters--no matter how good they are and how good their products are--in fact can achieve these kinds of results Anyway, this certainly would be my preferred outcome; there's no doubt about it But I just have a feeling that the timing is somewhat too optimistic and that whenever the bottom does occur the rebound from that low point will be more gradual and less sharp  I agree with the argument  that stability is good  and that there is great uncertainty  But I was just looking at  Appendix B [in the Bluebook]--I  realize this is ancient history but   I  do pay attention to the monetary aggregates and the targets we set--  and I just thought I'd remind you about M2  growth, looking back In  1988 we missed the midpoint  on the low side; in   1989 we missed the  midpoint on the low side; and last year we missed the midpoint  on the  low side And to me, at some point anyway, there ought to be an effort to think about at least a modest catching up I guess that is  the main reason, along with the desire for some stability, that I  would prefer to carry forward  the targets that we had for last   year  rather than use the tentative  ranges that were set last July   for this  year I think we've been assuming our targets were half-way  appropriate but we've been low-balling it right along I remember  a  few years ago, when Beryl Sprinkel was at the CEA, he made  some pass  at that idea in one of the Economic  Reports to the President Anyhow,  I just feel more comfortable not drawing a line at  the end of each  calendar year and acting  as if January 1 isn't related   to December 31  So, I would go with a  mix, using alternative   III for M2 and  alternative I for M3 That would just carry  last year's ranges  forward, which is a nonexistent  alternative  Oh, I can go with alternative I  I support your view, Mr Chairman, but I would say that the risk is definitely on the low side if for no other reason than the auto industry situation As you know, it's responsible for the biggest chunk of the decline in the fourth quarter Both auto  -58-    2/5-6/91  sales and production in my judgment are going to be a disaster in this quarter and right now I can't think what is going to bring them off the floor in the next quarter That is simply one reason In addition, there is the confidence factor I think that is partially related to CNN and the Gulf War but I think there's another big chunk coming just from this nervousness over the financial system I wish that weren't the case but I think it is Certainly, a lot of easing has been done But in order to compensate for the credit crunch, which in my judgment is definitely out there, there will be a need to do still more to offset that I think it would be good to look at Jerry's idea, too; it strikes me as sort of extraordinary to accommodate a special challenge of this nature, which I haven't seen since the 1930s So, I would go with [alternative B], asymmetric toward ease  Shouldn't we also move up monetary aggregates then, Mike?  As I've sat and listened here today, that has received a lot of discussion  May I just ask one question? Has there ever been a directive put out that just went one way? In other words, do we really think that in the next six weeks or so greater reserve restraint might be pursued?  I'm just asking if that is true; that's all I'm saying  This isn't a criticism I'm just asking if that has ever been done  Thank you "
