46,1987-08-18, And I'd like to second   I'll move that   I second that 
47,1987-08-18," I guess I just want you to play a ""what if"" game with me With respect to oil prices--I'm not an expert on foreign affairs or any kind of affairs--but the disruption in the Persian Gulf, I think, definitely has had an impact on oil prices, as you mentioned earlier But what if they sweep the mines away and the tensions are relieved Then, if we were to see oil prices coming down, let's say, to $15 or $16 per barrel--that's not my estimate, just assume that would happen--what would that kind of change in this one factor do to your overall forecast? It just seemed to me, as I read through this material a number of times, that the high oil prices, and rising oil prices, were driving many of our concerns on the forecast over the rest of this year and into next year   I think there's no honor among thieves As those prices rise, I think those people are going to be more and more tempted to cheat, and they will continue to cheat They're cheating now in that they're exceeding their own quotas--ones that they set among themselves I guess I'm not prepared to think that they'll get religion real quickly   That's not my forecast   Wouldn't that also help our trade balance? Again, it seems to me that the higher price of oil that we are importing has been a negative I would assume that that would cut current dollar imports, anyway, if nothing else changed   I hope that the staff forecast is right on target, but I do have some questions and some doubts, I guess One of them that I expressed yesterday at the staff briefing [to the Board] involves our emphasis on the trade turnaround I'm just not convinced that we will get as much of a boost to the overall economic picture from the trade turnaround as we are counting on in the forecast either for the rest of this year or in 1988 It was mentioned earlier that some of the trading partners have economic situations that are far short of robust So I think that's a key factor Also, no one has mentioned it, but there are trade barriers out there that business people tell me about And some of the obvious ones involve trying to get into the Japanese market Also, I'm not convinced that the dollar is going to fall as much as we're assuming in our forecast I realize it can be banged down but, as Governor Johnson said, there are things going on that may prevent that from happening Also, the staff is talking about some gradual upward drift in interest rates That may  -18-    8/18/87  happen, depending, of course, on what policy stance we take But I guess I don't see as much of a bite on the economy from that upward drift as I might have expected Looking at autos--and this would be more of a near-term situation than for '88--I think it's going to be a lot tougher to reduce those inventories than apparently you think, Mike Some of the specific makes have over a 100-day supply; that's not worked down easily even at 19 percent interest rates One of the reasons they have so many is they haven't a lot of sex appeal in the models; they may have to just give them away on some Saturday night, I don't know Anyhow, I think it's a lot greater challenge than --   That's right I don't like it myself My final comment involves inflation, and here Governor Angell made my point about commodity prices I don't think it's guaranteed that these are going to just keep rising We all know that commodity prices are very volatile and influenced by many, many things above and beyond monetary policy And I believe, as he said, that there are factors at work that may, as a matter of fact, keep those under control Particularly when I think about the crude oil situation, I'm not certain that we're going to get what's in the staff forecast On the labor market shortage, I just don't think there is a labor market; I think there are all sorts of labor markets--for different skills, for different industries, and for different geographic areas So I don't know that it makes any sense even to talk about a natural rate of unemployment because I just don't know how to use it as a guide Finally, one of the things that I really don't think we're emphasizing enough is the real change in managerial attitudes I see more backbone among corporate executives in their labor negotiations than I've seen in my whole working career, which goes back a long time And I'm really delighted to see that they no longer assume that they can just pass through these higher labor costs--which they used to do, particularly in the major industries Also, the company heads are more and more aware of import competition, more and more aware of the need to be efficient and to get even more efficient They're pushing the employees for moves that would enhance productivity This is going on all the time in the auto negotiations The emphasis is on job security; there is even talk of freezes on actual wages To the extent that there are pay adjustments, in a number of major companies they are making sure that the productivity gains do offset them because the 11 percent--or whatever the overall national number is-- is not what the productivity gains are in specific companies And so, I think, they are tending more and more to tie their own wage settlements to their own productivity enhancement moves And I think that's all to the good I put all that together and I don't see zero inflation, but I don't see 4-1/2 percent heading towards 14 percent either Thank you "
48,1987-08-18," I'm in favor of no change, which is alternative B, $500 million borrowing target, for three main reasons One is, as I think Governor Angell emphasized, the uncertainties that we are facing Another reason is that there aren't that many weeks between this meeting and the next FOMC meeting; we have another chance, very    8/18/87  soon, to look at things and change our approach, based on additional readings of the economy The third reason is that I just don't see that the economy is currently boiling The forecast certainly does look pretty good; but, again, I question whether or not we're going to see the hit from the trade turnaround in the way that many are expecting So, for those reasons, I would like to propose keeping reserve pressures as they are And, in the statement, I would deemphasize the impact of the dollar on what we are doing Also, I don't want to tilt the directive "
100,1987-09-22," May I ask just one question?   How much actual trading is going on in the foreign exchange market for what I would call corporate business use? In other words, not just trading for the sake of trading but for--   I remember before when there was all this turbulence, a lot of corporate traders did just sort of sit it out and hold off on decisions   That isn't what I would suggest at all I am just trying to sense what the attitudes in corporate America might be No, I don't think--    9/22/87   Second   Peter, did I understand you correctly when the question was asked about the market response to what might happen to borrowings before this maintenance period is up? Did you say you thought we could come in around $600 million without stirring things up? Isn't the arithmetic to get $600 million in this period such that it would require tremendous borrowings today and tomorrow? And if those borrowings occur in the context of the knowledge of this meeting date, I think [market participants] might make something out of that rather than just saying, well, it is one way to get the average to work out right I don't think they know what we are shooting for   Yes, but if there is all this nervousness in general, and if you average, let's say, $625 or $650 million, with $2 billion of borrowing on Wednesday--which happens to be the day after we meet here--there must be weirdos, anyway, who will think maybe there is a connection Maybe in New York they may figure all this out, but there are a few other market participants outside New York who might make something out of that whole sequence "
101,1987-09-22," Yes, I just have a couple of questions that are tied to a few matters that we discussed yesterday at pre-FOMC briefings These involve whether or not we have completely factored in the rise in interest rates that we have already seen, plus wholly factored in the increases that we think are yet to come In particular, on housing starts, which as of last month were at a 16 million annual rate, we know that there are problems with high vacancy rates in the multifamily area, at least in some parts of the country The incentives built into that kind of housing have been shifted greatly by the Tax Reform Act As for single family starts, at least some people say they are sensitive to interest rate changes I guess I have a hard time believing that for 1988 starts will not fall below 1-1/2 million I hope they don't, but I am sort of skittish about this   Is that true for both the single family and the multifamily?   What if it just means that the lags are longer? Maybe we haven't even seen the full impact of the spike we had back in April or May, which was quite dramatic   The other question I have again ties into yesterday's briefing, and relates to our heavy reliance on the trade turnaround to produce a good 1988 If I'm reading the numbers right, about half of the real GNP growth, fourth quarter of 1987 to fourth quarter of 1988, is expected to come from improvement in net exports Again, I think it's very, very difficult to get a $54 billion increase in exports in one year--namely, this year--and then tack on $57 billion next year That's just a lot to produce   In a prior life, I worked with corporate planning, so I was just sitting here thinking of that in our discussion this morning First of all, when you work with corporate planning, your bosses are always challenging your forecasts and they will not allow--at least mine didn't allow--you to utilize a single forecast Or, if you did, they were always wondering about where the weaknesses were and whether or not something might hit them that would put them out of business You are not allowed to bet the bank, or bet the company, on forecasts So, I just wanted to mention a couple of things that I think we have to look at as we look ahead One that I sort of hinted at it earlier is whether or not we are sufficiently incorporating the interest moves we have already had into this forecast And if we are, are we incorporating the interest moves that we expect are yet to come? Also, there's the question what if the dollar does not, in fact, decline more? So much of 1988 depends upon the trade turnaround; and if we think a weaker dollar is needed to produce at least part of that, then I think that is a vulnerability in this forecast Also, and this has been mentioned by Wayne Angell and Bob Heller, I really think we are not paying much attention to the change in fiscal policy When you go from a $221 billion deficit to $160 billion--and I've heard this morning that it might even come in below $150 billion--that's a major change from one year to the next I am not necessarily a Keynesian, but I do think there is such a thing as fiscal policy, and it certainly works with a lag I remember the summer of 1984, sitting around this table with many of the people who are here today, and it was very easy then to simply project the trends of early 1984, which looked tremendously strong And, frankly, we missed the fact that business was going to slow down; just about the time we thought it was looking most terrific was when we got the 90- degree turn I hope we are not doing that today  On the interest rate question, because I am an old lady I remember being in financial markets before inflation was a big deal, mainly in the 1960s And interest rates moved up; one of the reasons that long governments moved up involved simply the volume of financing, which is, of course, tied to the deficit And, as Bob Heller said, recently we have had these problems with bumping up against the debt ceiling and postponements of auctions Then, all of a sudden, Congress gets religion and takes care of this, and you get five auctions pushed through in a very short period of time, and this jerks things around And yet, if no one was talking about inflation, I think that would happen It certainly happened in August It's probably going to happen again in the next couple of weeks Also, there is just uncertainty about what's going on, uncertainty about what we are doing here I think we could help that problem if we released the minutes earlier so that people would not have to analyze every tea leaf to try to figure out what we're up to I think that  -31-    9/22/87  contributes to this situation Also, there has been improvement in communications and information flow If you go back to the 1960s and 1970s, not every person around America and around the world had a CRT on his or her desk Now every gunslinger sits there and, whereas they used to be told that the one thing to watch was M1, now they have been told that the one thing to watch is the relationship between the dollar and the yen or the dollar and the mark in the foreign exchange markets Most of these people are not economists; they are traders; and you give them two easy pieces of guidance and that is what they trade on So they contribute to this instability, I think, as you get this transmission from the exchange market into the bond market with the speed of light almost There are just a lot more players and I don't think they are necessarily really weighing what's going on in the real economy; and neither do I think that they are doing a thorough analysis of the inflationary forces at work or not at work "
102,1987-09-22," I am in favor of no change in the reserve pressure, which I guess is not really a stated option; I am somewhat between ""A"" and ""B"", $500 million borrowing target, and I would prefer symmetrical language   When the minutes come out do you think a lot would be made of the fact that the fed funds range has been moved? I can just see someone looking at that and saying ""Well, clear the decks for the next big tightening of the screws; batten down the hatches""  SPEAKER(?) Well, we really didn't   I know, but people pick at everything that goes down here; and I can just see a big deal being made of this move   So there will be an explanation? "
160,1987-11-03," I just have two questions in areas that I need to be educated on First, when you were talking about our policy of lending securities, did I hear you say that we had not been willing to lend for a short sale? Maybe I just didn't hear you   How do we know? Do you ask them in advance what they are going to do with the proceeds?   I see My second question When we have been so-called ""accommodative"" in the last couple of weeks, why have we done all these transactions with repos? I realize a million dollars worth of repos has the same reserve impact as a million dollars of direct purchases of T-bills, but I think the market perception of what we are doing is different in the one versus the other I guess I just don't understand why we have done it [that way]   Thank you "
161,1987-11-03," I just wanted to tell Mike that I admire his courage for attempting to put specific numbers down on a sheet of paper because, although I'm older than most of the people sitting at this table, I can't think of a time in my lifetime when we have had comparable events in the financial markets So I'm not sure I know how your econometric models can pick anything up when the data fed in are like what we have just been through in the last couple of weeks   One thing that concerns me, as I said before-- whether you formalize it or don't formalize it mathematically--is that not having experienced this kind of period, I just suffer from uncertainty about what it will bring Also, I wonder if a 20 some percent decline in the Dow on one day is really the equivalent of four months' worth of 5 percent declines each month I have a feeling that it's not comparable I don't know, but I have a feeling that there are a lot of things in here that, at least based on my inexperience, I cannot really judge  -15-    11/3/87   That's because they were giving things away that day   The two words that I think describe most completely what is going on are confusion and uncertainty All of the business economists and business people I have spoken with in the last couple of weeks admit to both of those Practically no one pretends to know exactly what the impact of the financial market disturbances will be, but almost everyone expects some sort of an impact Probably the most dramatic adjustment that I witnessed was at  where, unfortunately, the event caught them in the middle of the planning season for 1988 They immediately knocked 5 percent off their sales forecast up through the next year and also looked for  -25-    11/3/87  two plants to close--a truck plant and a car plant Their view was that back in the early 1980s, when the auto industry was going into the pink, they said they were cutting off a finger at a time rather than doing major surgery So, this time around they want to be prepared for more dramatic and significant adjustments if, in fact, they are needed They are watching very carefully what is actually going on so that they can do additional adjustments if necessary They also have made some dramatic changes in the management of their pension funds, which are very, very large They have cut back on the percentage invested in equities They also have cut back on the percentage in long bonds and have moved into a very liquid position I just mention that because I think it is one specific example that some people in the business world are reacting  Not knowing what is going to happen, I guess one of my nightmares is that what might happen is that consumers will cut back on their spending, as Mike has laid out in the Greenbook estimates, except that they will cut back a little more dramatically even than we are estimating in the next couple of quarters The rich lawyers will continue to buy Mercedes and Peugeots and Hondas and things like that that are produced abroad but they will cut back on their consumption of domestically produced items and, therefore, we will get sort of a double whammy we will have the weak consumption but, also, we will not see the import situation improving as much as we are expecting now, and as much as I certainly would like to see Yet, I am not saying we are going to get a recession; I don't really know But I think we ought to think about what the risk is, and ask If we do get a recession, is that going to help the problems that Jerry Corrigan has ticked off? I don't think so Going into a recession with a heavy debt load doesn't usually make the debt load any lighter; it just makes it look a lot heavier to service Also, I don't think that a recession here would help our trading partners As I read the growth numbers in Germany, Japan, Canada, and some other countries, it seems to me that they are not all that robust anyway They do depend a lot upon their business dealings with us and, therefore, I can't imagine that we wouldn't take many of them with us, which in turn, would make our new-found ability to export a lot more difficult to take advantage of because you have to have somebody to buy those exports that we now can produce efficiently So, to summarize, I just am concerned And I really think that we ought to watch the incoming data extremely carefully for signs of more weakness than we are now expecting "
162,1987-11-03," You think the markets know what that means?   Okay   I guess I can go with ""B"" but as I reread the Bluebook here for the seventh time, it looks to me as if Don Kohn was saying that all of these alternatives--""A"", ""B"", and ""C""--assume financial markets will return to conditions of normalcy, whatever that is   And down deep in my stomach I'm just asking myself What if, in fact, we don't? Which alternative should I vote for? Should I vote for ""A"" now because that possibly would allow us the greater opportunity to deal with abnormal times or do I go with ""B"" and assume that if the roof falls in we will at that point make a policy shift?   Then you go to ""E"" and ""F"" or something like that So having said that, I would go with ""B"", the Corrigan language, and the asymmetric language tilted toward ease And on targeting the fed funds rate, frankly, I would rather see it a little on the soft side of 6-3/4 percent rather than between 6-3/4 and 7 percent, because I think the fed funds rate is viewed as out of line now with other short-term rates If we are really interested in communicating clearly what market participants--   I would put a range in the statement, but I'm saying as an operating matter that I'd rather see us go to the low side of 6-3/4 percent rather than going 6-3/4 to 7 percent I would rather see us really targeting somewhere between 6-1/2 and 6-3/4 percent because I think that the funds rate is quite a bit out of line with other short-term rates   Since then it has changed   So we have to make this asymmetrical right?   I thought it was lesser reserve restraint would and slightly greater might Isn't that what we-- "
220,1987-12-15," I'd like to think of this in two stages One is what I think is useful in normal or typical times, if there are such things In those times, I'm perfectly willing to support an approach that emphasizes a borrowings target, even though I have learned that because we don't have nice stable relationships, we cannot predict exactly what a certain level of borrowings will produce in the way of fed funds rates But there are times when conditions are more unusual and abnormal, and I personally believe we are still in one of those modes at the moment And in times like these, I think that we ought to pay a lot more attention to fed funds because the markets are very, very nervous and skittish--not as much as they were October 20th through October 26th or 28th or whatever, but I don't think it's back to normal I would hate to see us give the message inadvertently that we were tightening or engineering a major policy change because fed funds rates shot up at the end of the year when we really didn't want to give that message I don't think that everybody out there in the real economy and in the markets is that comfortable with what's going    12/15-16/87  on Therefore, I would just urge us in the next few weeks to be triply sensitive, even though in two months or so we may go back to what we were doing prior to October 19th, emphasizing the borrowing targets But I personally wouldn't feel comfortable with going back to business as usual starting tomorrow   What if it comes in at 9-1/8 percent?   Yes, but having something like that in the context of having had flat reserves since April, a declining M1 in  -14-    12/15-16/87  December, and missing our M2 targets-- I think you have to look at it as the whole ball and not just--   Yes   What was the decision on the first?   I just wanted to make sure I understood what we decided   Okay   I just have one question as I sit here listening to comments about why bankers borrow on a seasonal basis Do we not administer the discount window in regard to requests for seasonal borrowing in the same hardnosed manner that we do for adjustment borrowing?   Maybe we should That's the answer to make sure that their--  -19-    12/15-16/87   I'm surprised   See, I told you Wayne, it's too dirty!   No, I just had a question   I just wanted to ask Don what would happen if all of a sudden Congress saw the light and allowed interest to be paid on demand deposits Individuals can go into NOW accounts and, in effect, receive interest on checkable accounts, but corporations or businesses can't It seems to me that part of the problem is having these two groups treated in a different way   Secondly, didn't you say--I read so much for this meeting I may have just dreamed it--that within the demand deposit category most of that is, in fact, business accounts? If that's the case, then I think the interpretation ought to be different, because I've never met a big business or small business that decides to buy a new dump truck or put an addition on a building because they have more money in their checking account I just don't think they operate that way Maybe I would as an individual, or my cousin would, but I think we have to look at how we interpret these things because of the change in the ownership of the accounts   I have one comment and one question In the last ten days, I've been at two different embassies for dinners and the dinner table talk among business people involved how they thought the dollar had actually become undervalued vis-a-vis European currencies Now, they were not talking [unintelligible], which I thought was interesting, because it wasn't a central banking group; it was a mixture of business people and embassy personnel My second point is a question You mentioned the Taiwan case and their gigantic trade surplus, etc I'm mystified as to the process of getting some of those devils to adjust their currencies What does it take? Does the Treasury have to lock them in a room? Does it take legislation or does it take negotiation of some sort? I honestly don't know the process   But, it has been pretty pathetic, when you compare it to--   What has Hong Kong's movement been then?   I still think that the trade statistics suggest that something has to be done about those currencies if we really are going to improve the situation with regard to imports without building walls   I can send them some alley toughs from Detroit   I second it "
221,1987-12-15," I was quite influenced by an article I read in this morning's Wall Street Journal about Marshall Fields, where Si Keehn lives, in the suburbs of Chicago He has to get out and do more shopping! Anyhow, it made me think about the retail sales report and your comment that the numbers were revised downward in September and October and showed only a modest gain in November You said this is causing some downward revision in your real GNP estimate for just this quarter You're not thinking of this as something that will spill over into the new year also? I wasn't sure I heard the--   That leads me to my next question If that's happening--if there are inventories building up that are not planned-- in the past that has often led to some sort of liquidation Maybe it is just because I've been around for a long time, but that's typically what happens at the retail level, wholesale level, etc So, at what point might that kick in?   My final question involves the trade statistics I guess the numbers were disappointing on both sides, but the exports ran quite a bit below what we had expected Again, at what point would you think that this might mean more serious trouble and not just a one-month blip on the screen? We have a lot of eggs in the one    12/15-16/87  basket next year--mainly an assumption of a strong trade turnaround-- in order to get the kind of real growth that we have for 1988, as I read the forecast anyway   It's just that I'm a cautious person, and when you put a lot of eggs in one basket I think you really have to make sure you check the assumption very, very carefully   Was $40 billion what we estimated?   I know we expected a big turnaround; I couldn't remember the exact number   What is well above?   Is that for one month?   I have just a couple of comments A few weeks ago I met with the chief financial officers of about 125 Fortune 500 companies One of the things that I asked them about was their reaction to October 19, both individually and corporate-wise Basically, they were sort of frozen in place They hadn't dealt with that kind of situation before so they hadn't recommended dramatic changes in plans to their CEOs nor had they changed their profit plans Most of them were right in the middle of the profit-planning season for 1988 Because most of them hadn't been through this  -62-    12/15-16/87  experience before--and, unlike us, they didn't have models that would predict the impact when there hadn't been a similar event--they were playing it by ear, I would say, and trying to get readings on what the sales of their companies were doing, and so forth They were going to continue to look at them and there might be changes forthcoming; but, at that point, they were simply not sure They said the biggest impact was on the bonuses and the value of the stock options As one fellow said, one of the biggest shocks was having to get his CEO out of a board meeting and tell him that their stock had stopped trading on the New York Stock Exchange That shook things up quite dramatically The one company that really has reacted to this, though--and I think I mentioned this before--is They have done such things as cut back on a major plant modernization job; pushed the completion date into the future for an addition that was going on at a similar plant and delayed a new tech center they were going to be building out in Also, they continue to fiddle with their pension plans, building more liquidity, raising cash, and cutting back on holdings of stock and also of long bonds In addition, they continue to fiddle with their production schedules As you know, Ward's announced that the auto industry as a whole was planning for production for the first quarter of about 14 percent below the first quarter of this year; but is making plans that are more pessimistic than that Also, I was told by them that some of the other auto companies probably would be cutting their first-quarter plans more deeply and that, therefore, the Ward's number would probably turn out to be a little overly optimistic Also, the inventory situation in autos is really, really severe As of November 30th, the days' supply was 86 days as compared with 73 days a year ago At the end of December, they think it will be 98 days That certainly is consistent with the idea of cutting production because these incentives that they have tried to use for the last year and a half have less and less ""oomph"" every time they drag them out And so, they just have to do something else The final point is that there is great concern about the deterioration in consumer confidence, looking both at the University of Michigan survey and also the Conference Board's One of the points made to me was that averaging the results of these two surveys, the latest number showed the lowest reading in this recovery after registering the highest level for this recovery in September So, they are concerned about what that will do to future consumer purchases of their products If you want a group that isn't rolling in the aisles with optimism, I would recommend that you talk to some of these people   [Unintelligible] "
222,1987-12-15," May I just ask one question about what Don said these new numbers were for the aggregates in December? I didn't hear what--   I heard him say revised down, but I didn't hear--   Yes   Thank you   Thinking back to the market reactions early in December when the fed funds rate passed 7 percent going north, I'm convinced that market participants are very sensitive to what happens to the fed funds rate on particular days So, I would prefer, short- term anyway, to stick with option (1) which really watches the funds rate very carefully If there's a decision to tighten that's one thing; but if there isn't, then I think the message that comes from a fed funds rate hitting 7 percent or higher is one of tightness and I'd be now very cautious about that Eventually, I certainly would be willing to go (3) or even (4), but I don't think that now is the time to do it And it may not even be the time to do it until we get to the February meeting In terms of the choices facing us here, I guess I'm going to be a nonconformist and go with ""A"", which gives us a slight easing I certainly hope that the exports stay very strong but I just feel that there is some risk there Also, I remember how difficult it has been in the past to read consumption events and consumer behavior It seems to me it was back in 1980, when I wasn't here but some of you may have been, when the credit controls were put on in March of 1980 because consumer demand was so terribly strong Of course, later on we learned that we were already in a recession And I think back in 1974 a similar thing happened when we handed out ""WIN"" buttons and that encouraged people to slice up their credit cards and so forth only to find again that we were already in the recession So, I am really concerned about misreading the retail sales reports We're all hearing different stories--some of strength, others of weakness And consumption is a big chunk of GNP, as we all know; so I think there is some risk here I also feel that maybe there's more of an inventory problem out there than we have yet identified And I'm impressed with the fact that the inflation numbers look far better than any of us thought they would if we go back to our discussions in the spring or even in the summer I think inflation psychology has simmered down The Dick Hoey survey, which I  -76-    12/15-16/87  didn't believe then and probably shouldn't now, nevertheless, for those who follow it, does show some cut in the inflationary expectations going forward So, I think that's good I'm not a monetarist but I am paying close attention to what's happening to the reserves and the monetary aggregates; and I think that is something to be slightly concerned about Having said all that, I would like to go with the modest easing identified as alternative ""A""   Well, because of the sloppiness of the relationships, I'm not sure what that would be I guess I would just concentrate on a fed funds rate of somewhere between 6-1/2 and 6-3/4 percent   But is that really what's going on? We put this broad range in there and it sounds--   Oh, I know that For 3-1/2 years I've--   I was just wondering whether there couldn't be some way to suggest that there might be situations where consultations would be helpful even if the fed funds rate were in the range   What if it does come to that?   Are you talking about a discount rate hike? I'm a little confused   I thought you meant monetary policy "
285,1988-02-09," I just have one   In regard to the width of the band, if there is all this uncertainty, the honest way to present that--if I remember from Stat 101--is to have the band of uncertainty identified And if we really think we cannot target within these 3 percentage point ranges, I think it would be more honest to bump the range out a point than to be below the bottom or exceed the top, because then you could explain it as indicative of the uncertainty rather than some sort of policy message   Well, starting with 1984, it seems to me that people either have been suffering from an undershoot--or rather, two years of overshoot followed by last year's undershoot Now, that's not going back to the '70s; but certainly, given recent history, it occurs to me that maybe you would get less trouble with the financial market participants if we put this up front   Last July I dissented when a proposal was made to cut the ranges back by a half [percentage point], not because I didn't want them cut, but because I thought we were firing our ammo too soon I felt that if we kept them the same, 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent, then we'd get a crack at them now, when we could do what was appropriate in the context of this period I think that was the appropriate way to go and, consequently, I am willing to go with a cut now, down to what's being called alternative II, I believe But I would like to go with a wider band, in keeping with what I said to Don Kohn about the uncertainties I just think that we are misleading people when we suggest that we can get it within a 3-point range If I thought we could, that's one thing; but at least many times we can't  So, I would go along with Messrs Forrestal and Melzer alternative II, with maybe a 4 to 8 percent range for M2 but staying with 5 to 8 percent for M3, so as to phase this in I still believe that the risk is on the downside Also, I think there are people out in the real world who think there are some downside risks and [this Committee] ought to be really, really concerned about doing anything with these ranges--even though, admittedly, they're longer-term ranges It would send a message to business people or money market or capital market participants that suggests a tightening Even though they might be reading it wrong, I would hate to have that happen, because right now I think that the mood is that we are easing I was just reading some money market commentary this morning and they think the Fed eased yesterday when the fed funds rate went to 6-1/4 percent If we send out a message when the Chairman testifies next week that we  -42-    2/9-10/88  are tightening, I'd like to crawl into a fox hole, because I don't want to be around when the flak flies Anyway, that's sort of where I'm coming from in general  On the rebasing, I've been in favor of rebasing all along In keeping with Mr Kelley's comments, I think we really ought to look at this And if we go to rebasing, we should do it come hell or high water, good times and bad--stick with it and not send the message that if it suits us we'll rebase, and if it doesn't we won't I think this is the time, though--and the chart here shows it--that it would make a significant difference whether we go with an average of where we thought we were going to be in the fourth quarter or where we actually were Also, if you don't rebase and then go to the lower ranges specified in alternative III, I think that could really give us problems On the monitoring question, I don't have a strong view on that; if you want to monitor M1 that's fine; if you don't that's okay with me too   I'll move it   I will move that "
286,1988-02-09," It's the Employment Act of '46   Well, ever since your briefing yesterday, Mike, I've been trying to figure out why I can't understand your point that when the fourth-quarter GNP numbers came out--which showed weaker consumption spending and greater inventory accumulation than I believe you had forecast--how now that we have those numbers, you can have an upward revision in the forecast for the first half of the year I must say that the arithmetic still flies right by me So, maybe you can try once again to convince me of it; I'm sure it's my density today that's doing it   A second question--maybe this is for Mr Truman-- involves the assumption about the dollar What is it likely to do this year? And if that agreement that I thought we struck with the other major nations called for drawing a halt to the dollar's decline, am I supposed to take seriously the forecast of a 10 percent decline in the weighted-average value of the dollar this year, followed by [a decline of] 8 percent next year? I just am not sure how to match that with what I thought the basic objectives were   Ten from the fourth quarter?   I like the idea of alternative scenarios, but looking at these got me thinking about whether or not our assumption was flying in the face of that deal I have a final question on the estimate for real GNP in the other G-10 countries running below our forecasted real GNP growth in each year--1988 and 1989 That makes me wonder about our export boom, and whether or not that, in fact, can materialize to the extent we are talking about   Well, at one time, you remember, we were lecturing the other countries to speed their economies so that it would help us peddle more of our goods overseas   We'd better go to Dale Carnegie Okay, thank you   That's pretty big   I guess my main difference with the staff forecast involves the inventory situation Because I am more pessimistic about whether or not the current levels are considered excessive or right on, that makes me have a different point of view about what's going to happen to them I think that there's going to  -20-    2/9-10/88  be a lot more worked off in the first quarter, and also some in the second quarter, so I have a significantly weaker first half In fact, my personal view is that we are going to have a down quarter in this present period Therefore, because I have a lot slower first half, I also have been the proud possessor of the low end of the range [of the members' forecasts] for the whole year, but this isn't my only difference I also think that housing is going to be somewhat weaker in the first half Also some kinds of construction such as office buildings and shopping centers, those sorts of things, I think are going to be weaker than maybe is implied by the forecast I think that we have to be paying careful attention to this Whether or not we will see what's coming in time to adjust, I think, is certainly an open question  In connection with an earlier comment about why these businesses aren't expanding their capacity, I had two interesting conversations this week One was with the chairman of the board of a large chemical company and one was with the chairman of the board of a large paper company down In each case, the main point they made about lack of willingness to commit to a major new project is that there is all this uncertainty about what's going to happen about public policy They think people down here operate like whirling dervishes--you know, they can't keep policy stabilized for very long It's impossible for them to plan They have questions about what's going to happen to fiscal policy You get a cut for a couple of years; then you get tax reform--they're still trying to figure out what it really means Based on how they read the deficit numbers, they are assuming that we will probably get a tax hike; and because corporate America is not very popular, they think they will get a big part of that bill passed on to them It's just very, very difficult for them to plan They also have concerns about where interest rates are going They're not talking about whether they're too high or too low, but just about the volatility; and it makes it tough for them to do the arithmetic  And finally, in looking at the foreign exchange markets, here again the volatility makes life tough for them They are not assuming that the dollar is going to stay where it is over the next few years A number of them were really burned in the late '70s and the early '80s, when they had expanded dramatically based on assumptions of strong future growth And then just as the plants were coming on stream, the growth evaporated So they were badly injured and, at least according to my sources, they don't want to get into that predicament again That doesn't suggest that they're not doing certain kinds of capital spending, because they are; it's much more targeted to specific kinds of products and toward specific production problems, with a big emphasis on getting productivity improvements, rather than--I think the term is [unintelligible] expansion So, for what it's worth, I thought I would pass that along Thank you   Did they call the last one?   [Unintelligible] "
287,1988-02-09," Should we be paying any attention to the structure of rates? It seems to me that the long rates have dropped dramatically in the last couple of months, as have private short-term rates The fed funds rate has dropped a bit, but it certainly hasn't kept up with the others And, of course, the discount rate has remained stuck Should we be looking at this as a factor or condition?    2/9-10/88   How about going back, though, to the October--   Having sat here for two days reminds me what a difficult job this is at the minimum wage Even at $4 an hour, the higher minimum wage, we'd still be-- But more seriously, I think one of the most difficult jobs that economic forecasters have is predicting turning points I sort of remember that from school and I also remember it, having lived a long time and through a number of business cycle turns I think policymakers also have a difficult time doing that--even identifying that the turn has occurred after the fact I just want to make sure that we are looking at every single thing here, and we have looked at a lot, certainly And we're very, very sensitive to the notion that there might be a bomb placed somewhere in this It's just this feeling of unease I have, I guess, that I would like to concentrate on I'll also repeat that I think there are risks on the downside both in this half of the year and my friend Governor Heller has convinced me that the bounce-back [in the second half] isn't assured either So that makes me doubly concerned I'd like to convey that feeling of risk and uncertainty and of having to watch carefully how we proceed  If I had to choose among the alternatives as stated, it would probably be alternative A If we can come up with something that's sort of a marriage between ""A"" and ""B"", then I could certainly vote for that But I am not convinced that the bankers are back to normal if they ever were normal I know a lot of them, and I had a feeling that those scars were going to remain for a while and I think they are remaining Therefore, I think it's more realistic to put a number in the borrowing path that, in fact, reflects what's going on--which is Bob Heller's $150 million I think that's what their behavior is really suggesting I think if we force the $250 million, we would put quite a bit of upward pressure on fed funds rates I'm willing to go with maintaining the current degree of pressure, but I don't think the $250 million would produce that Instead of putting all the latitude  -61-    2/9-10/88  on the Desk, I would rather give us a little vote in the process and let us suggest that maybe it go down to around $150 million  On the longer term, I would vote for alternative II with the broader band for M2--4 to 8 percent rather than 5 to 8 percent, and 5 to 8 percent for M3 A main concern I have is how these numbers will be received by the financial markets when they are announced Right at this moment I would be very sensitive about sending any message that we are tightening or even considering a tightening And I think one way to prevent that is to keep the upper end of this band where it has been So that's what I would vote for; I'm not sure that's specified exactly as an alternative   Would you say confirm the easing?   What we end up doing, though, is never voting for a policy change in this Committee I was thinking of last April when a snugging was taking place that we never voted on; but at the end of April we sort of confirmed the tightening that had occurred But we never actually voted at the FOMC meeting on a policy to tighten I was not opposed to doing it, but it just seems to me that there is a difference between our voting to ease, or whatever, and voting for no change with a tilt one way or the other--in which case the Desk can change the policy   Uh-huh   But I thought we were hearing it isn't back to normal   Or less normal   6-1/4 to 6-1/2 percent   That's trying to be on this side "
340,1988-03-29," I second that   I'll move it   I'd like to make a couple of comments as a person who was involved in banking most of the 1970s The image was that the policymakers just had no courage to fight inflation, because the Phillips curve suggested that when you fight inflation you're going to run unemployment up and policymakers couldn't take that heat I don't think people were focusing on whether or not fighting inflation by tightening monetary policy meant concentrating on one variable or another It was a bigger issue they just thought people who made policy were a bunch of weenies and couldn't handle the big job That was the view anyway  I share Manley's frustration with the operation of the Desk at certain points, and I think my frustration reached its peak this time last year I would just hope that the record of our discussions will really sensitize people to the concerns of some of us that when we think we've voted for a certain policy at an FOMC meeting and then we watch the numbers every day and see that we are getting away from what we thought the Committee voted on--I think maybe this has been a worthwhile exercise As I said a year ago, we went through a whole month where the daily explanation was that we couldn't predict Treasury balances or one thing or another, and that's why we were getting away from both the borrowing target and where we thought fed funds might be And then the light dawned well, in fact, we really snugged a bit And if that was going to take place--and maybe we needed to snug, by the way--then I think it should have been brought to the attention of the FOMC I think there should have been a telephone call or something I agree, certainly, that the Chairman needs discretion; I would argue that with my last breath But I thought that was a policy change Also, I'm very concerned about the messages that we send to market participants when we miss, for whatever reason, and when suddenly the fed funds rate runs up--or runs way down, for that matter I think we could take care of this    3/29/88  situation if we would release the minutes of the FOMC more promptly That way we would remove all this mystery about what we're doing and they would know They wouldn't have to dig through all these entrails to try to put together a message And I think that maybe this minutes policy is something else we could discuss sometime  I will shut up here by giving an analogy of whether you watch borrowings or fed funds If you think of yourself as driving an automobile, most of us, I hope, look out the windshield at the road ahead as we're driving along But we also have rear view mirrors And I don't want to ride with any of you who just look at either one or the other, because sometimes you have to move the steering wheel to avoid side-swiping when you see the guy coming at you in the rear view mirror I think the windshield, in this case, would be the borrowing target; but we have to take into account the information we pick up through the rear view mirror which is the behavior of the fed funds rate And because we don't know these relationships really well, or they change over time, I think we need to be very sensitive to these moves in the fed funds rate Not that we're targeting a number, because I don't believe in that; but at least we should give attention to it as an indicator of maybe something going wrong in these relationships--whether there's some little change in banker attitudes, or whatever Maybe this is a cop out by saying we should use some of each, but that's the way I feel  On the frequency of the meetings, I think that eight a year is just terrific, with the idea being that we can converse in between meetings We have these nice ""lightning rods"" they set up on this table and that makes telephone conferencing very easy when there is some policy change that might need to be considered or even a very major change in operations because of an event like last October 19th which, as you will recall, was handled by a whole bunch of daily telephone consultations So that's my three cents worth   That's all right   Yes  -31-    3/29/88 "
341,1988-03-29," I have just a couple of comments, primarily based on some conversations I had with people in the auto industry Friday and yesterday As I looked at the general statistics, I thought the consumer looked as if he or she was pretty tight-fisted Certainly, the retail sales look that way; the consumption numbers for the last five or six months have looked that way, I believe People point to auto sales as some sort of exception, but at least the people I spoke with in the auto industry are not putting that kind of interpretation on this What they are saying is that they had to put incentives on 75 to 80 percent of their lines because they were sitting on this tremendous inventory, the dealers were squawking, and they had to help move the inventory out In connection with all this effort, they actually reduced inventories by 58,000 units between the end of January and the end of February We seasonally adjust and we multiply everything by twelve The dealers who are holding the inventories are paying interest on actual numbers; they don't get seasonally adjusted Anyway, there is this feeling that they have to move these things and that there is a big advantage these days to keeping your production lines running because your workers are happier and your suppliers are happier The auto industry has excess capacity these days, and therefore, the pressure is really on them to do everything possible to move these units I sense that there is real fear about what might happen if and when they remove some of these incentives; they don't  -49-    3/29/88  seem too eager to test the market real soon In connection with this, the production schedules are looked at each week They did announce some higher schedule amounts for the second quarter They look at these on an ongoing basis, though, so they are not stuck with the higher numbers if they don't believe the numbers are consistent with the sales results Also, in the context of the room in this economy for producing for export, when you nail down some of the numbers, it makes me think that we have more room than some people realize For example, one automaker is talking about a big increase in export opportunities for a certain make that we export to Europe 400 units this year and 1200 next year That's a mammoth percentage increase; I can't do it in my head But, in fact, getting 400 units this year and 1200 next year on the kind of base that they're talking about here is not going to cramp anybody's style or their production facilities Finally, I checked with two of the big three automakers on the price pressure issue and said ""I'm reading all this stuff in the paper; what's really going on?"" One of them, who had just talked to their purchasing agents last week, said that in terms of what they are actually paying, they're not seeing this I think the difference is that we are confusing what is happening to some of the list prices and what sharp purchasers are paying  My final point is this let's say the price of copper rises by a nickel That is a tiny percentage of the total cost of a lot of products There are all sorts of things that we [consumers] pay for, like utility bills and labor and so forth; so I think you have to keep this in some sort of perspective before you assume that the increase in copper prices will be approximately the increase in the CPI I am still not convinced that we are about to go lickety split at 90 miles an hour I hope you can convince me that there is more strength there than I am able to find so far "
366,1988-05-17," I'm in favor of ""B"", including the idea of adding $100 million to the borrowing target eventually, for many of the reasons that the Chairman mentioned The main reason is, again, that we have had these two tightening moves in very recent weeks and I'm not sure that the markets have fully digested those moves I'd be very surprised if the real economy has taken them into account or if the monetary aggregates have begun to reflect them Also, as I mentioned before, I think we ought to pay some attention to the stock market I think there is a lot of nervousness still there, at least among a lot of institutions In many cases, institutions and small investors have taken a walk I haven't heard anyone mention the thrift industry, but I think that that's a disaster area, and something we have to pay attention to Bob Boykin, I'm sure, can speak to that, as can a number of us; and too much tightening too soon, I think, would make it a greater disaster I can't imagine that the LDC debt situation would improve dramatically if we tighten too much Also, as I read that table on the growth of the monetary aggregates, it seems to me that those aggregates are expected to slow whether we go with ""B"" or ""C"" And I still think that some inventory correction is in the cards I don't know when it will be--I'm not that smart; but I think there is some excess there that is going to be worked off In fact, when interest rates get higher, it just gives business people stronger incentive to run with less inventory I could live with the asymmetric language as well I think that summarizes it   I just have one question   I read these papers with great interest Would it be possible to run something like this off the shelf? In other words, not publicly announce that we're going to change, but act internally here as if we were trying it for six months, and just sort of simulate what the decision-making process would be?   [We could try it] between now and, say, the end of the year or something like that; and if it did turn out to have real working potential, then put it in the Humphrey-Hawkins [report] next February   It's better than looking backwards, which is what you're doing statistically   Yes   Well, it's just an idea   Probably three days "
421,1988-06-29," I think this question is related I'm never quite sure about the decision-making process Is the quarterback on these decisions the Secretary of the Treasury? Are Treasury officials the ones who decide the point at which to go in, or were we doing it based on the suggestion of the Bundesbank? I just missed that    6/29-30/88   Thank you   I'll move it   Picking up on one of Manley's questions--if we hadn't done this recent +$50 million on the borrowing target, where would you think the fed funds rate might be today? Would it still be hitting 8 percent?   But I thought we took that move because we were worried that in the next few days the fed funds rate would decline below 7-1/2 percent if we didn't do it I guess that's what confuses me   Did we not expect these special factors or--   Those seasonal influences were greater than we had originally expected them to be?   Okay   Thank you   Second    6/29-30/88 -12- "
422,1988-06-29, It won't change next year either 
423,1988-06-29," I am in favor of maintaining the existing ranges for '88 and in keeping with my position this time last year, I think that it makes sense to maintain the same ranges for '89 because we do have another crack at this early next year, and it makes a lot of sense to keep our powder dry And if we need to tighten further, I would certainly go to II or III; but in the meantime, I don't think the markets, as a matter of fact, think we are paying much attention to the monetary aggregates at the moment We keep saying we aren't, so I don't know how it is that we are supposed to send this tremendous message to the financial markets by knocking these ranges down substantially at this point  -41-    6/29-30/88   Maybe we ought to consider announcing promptly what we do; then you could tell them   I'm in favor of maintaining the present degree of reserve pressure with asymmetric language, and reconvening via telephone in the next two or three weeks In fact, it seems to me we could even wait until that time to put the extra $50 million in the target because, as I understand it, the fed funds rate is running right around 8 percent at the moment   It has been up close to 8 percent even before today, though, hasn't it?   Thanks   I guess I don't have that much faith in the accuracy of our models   Or 8-1/4   Are you ending up with ""increase"" or are you ending up with ""maintain""? "
476,1988-08-16, So move it   Second 
477,1988-08-16," Mike, could you elaborate a little bit more on the interest rate outlook pattern? I know you mentioned fed funds are expected to reach 9-1/2 percentby next spring, and I think you said long-term Treasury bonds, 10-1/2 percent It's hard to hear this morning at this end of the table, but I think you said 10-1/2 percent by next spring Are you suggesting that this will be the peaking of rates for this cycle or that this is just sort of a run?   How about mortgage rates? I noticed in your commentary you indicated that you think housing is probably number one on the hit list, as we tighten further But when I went through and looked at some of the forecast numbers I didn't see really major downward revisions So, maybe you can tell me what kind of mortgage--   12 percent   Big tax increase   I have just one comment and a couple of anecdotes that I've picked up in the last few days The comment involves the drought-adjusted real GNP growth figures I too found these very interesting, particularly to see the amount of deceleration that it shows over the fourth quarter That's really dramatic--from 38 to 18 percent So it does paint quite a helpful picture Also, one thing I haven't heard mentioned in connection with the drought is the  -22-    8/16/88  fact that it motivated the people down the street here to rain about $39 billion on farmers in the form of cash That ought to do something for somebody  On the anecdotes, a number of people in home building have expressed to me concern about the latest upward move in interest rates I would say that their numbers are somewhere around 100 thousand to maybe even 200 thousand starts a year more pessimistic than what we are showing Also, one of the things that has been pointed out to me involves defense spending and the impact of this investigation that's going on here in Washington--looking at the [unintelligible] and procurement process--and what this means as far as the slowdown in the actual granting of new defense contracts and also the payout of some existing ones This may help your area, Frank; it gets a lot of this money up there  Also on the export side, a number of manufacturers are very concerned about this rebound in the dollar because they were just really moving forward to emphasize exports and to gear up for producing more products for export And now, as they see the dollar rebound, they're concerned that maybe they'll get geared up just in time for the market not to be there I think that that is something certainly to look at, particularly any increase that's above today's already higher levels And the final thing I've picked up is in the consumer area I was talking to a couple of days ago, who told me that the only strong area there was sales of air conditioners; you can all figure out why that has been the case And the sales of lawnmowers have been very weak   Snowplows are coming up   But it is sort of interesting that that was the exact comment made This person also mentioned the concern over the consumer debt burden and what that may do in the future, particularly if economic growth does slow dramatically I believe that some retailers are looking at this variable-rate loan issue and whether or not the higher interest rates in the market feed back into the consumer budget more rapidly, because even though ARMs are often adjusted only once a year, the variable rate credit cards and the home equity lines often are adjusted monthly Therefore, we would get a more prompt feedback And I know there is some concern out there that that would be another source of restraint on consumer spending So, that's just a little bit extra on anecdotes for you Thank you "
478,1988-08-16," I can certainly accept targeting a borrowing figure But it does concern me when the fed funds rate whips all over and then that confuses market participants But I think the way to fix this--maybe we can discuss this issue at some future luncheon--is to release our minutes more promptly so people will know what we are up to Then they wouldn't have to be going through all these little subtle signals trying to figure out what it is we are really doing And, you know, if the fed funds rate goes to 9 this afternoon at 300, some people are going to suggest probably that it's there because we put it there They won't know I think that getting the information out more promptly about what our policy moves are would help to calm the markets down and would really eliminate some of this confusion   Well, I guess I'm a ""B"", $600 million today It's not a new [unintelligible] First of all, I think the discount rate hike did catch almost everybody in the markets by surprise Everyone is on vacation, and I don't think that we've had the full impact, particularly in the stock market Also, we've had several rounds of tightening so far this year and I'm not convinced that all of those have been felt in economic activity yet Also, I think the foreign exchange markets are very, very important to this process And I would want to be sure that we didn't get the dollar moving so rapidly north and get it so strong that it would impede our ability to fix our trade imbalances I think it's important to get that done over the long term  I do believe money matters and I think the monetary aggregates--particularly M2--have been looking quite good, behaving very well In connection with that, I would go along with Wayne Angell's idea that we move it up I'm not sure that today I'm willing to put it in spot number one, but I am willing certainly to move it up [in the directive listing of factors] Some of the indicators of inflation and inflationary expectations, I think, look better than they did a couple of months ago, particularly looking at prices of    8/16/88  such things as gold, oil, certain commodities And I realize we have a weak producer price index and some of those, but I think the more sensitive price numbers are not looking necessarily worse As I said, I would go for a $600 million borrowing target, and I guess I would prefer a symmetrical directive, but I can certainly live with an asymmetric one "
528,1988-09-20," I have basically two questions One is, if we don't get the dollar coming off from existing levels, what will that do to our ability to produce these kinds of net exports?   Do you want to do them one at a time or do you want to do several?   Some business people are concerned about their ability to be competitive at existing levels, but maybe that's not a predominant view My second question is one involving a statement in the Greenbook that staff continue to believe that additional pressure in financial markets would be required to slow the expansion, etc And I guess this goes to Mike Do you think you've seen the full impact of the tightening moves that we've had to date?   Thank you   Can't be or you'd get in trouble   The most intriguing information I've had since the last meeting didn't come from an economist or businessman but from a psychiatrist who happened to be sitting next to me on an airplane coming back from Boston He was writing madly and I could see the word depression, so I thought he was one of the crackpots who writes the doom-and-gloom books about the end of the economic world After a few minutes we got to talking, and I discovered that he is a psychiatrist specializing in depression But the useful information to me was that as he counsels people, one of the first things he asks them is for information about their spending habits, particularly the spending that they do using little pieces of plastic And what he's discovered is that this is one of the early signs of depression--that people go out on these big spending sprees They buy cars--no, seriously--that they can't afford   I'm not smart enough to make this up They buy cars they can't afford, do all this spending, and run their cards right up to the limits--and this is just before they go over the edge So we decided that based on what he saw and what I had seen in the statistics that there are a lot of psychos running around   Yes, that's right, he's doing okay In that con- nection, though, anyone I speak with other than him suggests that consumers as a whole aren't on a big spending spree So I guess my view of the economy is a little less optimistic than the staff's  Also, on the housing side, some of the realtors I've spoken with suggest, first of all, that the recent increases in mortgage rates haven't all been felt; and, secondly, that consumers are beginning to react to the high prices on new homes Also, in certain parts of the country, like Mr Parry's enlightened California, there are these tremendous restrictions on growth; and it's very difficult to get lots on which to build houses despite the whining about the housing shortages So I think that our forecast on housing starts might be a touch high  -16-    9/20/88  Finally, as I think I hinted in my discussion with Mike Prell and Ted Truman, I'm a little less certain that we're going to get the export improvement that we are forecasting I would certainly like to see it because, while certainly some companies are still competitive at existing exchange rates and in [scenarios] that involve a slightly cheaper dollar, I don't think everybody is And that concerns me So those are the three areas where I guess I differ from the staff Thank you "
529,1988-09-20," You can include me, too I just want to mention one other thing that I haven't heard commented about this morning, and that is the risk to the thrift industry That industry is already very weak, with many institutions on their backs And a further significant upward movement in interest rates, as the Board staff presentation yesterday showed us, would add significantly to the number of insolvent institutions around So I think that's just another good reason for sitting tight Thank you "
591,1988-11-01," I want to make a different point, because I don't know how presidents feel, not being a president But I can tell you, if this were done right now, the media would pick this up and say the Governors are trying to get rid of Bob Forrestal because he's a ""meanie"" from Atlanta And we're changing this arrangement to get rid of certain people I can just see it   I didn't say whether that was true or not    11/1/88   Seriously, the media would just love to pick up this us-versus-them routine, and while I haven't seen the us-versus- them at work [on the Committee], this would be something else that they would seize on--on top of whatever other considerations there might be So I'm sure you can't keep this quiet   I just have a question; I hope it's a fair one What if you had done this project 40 years ago, and ran it and established your equations, and so forth, would that have given us good guidance going forward?    11/1/88   So this relationship would pick that up? Because often I see econometric models that cheat They have the advantage of what has happened, and they go back and say, well, this really would have worked Whereas in fact if you had done it earlier, it wouldn't have worked But this doesn't--   Thank you   I just want to make sure I heard you right This is the first time I believe I've heard the election introduced into this analysis of what's going on   But I haven't heard us discuss that here in terms of what, in fact, it would be   Okay   Yes, but I'm just saying that this is the first time I've heard this even   That they expect some tremendous change after the November   Well, that's the day of the election   Thank you   I'll move it   Second   This is just a fundamental question The day that this bridge loan was announced in the newspaper, I happened to have breakfast with a Congressman from the House Banking Committee and he said, ""What in the world is the Federal Reserve doing in that? Why would they be involved with the bridge loan?"" And I didn't know how to answer, I'll be honest with you And then, secondly, there were a couple of articles in the newspaper shortly thereafter that indicated the conditions surrounding this loan were so much different from the bridge loans in the past I would like comments on both of those   Well, I guess he thought the Treasury would be involved; I don't think he thought it was inappropriate for the country   Thank you   Yes   Well, maybe this is what we're talking about!  SPEAKER(?) It doesn't look too great, like the economy certainly-- "
592,1988-11-01," Just two quick questions On the assumption about where we'll have to put interest rates over next year, you said plus one percent on fed funds between now and the end of next year, is that right?  -28-    11/1/88   Okay, how about the long rate?   Also the same, whether it's long governments or mortgages?   Run this by me again I think I asked this question last time; I'm getting more dense by the minute What are the underlying demand forces now that we're really trying to dampen, knock in the head?   I guess I just have a slightly different view of life in the streets Thank you   I read the Beigebook this time with great interest and all the comments about signs of slowing business I certainly agree with that I also think it will slow next year even without additional tightening I have been checking a great deal with all kinds of firms that actually deal with consumers, and the story is consistent that consumers need tremendous inducements to buy, a lot of coaxing; competition is fierce all over Also, if you look at the inventories expressed as inventories-to-sales ratios and do it in constant dollar terms--I'm thinking of the chart that I get from Goldman-Sachs all the time--it shows inventories are not in quite such good shape as I think we're assuming they are Also, if the sales part of the ratio weakens much, then what look like acceptable ratios can quickly become a touch high Also, with regard to business spending on equipment, I'm again hearing more and more decision makers comment on the uncertainties they have over future tax policy as we hear more and more talk about fixing the deficit and I think that that in and of itself is going to put a damper on this kind of activity Also, questions [they have] about sales prospects in their own businesses I think will tend to support that sluggishness On the housing side, I agree that sales of existing homes have been strong, but I also know that many realtors have been out beating the bushes telling their customers to buy now because home prices are going to rise and buy now because mortgage rates are going up And I think that there's some of that in these good results for the last three or four months  Also, I'd just like to take a minute to report on an interesting meeting I had yesterday with some Fortune 500 kinds of business people They had an interesting main topic of conversation, because they chose the subject of corporate takeovers That was their big interest, and I guess I shouldn't be surprised that one of the interesting things that came up was the notion that there are almost con-man types who are out running around and will actually go and approach management at very big companies and tell them if they go for one of these deals we will guarantee you so many millions of dollars,  -37-    11/1/88  etc And so these people are actually trying to play, I guess I'd almost call it matchmaker, before there is any action of another type taking place But there is great concern and the more thoughtful ones I believe were also talking about these two recent heavily publicized deals and saying that, sure, the debt can probably be serviced but that would mean that the cash that they thought they were going to have for R&D expenditures, privatization, etc, would be drained off from those good projects and would have to be used for debt service I think they were quite concerned about that The second big topic of conversation was this new National Economic Commission and they were very eager I'd say for that group to get its deliberations done and announce the results on December 15th And I think their expectation is very high, in fact so high that afterwards a fellow who works for  and has been attending these NEC meetings with him came up to me and said ""I just want to warn you, don't be too optimistic because first of all they're not going to have the report by December 15th; secondly, there's no guarantee they'll even agree among themselves on how to do it"" And, therefore, he thought that there might be some disappointment with the results And then finally, some of them did express some concern about the outlook for next year and whether or not the economy would make it through a seventh year of recovery But overall it was very, very illuminating   Did you talk to your retailers?   Did you talk to your retailers?   Oh, okay   Okay "
593,1988-11-01," Yes, I'm certainly willing to stick with alternative ""B"" I would note that my remarks about signs of less robust business growth and the performance of monetary aggregates have been pointed out by some others as well I don't think anyone has mentioned that there are financial market participants who thought, as of a couple of weeks ago, that we had tightened monetary policy somewhat when they saw the federal funds rate creep up to 8-1/4 percent or above So I think I can vote for alternative ""B"" but I feel fairly strongly that there should be symmetric language rather than asymmetric And if the $600 million borrowing target were to mean a federal funds rate of 9-1/2 percent, then I would have a problem with that   I wasn't sure   Yes, can I abstain? No, last time I went along with it and the asymmetric language even though I didn't want the asymmetric So, this time I'm willing to go along except that I have such a problem with the asymmetric I think I will dissent, since I can't vote 50-50  -50-    11/1/88 -51- "
653,1988-12-13," I'll do it   If this is too silly a question, tell me and I will retract it How do you decide, when you intervene, whether to really come in like ""gangbusters"" or to make sort of an anemic effort? In your comments, it sounded to me as if you said that earlier in the month market participants were disappointed with our intervention--I'm paraphrasing--because it looked as if we were just trying to let the dollar down easily and we weren't really trying to hold it up Did we really intend that?   So, why didn't we go in and really hit it then?   Thank you   Second   I just have a question How bad does the relationship have to get, or how unreliable, before we should drop this approach?   So, as Manley Johnson indicates, it seems that the rule has been that the relationship hasn't been super terrific rather than that being the exception over the last four years or so    12/13-14/88   If you were a robot and you just had pushed for the $600 million and kept going until you got it, what would your guess be as to where the federal funds rate might have gone?   You don't think you'd go over that?   Thank you "
654,1988-12-13," Keep their import protection   What are you assuming on the exchange rate situation with regard to the NICs? You know they haven't necessarily followed the weighted-average G-10 that we [unintelligible]   Starting in 1985?   And the second question I have is for those people who argue that slowing our economy will help our trade deficit Have you run a recession through your models to see what that does? If slowing is good, then recession must be terrific, right?   Yes, that's what my question was  -26-    12/13-14/88   No, I'm talking about the trade [unintelligible]   I wasn't talking about comparing recession to what we have now, I'm just saying comparing a slow growth forecast with an honest-to-goodness resession   Thank you   Yes, I need help in the housing area, and this sort of ties into the issue of alternatives You have housing starts, if I'm on the right line, going from 14 million this year to 143 then down to 136 million in 1990 with a fairly significant amount of monetary tightening built into these numbers I know when you talked about different scenarios before, you had housing as one of the more interest-sensitive industries and therefore one that would respond most dramatically to tightening So, when I looked at these, I really wondered if you had enough of a decline; or looking at it another way, I wondered, if interest rates were to stay where they are now, if housing starts would rise?  -34-    12/13-14/88   So, you don't think we are vulnerable here then?   Yes   I hoped that you remembered that   Yes   Thank you   I've been sitting here listening, then trying to match the comments with what I read in the Beigebook Either some weeks have passed or else I just read the Beigebook wrong But it sounds as though the views expressed were quite different; namely, the views today are much more optimistic than what was presented as those observations Also, maybe Mr Hoskins can help me out on this, it seems to me the NABE runs periodic surveys of members, and it seems that roughly half of the members expect a recession some time next year And most of the remaining respondents expect one in 1990   It was 47 percent next year   But when I read these I'm trying to ask what they know that we don't know or what are they assuming that we are not assuming Again, in talking with some business economists, I think they are somewhat more pessimistic on the consumer side than our staff forecast And in the housing area, at least, again I think some of them might be a little more pessimistic A number are bringing out these stories of real estate problems, even in the Northeast I think  -48-    12/13-14/88  there are some banks in the Northeast that are now actually indicating that they are going to have to take some losses on real estate loans which is quite a change from what people were telling us a few months ago I think this is also true in some other parts of the country which have been doing extremely well and now are turning around a little bit I can't imagine that that's an environment in which developers are going to hustle out and start more condo projects and apartment buildings, etc Also, in the capital spending arena some of the reports that I pick up--computer chips, those sorts of companies-- it seems that again the situation has changed dramatically in the last few months In fact, in some cases they've gone from a shortage of chips to situations with almost an excess Also, some of the auto economists I know are a little more pessimistic about the inventory situation than I've heard expressed around the table here today In fact, I heard yesterday that the days-supply for one of the very large auto companies would be a little over a 100 at the end of January That's high Also, when you get that kind of inventory situation in autos, you do see them follow through with some production cutbacks They have used incentives to a tremendous extent as you know, but the ""bang for the buck"" from incentives seems to be petering out So, if I had to come down on one side or the other, I would think they would fix this through some production changes rather than trying more incentives  Also, in the export area I'm not sure that all the business economists I've spoken with and some other contacts I've made expect the strength in the exports to be as great They would certainly like to get it, but there is no real confidence that we will continue to make these tremendous advances that we have Also, in the area of inflation and price stability, etc, one of the things that I think econometric models haven't picked up or haven't captured is the changed situation out in the real world, particularly in manufacturing I mean the changes that are going on, the emphasis on efficiency, productivity, cost controls, knocking off layers of management, etc, I think that has been going on the last couple of years and I think it is still going on And frankly when you look at some of these relationships back 10 or 15 years, it was a very different America then I think we've learned something and I can't imagine that these improved attitudes are just going to suddenly evaporate Also, I think on the labor side some of those people too would rather be employed at $17 an hour than unemployed at $1825 Ask your friend with the building trades why so much of the commercial building is being done by non-union workers Maybe that's had some impact on the fact that unions haven't had those nice settlements that they used to drool over They, too, may have to pay attention to markets, Bob This is a shock to union people   But it seems to be going on, and particularly if construction isn't rocketing ahead, I would say that the bargaining power of management might be even stronger now than it was a couple of years ago And also, looking at some of the sources of the higher prices that we have seen, I'm not sure we are able to control them For example, looking at copper prices, what are we supposed to do about a strike some place? We are going to go down and pull the people back out? I mean, that has influenced the copper prices Wayne's farmer friends have certainly suffered from bad weather  -49-    12/13-14/88  conditions this year, and that has certainly put upward pressure on prices of agriculture commodities I don't know what we are supposed to do about it And also, looking at the prices of some the steel products, it seems to me that they have been influenced by these silly quotas that we've put on the imports of steel So, maybe we need some help from our pals down the street to fix some of these things  Now, I think the Federal Reserve ought to do its job And I know Roger Guffey says everyone is looking to us to do it Maybe we ought to tell them that we can't solve all the problems, though we can do our share certainly Picking up on one of Governor LaWare's comments, I think the problems in the thrift area are very, very severe I met Monday with a person who is I think pretty expert on thrifts  and he had some very negative things to say about thrifts He indicated that even building into their cost  of funds the existing level of short-term interest rates would do tremendous damage, because it doesn't feed in immediately You have CDs that have fixed maturities and it takes a while for existing levels to influence those He's not a crackpot on this subject, so I took his comments rather seriously And also on the LDCs, I think that that is something that really could give us and the banks that have been involved with those things even bigger headaches So, I just think it's a very difficult call My own personal conclusion would be that it's not certain that 1989 and 1990 would be excessively strong even without a 200 basis point advance in interest rates "
655,1988-12-13," I'm on the side of the gentleman from St Louis, President Melzer   The young boy from St Louis!   I was trying to flatter him It didn't work   Anyway, I would be opposed to a discount rate hike now I would remind you of what the announcement effect did in  -60-    12/13-14/88  the summer, or actually September, of 1987 when the discount rate was hiked and the idea was that long-rates would decline as a result and short rates would rise Instead, all rates rose as I recall And the only thing that didn't rise was Wall Street in October when we had a slight problem with the stock market Again, their ""gong"" was done in order to sweep up the heavy pile of paper, and the blood on the floor But anyway I think it would be bad now in that sense Also, we are right in the middle of the Christmas selling season And again if you want the announcement effect, I can't think of a worse time unless you really want to cause retail sales to go into a tailspin at a time when for many merchants, a third, 40 percent of their annual sales take place around the Christmas holidays And, frankly, I just don't think it's needed The monetary aggregate growth has I think looked pretty good, pretty responsible Si Keehn said we've had a number of tightening moves since last spring And I'm not convinced that we've seen all of those impact the economy yet So, as I said, I'm on Tom Melzer's side   Yes "
720,1989-02-07," Second   I want to make sure I heard right what you were saying about our long-term objective for monetary policy relative to what the Humphrey-Hawkins Act had in mind Are you suggesting that we're not subject to their--   Okay   But you said it doesn't have it as number one, which is the way I saw the Act also   Oh yes, I understand that But it sounded as though we were departing from what they had in mind, but maybe it's just too early in the morning   Oh you really want to be popular! My second question is sort of a variation on my question yesterday about covering a standstill policy You say that alternative ""I"" here would encompass the Greenbook forecast of further tightening, right?   In our list of alternative forecasts, Mike said that we had one that would be a continuation of the existing, or constant--   Yes, right   Okay Where does that fit into these?   I still sense, though, that there's an option missing here You have number ""I,"" which is your base line, which is tightening, right? You have number ""II,"" which is additional tightening   And you have number ""III,"" which is easing   Well, at least that's what you read   Thank you   No, I was just picking up on what I thought Don said was in the Humphrey-Hawkins Act I didn't write Humphrey- Hawkins, but as it was written they put a higher priority on the employment side of things and mentioned price stability I was just saying from Don's comment that it sounded to me as if we were establishing priorities that were divergent from what Humphrey-Hawkins had That's all I was saying   May I pick up on the credibility issue? It bothers me to hear over and over again that we somehow or other just have to satisfy the financial markets I'm very respectful of the financial markets but it's a big country out there and there are a lot more Main Streets than there are Wall Streets And I think the screaming meemees up there shouldn't be the ones who dictate to us Establishing credibility is a much broader challenge We have to convince all sorts of people above and beyond the financial market types even though they are the ones--   Right   I don't know; I'm not Mr Greider   Now that I know the actual results [for the economy] and also what happened to monetary growth in 1988, I'm willing to support the preliminary ranges, which would be alternative ""I"" For M2, of course, it does remove a full percentage point at both ends of the [1988] range, which in my judgment is a sufficient message to the doubting Thomases Secondly, I would suggest that we're measuring from a point that is below the midpoint; the actual growth in 1988 came out below the midpoint of the range for last year  -37-    2/7-8/89  And so it seems to me we're picking up a little there, simply in measuring from a lower base On M3, again, taking a half point off from each end in conjunction with the full point off the M2 range should be sufficient to convince our followers   Yes, but commercial paper wouldn't be picked up in M2 or T-Bills wouldn't be picked up in M2   Commercial paper, T-Bills "
721,1989-02-07," Maybe I'm missing something, but as you go through the alternatives is there one that would be comparable to, say, just freezing in place today's policy stance? I don't mean--   Yes But I guess that wasn't quite what I was thinking of And maybe I have the wrong view of what holding today's reserve pressures would do I sense that that might put a little more upward pressure on rates But maybe your ""more money"" alternative is going to be the status quo   Okay, thanks   But look at what it did for the economy   Look at what it did for the economy--all the beer sales!   I just want to add a couple of points to those made by Governors Heller and Johnson along the lines that some of the forecasts of people on the outside seem to be somewhat different from ours The purchasing managers' survey and the Bluechip forecast were mentioned before This morning I had breakfast with some business economists representing a wide range of companies-- forest products company, a large energy company, two chemical companies, these kinds of outfits--and to a person they don't see the capacity shortages that we all wring our hands over They also certainly are pleased that their businesses are doing well but they don't sense a [boom] taking place They are expecting prices of the raw materials that they will purchase this year to increase but at a mere fraction of the increase of last year And they also are expecting some slowing down One fellow who couldn't attend, the chief economist of  sent me a fax I mention this because we often mention as an example of a rust belt outfit that shaped up and is  now doing well I'm certainly not going to read the whole fax but let me just read selections He said business has slowed down and is declining in housing-related construction, with about one-third of models on allocation compared to well over one-half early last year The allocated models are large machines associated with a worldwide mining boom Industry is never tooled for these peaks; it would leave too much idle capacity in softer times It's customary to stretch delivery Then he says that sales outside the United States are up 33 percent over the last year but that business is beginning to slow down in Europe Then he talks about materials prices being up less than the PPI and he expects that to continue; suppliers are asking for bigger increases but their target is less than national inflation  Also, I got something from the National Association of Home Builders They have a forecast of housing starts of 800,000--a figure 800,000 below ours for 1989--and a proportional decline in multifamily versus single-family starts And they are only assuming an additional 1/2 percentage point increase in long rates, specifically mortgage rates The third thing that I haven't heard people mention is the impact of the restructuring It seems to me that I read that General Motors is going to be closing a plant near Boston, so maybe that will help the labor shortage there; that's going to throw about 3,000 people in [the labor pool] And it takes 6 hamburger flippers to be equivalent [in pay] to one of the jobs of those laid off Xerox will be laying off 2,000 in Rochester; that ought to help Jerry's area Also, I haven't heard anybody allude to the thrift mess and the impact that might have on the overall economy I can't prove it, but I sense that if it isn't handled promptly and smoothly there could be a negative impact Furthermore, as Mike Kelley suggested, if we tighten too much--if interest rates move still higher--we could also make the mess worse than it now is, taking some of the modestly solvent and  -21-    2/7-8/89  profitable thrifts and throwing them over on the other pile Also, to reiterate, the monetary growth numbers are good; at least as I read them, they are about the best since I've been here I haven't been able to quantify the impact of higher interest rates on monthly installment loan payments as more and more variable rate loans are used, but I just cannot imagine that it's not going to take place We now have had enough of a rise in the short rates to which many of these instruments are tied that I would think [the rate adjustments] would start kicking into effect and would produce higher monthly payments Maybe everyone who signed on to one of these instruments had their monthly incomes advance as fast; if that's the case, they're lucky But for those who didn't, they aren't represented by  in their negotiations Perhaps they will have to cover their higher payments on these loans by cutting back on something else So, I guess I'm just not convinced that the forecast in here is in the bag Thank you "
722,1989-02-07," Would it be possible to make the case at this point, given this continued uncertainty about the relationship, that we should engage more directly in targeting fed funds rather than having the flexibility in operations of the Desk?   Yes, I can support your recommendation, sir I won't tick off all my reasons because most of them have already been stated by someone or another I would just add one, and that is that if we were to tighten further I think there would be copycat actions coming from other countries And I'm not sure that that would benefit all the economies in the world long term Also, with the dollar so strong at the moment and our strenuous efforts to lead it down, it just doesn't seem sensible to be putting further upward pressure on interest rates at this moment So I would back your alternative, which I believe is ""B""   But not until it's discussed at the conference call, right? "
780,1989-03-28," How about Cleveland?   Is New York okay for a second choice?   Second    3/28/89   I just want to make sure I understood your comment about intervening and the Ministry of Finance Do we have a deal with the Japanese that we will not intervene unless they [agree]? What if we reached the point that it was in our interest to do so and the Ministry of Finance was still balking?   It was too subtle for me   Just looking at their gigantic trade surplus vis- a-vis our own situation, it seems that at some point we'd have to ask ourselves what is in our interest rather than having the Ministry of Finance decide   There was an article in the paper about Salomon Brothers taking big hits in their government trading   Given their level of expertise, etc, and what you said about the people in the markets expecting us to tighten further how could they possibly have taken such gigantic loses?   The only reason I mentioned Salomon Brothers is that that was the firm that happened to be featured in the news item But I imagine--   Thank you   Second   I would have "
781,1989-03-28," Maybe you can get rid of some confusion I have I always thought that the housing industry was very sensitive to credit conditions and interest rate movements, and so forth I see what has happened to interest rates in the last year and I hear the forecast of another percentage point to be tacked on, yet I see housing starts for the calendar year 1989 actually estimated at a touch above calendar 1988--if I'm on the right line, it's 1-1/2 million versus 149 million And then the following year it's 144 million, with the weakest quarter not being any worse than 143 million I guess I just need to have that put together for me How, with these interest rates, would you think that the home construction will not be any weaker than that?   Assume everyone's moving to California--is that it?   Yes, but the others-- "
782,1989-03-28," My preference is for no change, which I guess is ""B"" with symmetric language As has been said by a number of people, we have had a substantial tightening over the last 12 months or so; interest rates have risen rather dramatically Because of these known lags, much of that tightening has yet to be felt by the economy Also, as Manley said, there have been some signs of slowing I personally would argue that there's going to be some more coming, particularly in housing and in the auto industry I haven't heard it mentioned but I think that the thrift situation is something we should be aware of, if for no other reason than we could easily do something that would make the cost of the bailout quite a bit higher Also, despite the Brady plan, I don't believe we've solved the third world debt problem; maybe it's coming but I don't think it has been done Too much additional tightening, I think, could negatively impact those third world nations Finally, I'm very concerned about the dollar perhaps not performing as Ted and his people think it will--that it will stay strong and that that will prevent this export expansion that we all want which, in turn, will make it even more difficult to narrow our trade deficit So, for all those reasons I would prefer to sit tight and have symmetrical language   That being the case, I'll say no "
845,1989-05-16, I will move them   I'll second it for you 
846,1989-05-16," I have three questions I may have missed the answers On the technical adjustment of the borrowing target from $500 to $600 million for alternative B, what do you think the fed funds rate would be if you didn't make that adjustment and you stuck with the $500 million that we currently have?   Sure   Do we have an alternative for no change in policy? It seems to me that what we have is an easing, which is ""A;"" a slight tightening, which is ""B;"" and more tightening, which is ""C""  -33-    5/16/89   But without even looking forward, doesn't the fed funds assumption in alternative B, at least in a relative sense, represent some tightening? I say that because we've already seen, as I read the numbers anyway, quite a significant decline in short-term rates And if you--   I'm sorry; I was up [on the Hill], having had a date with a couple of my Congressmen   I think you answered my third question when you talked about what the market impact might be in the future if they, in fact, are expecting an easing If it doesn't materialize--or I guess even more importantly if they're expecting an easing and then something registers as a slight tightening--I would imagine there would be even more of a market impact   Right   Thank you   I'm for no change and, again, I'm trying to figure out what that is To me it's either ""B"" with $500 million borrowing or something between ""A"" and ""B"" anyway, with symmetric language The main reason I feel this way is that, as I read the economic statistics for the last couple of months, I think there are growing signs of some sluggishness or slowing, particularly in housing and auto sales The first-quarter figures for real GNP are expected to be revised downward, according to the staff's briefing yesterday The second-quarter [growth rate] is expected to be coming in below 2 percent, which I don't view as particularly strong Also, we've done quite a bit of tightening over the past year or so but I don't think the tightening moves--particularly those taken at the beginning of this year--have been completely felt by the real economy I think there's some chance that fiscal policy is going to move at least modestly in the direction of restraint As for the monetary aggregates, Don Kohn yesterday told me that I can start paying attention to them, so I'm going to; and I think they look sort of weak, both currently and looking forward, based on their growth from the fourth quarter of 1988 to date Also, I haven't heard a lot of discussion of it, but I'm very impressed with the terrifically strong dollar--the fact that it's at its highest in over two years I'd like to see some manufacturing survive in this country and, therefore, I would hope that we don't do anything ourselves to make [the dollar] still stronger Thank you   With $600 million? "
911,1989-07-05," I'll move it  SPEAKER(?) Second   Second   Second   I would support sticking with the current ranges and carrying them over into next year I would use the arguments I used last year at this time that there are uncertainties and that there is no great [harm] in carrying these over because we do have another crack at them As I think Mike Kelley said, it's better to present the appearance of stability rather than zigging and zagging However, if we are going to change them, the direction I would go in, frankly, is toward alternative I--for a couple of reasons One is that I hope we do get some additional M2 growth as interest rates come down Secondly, talking about base-drift, I went back and looked at this table in 1987 M2's actual growth was 41 percent, which was outside the low end of the range; that was followed by growth last year of 52 percent, which was within the range but below the midpoint; and so far this year M2 is growing below a 2 percent annual rate So, if we look at this over a longer period, it seems to me that there is some point at which maybe we ought to say we should be making up a little of this growth that we haven't achieved in the past and that we did think at the time was a reasonable objective So, I could go with either carrying the existing ranges forward or alternative I Thank you "
912,1989-07-05," National is--   I've been sitting here thinking that I need a new hearing aid because I can't believe the change in the comments today versus the FOMC meeting in May or, for sure, the one in March Either I needed the new one then and not now, or vice versa Anyway, as you know, I've been somewhat concerned about the slowing economy for a fair while So, it is nice to have some other people who are on board with the same concerns Where I depart from the staff forecast is over the next six months or so, for a couple of reasons One is that in the auto industry, I think for the first time in three or four months, we're going to find that the auto manufacturers actually have some latitude to adjust production As they got into the late stages of this model year they were locked in because they had made commitments to suppliers to take X amount of materials and, therefore, they carried through with their production plans; but now they are reaching the end of that run and we're seeing announcements already of extended shutdowns from model changeovers And this is sort of the  -30-    7/5-6/89  first round Then Chrysler, for example, when it starts up the new models at one of its plants, instead of putting two shifts on is going to put one shift on I think we're going to see a number of these things Instead of just holding production constant and trying to ram the sales through the system through the use of these various incentives--which made the dealers very, very unhappy--I think we're going to see more and more production cuts I realize that the auto industry is no longer as important a share of the US economy as it used to be, but in terms of explaining cyclical wiggles I think it's still rather significant Therefore, I think over the next two quarters what's going on there may be really rather significant  I got some numbers this morning that I'll just share with you because, on the one hand, they were interesting; on the other hand, they were rather scary to me Chrysler sent some surveys to their dealerships and what they have discovered is that 60 percent of the people coming into their dealerships were not able to come up with even the downpayment to buy a car That's sort of scraping the bottom of the barrel, as I see it One reason, of course, is that used car prices have weakened; and [that hurts] those who, when they had trade- ins, could forget the downpayment I find the [unintelligible] system working; the others don't necessarily have trade-in difficulty but they just don't have the cash on the barrel head And this includes, by the way, the opportunities to use cash rebates for downpayments; even with that availability, 60 percent weren't able to get a downpayment together Also, the number of people actually coming into their showrooms is down about 10 percent from a year ago And what they call the closure rate is down So, of the people coming in, the number who actually go through and make a purchase is way down--I don't know by what percentage Also, 31 percent of their dealers are now losing money versus under 20 percent last year Those that are still profitable, though, have seen their profits drop to less than half of what they were a year ago Jerry, you mentioned that tight money hasn't had the impact you might expect; I think you can see it in autos And it works through the dealers, as the dealers have had to pay 3, 3-1/4, or 3-1/2 percentage points more to inventory this tremendous pile of cars; that's real money to them because they are the ones, as John LaWare knows, who have to pay these financing costs General Motors doesn't, or Ford doesn't The dealers have seen these financing costs soar and that has increased their unhappiness with the situation; it has also increased the flow of gripes back to the auto manufacturers By the way, auto sales picked up in April when these incentives went in but since then, even with the most generous incentives in place--to me these are the most generous incentives since they launched incentives back in '86--sales are viewed by people in the industry as disappointing in both May and in the sneak preview of the figures for June that they had received just before I talked to them That's one thing that concerns me  The other sector where I'm a little more negative than the staff forecast is in housing; I believe the staff has housing starts hitting bottom this quarter and then starting to percolate up I would like to think they would turn around that quickly but I'm not really that convinced that they will Therefore, as I said, my concern is how we are going to make it through the next couple of quarters before we see some of the monetary changes work through, because I think the very slow monetary aggregate growth that we have had is having an impact and, unfortunately, that it is going to  -31-    7/5-6/89 -32-  continue to have an impact for a while Thank you very much; I hope we're lucky "
913,1989-07-05," Since some people outside follow the reserve aggregates--I realize we don't target them but they have [dropped] more than we expected, I believe, since last summer--how would you expect them to perform over the rest of this year?   But you do think the decline in the reserve aggregates would cease under alternative B?   I know your preference is to go between ""A"" and ""B"" but I think I would go all the way to ""A"" First of all, I don't think that a 50 basis point change in the fed funds rate is all that startling Going upward we went 50 and 75 basis points without even winking or blinking at all Also, I'm not so sure that all the markets have incorporated only a 25 basis point easing by us This morning I heard the early financial news on TV and some of the stock market commentators were talking about the impact of expectations of lower interest rates on the stock market Again, I don't know if these folks are right, but they were building the stock market story on substantial declines in interest rates Secondly, we heard all these pieces of evidence presented yesterday about the slowing in the economy, and I certainly agree with all those Frankly, I think that there's going to be much more slowing going forward, regardless of what we do today, because I don't think the actions today are going to impact the economy one way or the other for probably the rest of this year  Earlier we were talking about the importance of announcement effects; probably there are a thousand people in the country who know what we do at the FOMC, and maybe 500 of them know what the ranges are for monetary growth But there are 500 and some people down at the other end of Constitution Avenue who are going to be following what goes on in the real economy If the economy weakens even further and they start hearing from the folks at home about rising unemployment rates and so forth, then I'm sure our Chairman here is not going to be the man of the hour when he has to go down there and meet with them-- because I think they will wonder why we didn't see what was going on, or if we saw it, why we ignored it and didn't react So, as I said, I would prefer alternative A "
972,1989-08-22," I just have one question about profits As I've read some of these profit reports the last couple of weeks, basically, it just seems to me that for the second quarter of the year there are a number of very soft stories that came out Now, maybe they weren't  -17-    8/22/89  any softer than we expected; I don't know But I just wondered if in fact there is a significant deterioration showing up, particularly in the high-tech area That was the one that surprised me the most And I wonder if the aggregate numbers forecasted here are sufficiently weak to reflect that   I know you don't like me to look at quarterly numbers, but I'm going to do it anyway It seems to me on a couple of these quarters looking ahead that you actually show a slight increase in profits--for example, in the fourth quarter of this year I don't mean as a share of GNP; I'm just looking at the corporate profits with IBA and CCA adjustment   Yes, I knew that   Right   In the third quarter of next year, also, you have the decline stopping and a bit of a rebound--or more of a rebound than in the fourth quarter of this year   Don't you think, though, that this profits story is tied into the inflation numbers? Many of these higher costs-- whether they're wage costs or something else--because of the competitive environment are having to be eaten by the organization And where it's coming from is out of profits   In addition to just the cycle [phase]   Thank you   It hasn't yet?   Oh   Are you talking about cops?   I'll warn you that my views were colored by conversations with my brother last week who happens to be in the construction business I asked him how things were going and he said pretty good The latest big project he had signed on for was a new bankruptcy court in southern Arizona! Anyway, that aside, I do agree with the comments around the table about the deceleration that is showing; certainly, the Beigebook referred to it and the Presidents here have alluded to it, and a number of individuals I've spoken with suggest the same thing I have a little difference of opinion about where we're going I think we are going to see more slowdown, despite the fact that there have been some upward revisions and some surprises in certain of the statistics for the last month I don't think that establishes a new trend by itself A couple of things concern me greatly and one is in the housing arena Again, I realize that starts have shown some uptick the last two months but the real estate markets in more and more parts of the country are weakening Builder friends tell me that eventually that does show through to new construction It certainly impacts the attitudes of developers and builders Also, I'm sorry to be unduly cynical, but I have an awful feeling that when the RTC gets rolling they are not going to make this any better The markets are already having problems and I think the RTC is going to turn it into a worse disaster and probably create new problems where there weren't problems   Well, okay In the auto area, once these new 1990 models come in, if any people can be pulled off the streets into the showrooms to look at the cars, I think they're going to fall flat on the floor when they see the stickers I understand the adjustments that were made in trying to price the comparable options and accessories I understand all that technical stuff, but for the average person who walks in all they know is that the bottom line is that they are going to have to write a bigger check to get a car-- whether they want air bags or not they get them And I think that will discourage numerous people Also, there have been a lot of cars sold in the last 5 or 6 years and there doesn't seem to be any real demand stacked up that has been unfilled When I read that sales of light trucks are now starting to show some weakness, that gave me some concern because they have been extremely strong We had some plant closings announced in the area of heavy trucks--Si Keehn alluded to that One of the major producers of heavy trucks, had a pretty negative report out on what they were experiencing And I personally believe we're going to see some more of that looking ahead  -38-    8/22/89  Even using our own statistics on exports, it looks as if they are not going to be exceptionally strong I believe we're going to see less strength there because I'm not convinced by Ted that the dollar is going to perform as he thinks Even though we have the trade deficit reaching its low point in the second quarter of this year and then getting worse, I think it will probably get even worse than what we're showing Putting this all together, and also adding to it the concerns that Mike Kelley mentioned about the impact of a recession on many of our other problems, I certainly think we ought to be very, very sensitive to what's happening and to balancing these risks between inflation and recession--particularly when the inflation numbers do seem to be looking better I really believe that there have been some major behavioral changes out there in the real world that are going to help to make the inflation numbers come in even better than we're now talking about Thank you "
973,1989-08-22," I can support ""B"" if it has asymmetric language with the tilt toward some slight ease between meetings, because I do think that the economy is going to move in one direction or the other from where it is now and is slightly [more likely] to go toward the weaker side rather than the stronger Also, I'm convinced that we don't want the dollar to strengthen a lot more, even though it might produce good inflation consequences It would be very bad for our export industries and our ability to cut our trade deficit "
1034,1989-10-03," I'll move it   Balance the budget, of course, Jerry   I just want to say two things, primarily because I've been one of the people concerned about the strong dollar--not because I don't like strong dollars on the face of it--but because I've been concerned about the impact on our manufacturers' ability to produce or to export But having said that, I don't believe the way to get the dollar down is to bomb it through intervention I think the best way to do it is to deal with it in a monetary policy way even though the [unintelligible] said we don't believe in that, I do In terms of Manley's concern over the possible market impact of this bombing effort, I think the reason we haven't seen it yet is that there are many people in the markets--maybe not in New York but in other parts of the markets--who really do think that there will be some monetary policy follow-up to this bombing And if that does not occur in the next couple of weeks, then I think we're going to get the bond market impact etc, in spades So you can write that down as woman's intuition speaking Thank you   What happens if they are not ratified?   Just abstain "
1035,1989-10-03," Is that because   I thought he supported all expenditures that went into that area   Oh, excuse me   I can't worry about where we're going in two years because I don't think most of us can forecast even two quarters ahead let alone two years ahead Looking a couple of quarters ahead, though, I do think that the slowing that we have seen is going to continue What concerns me greatly is the weakness that I see in various manufacturing areas And the weakness in manufacturing, I think, is more serious than the overall weakness The Purchasing Managers' Survey for the last five months or so has indicated this slowing; I have other sources of information as well Just to repeat a couple of things that Si Keehn said about the auto industry using the current production schedules for the fourth quarter this will be the weakest fourth quarter since 1982 and you may remember that 1982 was not exactly a hot year for autos Even if you pick up the transplants which, of course, have become very big and very important over this last seven years, it still will be the slowest fourth- quarter production since 1982 Frankly, one of the reasons two or three of the auto manufacturers have announced incentives for their 1990 models even before they are readily available is that they are so nervous about the weak demand In some cases, they do not have enough orders even to start their plants running to produce the 1990 models So, I think the people who looked at the August auto sales numbers and read them as a sign of strength got the wrong message It was end-of- year close-outs that they really pushed It's just about 180 [degrees] away from a strong story; it's a weak story  Also, if interest rates actually perform as the Greenbook assumes--if short-term rates are basically flat during the year ahead and long rates rise slightly--I'd be very hard pressed to expect housing to improve Maybe I'm missing something and maybe consumers are interested in buying more, but the builders--at least in the builders' survey that I read--are feeling rather negative That's particularly true in parts of the country that have been alluded to here earlier The export situation really has to be watched I think the strong dollar that we have seen over much of the year, until the [unintelligible] began recently, has had an impact on export growth; I believe it's going to have an additional impact because there are long  -34-    10/3/89  lags involved here Also, there has been a rather significant deterioration in profits going on The IBM announcement a couple days ago of disappointing earnings in the third quarter and expectations of disappointing earnings for the full year, I think, is a great concern They have announced that they will offer early retirement to some more people, which is not exactly very IBM-like If you read the press release carefully, it mentions that the strong dollar was one of the things contributing to their deteriorating profits because of the translation problem--the profits that they are earning abroad and then bringing back into their consolidated earnings report for this country It's my personal observation that when a company experiences profit deterioration, that eventually impacts on its willingness and ability to expand and even to modernize dramatically So, I'm probably a touch more concerned than the average around the table And if the stance of monetary policy is what we're assuming in the Greenbook, then I think I would be a lot more nervous than the average here Thank you "
1036,1989-10-03," I favor alternative ""A"" because I think we do need a slight degree of easing; actually, I believe the difference between ""A"" and ""B"" is basically a slight one   Yes I don't think the 25 basis points is going to pour rocket fuel into our engine Anyway, my main concern, as I indicated, is in the auto area and possibly in the capital goods area In regard to the impact on the foreign exchange markets, I think the demand situation there is one of great strength for the dollar, which is why we had to be in there doing this heavy intervening and selling of dollars along with the other central banks If we drop the interest rates slightly, then that would allow Sam Cross' people to take two days off and maybe that would be good So, I don't think that that would be a real danger Finally, just thinking back to our discussions here earlier this year about inflation, the actual performance of price indexes has been far better than any of us dreamed And I don't think the apparent shortages that were so worrisome are there now While I don't think inflation has gone away --and I say that so Lee Hoskins will understand--nevertheless, I don't think it is accelerating either So, I would be more comfortable with alternative A   I'm sorry, I meant 50   No, it wouldn't "
1090,1989-11-14," I just have a couple of comments I think this quarter and the next two are probably going to be quite weak, possibly even turning in some red ink performance I believe the weakness will be centered in manufacturing--because we already have seen that--and also in construction to some extent Some of my contacts in manufacturing indicate that in their view manufacturing is already in a recession or within a gnat's eyebrow of being there To use autos as a specific example, I have been talking to people in the last few days in that industry and they are the most negative I've seen--not since 1985 or 1986 but since 1982 That is probably because production is running about what it was in 1982 While they expected a payback from the sales spurt in August and early September, which of course was a result of the very generous incentives, they didn't expect this much of a payback The very weak October and early November sales performance has come as an unpleasant surprise, at least to my contacts There were a couple of things I heard mentioned for the first time from these folks One was the complications coming from the weak financial condition of a number of the automobile dealers, including very large dealers The statistic given to me was that about half of the auto dealers in this country are losing money in 1989 We're not just talking about a small marginal group but a very major group And that tends to lead to an unwillingness to carry the same size inventories as previously because the dealers just don't have the wherewithal to fund it Therefore, at the moment you're seeing a very poor flow of orders to the producers from the dealers It's a combination of the weak consumer demand for cars and also the efforts of the dealers to cut back their existing inventory levels There are still apparently quite a few carryover 1989 [models] that they would like to dispose of but haven't been able to  Another interesting thing came up in the comments of He said a number of the dealers were  telling him that some of their would-be buyers of Cadillacs are saying that they are knocked out of the market at the moment because their ARM mortages had adjusted upwards and, even though they're ""in the bucks"" so to speak, they are finding their monthly payment going up-- these are people who don't live in shacks like I do--by $400, $425, or $450 and apparently that's just enough to discourage some of them from going ahead and buying a new automobile at the same time That's the first time I heard that comment Also, this unpleasant surprise is forcing a basic analysis of how much manufacturing capacity they really need Chrysler is looking at this and so is GM I think GM has four plants, although they haven't identified the exact four or five, that are going to be shuttered for good Believe it or not, we've been concerned about capacity constraints; well, on autos we've had excess capacity and new capacity coming on stream all the time So there are going to be these more permanent adjustments taking place--not in Roger's District; he's very lucky But the assembly  -24-    11/14/89  plant down the street from my old apartment in Detroit is getting it February 2nd So, I would change places with you if your business is too strong down there Also, I heard mentioned [by my contacts in the auto industry] concern over the strong dollar and what that is doing in the high-priced end of the market, particularly because expensive German cars are now coming into this country at sort of bargain prices And this is making it more difficult for the American manufacturers to compete with them Also, the rather feeble efforts of Chrysler to do some exporting of cars is now being impeded by the stronger dollar this year  Finally, I'd like to mention just a couple of things I've been picking up about construction and housing One is the sad impact of the FIRREA legislation on the ability of builders to get loans because S&Ls apparently haven't had the kinds of lending limits on individual loan size that banks have had Now with FIRREA they do; it's 15 percent of their capital So, a number of developers are having a hard time getting loans of the size they need to do these developments Also, the HUD parade of homes march is on and the competition from the foreclosed homes, at least in some parts of the country, is very significant And that is tending to keep discouraged builders from putting up new homes So, my personal feeling is that we're going to see further problems in both the manufacturing arena and in construction I hope I'm wrong We'll find out by fourth of July next year "
1091,1989-11-14," I hate to be odd man, or woman, out again, but I feel fairly strongly that we are running the risk of a recession And if we are worried, as I am, about the waning strength of the economy going into next spring, say, the steps have to be taken now to influence it at that time because of the well known lags involved If I were convinced by my illustrious colleagues here that throwing us into the recession tank would solve our inflation problem I probably would vote differently But I don't see that a recession is going to offset the impact of unwise legislation--by our friends under the dome down the street here--that would put upward pressure on business costs I don't think that a recession is going to solve the medical care costs and the nursing shortage Maybe we ought to deal with recruiting more nurses and getting rid of some of the excess lawyers who are chasing ambulances and getting big settlements which are driving up costs and not try to deal with it through a recession These are the kinds of things that are contributing to inflation I have a hard time seeing at the moment that it's excessively strong demand and shortages of capacity So, having stated all that, I would prefer alternative A Actually, when I look at the difference between ""A"" and ""B"" as described here by Don Kohn it isn't as if the one is going to produce monetary growth double the other You're talking about really rather modest differences but sufficiently great, I think, to make a difference come next spring I would go for ""A""   It must be bonus time!  SPEAKER(?) It wouldn't be so bad "
1156,1989-12-18," I have a couple of questions and a couple of comments First of all, in regard to using the Hoey Survey I know that you've all known him for a long time; I think if you administered truth serum to him he would be the first to tell you that this is a very shaky, flaky, sort of survey and he wouldn't want you using it as an indication of inflation psychology Although I understand the need for a number, that doesn't make it good Secondly, as I read through here, I'm trying to figure out the answer to the question Credibility with whom? What group is it that we're trying to impress or convince that we're committed to price stability? Frankly, if you get outside the Beltway, most people in America don't know who the President of the United States is! And fewer know who the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board is Other than 32 people on college campuses and 25 Fed watchers on Wall Street they have never heard of the FOMC   Well--   We sit here and assume that everybody is sitting on the edge of their chairs waiting to see what the FOMC does I hate to tell you this, but they're more interested in the Redskins football game yesterday   I don't want to be disillusioning; maybe I just come from an unsophisticated part of the country where they like football Also, when you had this list in Exhibit 1 of possible impediments to price stability, I agree about a jump in the world oil prices, fiscal policy miscues, etc But I'm more and more depressed by moves that are taken by governmental bodies that are inflationary that are not fiscal policy I'm thinking more of microeconomic things   I don't call that a supply shock putting in some regulation that has tremendous--   You would call the minimum wage hike a supply shock?   I guess to me a shock is something that just comes from out of the blue and not something that is legislated by people down the street here That is not the connotation   Okay Also, I couldn't sit here and listen very easily to the comments on the early part of this decade and how the disinflation costs were not that great Possibly from Washington, DC they didn't look that great; or if you were sitting with the security of a government job or a government paycheck, perhaps they didn't But I can tell you that there are a lot of people who paid dearly for that disinflation They lost businesses; they lost farms; they lost jobs, and they're still without them I'm not saying that the fight shouldn't have been waged; it probably should have Maybe nationally the cost was very marginal, but when two states assumed about the whole cost it looked a little heavy Also, in looking ahead at sacrifices, I think you have to be much more micro in your analysis and think far more about sectoral differences, because it doesn't all average out I can tell you--pardon?   I think that's something you have to look at, though   Well, [remember] some of the pieces of 2X4s that floated around this building that came in from builders in the early '80s! I think that suggests that at a certain point the sectoral burden gets a little heavy, and they speak out even if it's by flooding [us with] 2X4s Anyway, thank you It was a very interesting presentation   You'll find out next year   As long as they're all in Massachusetts!   I just realized as I sat here how old I'm getting because I took the first economic courses I ever took in the '50s, before any of you were born! But I will tell you what they were teaching then--especially Manley, pardon me   That's what I was referring to--1850! Seriously, first of all, in the '50s we were taught that deficit spending was not [only] okay but it was great because we had to prop up this weak kind of economy Secondly, some of the gurus of the day--people like Samuelson and Slichter--were saying that you needed to have inflation of 2 to 3 percent per year to assure prosperity Again, none of you remember this but you can go down to the library and pull out the books and check to see if I'm right   The other persons from [unintelligible]! Anyway, I think it does state something about how the pendulum has swung Frankly, as a conservative, I'm delighted to see this because I do believe in price stability I also remember the early 1960s; in fact, I worked in Washington in the early '60s when we got those quite good results with the inflation measures But the interesting thing, as I recall that period, was that it wasn't really planned It was like a eureka experience We got it and said ""Oh gee, isn't this nice!"" We had this good record thrust upon us, which we then of course lost in the mid-'60s with the escalation of the Vietnam War   Yes, but--   Yes, but we had better inflation performance in the first half of the '60s than we had in the late '50s Anyhow, my punch line in all this is that I think it's very good to state as a general objective that we want price stability And by price stability I mean just be that vague; don't say whether we want to cast the CPI for October in concrete and make that the base or whether we want to do something else Set a general target and move with our policies in that direction but without specific numerical targets because, as several people around the table have said, we're going to have this test every single week or every single month Even if we're making general progress, to the extent that we miss a specific target, the financial markets particularly are going to pick this up and run    12/18-19/89  with it and conclude that we're complete failures, whereas in fact we might be batting 800 instead of 1,000, which in most ball games isn't bad So, I would be opposed to setting specific targets or selecting specific indicators of inflation because I think it would be very counterproductive As to one of your points, Lee, about saying that we're going to impose price level stability even though maybe most people don't care about price level stability, these are value judgments And if we get too far our of line with what the people in this country want, it's going to be like the government of East Germany and you're going to be put out of office   Yes, but America is bigger than financial markets You know, we sometimes forget that The people who put governments in place are not all on Wall Street or in investment banking houses, etc Anyway, it's a very big challenge And I think we have made progress in going from the '50s when, as I said, it was sort of accepted and even thought desirable to have inflation So, something that's vague and general, in my judgment, would still make a contribution   He's on the other side of the--  -49-    12/18-19/89   Because they know they wouldn't win the debate! "
1157,1989-12-18," I have a question Even though Mike can tell me never to ask about the quarterly distributions of economic activity, I'm sorry but I'm so confused that I'm going to have to ask anyway  -70-    12/18-19/89  In looking at the quarters for 1990, you have the strongest growth in the first quarter and--   Well, I think that's giving a lot [of weight] to both of those! As for the tremendous pickup in final sales from the present quarter to the first quarter, I hope that's accurate, but what if it isn't?   You have a big pickup in consumption expenditures on durables   Well, maybe that's where I should really part company with your forecast   I'm sure they're going to try the incentives We may talk to different people--we probably do--but I can tell you there's disappointment about the effectiveness of the incentives The bang for the buck seems to be less and less each year These incentives have been around for three or almost four years now And to show you how desperate things are, the incentives have been put on minivans by two of the Big Three, and minivans have been the stars of the universe in that they were selling quite well even when a lot of other models weren't As I said, I hope you're right; but I have a feeling that the first quarter is going to be weaker than what we're showing here  -71-    12/18-19/89   No What I'm worried about is--   The stories I hear are that the production schedules for the first quarter are written in pencil and are written very lightly   Thank you   We still have to live through these quarters-- quarter by quarter by quarter And those, in fact, produce the average for the model for the whole year   I have just a couple of comments First of all, I agree with the Greenbook statement that signs of substantial slackening in the pace of economic expansion have accumulated in recent weeks I think we're going to get more I'm particularly concerned about autos; the inventory situation is excessively heavy I think the days' supply is the highest level for the end of November in more than 10 years, which is quite a significant point I believe Given that we're going into the next quarter with this tremendous inventory and given the fact that the effectiveness of incentives probably is wearing off, I think we will get much more of the adjustment on the production side than on the side of higher sales We had the head of and what he and I discussed quite a bit was the impact of the liberalizing of debt terms on car sales some time ago That is coming back and biting the dealers because individuals who took advantage of those attractive terms earlier now find that they have no equity in the car They would like to get rid of the clunker--it's 3-1/2 years old--but they can't turn it in because they don't have the [equity] or the downpayment This apparently is a growing problem Also, he was talking about the financial health of the dealers That is one place where interest rates do enter in because the dealers have to pay the floor plan financing on all these cars; that isn't a gratuity from the auto manufacturers And that's a big part of their cost besides having to rent fields to park the cars in So I really believe that over the next couple of quarters we're going to see quite a bit of additional bad news from the auto industry; and I don't think it's going to impact just the Seventh District In fact, some of the announcements of plant closings have involved plants in places like Kansas and Georgia   And Delaware I figured I'd get at least a couple of the Districts!   I don't want to emphasize this too much In the area of housing, again, I'm very concerned As real estate markets have weakened around the country, my realtor friends tell me it's more difficult to move existing homes And for most people who are buying new homes, the purchase of the new home is contingent upon selling an existing home Therefore, that is a very major factor in the weakness of new home sales Again, the signals I get suggest that the real estate markets aren't about to improve dramatically soon, even in the Northeast Also, I pick up more and more comments about the fragility of the financial system, particularly from business people--people who are not in a commercial bank or an S&L, but who just seem generally nervous about what's going on And as Dick Syron said, there are more and more suggestions that this ultimately is going to impact the availability of credit, particularly for people who don't have a blue chip credit rating I was at a real estate conference out in balmy California a couple of weeks ago and there was substantial discussion there of the problems coming from the FIRREA legislation and what it's doing in the way of imposing lending limits on S&Ls The banks for some time have had limits on the size of loans that can be made to one borrower But with FIRREA extending that to S&Ls, it has become a big problem for contractors to get financing--at least the same way they used to get it So, there are a lot of things going on out there that in my judgment indicate that the risks--for sure for the next two quarters--are on the low side, the down side I hope I'm wrong, but those are my concerns Thank you   Maybe you didn't pay them on time! "
1158,1989-12-18," I would support your suggestion of an immediate cut in the fed funds rate; in fact, I could even go for 50 basis points, but I won't be a hog and I'll settle for 25 As I said earlier, I think the risks are on the down side I don't see where the strength of the economy is coming from in the next two quarters, and beyond that I'm not sure what's going to provide the impetus for an uptick I'm very concerned about the financial fragility; I'm very concerned that so many people in the business world are sensitive to it It's one thing for me to be and it's another for them to factor that into their decisions And I do believe that lower interest rates would have an impact on the economy before six or nine months go by, even though it probably takes that long to get the full impact I think you would get some impact, particularly on the psychological side So that's my vote "
1225,1990-02-06," I know that several times in the past we have taken into account how well we hit the targets in the previous year,  -26-    2/6-7/90  in terms of whether we should adjust for a miss Now, on M2 we came in about 1/2 percentage point short of the midpoint of the range Is that a close enough hit that it doesn't really enter into this consideration of what we set for '90?   I know we discussed this in the past without having an explicit policy for dealing with it Thank you   It was interesting to see these longer-term projections, but I'm extremely skeptical about our ability to get exact projections out that far In looking at the more near term, whatever ranges we select, we have to make sure first of all that the monetary growth we achieve fits in those ranges Secondly, I think it's very important to allow ourselves some maneuvering room in 1990 just in case the optimists here are wrong and the nervous Nellies are right about the strength of the economy in the next couple of quarters I was impressed by something that Don Kohn wrote on page 16 of the Bluebook which suggests that a 1/2 percentage point shortfall in aggregate demand in the first half of the year would require 7-1/2 percent M2 growth for the year in order to achieve the fourth-quarter level of real GNP in the staff forecast And it seems to me, if I'm  -35-    2/6-7/90  looking at these ranges correctly, that alternative II would not handle that So, I would like to vote for an alternative that doesn't even exist, which is the alternative I version of M2 (3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent) and then for M3 and debt I'd keep the tentative ranges that we adopted last July, just to give us running room through 1990 It doesn't mean anything in terms of my longer-term commitment to price stability   They're also not going to be held accountable "
1226,1990-02-06," John LaWare stole my script We're at the same end of the hall, so I'm a gloomy Gussie I will add just a couple of items to his sad tale One is that I really think the problems in the auto industry are more extensive and more permanent than a lot of people realize I don't think we're going to have layoffs for a couple of weeks and then a pop back If you look at even the transplant numbers carefully, I believe you'll see some adjustments For example, Mazda has cut back on its pace of production--and that's acceptable Japanese, not American junk So, I think one has to pay attention to that Also, I don't believe that the weakness in durables manufacturing is limited to autos Caterpillar Tractor, for one, is experiencing declines in orders from just about all categories of customers They are below the peak levels Also, appliances and [other durables], again these are not auto [unintelligible]  I'm getting more and more concerned about credit availability I think I mentioned a couple of meetings ago that part of [the stringency is due to] the overreaction of examiners; they are scaring the heck out of bankers But, in addition there's the problem in financing developers, and I mean the good developers not the scabby types They are having problems getting financing from the S&Ls and their old sources because of these limits on loan size [Regulators] have taken the national bank limitations and placed them on S&Ls and that's giving developers real problems I think we're going to see this impacting the housing numbers more and more Also, in certain parts of the country I think there is a problem simply in dealing with sick thrifts I've been going back and forth to Arizona to check on my mother and out there 60 percent of the S&L assets in the state are now under conservatorship When the grey panthers are talking about this kind of thing, you know it's a serious problem And dealing with the overseers at these thrifts and conservatorships is different from  -23-    2/6-7/90  dealing with other kinds of managements They have a different outlook Just the decline in real estate values is something that's very significant, and I don't believe it's going to go away soon Many of the gains in employment are in jobs like bankruptcy lawyers and ""undertakers"" hired by the RTC, etc So, I don't find all that growth an optimistic story at all I'm certainly not eager to see a recession but I really feel that over the next couple of quarters we're at risk I hope I'm wrong Thank you very much   No "
1227,1990-02-06," I would still prefer some modest degree of easing From where I sit or stand, I don't see that the slowdown that  -52-    2/6-7/90  we've had in either autos or housing is completely wound up and I do believe that some drop in interest rates, even modest, would help Looking at autos first, the dealers are very reluctant to add to their inventories One of the reasons is the cost of floor planning them One half of 1 percent may not sound like much to us here, but it's real money to those folks So, I think that would be significant I think that housing is very sensitive to the level of interest rates and that the credit availability issue is especially critical--not in financing Mrs Jones who wants to buy a condo but in financing the builders themselves That doesn't show up in these spreads between mortgage rates and T-bills or anything else because that's not what we're measuring We're talking about loans to contractors So, I think that somewhat easier conditions would help both of those industries  If we should tip the economy into a recession, Congressman Neal may still be holding hearings on the need for zero inflation but 434 other people in Congress in the House and 100 people in the Senate are going to be dragging us down there to explain why in an election year they're facing rising amounts of unemployment back in their districts And Congressman Neal--frankly, I don't know the characteristics of his district--may even get some calls Who knows? But I don't think there's that much at risk for this kind of move and it could help in the immediate future On the matter of inflation, I still maintain that we are not able through monetary policy to influence all of the sources of inflationary pressure and that we had better spread the responsibility for fighting inflation over more groups, including the folks under the dome down the street They do a lot of things that contribute to inflation and I don't see how we can offset here all the bad policy moves that come out of the Congress It may sound macho to beat our chest and pretend we can, but I think the cost to the economy of doing this is going to be very, very severe So, I vote for ""A"" "
1291,1990-03-27," I'll move it   I just want to make sure I'm listening correctly to what you said about Drexel When a firm is a primary dealer do I understand that that gives us the authority to advise them on what they do in the area of corporate finance as well as securities? Is that what you're saying?   Right   Where do we overlap the SEC then? Isn't that their basic responsibility to oversee these firms?   Well, that's why I asked to see if I was understanding Peter's comment about junk bond financing correctly Because whether or not they choose to underwrite junk bonds is--   Second    3/27/90 "
1292,1990-03-27," I guess this is directed to Ted I still have a hard time accepting your idea that the dollar will depreciate, even though you're saying you expect it to depreciate less than you had expected a month or so ago I really can't go through this whole scenario and get a depreciating dollar to be consistent with a tighter monetary policy and rising interest rates I just can't seem to get that into my mind as something reasonable I hope you're right because, as you know, I have concerns about our ability to export-- little things like that! I don't have a problem with the outcome; I just am worried about the likelihood of getting it   I'm just nervous about the 7 percent advance in the dollar vis-a-vis the yen since our last meeting It reminds me how difficult it is to get these estimates right even over a short period of time   Thank you   Yes, but actual trade decisions usually are not based on the weighted average; they're based on movements in specific currencies and the arrangements between specific countries   Well, the weights are based on ancient history I think if you look through how they--   All I'm saying, though, is that when you look forward I believe you have to think in terms of a very micro analysis of the foreign exchange markets if you're going to think about what the impact is going to be on our country and our economy   Also, Bob, I think you'll notice that more of our trade is with countries such as Taiwan and Hong Kong, etc And the last I checked, their currencies were not picked up in the weighted average at all   No, I'm talking about that series we run on the weighted average; I didn't think they were in there Anyway, one final question for Mike With tighter monetary conditions assumed and rising interest rates and the FIRREA effect, how are we likely to get housing starts this year of about the same magnitude as last year?   Thank you very much   Coming up or going down?   Did you say auto employment is at a high in your District?   Thank you   You had a sneak preview?   Well, as I think I hinted with my questions earlier, I feel uncertain about the outlook and I hope that what's on these pages from the staff turns out to be right because I believe in having moderate growth I think it's important in many ways to have that happen But I would just like to tick off some concerns I have that I think are going to put these possible outcomes at risk I mentioned the first concern I have the dollar and the issue of whether or not it actually will decline in value relative to the other major currencies If it doesn't, I'm old fashioned enough to believe that that will have an impact on our trade situation on both sides of the equation And that, indeed, concerns me since we are counting on trade to help us, particularly in 1991 Also, despite the fact that  -35-    3/27/90  Russian tanks rolled into Lithuania, I think that we are still going to have some defense cutbacks and some actual cuts in the defense budget I personally don't know how that will play out; I don't know which contracts will be cut back or which bases will be closed, etc But I suspect that when that happens it will show up in somebody's District around the table here and also will impact the aggregates eventually  Also, there's the question of state and local government finance I hear more and more comments about the deterioration in state budgets from the Northeast to the Southwest--all over I met with a legislator from Michigan very recently and they're having to redo their estimates because they were too optimistic about the revenue forecast So, instead of having a comfortable situation, it now doesn't look comfortable I would think that ultimately that would impact either on spending by state and local governments or on their need to raise taxes, neither of which would be supportive of economic activity On the US budget situation, I heard the Rostenkowski name come up, but if we do get a tax hike I don't see that [unintelligible] Is that the correct assumption that you have not built in a tax hike in [your forecast]?   Well, if by some miracle it happens, I would assume it would have some sort of impact Also, I'm extremely concerned about the profit margin squeeze and what it will do; it's already going on and I think it will get worse In my judgment that will have a significant impact on plant and equipment spending of all sorts  Finally, with regard to the credit crunch matter, which we've heard about from a number of people, I think it is going on As Manley said, we talk to a lot of these banker groups that come through and we hear those comments; I also hear them from many business people I've observed recently that banks were even tightening terms on their home equity lines, which of course they have been practically shoveling out the door Now they're using a smaller shovel anyway Certainly, we are all hearing about the commercial lending tightness For auto loans, there's less enthusiasm for the [unintelligible] 6-year or the 5-year loan and the idea is surfacing that maybe you shouldn't make a loan that's longer than the life of the car So there's some tendency, at least among some lenders, to cut that back In the small business arena--I have a lot of friends who are small business people, including my brother--I'm not sure that what's going on is going to show up in the numbers we're looking at because so far a lot of the changes involve the terms or the fact that lenders expect personal guarantees If you have a small corporation they want your personal backing on a loan; there's this desire for extra security to protect the lender It is certainly making business people feel a lot more conservative and I would suggest in some cases rather nervous On the S&L side there's the FIRREA effect in the case of small and medium-size homebuilders and developers--I'm not talking about developers of big projects or major strip shopping centers but about homebuilders And I thought we had a housing shortage, at least in some parts of the country I think it's important to allow builders who have an active market to build those homes Yet these are the ones who are feeling the impact of this single-borrower limit that has  -36-    3/27/90  been imposed on the S&Ls to match the limit on national banks Frankly, I don't think we have much of that built into our housing forecast here And finally, in the case of the captive auto finance companies, they too have been tightening some of their terms and standards; and some of these marginal auto buyers are not going to be able to buy a car because they don't qualify under the new standards whereas they might have under the old, more generous, ones  Frankly, I don't know how all this will play out, but it's just a long enough list of concerns and question marks that I am uncertain and I wouldn't feel comfortable with a 90 degree swing in policy from where we are now I might [not] even feel comfortable with a 5 degree swing, even though I certainly am concerned about the inflation situation But I don't know how to pull out from these reported numbers what is transitory and what is really a fundamental change I'm really impressed with the degree of competitiveness out there in the real world I just don't think we can sit here and assume that every business can say ""Well, my costs are going up so tomorrow I'll just mark up all the prices of everything I sell"" They just don't think that the market conditions would [allow] that   Thank you "
1293,1990-03-27," I would support your position of keeping policy at ""B"" with symmetrical language "
1346,1990-05-15, I'll move them 
1347,1990-05-15," I hate to sound like Ginny Dimwit today, but would you walk me through one more time the sectors that in the next two to four quarters would be taking off, or would be much stronger, with a status quo monetary policy? In other words, exactly which sectors are the ones that we have to restrain? I'm having a problem finding such sectors out there   I would just as soon see us export more, but that's a personal bias   Right   What amount of attention are you paying, then, to the availability of credit in the housing situation? I just hear so often that it's not the price of money or the price of credit as much as it is strictly unavailability   Thank you I hope you're right   It isn't Massachusetts any more?   John LaWare gave my talk, so I'll just piggyback on his Thank you "
1348,1990-05-15," He's also about ready to retire   I would support your position of ""B"" symmetrical I don't think the condition of the economy is that clear Also, I'm very concerned about the fragility of the financial system I'm not just talking about the credit crunch angle, although that's part of it But there are many, many financial institutions out there--S&Ls and banks alike--that are pretty shaky, and there are more on the list of those that will be getting shaky I would like to support Si Keehn's point about the timing If we tighten today, the day of the budget summit, I think we'd look like we had no sense at all So, all that means that I would support your position "
1409,1990-07-02," Move it   I'll move it   Is he in the Senate?   Well, like everybody else here, I think it's great to be a long-range thinker and strategist I'm also looking backward 6 years to the first Humphrey-Hawkins meeting I attended in 1984 Just to remind you folks, we had an M2 range of 6 to 9 percent and we have brought it down to 3 to 7 percent, which is quite a significant change The actual M2 growth ran 77 percent for 1984 and we are estimating it at around 3-1/2 percent this year I think that's very significant Also, these ranges have been moved down very consistently; we haven't had them popping around like popcorn, and I think that's good also On M3 we went from a 6 to 9 percent range down to where we are now, 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent, and the actual growth went from 10-1/2 percent down to an estimated 11 percent this year I'm just mentioning this because there has been a very significant amount of squeezing out of liquidity in the economy over that period So, having pointed that out and looking ahead with respect to the strategies, I'm a baseline strategy supporter With all due respect to the forecasters, I'm just not convinced, looking out 5 years at the additional inflation relief we would get from going the tighter route, that it's worth taking a chance on I realize that's a value judgment; but it's the way I feel I'm also not convinced that tightening policy will generate greater growth out in 1995 So, I would go with strategy I  In terms of the ranges for 1990, I've never supported changing the ranges in the middle of the year; I just don't think it's  -39-    7/2-3/90  a good idea I believe that these ought to be set with some idea of stability and [we should] just keep moving them downward; we can pause [in implementing the] decline, but I just think it's very disruptive to have too much volatility in the ranges themselves So, I would be for keeping the ranges where there are, including the M3 range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent And instead of just dismissing this [shortfall] as a technicality because of RTC activities, I think a big part of the credit crunch story is in here Maybe we ought to look at this and ask ourselves whether we should be satisfied with a 1 percent increase in M3 for 1990 If many people up on the Hill are continuing to get letters from their unhappy constituents, they might be asking that same question or a similar one So, I would support keeping the same ranges for this year that we established earlier And for 1991, I also would keep the same ranges for the main reason that we have another crack at these in February There are a lot of uncertainties about velocity and the economy in general--the RTC activities and a whole lot of other things Therefore, there's something to be said for hanging in there with the existing ranges and then, with six months' additional information and knowledge, if we're off we can adjust them at the next Humphrey-Hawkins meeting Thank you   Five to five "
1410,1990-07-02," Somewhat related to Jerry's question How likely is it, if Congress goes for expenditure cuts on the budget and higher taxes, that that actually would produce a larger deficit because the impact of that fiscal restraint would be to slow growth even further?   And you think the timing would work out and all that?   My second question relates to what I thought I heard you say when you were talking about housing starts I believe you said that you thought the credit availability problems for builders were a one-shot phenomenon I hope that's true, but I'm not sure   Right   Thank you   The people are blase or the outside--   I have a couple of comments First of all, I do agree with Mike and the Greenbook that the economy is sluggish In fact, I would even use the word ""weak"" to describe some sectors I'm pleased to see some of the estimates getting down more in my neighborhood, which is a very low number for economic growth this year  -25-    7/2-3/90  and no growth next year Maybe I'll have some company for next year as well  I will note just a couple of concerns that I have Autos have been mentioned quite a bit, and I too was surprised by the announcement in today's Wall Street Journal about price hikes I checked with two friends of mine, including one who is  and his explanation was that they added on to the sticker so they can give bigger incentives I'm not a marketing person, so you can explain to me later whether that makes sense It still has a negative impact as far as the public is concerned And I don't think it's too bright, especially when some of these same people have been telling me for some time that there has been a problem with sticker shock, particularly in parts of the country where income levels are a lot lower than they are around Washington So, that's a problem Also, the consumer debt load is a growing problem and the auto companies have been having trouble getting some of the would-be buyers qualified to get loans even by their own captive finance companies You would think that they would bend over backwards to get the sale made, but I think that says something On the credit availability side, I picked up some comments that some of the dealers themselves have been kicked out of commercial banks for their floor planning So, credit availability is entering into autos in that way rather than on the individual consumer side I talked with people at has been expected to fill this void by providing funds for floor planning; but because of their own problems, they're not always able to do that And a growing number of car dealers are having financial difficulties, to the point of going bankrupt The number of dealers going bankrupt in the first 6 months of this year is equal to the number that went into bankruptcy in 1987 and 1988 combined and is 50 percent above the number that went bankrupt in all of 1989 So, I think this is getting to be a serious problem and it [unintelligible] in a couple of ways One is that they are not going to be around to make sales; the second is that they're unwilling to come up with a good order stream because they're just so stretched themselves that they cannot afford to carry decent-sized inventories Everything I heard I don't view as a temporary phenomenon--something that's going to go away in the next couple of months, unfortunately Then, of course, the auto makers have the UAW to negotiate with I can't get anybody to admit, by the way, that they're adding to production in order to stockpile; that just does not seem to come through In fact, what I hear more is that they're having a hard time getting enough orders from dealers to do their build out just so they can handle the production for which they already had ordered parts and supplies  Another area I want to say a few words about is housing I probably deal with less-than-spectacular builders, but I don't think the problems are all going to be resolved in a hurry--particularly in smaller towns I don't believe that it is easy just to walk out and find alternative sources of funds Even though it would be nice to assume that, that doesn't seem to be the case A person  just called me this morning from California with another whole raft of stories about small and medium-size builders who are having problems getting financing In some cases they are builders of single-family homes; others are builders of small apartments--10 to 12 unit apartments, not the big ones by developers who have been engaging in all sorts of wild extremes I would like to think that housing  -26-    7/2-3/90  starts have bottomed out, Mike, but I'm not necessarily convinced that that's the case  Finally, on inventories, even though the aggregate numbers may look pretty good, there are growing examples of firms in the retailing industry, and to some extent in manufacturing, whose inventories are creeping up above where they would like to have them So, these are the areas that I'm most concerned about at the moment In looking ahead for 1991, my problem is that I can't see what's going to give this rather sad-sack situation a boost and turn it around, particularly with the talk about the tax hike I had the TV on yesterday and it seemed to me that every program--every one of these ""Face the Nation"" kinds of shows--was going into this subject of the tax hike and President Bush breaking his pledge of no new taxes You would have to be deaf and a low-grade moron to have missed this And I think that is going to have a real impact going forward  On inflation psychology, I talked to the head of a big paper company and I'll just tell you what he said because I remember a year or year and a half ago paper was one of the industries that we worried about having shortages of capacity and that were passing out price hikes with abandon Anyway, he said that they have ample to excess capacity at the moment and that there's nothing in the way of price increases either in the works now or on the horizon Many prices of this particular producer are actually well below where they were a year ago and at the moment some prices are still declining He thinks the rest of 1990 and 1991 should be [a period] of price stability for their whole industry, not just for his company There has been new capacity added in the last year, year and a half, and there is going to be more coming on all the way through 1991 which, of course, will make it still tougher just to pass through any higher costs From his point of view inflation is not a big problem, and he doesn't hear other business people that he speaks with mentioning inflation as a big problem either He thinks the so-called inflation psychology is much more evident in the financial community than in the manufacturing arena And I think he's probably right Thank you "
1411,1990-07-02," Obviously, you know that I'm in favor of easing I'm just sitting here trying to decide what we gain by doing it in a couple of weeks rather than now I'm thinking about the lags that I thought I had been taught about by Don Kohn and his pals Whatever we do today or in two weeks or three weeks is going to impact the economy some time in the future, not immediately The way I read the economy, I'm not sure we have until Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve to have some stimulus actually being felt The employment numbers are not my favorite numbers, but I do read them As I remember, in the April and May statistics the whole show was the hiring of temporary workers by the Census Department And from what I've seen previewed, those folks are leaving; a lot of them--something like 160,000--left in June That number came from Barbara Bryant who heads the Census; it isn't something I just threw out That's going to have an impact on the employment numbers again and not a very good impact Some more of these folks are going to be turned out on the street in July So, I think we're going to get some weaker employment numbers as we go along here Also, I read the retail sales numbers as weak I don't think we have had three months in a row [of weak data] that have been flukes or aberrations; I think there's something going on there I hate to repeat myself unnecessarily, but I believe that this so-called credit crunch has had a big impact on construction in many parts of the country; it's worse certainly in some parts than in others, but it's not confined to New England or Arizona And I don't think that is over as an influence I also believe that lower interest rates amazingly would help the strength of the financial system; it would provide some of the marginal institutions a better chance to make it because it would allow them to get a lower cost of funds rather promptly and improve their margins And I think we need to do that very swiftly I would argue that lower interest rates would help even on the liquidation of the S&Ls by the RTC So, I certainly agree with your notion of some ease, but if I wanted to split hairs--which I won't do; I will support your position--I would feel more comfortable doing it sooner rather than later "
1459,1990-08-21," I have a different question about what I guess I would call a worst-case scenario or ""what if"" games Did you try in your model to see what the impact would be if we had one of these horrendous sequesters that I hear kicked around town--if they knock off $100 billion and send pink slips to the federal employees and things like that?   What is the decision date for this? Is it by October 1 that something has to be done under Gramm-Rudman? Is that the magic time?   With the existing Gramm-Rudman law, what would it take to derail it? Is it a forecast of two quarters of real GNP growth below 1 percent?   My second question in regard to worst-case scenarios involves oil prices Having remembered the difficulties of the 1970s and 1980s in getting even the direction of oil prices right, what would be the impact on the economy of, let's say, a tremendous additional acceleration in oil prices to $35 a barrel because the Iraqis also take over Saudi Arabia or some other major producer? Have you tried any of these scenarios in your model? I'm not saying these are terribly likely outcomes or high probability assumptions but--  -13-    8/21/90   What else could we face that would throw our forecast into the trash can?   Trash can is more appropriate   Well, thank you for playing my game with me   Iraq really needs it, doesn't it?   Every time I come to one of these meetings I am reminded of how difficult it is either to analyze the economy currently or to forecast it This time we've just come through a period of having received these major revisions in the GNP numbers which, at least as I read them, show that we had weaker growth last year than most of us thought we had had Also, the numbers for the first two quarters of this year look rather weak In doing our forecast, I think the uncertainties are really tremendous I mentioned a couple of them in my questions for the gentlemen at the end of the table primarily, the impact of the Middle East situation,  -31-    8/21/90  the budget summit or what might come out of the summit, or how Gramm- Rudman will work and whether or not we'll have a sequester All of those are key unknowns in our forecast I certainly don't pretend to have any answers that are any better than anyone else's It is interesting for someone who has been rather concerned about the signs of weakness in the economy, as I have, to be able to add some more indicators to my list this summer A number of them have been mentioned, so I won't repeat them Also, I think it's interesting that the US Chamber of Commerce has now come up with, and made public, a recession forecast for this year Solomon Brothers economists also are now forecasting a recession  As I compare my own views with the Greenbook presentation, there are a couple of things I would mention One is the area of consumer spending I'm somewhat more negative about that than our official forecast, primarily because of the debt situation Consumers are really loaded up to their eyeballs, I would argue And I think this Middle East mess and what that's doing to consumer confidence is going to result in a chance that their debt problems may even worsen with defaults and delinquencies and those sorts of things Also, I never hear anyone mention the impact of these declining real estate [values] on consumer spending John LaWare and I have talked about it in the past as an influence on the health of the banking system and S&Ls, etc But for the average person, at least the average person I know, the equity in their home is the biggest single item on their personal balance sheet And when the bombs dropped on the values of those homes--they actually are facing declines in real estate values in many parts of the country, except maybe where Bob Parry lives--it made them feel more poor I think that is a bigger impact on the consumer sector than the October 1987 stock market decline The latter impacted people who owned equities, but a lot of other people didn't even know there was anything going on on Wall Street I think the decline in real estate values is far more serious to the consumer and will be a future influence on consumers' willingness and ability to spend  Also, I'm somewhat more concerned about housing and other kinds of construction because I don't think the financing problems that are out there in the real world have been fully reflected in our statistics, particularly the needs of contractors to locate funds to do their construction work I know we've discussed the credit crunch primarily in the context of banks, but it also relates to S&Ls and to the closing of S&Ls and to the limits on loans to a single borrower That is coming in through the back door and impacting on the construction of single-family homes, multifamilies, etc I'm also more concerned about what's going on in state and local governments and their budgetary problems I think we're likely to see either cuts in their expenditures or still more hikes in their taxes We've already seen numerous instances of that but it wouldn't surprise me to see still more And that, of course, impacts those folks who have to pay the tax bills  In terms of why I would just as soon not let us go into a recession, the fragility of the financial system is certainly the big part of that I'm sure that the problems that already exist would be made much, much, much more difficult And a recession would make the US budget far more difficult to deal with and would make the budget deficit much, much bigger As for inflation, if you could guarantee  -32-    8/21/90 -33-  me that a trip through the wringer would cut our inflation rate in half, I might sign on for the ride But I haven't heard anyone try to make that argument Consequently, I am unwilling to take the risk of a recession to get what may be a very modest cut in the inflation rate So many of the sources of inflation that I see are just out of our reach, period--whether it's an action by government or whether it's something that has to do with OPEC or Mother Nature, etc I think we have some impact but we certainly don't have complete control So, I hope that we can come up with a good decision today--one that will help to keep us out of a recession if we're not already in one, though be responsible on the inflation-fighting side "
1460,1990-08-21," I know these are very tough times and it's difficult to come up with accurate forecasts and it's difficult to make good policy And I appreciate your point about the need for stability and the need for some sort of anchor in Washington or something that is viewed as an anchor But having lived on a river for 13 years, I remember that even boats that are anchored move a little; otherwise the line snaps So I think we could move a bit and not be viewed as either irresponsible or reckless and also that it wouldn't turn the financial markets on their ear In fact, it seems to me that a modest move--to me 25 basis points is modest--would offset some of the availability problems that I see in the credit markets And at the same time it would make it easier to do further modest moves in the future as we see the need So my preference would be for some sort of a move that would resemble ""A""  -43-    8/21/90 "
1518,1990-10-02," I'll move   I'm just sitting here listening to Peter and Don talk about this fed funds fixation and the problems [that creates] Are you sort of making the case for prompt release of our minutes? Maybe that would fix it so we could tell people what we're doing rather than make them try to read it from entrails   It would still give them more guidance than they now get where they just really are flying by the seat of their pants   Maybe the Greenbook--   Well, I think we need to give them some more guidance so they don't have to hang on every basis point change [in the funds rate] and try to equate that with a policy move   [That's] why we need to tell them what we're doing "
1519,1990-10-02," I'm back on my housing kick If I'm reading this page correctly, you are estimating housing starts for this present calendar year at 12 million, going down to 115 million next year, with this present quarter actually being the low quarter--although the next quarter is going to be about the same It surprises me that we see this downturn ending so quickly--unless you're a lot more optimistic than I am about the credit situation, which, obviously, you are   Mike, how about this heavy flow of horrible publicity about real estate problems, such as the latest Newsweek cover story If you [don't] own a house, it seems to me you'd get a slight case of cold feet about buying one because it practically guarantees a big loss on your investment, whereas a few years ago practically everyone--especially around this area--who stepped into the housing market expected to make a killing   Isn't that right?   Yes, a bleeding signal   It's small, but it involves a lot of small business people who write their Congressmen   I'm not; it makes no sense here   Thank you   I have just a couple of comments about two industries I've been following closely in the last several months One is autos Quite a bit has been made of the fact that deliveries in August and September have looked pretty healthy, and that has been used as an indicator of consumer spending not falling into a sewer  -31-    10/2/90  someplace What I picked up from some analysts within the industry were two things (1) that the seasonals are atrocious because the auto industry no longer has the regular seasonal swings that it used to, so that applying the seasonal factors that we do doesn't make a lot of sense; and (2) that the auto sales and these deliveries statistics really were distorted this time Si alluded to it, but didn't expand on it They were distorted by fleet deliveries, but these are fleet sales that are controlled by the auto companies themselves, primarily to car rental agencies All of the Big Three own car rental agencies and they use deliveries to them to sort of cook the books, if you want to say that They can more or less determine what kind of sales statistics they want to report by getting either more orders placed or fewer orders placed for their car rental subs And there was an exceptional amount of that done in September for a couple of big reasons One is that they simply didn't have enough orders coming from the traditional sources--purchases by folks like you and me--to get their assembly plants cranked up They needed to get more strength in orders, so they chose to provide it in that way Also, there is this continued push in the industry for market penetration There's a real horse race out there It's as if nobody wants to blink and no one wants to cut back and run the risk of cutting their market share statistics still more So, they are really trying to hold their production up Then there are the rating agencies--Moodys and Standard and Poors--and those folks are really checking carefully on the Big Three these days with threats of downgrading their debt obligations Apparently important factors considered are production and market share as an indication of future viability So, that's another factor entering in Anyway, I was warned by two different people that these statistics should not be taken at face value at all Also, I got an interesting statistic on showroom traffic, which would be the kind the consumer would usually think of; it has dropped substantially to about 15 percent below a year ago And what they call the closure rate, or the number of deals that are actually closed as a percentage of the individuals they deal with, has dropped by 20 percent just in August It was pointed out to me too that inventories are building and that the auto inventories themselves are probably about 4 days above normal and that truck inventories are getting up to about 20 days more than the dealers would like to have  Another industry that I was probing Mike on is homebuilding, because I've been talking to a lot of homebuilders in the last couple of months, and there really is a problem out there The financing situation is getting more and more attention; it started out as an S&L problem in the form of limits on loans to a single borrower but now it has spread way beyond that We are hearing of more and more homebuilders failing and closing their businesses or liquidating, etc Small business groups in general, I think, are showing a lot of nervousness They seem very negative Retailers who are in the small business category seem to be very cautious about their Christmas orders Again, as Bob Boykin said, small businesses always have gripes about getting credit, but I've never heard them as loud as they are this time because now they're talking about having had credit but then the lines were cut So, this is a little different from lack of availability initially And these credit availability problems are way beyond small business Again, we're hearing it from businesses of all sizes and in many different industries  -32-    10/2/90  So, I wouldn't be surprised to see the couple of negative quarters that are shown in the Greenbook I guess what I would be surprised to see is the kind of snapback next year that the staff is assuming I'd like to see it but, frankly, I doubt that it will happen "
1520,1990-10-02," I think it's a holiday   Because they're scared to death of the stock market   I certainly support an easing move, basically because of the spreading weakness in the economy that I think was apparent even before August 2nd, the credit crunch situation, and the fragility of the financial system that doesn't seem to be getting better My preference would be for something called maybe ""A*,"" which would be an immediate 25 basis point cut reflecting those concerns, to be followed by another 25, which would be the reward to the boys on the Hill for doing the budget "
1584,1990-11-13," I'll move  SPEAKER(?) Second   May I just ask one question?   When you alluded to the pressure being put on mutual funds to improve the quality of their--   I figured you meant bank CDs and commercial paper Is that correct?   I guess I didn't realize that the SEC has the authority to manage accounts I thought that the primary purpose of the securities laws required--well, that it was not to tell the managers what to put in their portfolios   But still, they will come back up and make financing problems for the issuers of those--   They figure that out   They'll all be on Christmas vacation so they won't notice!   Can I just ask one question? I think you said we've had this exact sentence since 1982 How many times in that 8- year plus period has the fed funds rate deviated more than 4 percentage points between meetings? It cannot be often   I can't think of one myself "
1585,1990-11-13," But, Roger, that's not true of the suppliers That's the Big Three aspect Between the sub-benefit and the unemployment benefit the auto workers come up to around 95 percent But everybody who feeds into the auto industry--those producing widgets and nuts and bolts and all those things--is not necessarily that protected  -21-    11/13/90   At the beginning of the year when I was trying to get Mike Prell to tell me why I couldn't see the strength in the economy, he sort of suggested kindly that I needed new glasses So, I just wanted you to know that I went to the ophthalmologist two weeks ago and got an exam and a prescription for new strong lenses And now that I can read the numbers they look worse! But seriously, I do get concerned about the numerous signs of weakness in the economy I agree with the staff forecast that we should look at things more modestly than we have been I hope that the weakness doesn't turn out to be still worse than the staff is showing in the Greenbook forecast Business is so bad that I noticed that George McGovern, innkeeper, filed for bankruptcy; maybe that's not a function of the economy but more a function of his competence Also, Lipton is closing a teabag plant in Texas And Mr Forrestal's Peachtree Center in the Sun Belt of Atlanta is being foreclosed on I understand by Equitable So, there are some pretty scary pieces of news around Also, the regional sales numbers really bothered me simply because two major chains that are pretty strong financially showed sales in October that were actually below year-ago levels Even Nordstroms, which is considered a rather superior place and operates in the boom part of the United States that is Bob Parry's District, is talking in less optimistic terms  I'd also like to put in my two bits worth on the auto situation I believe what has happened is that the auto sales figures that are reported really are distorted by deliveries of police cars and cars for corporate fleets, etc Most dealers don't see those deliveries; they go through just a handful So, the average dealer is looking at a showroom which is devoid of much traffic People who do come in are not eager actually to close the deal And the dealer looks out the back door and sees all these cars on the acreage that are not being sold and he is paying interest to carry them So, I think there's good reason for most dealers to be very negative And they are the ones who have to send orders in to the manufacturers or the manufacturers don't have enough to keep their plants running I think that's what is driving these decisions They are not made unilaterally by the car producers; they are based on the orders received from the people out in the so-called trenches If you look at inventories that way, we are not in as good shape as the aggregate figures might suggest  I'm more concerned about the housing situation I think than Michael is, mainly because housing under construction is the sector that really is taking the brunt of the credit crunch, if you care to call it that Also, I think there is going to be a growing problem    11/13/90  coming from state and local governments Now that the elections are over we're going to see some more honest statistics presented They looked pretty bad even before the election, but now that that's behind us I think we're going to see still more states [and cities] that are in not very good condition Mr Boehne's Philadelphia is the greatest basket case, but it's probably going to have some competition   Exactly, the Rotten Apple! Those are some of my concerns Putting this all together, I would love to believe the staff forecast and would love to accept the idea that the improved oil price situation will turn the economy around in a couple of quarters But because I don't believe that the oil price hike is the main problem, I'm not as convinced that having oil prices behave well will turn things around I really think we are going to have to deal with this fragility in the banking system and the credit availability situation or we are going to have something that none of us has seen before Thank you "
1586,1990-11-13," I'll support it, although I wish we could go 50 basis points, maybe just based on my having a negative-- "
1640,1990-12-18," Gretchen, I've always wanted to know how much of the activity in the foreign exchange market involves corporate positioning as opposed to traders who work for money center banks I know that many multinational corporations are having to get involved with foreign exchange more and more as a byproduct of their real work Do you have any sense of how that proportion would fall out?   What made me think of it was that I was talking to a friend of mine who is a corporate treasurer and he was saying that in their shop, which is a very major company, they now have at least one person in the treasurer's office 24 hours a day monitoring what is going on around the world not only because of general interest but also because of their foreign exchange situation That's what made me think that maybe corporations as whole, particularly multinational ones, are more involved than they used to be, say, 10 or 15 years ago   Thank you very much   You mentioned the reserves that institutions would need for clearing purposes and that, obviously, the required reserves also have served that purpose to this point   Who actually will be determining that number? Is that a bank matter? It's not a monetary policy matter   Well, I understand that But I just wondered if the people within the Federal Reserve who are so concerned about the daylight overdraft issue are also going to get involved in setting the numbers or if it would be driven strictly by managerial [decisions]   I have a question that relates to Bob Parry's question involving the relationship between the discount rate and the fed funds rate and also the very low level of borrowing It seems to me that a big part of the so-called reluctance of banks to borrow could be explained by that If you can get fed funds for about the same rate as the discount rate why go through the hassle at the discount window? [Unintelligible] your favorite desk a call We probably will see borrowing go to zip, if we let the fed funds rate and the discount rate coincide   Yes, but I may know an atypical group that has made money--   So move   I'll move that also "
1641,1990-12-18," That's an improvement down 40 to 50 percent?   Just so you'll know, I'm crying not because of the outlook but because I have a virus in my eye Last night when I was reviewing the staff forecast one more time I was reminded of something in my childhood Although it was a long time ago I do remember a few things from it! My mother always read to me every night and I had a strong preference for stories that had ""they lived happily ever after"" kinds of endings I feel the same way about the forecast I really do love the ones that are positive, optimistic, and happy So, I have no problem [with the forecast] And that's why I would remind you that at the beginning of the year, when we had the soft landing scenario which was marvelous because it accomplished all our goals with no pain, no strain, no sweat, that was terrific But it sounded too good to be true and what I have discovered is that if things sound too good to be true there is often a problem So while this forecast isn't [unintelligible] scenario, it still isn't a dismal forecast I hope that what is in the Greenbook turns out to be right But I'll just mention some of the questions I have about the numbers, even though, as I said, I hope that Mike's and his staff's assumptions are on target rather than mine  First of all, I really sense that whatever it is we're in now--I call it a recession--it's going to be longer and more serious than the Greenbook suggests One thing I'm more concerned about is consumption As you know, I've been taking a more dismal view of the auto industry for some months now, and I think that some of my concerns are [now] rather evident to the public at large And I don't see what is going to turn that around really quickly Also, in the consumption arena I am concerned about the nature of the layoffs that we're seeing around the country; it's not just Joe on the line at the Rouge, the blue collar types I used to assume would be laid off But that didn't have the same impact as when the sales vice president of some company who lives next door loses his job or a bank president loses his job or in some states bureaucrats are being laid off That sends a different message and I think it's having a big impact even on the people who are still working  Also, there is the deterioration in confidence I'm from a state where confidence is usually negative because the state's economy is very cyclical, so I'm used to a lack of confidence and nervousness and all that But I've never seen anything like what I'm seeing now And I'm not confining my remarks to Michigan at all; it's widespread and is impacting ordinary individuals who just have this feeling that something isn't right They don't necessarily know what it is that's wrong, but they just feel uncomfortable I know that it's nice to assume that that's a fallout from Saddam Hussein and the higher gasoline prices and the worries over availability of oil, but my sense is that if all those things were taken care of [unintelligible] this afternoon and whatever it takes to solve this problem were done, this would not go away completely Also, you don't hear much about it, but there is a real problem with the consumer debt load I used to nag our researchers about looking at the consumer debt load and was told that the two sides of the balance sheet were okay--that the assets were building at the same time as the debt load was, so forget it But it is a problem now, at least for a lot of individual consumers And I think some of the delinquency and loan write-off data suggest that In fact Sunday night I happened to have my TV on and one of the  -22-    12/18/90  PB evangelists came on and his wife was announcing that in January they're going to run some seminars for their parishioners to tell them how to get out of debt in 1991 Now, that says something to me It has even become a moral issue!  Also, we are being hit by very much higher taxes in this country I realize we've just seen a nickel a gallon increase on gasoline so far, but that budget deal has a lot more coming up That may help the budget deficit, but I don't think it's going to be a positive for consumer behavior And at various state levels, there are substantially higher tax hikes down the pike We saw a lot of tax hikes in 1990 and I believe we're going to see still more in 1991 because so many states and cities and other localities do have budgetary problems So, I just feel very concerned that the consumption side is going to be weaker than we're assuming  Housing has gone down rapidly We're now down again to where we were back in the 1981-82 recession--depression for my part of the world That's where we are already It seems to me that the so- called credit crunch has been especially tough in this arena; it has been centered on the home builder, not Mrs Jones who needs to get a mortgage to buy a house It's the financing for the person who wants to build the darn thing Again, I hope I'm not being too negative but I just don't see what's out there that's going to turn that credit availability problem around really soon for those kinds of folks If I'm right that that's a big constraint, then I don't know what's going to turn this around  On exports, I would just repeat what Jerry said In talking to people who actually export rather than to academic analysts, I think the opportunities for 1991 look a little less robust And when I think about the shape of the economies of some of our major trading partners such as Canada, which is already in a serious recession, it makes me agree with the folks who are in the business Also, I realize we're running a sort of war in the Middle East, but I think there are still some defense cuts coming through, which will have an impact on places like sunny California and have already had some effect in the Northeast So, those are some of my concerns And what I think is really unique this time, though--to borrow the term of my favorite peanut farmer--is this general malaise that seems to exist throughout the land It's hitting individuals as consumers but also as businessmen and women Personally, in my life time, I have never seen it that way  On the financial fragility issue, there is this drumbeat-- which unfortunately is coming out of Washington, DC--about the problems of the financial industry If we could put a gag or a muzzle or something like that on some of these people so they would shut up, maybe this problem would be less severe But we haven't, and the awareness of this is just becoming a big problem and in turn is tied into the so-called credit crunch And as I already have mentioned a number of times, there is the special situation in real estate, the deflation in real estate values Unless you go back to the 1930s, I don't think you will see anything like it My good friend Wayne Angell in his comments used +5 and +10 percent figures; you'd get some exciting numbers if you used -15 percent Thank you "
1642,1990-12-18," You must have been in the Christmas punch!   I enthusiastically support a move toward ease, and tomorrow I will vote in favor of a discount rate cut because I think one of the reasons for the lack of confidence in business communities is the feeling that somehow or other a lot of people in Washington don't know what's going on I think this would be a kind of discreet action It wouldn't be so discreet that no one would know it, but it would be something that would fit on the front page of the newspapers and, therefore, would be communicated all over the country and not just to fed watchers And that would help a great deal I'm not a betting woman, but to answer Don Kohn's question If this goes across the wire tomorrow at 930 am, we'll see the prime rate cut announcements starting about 942 am "
1709,1991-02-05," As Mr Greenspan says--I shouldn't call him chairman at this point--we have to select a new chairman and vice chairman for this FOMC year I would entertain a motion for chairman   Yes    2/5-6/91   Okay, thank you May I have a second or some more nominations?  SPEAKER(?) Second   All in favor?  SEVERAL Aye, aye   Thank you   Right Now we need a nomination for vice chairman, please   All right Any additional nominations?   Thank you All in favor?  SEVERAL Aye, aye   Thank you I guess we have our officers   I was going to push Kansas City!   I'll move it   Second   Can you open the [discount] window at night so they won't been seen going in? Would that help?   I'll move it   I agree with the argument  that stability is good  and that there is great uncertainty  But I was just looking at  Appendix B [in the Bluebook]--I  realize this is ancient history but   I  do pay attention to the monetary aggregates and the targets we set--  and I just thought I'd remind you about M2  growth, looking back In  1988 we missed the midpoint  on the low side; in   1989 we missed the  midpoint on the low side; and last year we missed the midpoint  on the  low side And to me, at some point anyway, there ought to be an effort to think about at least a modest catching up I guess that is  the main reason, along with the desire for some stability, that I  would prefer to carry forward  the targets that we had for last   year  rather than use the tentative  ranges that were set last July   for this  year I think we've been assuming our targets were half-way  appropriate but we've been low-balling it right along I remember  a  few years ago, when Beryl Sprinkel was at the CEA, he made  some pass  at that idea in one of the Economic  Reports to the President Anyhow,  I just feel more comfortable not drawing a line at  the end of each  calendar year and acting  as if January 1 isn't related   to December 31  So, I would go with a  mix, using alternative   III for M2 and  alternative I for M3 That would just carry  last year's ranges  forward, which is a nonexistent  alternative   Oh, I can go with alternative I "
1710,1991-02-05," They put it on the desert to keep down the dust!   How many people do they employ?   I think most of my points have been made--12 times--but I will start off just by explaining an experience I had when I dug into my files to see what I had sent in this time last year for a forecast because I try to key off that when I do the next go- around Last year I was the source of the low end of the range, in  -37-    2/5-6/91  case any of you have forgotten I had 1 percent real growth fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter, which was off the bottom of the chart And what is making me nervous is that that turned out to be too high; as you know, it came in at about 3 percent Anyway, having said that, I love Mike's forecast and I hope it is realized Even though I'm leaving, I certainly hope that this is what materializes But I must say that I'm a little skeptical that it will  I'll just mention a couple of things One relates to the assumed bottoming out of housing or the investment in residential structures I realize I'm biased because I just met with a couple hundred homebuilders last month, but I really think there is a problem there I think the credit crunch is still present in that industry, particularly on the side of builder financing The United States is a big country and housing markets are local; there are zillions of them They are not all like Boston or Denver or Dallas There really is a housing shortage, especially in low and moderate income housing We can use some more structures So, I hate to dismiss this as something that we don't need to be concerned about And I don't believe that we've seen the bottom yet on this; I don't think it's going to bottom out in the second quarter because of this credit situation Also, on the consumer side I would love to see the consumer come roaring back into the stores It used to be VE day or VJ day--I'm aging myself; I don't know what this would be--[VS] or something   VI or VIQ Anyhow, I would love to assume that [that will happen] I have no idea when the war will end but, whenever it does, I just don't think that in and of itself is going to cure all the consumer confidence problems because I think part of the confidence problem involves the war but another big part involves this continuing flow of bad news about the financial system It's like having cold water run down your back continually and a lot of people are reacting that way That's part of it, but also consumers are still very overloaded with accumulated debts I saw in one of the presentations the quality of consumer debt deteriorating, mortgage defaults growing, and that sort of thing So, I just don't think consumers are in shape to run right out and go on a spending spree if they feel like it  Finally, on the assumption that exports are really going to carry a big part of the load again, I would like to assume that I'm impressed with how we have gotten our exports turned around But as I hear about the conditions in other countries, such as Canada, that are our major trading partners and I think about their problems, I just wonder how strong those markets are going to be and, therefore, whether our exporters--no matter how good they are and how good their products are--in fact can achieve these kinds of results Anyway, this certainly would be my preferred outcome; there's no doubt about it But I just have a feeling that the timing is somewhat too optimistic and that whenever the bottom does occur the rebound from that low point will be more gradual and less sharp "
1711,1991-02-05," I support your view, Mr Chairman, but I would say that the risk is definitely on the low side if for no other reason than the auto industry situation As you know, it's responsible for the biggest chunk of the decline in the fourth quarter Both auto  -58-    2/5-6/91  sales and production in my judgment are going to be a disaster in this quarter and right now I can't think what is going to bring them off the floor in the next quarter That is simply one reason In addition, there is the confidence factor I think that is partially related to CNN and the Gulf War but I think there's another big chunk coming just from this nervousness over the financial system I wish that weren't the case but I think it is Certainly, a lot of easing has been done But in order to compensate for the credit crunch, which in my judgment is definitely out there, there will be a need to do still more to offset that I think it would be good to look at Jerry's idea, too; it strikes me as sort of extraordinary to accommodate a special challenge of this nature, which I haven't seen since the 1930s So, I would go with [alternative B], asymmetric toward ease   Shouldn't we also move up monetary aggregates then, Mike?   As I've sat and listened here today, that has received a lot of discussion   May I just ask one question? Has there ever been a directive put out that just went one way? In other words, do we really think that in the next six weeks or so greater reserve restraint might be pursued?   I'm just asking if that is true; that's all I'm saying   This isn't a criticism I'm just asking if that has ever been done   Thank you "
