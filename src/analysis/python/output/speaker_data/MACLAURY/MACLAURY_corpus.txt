  Alan, you mentioned in your comments that we had no requests from  the Bank of England for a drawing  I just wanted to ask whether we had done any anticipatory  thinking as to how we might react to such a request for a drawing by the British, and can you cite  conversations that, given a new budget, that this might  provide the sources for intervening    I want to weigh in on the side of saying that the outlook is stronger  than the Greenbook forecast  Our research staff in Minneapolis had revised upward its first- quarter figures before we got the Commerce Department figures  And therefore we were very  surprised to see the Board staff going in the opposite direction on that occasion    And as you know, for the past six months or so, we have been more bullish both  [unintelligible] as to real output for the four or six quarters than had been the Board’s staff  I  think we were more confirmed in that view, and I have been hesitant to even use the numbers     4/20/76 - 12 -           that we have been developing, but now that we are looking at the year 1976 over 1975, we are on  the order of real growth at a 7-1/2 [percent] rate rather than a 6 percent rate, which is what the  Board has on a year-over-year basis     I had not heard the kind of comments that Willis Winn just reported to us about shortages  and allocation, but I do think that the expectation is of a pick-up around the world, not just in the  United States  The signs are coming in of greater strength in Europe and Japan  And while it is  too soon to talk about a cumulative boom, I think that there’s a greater risk that we will be facing  boom conditions by this time in ’77 than that there will be any petering out    John Balles reminded me of a question with his question on staff on  the Hill  The news releases from the Senate Budget Committee came out with a more  expansionary fiscal policy than the President had proposed  [It was] argued in the press release  that this was less inflationary and [provided] more real bang for the buck in terms of real growth   I think they argued it on the basis that they were not going to have higher payroll taxes, which  would in turn be passed directly on in price increases  I wonder what the staff felt about this line  of argument  Was this a strictly political document in that context or was there some truth to it?    But as you extend your experiment in that fashion, it gets increasingly  hard to say what might have been because you start with a base and you get a little further away  from it unless you are taking one-month chunks  But to know after five months of experiment  where you would have been--I think it is relatively easy with one month and relatively more  difficult as you expand that experiment   SPEAKER(?)  The more difficult the more important   SPEAKER(?)  He has to keep track of--     4/20/76 - 16 -            A year-over-year figure rather than the quarterly--    Right    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I certainly support your suggestions as to  the ranges  I came prepared to argue for a 4 to 7 percent, in other words, a 1/2 [percentage point]  down on both sides of M1 and M2--it does really matter  But my conviction that we ought to be  working with narrower ranges rather than wider ranges makes me very content to accept a one- sided reduction this time around     I also agree with Chuck Partee’s first reservation, in particular, namely, that we should be  doing this in the belief that the Greenbook forecast is too low, and I subscribe to that idea too     A couple of points on your reasons, which you may or may not have a [unintelligible] of,  and you may or may not use with the Congress itself in your testimony  It seems to me we  should be leery of accepting the argument you cited on the con side, that we can afford sustained  rapid growth now because we have some catching up to do  I’m reluctant to give credence to  that kind of an argument, and specifically because I believe that our forecasts, our expectations  today, have built into them whatever has happened in the past  And we are looking at a GNP  forecast predicated on those factors having been built in, so there’s no case therefore for  compensating today for what has already transpired     And the other point, just to strengthen perhaps or add a different angle to one of your pros   It seems to me that the kind of range that we’re talking about today is a very different number  than the same number that we adduced a year ago because our expectations of--     I didn’t say it very well  What I had in mind is that our expectations  for inflation in the year ahead are lower than our expectations were when we first announced  these targets back in March of 1975; that 6 percent today is not the same 6 percent as it was a  year ago; and that we have a very legitimate case for saying that we can finance as much or more  real growth today with the kind of numbers that we are talking than we could have last year  I  think that’s an important rationale for now trying to capture some of that advantage that we’ve  already gotten in the way of reduced inflation    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to associate myself with  something that Paul Volcker said at the outset, namely, that the path laid out for us by the staff  on table 4(a) of the aggregates for M1 or M2 under alternative B just seems to me not realistic   To start out the second quarter with a 7 percent annual rate and to expect that, given the strength  of the economy as I see it--and I’m much more confident about that than Chuck Partee seems to  be--that we’re going to have 5 percent annual rates of growth by the fourth and first quarter of  next year--I don’t think that’s likely to transpire     I think that it’s much more likely to be on the higher side  The pressure certainly will be  for faster rates of growth than that, at least that’s my expectation, and for that reason I, too, like  Paul, would like to see us begin to move in the direction of allowing, and I think that’s the key  word, “allowing,” some increase in interest rates     Therefore, I don’t buy his prescription as to how it happens  I think, for political reasons,  it’s very important that we continue to attach some significance to these aggregates and let  interest rates, in effect, move as we try to pursue those aggregates  I recognize that we are in a  bit of a box on this because the aggregates have behaved erratically over the past year, but I have  not convinced myself that 4 equals 8 yet  I’ve managed to stretch myself to--     Well, I recognize that that’s the point you have made, but I find that I  can’t go along with it, at least for a policy decision  I’m as far as saying 4 equals 6 in this kind  of a context  So, to be specific, then, I also, growing out of this feeling, have not liked our  setting 4 percentage point ranges for your short-term targets and then 2 percentage point zones of  indifference     I would prefer, therefore, the prescription to follow a modified alternative B, but call it 5 to  7 percent for M1, and that would, so far as I’m concerned, be a zone of indifference  I would not  move the funds rate within that range--and similar kinds of ranges for M2, 8-1/2 to 10-1/2  And     4/20/76 - 42 -           a funds rate range of 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 because I agree with you, I am not interested in seeing a big  movement upward in short-term rates  But I am interested in beginning to see a move in short- term rates if that comes about because aggregates are growing faster than this range of 5 to  7 percent that I would like to specify for M1    You left the range wide and I would prefer that--    I called it a modified alternative B    Now, on the funds rate range, you see, the lower end is B and you can  call it whatever you wish    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation  Before I  came down I had some nostalgia for the Memorandum of Discussion, but I haven’t read the  memorandum  I think it’s a very reasonable kind of suggestion     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ve been thinking about the Sunshine in  Government [bill] today, and in that context, my wonder is that, were the bill to pass as it  presently is being proposed, am I correct in thinking that we would be required to keep a  verbatim transcript?  And if so, wouldn’t that make moot this question of whether we drop the  Memorandum of Discussion?  That’s my question    But perhaps Henry’s point could be put a different way that would  serve both of your principles, and that is that the interpretation of the existing facts by the staff  and by the members is what is new information to anyone outside of this group, and the question  is whether that information should be supplemented, not to say padded      My question was on the conceptual framework of this capacity index   The public gets it, and the way we talk about it, not in detail, is as a percentage of capacity  utilization overall, and then by industry--which implies what is of course not true, that there is  some sort of absolute level of capacity in each industry  And I think that that way of thinking  about it gives rise to a feeling that until one reaches 100 percent, then price pressures are  relatively easy, and then after 100 percent it becomes a skyrocket  And we get a lot of  uninformed comment based upon that kind of a concept      No, we don’t, but my question really is whether there is any practical  or feasible way of constructing the index or an index based upon increasingly less efficient plant  utilization so that one gets an immediate index, if you will, of the price pressures that would  result from the use of increasingly inefficient plant     I am with Lyle on that  I think our directors probably would share the  same sentiments that have been expressed by other directors, but I think they’re just wrong     In the same kind of context, I think you have been looking at--but I  don’t know the status--the extent to which corporations are holding their compensating balances  in the form of nonnegotiable CDs to reduce the reserve requirements for the commercial banks    Thank you, Mr Chairman As you know, the view from the North  Country for some months has been that the economy is stronger than the staff had been  forecasting, and I think we are still in that extended position of believing that the staff is  underestimating the strength of the recovery over the next four quarters  I can’t see any risk of  aborting recovery or substantially damaging confidence by continuing gradually to show some  resistance to the kind of monetary aggregates [growth] we have been getting in the last couple of  months Indeed, on the contrary, as I think you said, Mr Chairman, the country has looked to us  for a resistance to the resurgence of inflation, and I think we ought to continue  We may indeed  inspire sustained confidence by continuing to act as we have, and by that I mean resisting  monetary aggregate growth that seems on the high side     I’ve been impressed in the Bluebook this time by two points in particular  On page 8, it  points out the path for the year ahead, given what looks like, at the bottom of that page, a 9-1/2  to 10 percent rate of growth for M1 in the second quarter  It points out that, for the following  three quarters, one has to look at a 4-1/4 percent rate of growth if the midpoint is to be hit for a  year as a whole I think that’s significant     And similarly, on appendix table 4, toward the back--it’s not a numbered page--it is  likewise important  [It is] projections and therefore has to be given a degree of uncertainty, but it  points out that for the various alternatives, alternative C at the moment, with a funds rate path for  the second quarter of 5-3/8, leads to a lower funds rate range throughout the year than either of  the other alternatives  And that impresses me, and I happen to believe that it’s correct       5/18/76 - 44 -         And it’s for that reason that I am inclined to buy--not alternative C in its pure form,  because I think that going above 6 would be undesirable in the funds rate at this point in time   But since I endemically would prefer narrower monetary aggregate ranges and wider funds rate  ranges--not that I deviate very far from what’s been said--but for an M1, I would like to see a 5  to 8 percent kind of a range, 3 percentage points rather than the 4, and similarly for M2, maybe 6  to 9  And for the funds rate range, it seems to me 5 to 6 percent, where Governor Jackson came  out, is the place I, too, would like to [come out]    This is not something we have to do, but it’s just a suggestion I’d like  to make  In the Bluebook, I find the charts on the monetary aggregates particularly un-useful   They tell us nothing, at least in my view, and I would like to suggest that the staff consider  alternative charts taking into account those that John Balles has prepared as perhaps more  meaningful to the group  It’s just a suggestion, and I’d like to hear some comment about what  might be more useful to the group over time--     I was going to ask, Mr Chairman, if Tom could tell us anything about  the case cited in the covering letter, of Buckley v Valeo, or whether that’s even worth taking the  time to do now     6/22/76 - 4 -            Thank you, Tom    I was just going to ask, to the extent that OPEC countries’ sterling  balances seem to have been a major part of the pressures on sterling before the package, whether  they continue to be described as continuing commercial selling in the market following the  package    In the case of diversification of previous sterling holders, do we have  any [unintelligible] as to whether they are diversifying into dollars or into a broader range of  currencies or into marks, or yen, or is it unknown?    On that same point, I think the answer would obviously depend upon  the extent to which we were prepared to follow the nonborrowed target regardless of day-to-day  variations in the funds rate  The answer you gave, it seems to me, implied that we would  certainly be giving less weight to day-to-day stability of the funds rate and therefore [creating]  greater difficulty in tracking exactly what we had in mind     I think that likewise has a bearing upon what so-called experts or professionals in the  market can read from early disclosure of our decisions here  Will we be following a  nonborrowed reserves target and allowing the funds rate to move in a wider range than we now  do, day to day?  It seems to me [that then] it would be much more difficult for the professionals  to follow what we were doing or benefit or profit thereby even if we were to release our targets  quickly     SPEAKER(?)  I think that’s a good point--    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I likewise share what seems to be the  consensus view of the economic outlook  This is just a pause  On the funds rate range, I think  we should be consistent  If we are going to narrow the range to as small as 5-1/4 to 5-3/4, which  I think is reasonable under current conditions, then we ought to use a money market directive  rather than an aggregates directive  I think that’s simply more consistent with the facts  I think     6/22/76 - 31 -           we are going to end up as Chuck indicated, forgiving or forgetting April’s bulge and not trying to  retrace our steps as we go down the pike, and that would give us some leeway later on     I think likewise if we are going to use this narrowed range for the funds rate, perhaps  there’s something to be said for what I think was a pattern we set at our last meeting of keeping  our two-month targets consistent with our long-run targets  I like that idea and I would like to  reiterate it at this time, particularly if we are going to use, as I say, the narrower funds range  It  seems to me we can then stick with a narrower and lower money supply target, and I would  simply buy the 4-1/2 to 7 percent range, rather than the 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent     Mr Chairman, isn’t also another point on this, that if we got as high  as 6 with the funds rate, it calls into question the discount rate, which is 5-1/2  I think that  becomes a potentially more pressing issue, and you may or may not want to contemplate a  discrete overt move that would be interpreted as tightening      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Phil, I wonder whether the Supreme  Court analogy is apt or exact enough  I personally have not made up my mind  I don’t feel  strongly one way or the other on the substance of the issue of whether we reconsider our decision  or not  But in some sense this whole judicial system as I understand it is set up so that the final  court of appeals is the Supreme Court, and their word, so to speak, is the last word     I don’t think anyone has quite accorded this group that same distinction or place in our  system  We are accustomed to being second guessed from beginning to end, and therefore,  maybe the arguments by which we arrive at our conclusion are just fodder for second guessing in  the press or otherwise, whereas the Supreme Court has spoken and there’s not much point [to  seeing a transcript] because there’s no place else to go  That’s my only comment on that  particular analogy    In that context, though, one of the things that we did discuss a good  deal in arriving at this conclusion, one of the things that we cannot really discuss except in  executive session, is the role of the Government in the Sunshine bill, and not just the particular  bill but where we stand on the court suit that was brought by the Georgetown lawyers  And,  frankly, I have lost track of where that stands, that court test of our disclosure of the minutes of  January 1975  I would just like to be brought up to date if I could  I do think that it has some  relevance for our consideration  And then, finally, I’m just musing personally about whether or  not the Memorandum of Discussion for the year 1972 might not have been a useful document in  the public domain to somehow dispel all of these false accusations about--    Right, but I’m just thinking in terms of the future as well  We have  been subject to charges that we were politically motivated, partisanly motivated in 1972, charges  which I know to be entirely false  And it seems to me that the Memorandum of Discussion is  perhaps the only document to which historians can look for some sort of truth in that particular  issue  We can make all of the protestations we want  I just put that on the table  I don’t know  what it implies, but I think it’s something to be considered in our discussion    I thought that was one of the strong points you made, Mr Chairman,  in your comment  The criticism was that the first examples [of the expanded Record of Policy  Actions] were very bland, and your comment was that you can’t be less bland than the  discussion  And I think in that context the reverse is also implied, that if there are dissents or  discussions, that those will be fully put on the record, and I would hope that that is really the  answer to the criticism of these two gentlemen  And maybe that would be said in the letter    How might the LDC’s [less-developed countries] feel about that  issue?  They must be--    I find myself very much in sympathy with what Roger has just said   First of all, I start out with you, Mr Chairman  I can’t tell you really why I think the economic  outlook is going to be stronger than the Greenbook forecast  Chuck has given us a couple of  potential reasons, but it’s my guess that it will turn out to be stronger  And furthermore, I think  we have been happily surprised, at least in the wage rate area, that we have not seen the kinds of  increases that we might have expected, and we can argue there that the prospect for inflation is  better; at least we have a better basis for our expectations than we had before     I point out that the way we have been moving the M1 range down 1/2 point on one end,  and the next [on the other] end, if my arithmetic is correct, gives us 1 percentage point per year   If we were to do that continuously over time, well, if we’re 4-1/2 to 7 now in ’76, we’d be at  2-1/2 to 5 in ’78, and so on  It would take us a very long time, even if we continuously followed  this pattern that we have  We could accelerate that at some point if it seemed necessary     The last point, I guess, is that it will be more difficult in October-November of election  time to make a further adjustment downward in the M1 range than it is to do so today  And I  think, therefore, for these various reasons, I would opt for a 1/2 point reduction in the upper end  of the range today      That would ease to some extent that dilemma, as I see it, if that could  be worked out  I think I would still stick with the suggestion, but I don’t feel all that strongly  about it     A couple of points on John Balles’s comments  I have felt, as I said before, that the  moving base is a bit of a problem  Rather than taking a fixed basis, as John suggests, I’ve always  been more sympathetic to the idea of starting our targets in terms of dollar levels, which do not  move when the basis moves out a year       7/19-20/76 - 51 -   And secondly, the market overreaction  I think Henry’s put his finger on it exactly  It  doesn’t matter so much what kind of average we publish  I agree with Lyle that as a longer  average it’ll be largely ignored  But [it is] rather our method of operation, and so long as we pay  as much attention to the funds rate as our [unintelligible] and hold it in its narrow range as we  have been doing, the market will be very understandably but incorrectly looking to this linkage  that we have ourselves created  I think the only way we can prevent overreaction to moves in the  funds rate is to be less circumscribed in those movements ourselves  I just want to reinforce  what Henry said    Two wrongs don’t make a right   SPEAKER(?)  It’s more flexible    I’d like to associate myself with Henry Wallich’s point, and Phil’s  likewise  a zone of indifference  I don’t think we are debating it now, but that’s the direction in  which I would like to move; maybe a half a point fed funds rate zone of indifference     It seems to me that the Wednesday phenomenon is instructive in this connection  The  market did not react at all, as far as I know, to the fact that the funds rate got out of our supposed     7/19-20/76 - 69 -   range of concern on Wednesday because they know that we don’t react, and it doesn’t mean  anything  And I would think that that could gradually be broadened to be not just a Wednesday  phenomenon but a Monday through Friday phenomenon within a more limited band  My own  preference here--if we were looking for a compromise, [then] a compromise to me does seem  like a 5 to 5-3/4 federal funds rate this time  That may not be totally consistent, but it’s working  out     I wish you could have given us your suggestion at 930, Mr  Chairman, because I really feel that today was a day when I didn’t have anything to add to the  discussion  I’m perfectly content with B  I would like to ask, if I may, when we as a Committee  are going to have that discussion of our operating methods     Can I ask Governor Wallich, is the certification of Witteveen in some  sense [similar to] the indications of the [US] Comptroller of the Currency as to the viability or  solvency of banks?  That’s one question, and the second one is do we have any--    The other question was--maybe that will then rest as a rhetorical  question--in our swap drawings, there’s no question as to the fact that there will be no exchange  losses to the Federal Reserve in the repayment of these drawings?  No splitting of losses or  anything?    Is there any reluctance on the part of the capital markets to provide  the funds that the Mexicans continue seeking?    But in a floating [exchange rate] world, really you have to ask  yourself what takeout with gold or with an IMF drawing or anything else in some sense means   It seems to me that what we would be talking about now is, one, getting the debt off our books;  but, second, the losses that we would incur as an institution in doing that  And if Henry and Alan  are right, that the Treasury is prepared to take the debt off our hands at the rate at which it’s on  our books, then we have as much of a guarantee, it seems to me, for both things as we had with  the Fowler letter--which strikes me as being pretty much a dead letter philosophically, and not  just by virtue of the course of events in the meantime    First of all, Mr Chairman, could I get a clarification of your proposal  on the funds rate range?  I’m confused as to whether you’re speaking of a 4-3/4 to 5-3/4 range as  proposed in the Bluebook or 5 to 5-1/2 as was mentioned by someone else here  I think they’re  both centered on the 5-1/4, but I’m not sure which you were proposing in terms of the width    The narrower range    Well, in that context, if I may carry on  I certainly agree with your  optimism about the economic outlook  I guess I am closer to the staff on its inflation outlook,  and we will see where that comes out next year  The M ranges that you proposed are fine, I  think  If I understood Phil’s suggestion, I would not wish to disregard the whole range of 4 to 8  on the Ms or whatever else is consistent and let the funds rate in effect be led by the market  I  think we have more or less agreed to a system of operation of linking movements of the  aggregates to our funds rate, and until we have this debate that I also hope we have soon on our  procedures, that we would not change that markedly  On the funds range, in the meantime, I  think that my feeling is that we are in a less sensitive position and that we ought to, in my view,  go back to a wider range of 4-3/4 to 5-3/4, centered on the 5-1/4    Exactly  Very much so  Much more so     I want to ask Peter about the comment that he had made on the  volume of repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements  Did I understand that now  these are made in some rather sizable amounts, not only to even out what we think we know  about technical factors in the market, but also the market’s perception of what the reserve  availability is?  It seems to me this is one step further that we are going in the direction of  maintaining a constant fed funds rate  Is that the intent of these additional repos?    I have a couple of questions, Lyle  The extent to which the housing  starts in the multifamily area picked up [in] the latest month reported was surprising, and I  wondered whether artificial stimulus from government programs was playing any major part in  explaining why multifamily starts seemed to be racing ahead?    I’m trying to remember which are the latest starts figures  I think we  would have September by now, wouldn’t we?     10/19/76 - 11 -    I do not have those  It must be August that I had in mind    My second question was--    My second question, then, had to do with the lag in government  expenditures, which Lyle has already told us he has not been able to pierce the veil on--as others  apparently have not--as to why this $13 billion rate of lag  I suppose that makes it impossible to  say whether this is likely to be reversed, whether we’re going to come back to sort of a trend  path, whether we’re going to make up for past undershoots without knowing what’s the cause of  it  I suppose there’s nothing that can be said in that respect, but I’m still very curious, and the  effect of that lag on output and the lag in the economy as a whole  I thought that the Greenbook  was implying that the lag was in interest payments on the national debt and in transfer payments  to state and local governments    Thank you    Just a very brief comment  Paul Volcker has already brought out the  fact that nonagricultural income has been rising in the last couple of months--I don’t know, I  would say by a rather decent rate  The 86 percent in August and 89 percent in September--that  has very mixed implications for our District, as it does for Roger Guffey’s  It means that the  agricultural sector at the moment is, I think, bearing the brunt--and [with] the drought in our area  in particular  We see a very substantial difference in retail sales in the purely agricultural areas  of our District from the more industrialized or evenly spread industry of the Twin Cities      A large difference, yes  Retail sales are definitely sluggish in those  centers that depend upon the agricultural sector, including, of course, sales of farm implements,  as I think Roger mentioned  That’s sluggish  On the other hand, I’d like to give one other straw  to Willis Winn’s point about retail sales  One of our directors mentioned last Thursday that, in  the first two weeks of October, one of the national retailers based in our District has seen a  substantial pickup in retail sales  Not just in our District but, I assume, in the stores around the  nation  His stores around the nation doesn’t add all that much  And one other straw on that  same side  Capital spending by one of our large computer firms based locally had been held  back substantially  And the member who’s on our board who had been pessimistic about capital  spending up until now said that he was beginning to see a turn, in that the orders for computers  were coming in rather substantially, and he was feeling better about that than he had up until  now      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think I’m a little closer on the  aggregates to Paul Volcker  As I recall, I’d take the 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 [for M1]  I think especially--I  know this anticipates out next discussion on the long-run aggregates--but if we do move down  the longer-term Ml, then it would be in my view a little inconsistent to be moving up in the short  range, despite Chuck’s point about shortfalls just seen with our short-term ranges for M1  So I’d  like 4-1/2 to 8-1/2, and 8-1/2 to 12-1/2 for M2  I like your range [for the federal funds rate] of  4-1/2 to 5-1/4, but I would move within the first week to 4-7/8 as the midpoint      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I guess I’m with Chuck so far as Ml is  concerned  I have been a partisan, as you know, of this knocking down on the Ml in particular,  but I think that as things seem today, this would be interpreted as an inappropriate time to do  that, and I would concur in that judgment as things stand today  So I would stick with the 4-1/2  to 7 [for M1], mainly for the public interpretation aspects of it On the other Ms, I think I again  follow Chuck’s idea of going back to a new 7-1/2 to 10 and 9 to 12 as consistent with the  seemingly different relationship between the Ml and M2 figures      If I may very briefly  Having sat around this table for many years, I  can’t remember many occasions in which anybody has changed his mind as a result of the  discussion  But I would like to avow that at the moment and say that, listening to the discussion,  I have changed my mind, and I think that technicalities are pushing us in the direction of  reducing the range of Ml in comparison with the other Ms  Likewise the technicalities according  to the preliminary impression you gave us today is telling us that Ml now means something more  if it is adjusted for the shifting to [the nontransaction component of] M2 than the basic numbers  imply  Therefore I’d like to, I think this is consistent, accept your proposal for 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 but  offset the psychological effects of announcing a downward revision there by a 1/2 point increase   in the other two Ms       As I remember our last spot takeout--in fact, for a short time, at least,  it was the ESF--the Exchange Stabilization Fund--that took us out  Were they then funded by a  drawing on the IMF?  Is that the sequence of events, that’s, in other words--    But it didn’t go that way, and at the moment, what is the status of the  Mexican ability to draw on the IMF?  Can we look to that as a takeout this time around, or are  we on a limb?    The treatment of the separate file on personnel matters and protection  at the Banks--are those minutes to be held here at the Board of Governors?    I wish I had a better reason to feel that we may be overly pessimistic  in our comments  The one thing that John Williams mentioned was the drought in his  areas--[our drought] has colored the sentiment in the upper Midwest particularly  It has persisted  and it is now really very severe  It affects a couple of our states in particular, two or three   Certainly retail sales, agricultural implement sales--I think I said this last month--have been very  seriously affected by the drought per se, which is not a national phenomenon  That was coupled,  of course, [with] the large harvests [which] have generally put their considerable squeeze on  agriculture in our District     Retail sales--I think you mentioned, Mr Chairman, [unintelligible] and his figures, perhaps  in the last two or three weeks, I guess three or four weeks, those have softened a little bit  In  other words, that steady uptick from two years ago that had impressed him has now faltered  slightly  I think that’s the only way to put it, faltered slightly  It’s not a downturn by any means,  but it’s not the persistent uptrend that he had mentioned to us a month ago     I say all of that, and that’s sort of on the downside, and yet I say my feeling is that,  [although] this uncertainty is pervasive, it seems to me that it could go either way, and I guess I  would disagree with Lyle’s feeling  I would have a different feeling  With the markdowns that  have now taken place in the Board’s staff estimates of the outlook over the last two  months--those markdowns are really quite substantial, $16 billion or so, I think, in final product  at the end of ’77--I think it could as likely turn out that that now is on the too-bearish side; and     11/16/76 - 24 -           the foundation in terms of income, liquidity in the economy, is there  And if we can get some  confidence started one way or another, it seems to me that it’s very uncertain which way we go   I would not consider it more likely to be bearish than to be bullish    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I find myself in virtually total agreement  with the specifications you gave and the reasoning for those specifications  On the discount rate,  I would certainly favor, at this point, a 1/4 point reduction  I realize that there are a number of  interpretations that one could give to a discount rate reduction  But I would see it as a modest  stimulus to confidence, and it seems to me that’s [what] we are talking about at the moment,  trying to find ways in which we can bolster confidence [so] that the future will be less bleak than  the staff projections or others are predicting     And in that context, I guess, given Mr Gardner’s comment about my wishy-washiness on  my earlier intervention, I ought to say that I share Bob Black’s feeling, and yours, I guess, Mr  Chairman, that the staff projections are too low  That doesn’t mean that I’m far above them, but  it indeed says that if I were at a 5-1/2 percent kind of real GNP rate for ’77, then you’d still argue  that that’s too low given the circumstances  So it does not trouble me at all to see us indulge in a  mild easing at the moment, and that’s I guess how I’d interpret your specifications     One of the most difficult cases that I can think of is when the Federal  Reserve with the Treasury’s blessing has borrowed under a swap arrangement and then the  Federal Reserve Bank, or Federal Reserve System itself, has an obligation outstanding to repay   And history has shown that there have been occasions like that when the Treasury has not been  willing to provide reserve assets when that was a case in point, when that was relevant, and was  urging us to simply roll over our indebtedness to foreign central banks when we were disinclined  to do that  I think that’s one of the more difficult areas to deal with     And yet even looking at that, I guess I have to say that I don’t think we have room for  independence of action beyond what we have already asserted in buying currencies in the  market  But much as I share Phil’s wish that we could find a different word, I think this  effectively characterizes the relationship    Well, Governor Partee called upon those of us who [unintelligible]  nevertheless to speak up, and I do so only to respond to that call  I find myself very much in  sympathy with the Greenbook forecast at this point, and I think maybe what should be worried  about [is] our consensus, but I am part of that consensus    In some ways I wish, at this last opportunity, to say something wise,  insightful, or controversial, but I could think of [nothing] wise, insightful, or controversial to say   As the members around this table know, when I have felt that we were going astray, I have not  hesitated to say so  But at this time I very much share the Chairman’s summary of where the  economy is at [and] where we are at with respect to our part in seeing that the economy evolves   I would share therefore the general thrust of alternative B at this time     My sense is one of relief that the economic indicators are now pointing in the direction that  I felt instinctively, or by the seat of the pants, they should have been pointing earlier  I don’t  know that I have revised upward my feeling of where the economy is heading, but I certainly  have somewhat more confidence now that that relative optimism was justified  I think that the  case for some of the fiscal stimulus, which is not our prerogative, after all, is as the Chairman  described it--pervasive if not correct  I guess I would say that I think it is correct as well without  trying to get into the specifics of how that stimulus ought to be structured  I was struck by the  Chairman’s question, I guess it was last month, as to whether there is a lack of liquidity, or what  more could be accomplished by trying to put more liquidity into the economy, and I found  myself unable to give a positive response that there would be much to be gained  In fact, I felt,  to the contrary, that there might be something to be lost     On structural matters, taking advantage of the opportunity the Chairman has provided me,  I would like to urge once again, more in the spirit of yesterday afternoon’s conversation, that we  expand the funds range a bit when an opportunity exists, and not be afraid to move it  I have  certainly been among those who have viewed the greater emphasis on the monetary aggregates  as useful but perhaps in a different way than the monetarists do  Not because I think there is  great stability between any particular aggregate and the economy  I think the experience of the  past year or year and a half has amply demonstrated that that stability does not exist  And I share  the Chairman’s view that the technological, structural changes that are taking place make it  particularly perilous to link ourselves to an aggregate or a set of aggregates in any sort of a  slavish way       12/20-21/76 - 62 -         Rather, it has seemed to me [that from] a rather political point of view, dealing with the  Congress, the public in general, that the aggregates, in an admittedly oversimplified way,  distracted some overattention to interest rates and our impact upon interest rates; that we could  explain to the public what we were doing by reference to the aggregates in a way that seemed to  make at least structural sense  And that, therefore, when the time came for raising interest rates  we could adhere to and speak in terms of the aggregates     Likewise, I think around this table my feeling has been that if we can avoid being caught in  our own rhetoric by overemphasis on the aggregates, [they give] us a reason for moving interest  rates up or down more rapidly in the face of changing economic circumstances than we were  inclined to in the past when we were not focusing on the aggregates the way we have been in the  recent few years  In that last sense, I will align myself with Henry Wallich’s comments of last  evening, that my hope will be that there will be a willingness to allow interest rates--short-term  interest rates--to move, move rather more rapidly if the economic circumstances seem to call for  it at the moment  I think that’s not the case now, and, as I say, in the short-run I share fully the  Chairman’s view of the outlook and our part in it  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I’m not going to try to revise or change my views on the basis of  these relatively minor differences  One thought that occurred to me during the conversation  though--we are very much aiming at a funds rate target today and we are likely to do that much  of the time  And the suggestion for widening the band on the Ms ranges is consistent with the  focus on the funds rate  And Paul Volcker’s “viscosity” [concept]--as we move away from a  particular rate also emphasizes that  My concern--I think Chuck Partee mentioned, for example,  that he wished we had a better view of the appropriateness of a given relationship between M2 or  M3 and the economy--my concern is that I wish we had some sort of a guide as to what the  appropriate funds rate is, for the rate of movement in the funds rate, if we are going to continue  to focus on--as I think we are doing--the funds rate as our handle  I feel even more at sea, I  guess I would say, with the inappropriate [connection] between movement in the funds rate and  the economic consequences thereof than I do with the imperfect M2
