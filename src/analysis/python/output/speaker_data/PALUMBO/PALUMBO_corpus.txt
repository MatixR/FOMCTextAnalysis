  Exhibit 3 turns to the outlook for consumer spending, first by   describing some aspects of the substantial financial adjustment—most notably, the   “deleveraging”—undertaken by households since the onset of financial turmoil  As   you can see in the top left panel, the personal saving rate shifted up from close to   1 percent in early 2008 to above 4 percent late last year  We expect the saving rate to   remain in the neighborhood of 4 percent over the medium term  The right-hand panel   shows that the rise in personal saving appears to reflect a broader retrenchment in the   household sector, evidenced by a substantial reduction in the rate of household   borrowing  Household debt climbed at double-digit rates from 2003 to 2006 but   decelerated sharply in 2007 and 2008 and then contracted about 2 percent last year    A consequence of the recent deleveraging by households can be seen in the middle   left panel  Aggregate debt service payments—that is, required principal and interest   on existing household debt—dropped from almost 14 percent of disposable income in   early 2008 to about 12½ percent last quarter, leaving the debt service ratio at a level   last seen in early 2001  We expect this ratio to decrease somewhat further through   the end of next year, as growth of disposable income outpaces household borrowing              Turning to the right, the combination of steep decreases in home prices and stock   prices cut the ratio of household net worth to disposable income from its elevated   level of nearly 6½ in 2007 to 4½ in early 2009  Since then, home prices have   flattened out and stock prices have rebounded, returning the ratio of net worth to   income close to its long-run average level, roughly where we expect it to stay over the   projection period   The bottom left panel provides some perspective on the behavior of consumer   spending over the course of the current business cycle  The black line shows data and   our forecast for real PCE, and the red line shows the level of spending from a   simulation based on one of our forecasting models that conditions only on the   realized and projected values for household wealth, income, and interest rates  (The   main takeaway points are noted to the right)  The chart shows that consumer   spending began to fall short of the simulation in 2007 and then dropped far below it in   2008 and early 2009  We think that the sharp tightening in mortgage and consumer   credit and heightened anxiety about the potential depth of the recession and job loss   (as evidenced by the outsized decline that occurred in consumer sentiment) played   important roles in the “shortfall” in spending  We expect consumer spending to   continue to accelerate over the course of this year and in 2011, as wealth and income   become more supportive of growth and as consumers regain confidence and credit   becomes more available   Exhibit 4 covers real estate markets and construction activity  Existing-home   prices, shown in the top left panel, dropped back last quarter, as we expected, after   popping up in the second and third quarters  Looking ahead, we expect prices   nationwide to be about flat over the projection period, reflecting continued downward   pressure from the supply side of the housing market that we think will be roughly   offset by improvements on the demand side  One indication of an abundant supply of   homes on the market is the Census Bureau’s “homeowner vacancy rate” (the blue line   January 26–27, 2010 100 of 260    in the panel to the right), which has remained unusually high despite being down   from its peak  In addition, the black dashed line shows that the volume of foreclosure   starts picked up over the latter half of 2009, and we expect them to recede only a little   this year and next, adding to the supply of homes for sale over time  On the demand   side, sales of existing homes fell back last month, broadly consistent with   November’s drop in the pending-sales index and the notion that some of the earlier   surge in sales was induced by the homebuyer tax credit  Nonetheless, as noted in the   middle left panel, the volume of existing-home sales rose noticeably over the second   half of last year, with demand evidently lifted by the combination of low conforming   mortgages rates and low home prices  In addition, a growing sense that prices may   have bottomed out in many parts of the country and a gradual increase in employment   in coming quarters should contribute to rising demand            Turning to the market for new construction, the blue line in the right-hand panel   shows that sales of new single-family homes moved roughly sideways over the   second half of 2009, after having increased last spring  Nonetheless, as shown by the   beige shaded area, construction has been well below sales for more than two years,   resulting in a sizable liquidation of the inventory of new homes for sale  Indeed, as   the inset box reports, the inventory of new homes for sale fell from 545,000 in May   2007 to just 235,000 in November, the lowest reading in any month since 1971  With   inventories so lean, we expect construction to move up toward the level of sales   during the next few quarters  We expect the stronger overall macroeconomic   conditions in 2011 to generate a rising demand for new homes that should provide a   further impetus to residential construction   The outlook for nonresidential construction is gloomier  The bottom left panel   shows that vacancy rates continued to rise through the end of last year, and prices of   commercial properties fell a bit more  As noted to the right, amid these very weak   fundamentals, respondents to the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, on   net, reported expecting the performance of their commercial mortgages to deteriorate   further this year  Also, relatively large net fractions of bank loan officers reported   having continued to tighten CRE lending standards in recent months, as well as a   further weakening in demand for these loans  Against this backdrop, we expect   nonresidential investment (outside of drilling and mining) to fall around 7 percent this   year and to inch down in 2011   A theme that continues to pervade much of the recent commentary about the   macroeconomy is that conditions appear to be worse for small businesses than for   large firms  The top left panel of exhibit 5 shows that, in December’s NFIB survey,   the fraction of respondents reporting plans for capital expenditures in the next six   months (the blue line) remained quite low, whereas the fraction reporting credit   becoming more difficult to obtain (in red) stayed high  That said, tight credit supply   is probably not the only or even the principal factor holding down their capital   spending plans  Indeed, when asked about the most important problem they face,   many more small business owners cited “weak customer demand” than cited   “financing conditions”   January 26–27, 2010 101 of 260                          Meanwhile, as Brian mentioned yesterday, spreads on triple-B-rated and high-  yield corporate bonds—plotted to the right—dropped further in recent weeks and are   now at levels last seen in late 2007  Solid corporate balance sheets and scant defaults   in recent months appear to have encouraged investors   Turning to the outlook for equipment and software investment, the middle left   panel notes a few findings from the Reserve Bank survey about firms’ plans for   capital spending this year  Looking across the responses collected by all of the   Reserve Banks, almost 40 percent of firms reported that they plan to increase   equipment spending, while just under 20 percent reported that they plan to decrease   spending  The most commonly cited factors by firms reporting plans to increase   investment were an expectation of strong sales growth and the need to replace IT   equipment   Information about the high-tech sector from other sources has also been upbeat of   late  In the middle right panel, you can see that in the NABE survey released on   Monday, more respondents expected increases in IT spending this year than expected   decreases—a finding that is consistent with corporate reports indicating an expansion   of IT budgets in 2010  Other reports suggest that tech spending that tends to be   driven by telecommunications “traffic”—such as servers and communications   equipment—is expected to continue rising robustly, while spending typically driven   by “headcount”—such as personal computers and the local network gear connecting   them—is more likely to pick up steam later on   As can be seen in the bottom left panel, we now estimate that investment in   equipment and software climbed at an annual rate of 12½ percent last quarter—much   stronger than we projected in the December Greenbook, particularly in the   transportation and high-tech categories  Looking ahead, with solid increases in   business sales and profits, strong replacement demand, and relatively inexpensive   bond-market finance, we expect increases in equipment and software investment to   average about 14 percent this year and next   The right-hand panel provides some perspective on the recent investment data and   our projection  The very short bar toward the right indicates that the meager amount   of gross investment undertaken in 2008 and much of 2009 was probably barely   enough to cover depreciation, so that, by our estimates, the real stock of equipment   and software was almost unchanged over those two years—something not seen since   World War II  Moreover, even with the double-digit growth rates of E&S spending   projected for this year and next, the level of investment will still be quite low,   resulting in very sluggish growth of the real E&S capital stock  Dan will continue our   briefing on the domestic outlook       We get reports that are mixed  Some reports will be explicitly about   global cap-ex or global IT, and we will report those as distinct from our more domestic reports    We can usually parse the pieces, but most of what I was referring to were domestic plans for   domestic spending  There is an import component to that spending, which is another piece, so   it’s not all domestic production  But we also think that domestic production in the high-tech area   has already been accelerating and that the plans are to continue to accelerate  So we have some   ability to parse those things, but they are really broad indicators as opposed to anything that   would add up to something that shows up in the national accounts     The conceptual differences are fairly small  Both of the measures are   missing lots of important pieces of data  The flow of funds accounts are missing a tremendous   amount of data for the third quarter  The quarterly variation in the flow of funds saving rate is   even more residually derived than the national income accounts saving rate  We don’t take very   much signal from the quarterly pattern at all  Nonetheless, as you suggested, over longer periods   of time, they move generally together  They tell similar rather than dissimilar stories  I haven’t   looked at a detailed parsing from the most recent data to see what was going on in the third   quarter   December 13, 2011 21 of 198              One of the things that is conceptually different in the saving rates is the way that the   accounting of liabilities on the household balance sheet works into flow of funds saving versus   the expenditure-based measure in the NIPAs  It’s possible that is still driving a wedge that’s   making the flow of funds saving rate higher  Essentially, households are still having a large   amount of debt charged off their balance sheets; that could show up as a saving concept in the   flow of funds accounts, but not necessarily so in the national income accounts  But I don’t think   that’s a third-quarter source of difference  In general, we don’t put a lot of signal content on the   quarterly frequency flow of funds data, especially on these early vintages where there’s a lot of   missing information It’s something that I generally pay only a little bit of attention to     Actually, the headline measures of the saving rates from the flow of   funds accounts do not have a capital gains component in them  The only real conceptual   difference is with regard to net investment in consumer durable goods, and we even show a   number in the table that takes out our estimate of that bit  The other thing that can be an issue—  as I think I suggested—was how the charge-offs end up being a form of saving in the flow of   funds accounts  I don’t think that has a counterpart in the national income accounts, but the   capital gains—depending on what they are reporting, and I think they are reporting the flow of   funds saving basis—is not in there
