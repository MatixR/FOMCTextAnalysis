 What about in relation to sterling?   That may indicate whether or not it is related to oil   That's not oil   That's right   I have two questions about the forecast If you were to take another look at your forecast for the third quarter-- incorporating the most recent data with regard to employment, retail sales, and production--do you think the number you'd come up with would be higher? And is it possible that the weakest quarter of the year, in fact, could turn out to be the second quarter?   My second question involves inflation You have a very sharp drop-off, as you did last month, in the second half's inflation rate in terms of the GNP fixed-weight deflator It seems a little surprising to me, particularly given the revisions to GNP data that we saw in the last month and also the somewhat brighter glow to the economic statistics I'm not sure I understand what's causing that   But you have more than a doubling of the growth rate of PCE, and final sales are up very substantially in the third quarter   Not in the third quarter   Mr Chairman, our forecast is in basic agreement with the Greenbook forecast, but I'd agree that the risks, in terms of growth, are on the upside, for many of the reasons that have been mentioned For example, we have assumed the $25 billion deficit- reduction measures which are indicated in the Greenbook, and it's possible that some portion of those measures will not be enacted That's another area, in this case resulting from the government sector, where we could see a greater boost to GNP, at least until some of the secondary impacts of a greater deficit are felt Moreover, when we look at the 12th District, the data to us, particularly in the area of employment and retail sales, indicate strong growth And the discussions I've had over the past month with directors--not only at the head office but also at our four branches--indicate a greater optimism about business prospects than I have ever seen in the year and a half that I've been with the System I'm more pessimistic on inflation than the Greenbook, since I believe that the fixed-weight price index will continue to advance at a 4 to 4-1/2 percent rate in the last half of this year and remain in that range in 1988 It seems to me that recent tightening in labor markets raises the chances of price increases in 1988, and it certainly heightens my longer-run concerns about inflation It would appear to me that, at this point, our room to maneuver is rather limited, with the labor market around full employment, nominal short-term interest rates rising about 100 basis points next year--at least in our forecast--and real interest rates rising only slightly The current forecast that we have and the one that is in the Greenbook hold out little or no prospect of the inflation rate subsiding in the near future   Mr Chairman, I believe a strong case can be made for alternative C and I would characterize that, at least in terms of anticipated effects on interest rates, as being a small move In July, several Committee members expressed the view that a tighter policy would be necessary in the coming months and I think developments since then strengthen that view Most data released since our last meeting suggest that the economy and inflationary pressures are picking up Inflation in the first half was over 4 percent and real growth was at a very strong 3-1/2 percent rate Data that we have seen so far on economic activity in July--particularly employment data, retail sales, industrial production--indicate that the economy remains strong in the current quarter Given that it takes a long time for our actions to affect inflation, I believe we should make a policy adjustment If we delay much longer, until inflation has really gained momentum, more severe action will be required to bring inflation under control For those reasons I would support the adoption of alternative C as presented by the staff   $700 million   Peter, has there been much discussion of the impact of higher interest rates on Treasury requirements? One hears a lot of discussion from the Administration recently about the deficit, at least in fiscal 1987, being somewhat lower than their estimates because of revenues going up But I don't hear much discussion of the impact of higher interest rates on future requirements   I would like to ask two questions about your assumption with regard to fiscal policy This time, as has been the case in the past, there is an assumption that there are spending cuts of around $25 billion I think there is a substantial risk that that will not materialize Some work we have done suggests that if policy is accommodative and you don't get that $25 billion deduction in spending, that it could add approximately a percentage point to growth in 1988 and a half percentage point to inflation Would you think that to be roughly [the magnitude]?   You don't get the $25 billion reduction; you get zero    9/22/87   One further question I notice the change in the assumption you have made with regard to the size of the deficit I guess it would primarily be the higher interest rate assumption over the forecast horizon Does that feed back into income? In other words, is the loop closed in the model so that you get higher growth of disposable income as a result of the higher interest payments on the deficit?   But the underlying inflation must pick up quite a bit, because you have a marked acceleration in labor costs   I just want to raise an issue to shed a little light on this concern about a slowing in the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy, such as housing It seems to me that with the economy operating where it is, in terms of employment at least, if we did not get that slowing in the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy at the same time we are going to get the strength in net exports, we would have a real problem So, one can be concerned about the implications for housing or for other sectors but the picture doesn't really fit together very well if you don't get that kind of slump And I would assume that's the problem   Mr Chairman, with regard to your question about real rates, we look at it in two different ways first of all, through a model approach and, secondly, at the survey that is referred to as the Hoey survey from Drexel Burnham Lambert Both of these give us a similar reading with regard to your question In both of those instances, much of the increase in nominal rates has produced an increase in real rates For example, the Hoey survey shows an increase of only two tenths of 1 percent in inflationary expectations between January and June So, in effect, what we got was a very sharp increase in real bond rates when we saw bond rates increase so sharply in the April-May period This has a big impact on our forecast--and I think also on the Board staff's forecast--because it does damp the growth of the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy In some respects, I draw a little comfort from that because we also have strong growth in the net export area and, in effect, it is the weakness in the interest-sensitive sectors that makes room for this growth in net exports  With regard to our forecast more generally, we estimate that real growth will average between 2-1/2 and 3 percent over the forecast period We have actually shaded slightly our expectations with regard to net exports, but we still have real net exports contributing approximately 1 percent to real GNP growth, both this year and next year Also, and here we have somewhat of a difference with the Greenbook forecast, we have greater strength in consumption in next year's economy than the Greenbook forecast That has something to do with differences about the growth of real disposable income, if I'm not mistaken We are concerned about the inflationary impact, not only of our own forecast but also that of the Greenbook As you know, in the Greenbook forecast, inflation averages 4 to 4-1/2 percent, at least in terms of the fixed-weight deflator; and we are not much different from that But what concerns us is that, in some respects, the composition of that inflation in our forecast changes rather dramatically We are somewhere in a zone close to full employment, at least according to our staff work, and thus, in our forecast and in the Greenbook forecast as well, wage costs begin to accelerate To the extent that the inflation in 1988 is more a function of what I would characterize as underlying factors and less a function of some of the temporary factors that we drew on this year, we think that the inflation problem will become more persistent Finally, I do think that in some important respects, the risks to the outlook are on the upside with regard to real growth and perhaps in inflation as well My primary concern here centers around government spending because I think that the assumption of the $25 billion cut used both by us and in the Greenbook may not materialize And if it does not, then we are likely to get more strength from that sector than is included in our forecast Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, at this meeting, I certainly could support alternative B, but I do have a preference for alternative C, for many of the reasons that I mentioned in the go around The prospect, in my view, is for growth in aggregate demand at, or above, long-run potential Given the fact that the economy is operating in the zone of full employment, this strength in demand, in combination with the declining value of the dollar can be expected to put upward pressures on prices Also, growth in labor costs, which is part of our forecast and that of the Board staff's as well, should lead to an underlying inflation rate that is higher in 1988 Moreover, this inflation prospect could be significantly worsened if the expected reduction in Federal government spending does not materialize Given that it takes a long time for our actions to affect inflation, it is important, in my view, that we not delay until inflation already shows signs of becoming more persistent Finally, I'd make the point that, if I read footnote 1 on page 10 correctly, it looks to me like, in the not too distant future, alternative C is assumed by the Greenbook, as it is in our forecast So when we talk about the economy and its performance, and particularly the Greenbook forecast, please keep in mind that that assumes alternative C in the not too distant future At least that's the way I read that footnote   Doesn't the futures market support that conclusion?   I have a question about borrowing Since October 19th there has been a change in the willingness to borrow What are    11/3/87  your assumptions about how the demand for borrowing may change over the next week or two? Are you assuming that basically the shift is going to continue over that period or that there is going to be a restoration of more normal relations?   Wouldn't that suggest that as long as there is that uncertainty it's probably wiser to focus on rates rather than borrowing levels?   I'm sorry, I'm not used to using words like that!   Probably 7 percent or a little below   That's what I think   Mr Chairman, I have a comment and two questions concerning the Greenbook forecast My comment considering the modest wealth and cost of capital effects of the stock market decline, and also what is referred to as an expected appreciable fall in interest rates, it's surprising to me to see real growth for 1988 at less than 2 percent Now, my first question deals with real disposable income We have talked about this in the past but I think it has even greater importance today Real disposable income in the Greenbook forecast rises so slowly relative to real GNP that I really doubt that that forecast will occur The difference in growth rates is 12 percentage points In our forecast, there's a difference of one tenth of a point; in the Blue Chip consensus of 30 economists, it's two tenths of a point A distinction of that magnitude is, I think, pretty much without historical precedent It is my understanding that the way that occurs is that you have an increase in inflation as a result of higher import prices, which causes the PCE deflator to rise very substantially relative to the GNP deflator And, as I am sure you know, the relationship between the PCE deflator and the GNP deflator is one of the most stable relationships we have We looked back to 1973 and that relationship varied between 988 and 1021 In the forecast, it gets up to 1026, which is an incredibly high level I don't think it has ever been that high And my question is If you had a ratio between the PCE deflator and the GNP deflator which is more traditional, how would that affect the staff's forecast of both?   No I think what happens in their forecast is that the higher import prices show up very dramatically on the consumption side but not on the investment side   Well, perhaps this will happen, but I don't think it has happened to date I'm not sure I will have to look at the 1987 data; I'm not sure we agree on that in the second half   The statistical work that we have done indicates that all of the increase in the PCE over that period that you just cited can be attributed to oil and none of it to foreign exchange   Yes, but it depends on the lag, of course   It's a difference in the forecast   It appears to me that recent developments have had a very substantial impact on [your forecast for] final sales and inventories in the fourth quarter There's a very large impact on inventories in the fourth quarter and then these unintended inventories are worked down over 1988 and that's in large part why growth is so weak in 1988 Why is there such a large impact on final  -14-    11/3/87  sales in the fourth quarter, given the assumptions about modest impacts of wealth and cost of capital effects in recent developments and also the lower interest rate? What if you have an inventory situation that really colors that entire forecast very substantially through the end of 1988?   With regard to developments in the Twelfth District, I think economic conditions remain relatively upbeat and, at this point, very few effects of recent financial developments have shown up yet But, it's clearly too early to see the real effects We are, however, seeing broad-based effects of the reduced value of the dollar, in addition to the greater exports of lumber and selected agricultural products that I mentioned previously For example, a Utah steel plant which was formerly owned by US Steel recently reopened and it was interesting to note that part of the decision to reopen was based upon a German firm's five-year commitment to buy 40 percent of the plant's production I think that is rather interesting In addition, the price of titanium dioxide, which is a key ingredient in paint, has increased substantially due to the dollar's decline; and a major paint manufacturer in our District is turning increasingly to domestic suppliers So wherever we look, we seem to be seeing some effects of the declining value of the dollar in terms of expanded export opportunities or increased import substitution  With regard to the overall economic outlook, we estimate that the wealth and cost of equity capital effects of the stock market decline would reduce real GNP by slightly less than 1 percentage point, assuming an unchanged path for interest rates Given the easing that has already occurred and the expected lower path for interest rates that is mentioned in the Greenbook, we would have  -16-    11/3/87  growth closer to 2-1/2 percent than 2 percent and the employment rate basically unchanged   Why is there such a significant change going from November to December?   Yes M1, and a little on--   All right   Mr Chairman, I would favor Bluebook alternative "B", which I would interpret to mean a funds rate of around 6-3/4 to 7 percent It seems to me that with rates at that lower level relative to what we had been looking at six weeks ago, we will offset most of the negative effects of what has happened in the stock market In addition, I would favor Variant I and it seems to me that, given the uncertainties, symmetrical language would be appropriate  -33-    11/3/87   Symmetrical   I think that would make some sense   If your concern is about the dollar why would you then go in that direction?   Would one be willing to say instead of "may call for" just "calls for"?  SPEAKER(?) Sure   That barn door is no wider now that it has been for years   I think so  SPEAKER(?) I think that would, though   There was the additional problem, too, of knowing what rate to aim at That isn't obvious There was a reluctance, I think, in that period, to move the rate sufficiently And secondly, there was some considerable uncertainty about what would be the appropriate rate if one had the will   I wouldn't change the current operating procedures either I think the experience with fed funds targeting was not very good and it seems to me that, for the time being, we ought to stick with these procedures Hopefully, some time in the future we'll be able to move more in a direction of using aggregates I don't want more meetings   That represented a significant downward revision from January   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy continues to exhibit strength and we see few signs of weakness A particularly encouraging sign is the apparent broadening of the expansion throughout the region States that have had weak or negative growth because of problems in agriculture, mining, and energy are now growing Manufacturing is enjoying strong growth, especially in export- and resource-related areas In our view, this expansion does not appear to be threatened by excessive inventories Our sources generally indicate inventories are at or below desired levels It appears as though retailers followed a more cautious inventory- stocking policy following the stock market decline in October  Looking at the national economy, our forecast is for less growth in 1988 than in the Greenbook and about the same growth in 1989 Differences in our forecast center around the size of inventory adjustments and the amount of improvement in net exports But, it seems to me that the important point is that both forecasts indicate reasonably strong growth this year and next I feel that both our inflation forecast and that of the Greenbook are very distressing, especially for 1989 It seems to me that the prospect of compensation per hour rising and approaching 5 percent in 1989 is intolerable, if indeed, our objective is to move gradually to price stability   I've seen some sensitivity tests for and if you have interest rates go up a full percentage point, it would accelerate their losses substantially   All right   Mr Chairman, it seems to me that two significant developments have occurred since our last meeting that have a bearing on this policy discussion First, economic activity is stronger, and prospects are that growth will be more robust between now and the end of 1989 than was anticipated in mid-February Second, since the growth is occurring with the economy operating in an area close to full employment, the prospects for inflation have worsened Most disturbing to me is the possibility that increases in labor costs will be rising at more rapid rates Such a development would be a major setback to our inflation--  [Secretary's note The transcript ends at this point owing to a malfunction of the recording equipment]  -54-       Mr Chairman, you asked us to comment specifically about inventories I think that there probably is some indication of accumulated inventories that are imported goods, and that's in response to higher prices With regard to other goods, my recollection of that period in the late '70s when that occurred is that that is a bit of a lagging factor What usually happens is that we get some pickup in the price indexes and that begins to fuel expectations; and we don't get the really rapid accumulation of inventories until somewhat later And if that, in fact, is correct, I think maybe waiting for that as an indicator might be a little dangerous   Is that right?   Well, I thought there was more of a delay   In any case, as I see the developments, particularly the ones we've mentioned--unemployment, capacity utilization, M2, the positioning in the aggregates--it seems to me that there is a very strong case to support Bluebook alternative C In fact, I can't imagine a more convincing case being put before us than the one that was put before us by the staff There was general agreement with the staff's forecast; some questioning about it But it seems to me that it is explicit in the staff's forecast that if we delay in taking action, we're going to pay a price later--conceivably, based upon what we know, in terms of having to move even more aggressively I know it has been mentioned that we've moved twice recently Those two moves of 1/4 of a percentage point just don't do much And I remember earlier times when, to get any significant impacts on the economy, one would have had to move a lot more than a 1/4 of a point So, my clear recommendation would be Bluebook alternative C I could see as something of a compromise that we move borrowings up maybe a $100 million now But I would hope that we would have specific plans to talk or reconvene in a couple of weeks to see what the intervening two weeks or so bring in terms of data, because I think that, unless they show weakness, we should then move again   I found both papers very interesting, but I have some analytic questions that I think are relevant, as far as whether or not the base should be considered as either a target or a constraint The work done by the Board staff suggests that the statistical properties of the monetary base are superior to those of other aggregates The work we have done suggests just the opposite As a matter of fact, the statistical properties of the base are inferior to those of M2 We have a much larger interest rate elasticity on the monetary base and our income elasticity of M2 is significantly less than that [for the base] The difference appears to be a function of the period of estimation The period of estimation in the Board's forecast goes back to the very early 1960s  -23-    5/17/88  and goes through the entire period We think that the interest rate elasticity has probably increased in recent years and on the basis of our estimates, which run from 1978 through 1987, we find that the base actually has inferior statistical properties to M2 In any case, it appears as though there are significant amounts of shifts in the statistical properties that occur and I'm not sure we've paid enough attention to those kinds of shifts They certainly could affect how reliable the monetary base could be as either a current constraint or a target in the period ahead I guess I'd say that even though there has been a lot of analytical work done, maybe we ought to do a little more   Ted, I have a question about your net export number With this small decline in the value of the dollar that you're assuming, wouldn't a model forecast typically give less of an improvement in net exports than what you're showing? It seems to me that for this year it's something like $47 billion, and for the next year it's $32 billion At least some of the models I've seen would suggest that with that kind of very small decline in the value of the dollar you would have a more significant slowing in the improvement in net exports than you have Was that managed to some extent or--   So at least that's one area where perhaps it could turn out that there'd be a little less pressure in terms of growth?   Okay, thank you sir   But if you didn't take that into account, it would be very misleading   Isn't the analytical issue raised here that you may be overstating inflation a little bit--that there has actually been more real growth because of declining prices, which has not been taken account of in the fixed-weight index It seems to me that may be a bigger analytical issue in this area   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Twelfth District economy continues to grow at a healthy pace, with particular strength in the coastal states, excluding Alaska This growth appears to be putting upward pressure on wages For example, in southern California, Oregon and Washington, employers are having difficulty hiring qualified workers at prevailing wages I also might say parenthetically that in California the minimum wage rose to $425 effective July 1st Inventories are satisfactory to lean throughout the District at both the manufacturer and retail levels In some industries, including paper and aluminum, low inventory levels result from strong demand combined with limited production capacity When we checked with District retailers, they indicated that the previously excessive inventories in women's apparel, which were quite a problem a couple of months ago, have been brought under control  If I may turn briefly to the national economy Even with the drought, real growth is likely to exceed the growth of potential output during the second half of this year And next year we expect growth similar to that in the Greenbook, assuming further significant tightening of monetary policy between now and mid-1989 We do have a somewhat stronger dollar and a smaller improvement in net exports, but in our forecast this is offset by stronger consumption than that which is incorporated in the Greenbook With the economy continuing to grow above or at potential over the forecast period, inflation in 1989-- measured by the fixed-weight deflator--seems certain to accelerate by the roughly 1/2 percent that is in our forecast and the Greenbook's   Do you have a significant in-migration?   We are getting record in-migration in California I think it's about 700,000 or something like that a year--it's incredible And we have similar housing problems, but I guess it's just that you can find cheaper areas Plus, there's a very large [unintelligible] That seems to keep a lid on things a bit   Bob, you made the comment that the slowdown is just what the doctor ordered Is that correct?   Domestic that we see in the forecast What is the monetary policy implication associated with that forecast?   Don, both alternatives cover a relatively short period of time Would you indicate which of the two alternatives, "B" or "C," is most consistent with the policy assumptions in the Greenbook forecast?   The quarter?   So, it's really more consistent with "B," you'd say?   It seems to me that characterizing the recent period as being a hybrid is maybe a little bit too strong, because in the last statement periods we've really hit borrowings right on the  -34-    8/16/88  head And some times and days, there may have been some attempts to resist the funds rate But if you are getting your target, then you must be pretty well content with the interest rates that are resulting from it I know there was a problem very early in July, but I don't know that it has been operating all that poorly in the last few weeks Would you agree with that Don, or not?   Yes   That's right   I can support alternative "B" considering how recently we tightened and also the short time before the next FOMC meeting However, it seems to me that further tightening will be needed soon, if it isn't needed now, and that alternative "B" can hardly be described as a policy that keeps us ahead of the curve with regard to the problems of excessive economic growth and intensified inflationary pressures Therefore, I strongly recommend the asymmetric language It would permit a tightening of policy in the intermeeting period if incoming data indicate no significant deceleration in economic activity With regard to the ordering of the phrases in the second sentence of the operational paragraph, I would not be in favor of changing the position of the monetary aggregates because I know how quickly their behavior can change and we might regret moving them up to a more prominent place this early   I have a question about your forecast of net exports There's a very substantial improvement in the net exports over the period I get the impression that if one were just to look at the model forecast, assuming a relatively moderate decline in the value of the dollar, that you wouldn't get that significant an improvement Am I correct in assuming that your forecast has a large judgmental component; and if so, is that sort of the opposite of what we saw when the dollar was going down? When the dollar was going down, the model predicted a more quick response in terms of net exports Now that the dollar has gone up, are we assuming that has a    9/20/88  delayed response as well--in terms of slowing the improvement in net exports?   So you don't know   Yes, thank you   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy appears to be growing at a relatively brisk pace, and I'd say that the outlook for the District generally is favorable A very strong order book for aircraft should assure strength in the Seattle area for a couple of years That also boosts prospects in the aircraft industry in southern California Prospects for the growth of exports are reasonably bright for such things as agricultural products, specialty products, and also transportation and electronic equipment Agriculture in the west appears as though it may actually be  -13-    9/20/88  benefiting somewhat from the drought as a result of the higher prices that more than offset the effects of very mild reductions in yields in the west At this time, signs of weakness in the District are really quite spotty And they're only concentrated in a few states--Alaska, Arizona, and Utah--and a very few industries as well Residential construction is weak Dairy and livestock are rather weak as a result of the fact that they're paying higher costs for feed And aluminum and forest products are weak due to capacity constraints It's rather interesting that even where you have weakness, it's in areas that are pretty much up against capacity constraints in residential construction, for example, that's solely a result of extremely strong export demands for lumber Weakness may intensify in the District if the very recent sharp slowing in retail advertising in California-- which looks quite pervasive--is a precursor of softer retail sales  If I may turn to the national outlook, it's my view that it's premature to conclude that the recent softening of economic statistics is indicative of a trend that will persist through 1989 Rather, it seems more likely to me that if interest rates were to remain at present levels, growth of the nonfarm economy would probably exceed the growth of potential over the entire forecast period Thus, prospects for the underlying rate of inflation still are a concern, though obviously we're going to see actual inflation rates buffeted by many special factors If this expectation in our forecast is correct, then it seems to me that the process of tightening probably is not over and will have to be resumed sometime soon Thank you   If that's in the form of a motion, I certainly would second it, particularly with the asymmetric language I would point out, though, that I really do doubt that we're going to be lucky enough to get through more than a meeting or two without further  -25-    9/20/88  tightening I think there are pressures on the underlying rate of inflation that are likely to intensify And I think that some of the potentially favorable developments associated with the price of oil and the rising dollar--as far as inflation is concerned--could easily be reversed At this time, given the uncertainties, it seems to me that alternative "B" is probably the appropriate path But given my concerns, I would very much favor the asymmetric language that was incorporated in the previous directive   Third  SPEAKER(?) Third   I support the change as well If the change were announced, say, at the end of the year and the reasons explained, I don't think there would be much press pressure to it The other thing is that it probably would be wise to emphasize one of the points that Ed has made--that the FOMC is a continuing body But it does make some sense If we were starting off today having no precedent, we clearly would probably opt for something more like what you are proposing than what we have So I would support it   I have a question about the approach It's a single-equation approach, and there is an assumption therefore that money is exogenous Yet, we know that throughout this period for which you got your statistical results that at times money was endogenous--that you were reacting to what was happening to prices It seems to me that that is a point which has some bearing on the usefulness [of these results] The second point is that for some of these [periods] velocity is more stable If you look at Chart II, it looks to me that if you were at different points of history, you might have concluded as you drew a line most recently that you were going off the long-run velocity line We know that potential real GNP changes over time I don't know how much that would lead us astray, but it seems to me that assumptions about both of those being unchanged over time are potentially dangerous with respect to--   Sure    11/1/88   What about potential real GNP? That can change for other reasons, and it does change for reasons that sometimes are very difficult to anticipate   I see   The example you cited about how [the model may] be useful in the long run really depends upon the actual coefficients that are estimated In effect, that's how you determine at what rate M2 should grow to get the growth and prices that you find acceptable The only point I was trying to make--I think this is a correct statistical point--is that to the extent that money is not exogenous, those statistical results can be biased I don't know if that is a major factor I don't think you ought to assume that those coefficients are unbiased coefficients because the model starts out with an assumption of the exogeneity which is not there This may not be a big factor, but I think it is a factor   Yes   Mike, the level of nonfarm business investment in inventories has been averaging about $31, $32 billion for the last two quarters You've got quite a pickup in the fourth quarter--that means a source of strength in the fourth quarter--and then it remains at that high level throughout most of 1989 The level at around $40 billion is just a little bit high traditionally You commented that you thought inventories were lean Could you talk about that a little bit because clearly it could be a source of weakness if it doesn't contain those   Mr Chairman, growth in the Twelfth District has slowed somewhat but we think the outlook is rather optimistic The slowing really appears to reflect the tightening of labor markets and  -31-    11/1/88  the lack of unused resources rather than just weakness in demand To offset these impediments to expansion, we're beginning to see that some employment growth is shifting through areas of the District which have characteristically been weaker For example, Boeing is opening up a plant in Spokane in eastern Washington where there is a lot of labor available, and it has been traditionally weak We've seen, for example, that Carnation is going to open its largest production plant in Bakersfield As you know, Bakersfield is about 110 miles north of LA and costs are quite a bit lower there So, that does seem to be going on a bit As far as durable goods manufacturing is concerned, it remains strong because of the dominance of aircraft and electronics industries And you perhaps saw the article today in the paper about Boeing indicating the strength of their sales and profits We are also seeing the shortages that have been characteristic of the wood products and paper industries fading a bit This probably is a result of the fact that housing has weakened a bit, at least new housing And the generally slower pace of the economy may be having some impact on packaging Prospects for agriculture in the District--and I'll just underline the point that it is the single largest industry in the District--prospects there depend very importantly on rainfall this winter We have had two years of drought, but it really hasn't affected agriculture Most of our agriculture in the District, especially in California, depends on irrigation; but if we have a third straight year of drought this winter it would cause problems Also in 1988 the District continued to excel in the production of championship professional sports teams!   With regard to the national economy, I would agree that [some} slowing of economic growth may be underway After we abstract from the effects of the drought, our forecast is that growth will average about 2 percent next year with the slowing in growth centered in the areas that have been mentioned in the Greenbook forecast net exports, business spending on plant and equipment, and consumer spending on durables And although inflation certainly could be less next year, I think the underlying rate of inflation probably will not improve And it seems to me, therefore, that further tightening action may be required sometime in 1989   That seems to raise a lot of issues   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation, particulary the asymmetric language One point I'd make is that I have a greater emphasis on hitting the $600 million borrowings target It seems to me it's not really necessary to worry about a federal  -49-    11/1/88  funds rate which differs by an 1/8th or 1/4th from what statistical relationships would seem to indicate between borrowings and the funds rate   Ted, considering the strength of the dollar in the past year and your comment that you think the dollar will remain relatively firm in the near term, why wouldn't it be reasonable to expect that any significant improvement in net exports would be delayed to the second half of the year at the earliest and most likely to 1990?   Well, you have improvement over the year going from $103 billion, which of course has been revised But the change is from $103 to $85 billion; that's not [unintelligible] $18 billion   It's still $13 billion   $98 billion to $85 billion is still $13 billion   But when--   Wouldn't typical statistical studies lead you to expect an actual deterioration?   Would you say there's perhaps a greater uncertainty in this area than in some of the other areas of GNP performance?   Thank you   Governor Seger, one other perspective that perhaps I can provide on that If you take the California market, which represents a fairly significant share--   No, I said it's a fairly significant share of the total housing market We have had increases in the prices of single- family homes that have averaged 25 to 30 percent in the Los Angeles and San Francisco markets I think there are some consumers that look at that on a total return basis and figure out that 11 percent is not such a bad deal if you can count on increases in prices of that magnitude I think that's had an impact in our state I don't know if--   Right   Well, all I know is that the average price in the two markets that constitute most of the area has gone up about 25 to 30 percent in the past year   No And one has to figure out what people are projecting   That's right   We do not'collect good data on that I don't know how much that has changed and how much of a factor that is   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Twelfth District economy continues to experience healthy growth with only a few signs of slowing Agricultural producers are enjoying high product prices and recent rains have lessened the chances of drought in the area rather substantially We also hear reports from Western department store executives that sales of soft goods have improved in recent weeks But I must admit that that may be a reflection of improved weather conditions and also the early Easter season In the few sectors that we do see slowing it appears as though supply constraints explain much of the change In Section II of the Greenbook there was a reference to the types of problems that the commercial aircraft industry is experiencing and I was thinking that it's rather amazing that Boeing has signed an agreement with Lockheed to borrow up to 670 Atlanta-based workers for as long as six months  Turning to the national economy, the level of activity as indicated in the discussion in the Greenbook remains above its noninflationary potential Strong growth in employment and tightening labor markets suggest that upward pressures on wages are likely to  -22-    3/28/89  persist At the same time, higher short-term interest rates may result in some slowing in the next few quarters But I must admit that, to me, signs of current slowing are too few to be convincing at this point Our overall outlook for the economy is really not very different from that of the Greenbook We also expect the economy to remain above full employment with continuing upward wage pressures for at least the remainder of 1989 and perhaps into 1990 However, we have less strength in our forecast originating in the net export sector, largely as a result of the strength of the dollar that we've experienced during the past year Thank you   Mr Chairman, I have a request for clarification In the Bluebook it's stated that alternative B would assume roughly a continuation of 9-3/4 percent [on the funds rate] and that money market rates might tend to decline a bit if that indeed is where we came out It seems to me in terms of maintaining the existing degree of restraint in financial markets that the market is probably thinking more about 10 percent Could I interpret support of "B" as being an operation which would cause money market rates to remain at roughly their current levels?   So that could be consistent with a slightly firmer funds rate?   Okay Well, in that case I certainly would favor alternative B and asymmetric language at the present time However, if further signs of slowing do not become more convincing in the next several weeks, I would certainly recommend that we consider moving to alternative C promptly   I'd like to ask a question about the primary dealers How many are Japanese owned?   One keeps hearing that that has changed the market somehow Is that correct or not?   Well, I guess it's just vicious rumor or whatever but one issue is that in Japan information is exchanged a lot among companies One hears that that may be an issue in the United States Is that just vicious rumor?   I have a question, Mike, that is related to your final comment In the Greenbook the comment was made that aggregate demand will still have to moderate further to relieve pressures and reverse the current upturn in inflation And as you indicated, in the Greenbook forecast you've assumed additional restraint What would be the impact of not implementing that restraint? In terms of an analytic exercise, what would it be costing us in terms of progress with regard to inflation and, for that matter, with regard to growth as well?   In 1991?   So there's really no improvement in underlying inflation through the forecast period through the end of '91 unless one gets some further restraint?   That's what I thought Thank you   Half a percent more than [unintelligible]?   Thank you, Mr Chairman Recent information from the Twelfth District suggests that the growth may be slowing Some sectors that have been contributing strength now are limited by capacity or supply constraints For example, in the forest products industry they are facing severe constraints in obtaining logs, and that has actually resulted in some shutdowns of mills In the aerospace industry you've heard a great deal about the situation among commercial aircraft producers orders continue to build but the capacity is slow to respond and, consequently, they're not getting much growth at all Other indicators throughout the District are suggesting somewhat slower growth even though capacity constraints in those areas are not a factor As an example, the recent data on employment in California indicate significantly slower job growth during the past two months In manufacturing, employment growth also has slowed Construction activity may be slowing in the District but the picture is not all that clear The weakness is principally centered in Alaska, Arizona, and Utah; we still see rather strong growth, particularly in residential construction, in Seattle, Oregon, and especially California Anecdotal evidence does suggest that there is increased caution on the part of small businesses, with many of them reporting--at least in the cases that we were told about in Oregon and California--that they are holding off expansion plans and are also in the process of trying to keep inventories at lean levels  Our outlook for the national economy is really fundamentally similar to that of the Greenbook The slowdown appears to be more convincing now than it looked when we had our last meeting It also seems as though slow growth could persist for a number of quarters I would agree, however, that the risks of recession don't seem all that great Moreover, even with the slowdown, real GNP will remain above its full employment potential with continuing upward wage pressures into next year, as was indicated by Mike Prell The pace in underlying employment costs and unit labor costs is likely to rise We do not have much evidence of increases in contract settlements in the Twelfth District but the LA school teachers went on strike on Monday That's the second largest school district, in the United States They had on the table a 21 percent three-year package and they rejected that and are on strike And everyone is beginning to speculate about what's going to happen in the aerospace industry When you're bringing people in from Atlanta and other places and  -21-    5/16/89  you've got a contract coming up there's not a lot of optimism about what that contract might result in Thank you   I would agree with your recommendation with regard to Bluebook alternative B, but I would very much favor retaining the asymmetric language for the simple reason that I think we ought to impress on the markets our longer-term resolve with regard to inflation I think symmetric language could be, and probably would be, misinterpreted I'm afraid that if we went to symmetric language they would think we have a greater tolerance of current rates of inflation than I think we really do I just don't like the message it communicates at this point   Ted, a question about net exports In Part II of the Greenbook there was an interesting discussion of the revision in the export numbers that was done for '86, '87, and '88 Analytically, how do you treat that when you're using a model or you're doing your analytic work since they haven't done a benchmark and you don't know what happened before that?   I know   So you have a whole year, too   Is there a similar problem in inventories because there were big changes there?   Could it add a little uncertainty to the forecast?   They were moved out of consumption right into exports It wasn't something that had been missed?   And formerly it was in domestic consumption?   Thank you   There were some changes, I think, in the estimates of productivity Has that led to any different views about what [potential] growth in the economy might be?   Pursuing this a little further you made the statement that the underlying rate of inflation really doesn't show any progress between now and the end of 1990 I know for the next meeting you will come out with [a forecast for] 1991 Have you taken any preliminary looks? Based upon the assumptions that you use, is there any improvement in the underlying inflation that occurs later?   By design?   That's the objective   Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in the Twelfth District continues to grow, although at a slower pace than earlier in the year Some areas are enjoying robust growth For example, the state of Washington is experiencing a sharp escalation in housing prices, booming construction, and rapid in-migration Alaska is recovering at a rate of growth in employment that is twice that expected prior to [unintelligible] growth District retailers characterize sales as satisfactory and inventories at desired levels But other areas of the District are exhibiting weaker growth Arizona remains weak, with construction slumping and defense-related manufacturing facing cutbacks A rather new development is that growth has slowed in California, with declines in manufacturing and construction employment noted in the last several months  Turning to the national economy, stronger growth now seems to be more likely than it did at our last meeting Lower interest rates and declines in food and energy prices should produce a pickup in consumption Moreover, it appears as though the downside risks to inventory accumulations have lessened because of the recent revision of national income statistics We expect the economy to remain above  -24-    8/22/89  its high employment level through 1990 Thus, similar to the Greenbook, we expect some further modest increases in wage inflation And in the absence of any policy changes, we would expect the momentum of the current inflation rate to persist into next year Thank you   I would favor "B" as well and I also would strongly favor the symmetric language It seems to me that relative to the previous meeting there are fewer downside risks than we saw at that time We have had a recent robust growth of the broad aggregates, so I think one can make the case that the risks are  -41-    8/22/89  symmetrical I certainly would not prefer asymmetric toward the side of ease   That's a double asymmetric   Well, it seems to me that we are pretty well agreed on the efforts to [discourage] intervention I would say that we only have one factor that we can [use] and that is for you to make our viewpoint known as best you can to the Administration My concern is that if we were to do something of a confrontational nature we would be forced or required to do things that we wouldn't want to do I don't understand If we were to back away, Manley, I don't know--   You said that you think the markets are anticipating further easing of some magnitude in the near term?   I bring this up because the Bluebook seemed to say the opposite--that [the market] does not now appear to be anticipating any near-term change of policy I think it has implications for what might happen to market rates relative to the choices we make So I just want to--   One [other point] I'm sure you all got this letter to respond to by the end of October or early November from Representative Neal and that kind of information might be useful I don't know what we're all going to do about that but that kind of information might be an important--   The end of October or early November is my recollection   Well, he says he'd like to make it a part of the record and he will be doing the hearings in late October or early November And we assumed that--  -45-    10/3/89   I'd like to ask two questions related to the near-term strength of the economy Based upon the statistics that we now have for the third quarter, do you think there is much of a chance that the actual growth rate was in the 3+ percent area? And related to that, you have a very substantial decline in nonfarm inventories Is that just what is happening as a result of aircraft? I see aircraft exports are up and are very strong   Third and fourth, [unintelligible] inventories   Thank you, Mr Chairman I think the tone of my report is probably going to be a little different from some others The economy in the West currently is expanding at a healthy pace, and growth actually appears to have strengthened a little since our last meeting Improvements in trade and service activity account for much of the recent strength we've seen Apparel sales are reported to be strong and, of course, toward the end of the quarter there were quite strong sales of autos We've seen good growth in tourism activity throughout the entire area Construction, both residential and nonresidential, and real estate activity are strong in California,  -24-    10/3/89  Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Hawaii, and much of Idaho, although some slowing in home sales recently has appeared in southern California Reports of weakness are focused, as they have been for the last several meetings, in Arizona and are associated primarily with construction The Northwest is actually booming I don't think there's any word that would be more appropriate California-style bidding wars on single-family homes have become common in the Puget Sound area Manufacturing firms throughout the Northwest plan to expand employment facilities and equipment Now, in two hours the contract at Boeing will expire; 43,000 workers in Seattle and I think 12,000 in Wichita and 1,700 in Portland are covered by that union But the chances look less than 50 percent that there will be a strike; it requires a two-thirds vote At this point, if there is not a strike, I would assume that that strength would continue for the foreseeable future   I don't know if they vote today, but the expiration of the contract occurs today at 1000   That could be, but it does require a two-thirds vote for a strike  At the national level, the economy--to us at least--appears stronger than at the time of the last meeting We've revised our estimates of third-quarter growth and now expect an increase of around 3 percent, which is somewhat different from that in the Greenbook Also, I wouldn't be surprised to see stronger growth in final demand than projected in the Greenbook, especially in 1990 Quite frankly, looking at a lot of private forecasts, I see more centered in the area of 2 to 2-1/2 percent than I do under 2 percent at this point If the growth does not slow as rapidly as projected in the Greenbook, then it seems clear that upward pressures on underlying inflation will persist   I would certainly support alternative B, but I would have a preference for symmetrical language because I think the data to date suggest that the risks are equal on the up side as well as on the down side   Are we going to meet Monday afternoon?   Factor income was a big--   There was such a dramatic change in [factor income] and what they based that on Why did they come up with--?   So that may be it   [Unintelligible]   No   Mike, I have a question We have had relatively strong growth in real disposable income in the past two years If you had the traditional relationship between changes in real disposable income and consumption, how much greater strength would we have in consumption in 1990 than shown in the Greenbook, particularly in the nondurables and services areas?   Well, typically the [equations] show current consumption as a function of current and lagged values of real disposable income I think the Greenbook goes into some special factors that may be causing consumption not to be responding as rapidly to changes in real disposable income So I'm asking If the relationship were traditional, how much more strength would you get?   A lot of the weakness in the economy, if you're looking at the dollar source of weakness, is focused in nondurables; that's down to 11 percent, which is very small And perhaps even more remarkable is services, which got down to 26 percent They have been down that far, but that's not typical   Thank you   There are offsets in inventory, right?   Mr Chairman, the economy in the West continues to expand at a healthy pace despite the destructions associated with the Boeing strike and the earthquake Employment in the Twelfth District grew 33 percent over the past year, which is considerably stronger than the 27 percent we experienced nationally Discussions with our directors and other business people in the area indicate that business activity remains robust But I think there's a generally shared expectation that [it will be] slowing The Boeing strike shows no sign of a settlement and is beginning to affect the Puget Sound economy which, of course, was the strongest economy in our District We estimate that personal income has been falling by about $25 to $30 million each week of the strike Even assuming some generous multipliers, I think that probably translates into less of an effect than is included in the Greenbook, but I'm really not sure about that If the strike were to continue to the third or fourth month, it is anticipated that the direct income losses would be on the order of about $60 million; but of course there would be secondary effects that would multiply that rather significantly The negative effects from the quake are likely to outweigh the positive effects during the current quarter I don't know how much rebuilding refers to the quake and how much actually applies to [hurricane] Hugo, but we feel that is offset by businesses that have slowed significantly due to actual business closures, the loss of tourists, and the interruption of normal traffic patterns The number of unemployment claims, for example, has skyrocketed in hard-hit areas such as San Francisco where they are up 60 percent If you get out to the Santa Cruz area, in one of the smaller towns there, Mutsenville, they are up 200 percent At the present time, recovery efforts are limited to utility repairs, structural inspections, and demolitions--although I know demolitions add to GNP! With a few notable exceptions--the exception being the Bay Bridge, which will be opening Friday--in general there's not much going on in terms of repair and rebuilding for the simple reason that the earth is still shifting and people are unwilling to do anything until that shifting stops And that typically [lasts for] a 3- to 6- month period  -13-    11/14/89  At the national level, we expect growth to be stronger than that in the Greenbook We feel that consumption spending should benefit from the lagged effect of the strong growth of disposable income in the past two years Moreover, strong investment in business equipment is expected to result from backlogs of orders for aircraft; also, the continued reduction in the relative price of information processing equipment should be a positive development and a source of strength for business spending for equipment In our view, if the economy expands as fast as I think it could, which is around 2 percent, then unemployment will rise only modestly and I think upward pressures on the underlying inflation rate are likely to persist through the end of next year Thank you   Mr Chairman, I support alternative B as well I have a preference for symmetric language as a result of my concerns about inflation and the inflation rate incorporated in the forecast I must admit that I'm not quite sure I fully understand the initial part of your statement about how, if we don't get help from the fiscal side, it may make it impossible I think you said to reach our objectives with regard to inflation   I would hope that one thing we can look at in this study that is being done for next month is how the burden on the  -30-    11/14/89  economy is affected by different assumptions about fiscal policy; because it's not obvious to me how the total burden on the economy changes with combinations of fiscal versus monetary policy But I know how the burden on us changes Okay?   Manley, were you talking about total real estate [financing] or real estate [financing] provided by commercial banks?   There has been some switching, of course, in the commercial banking industry   But there has to be a big FIRREA effect there   Ed, are you saying that those are both valid reasons for intervention?   Implicit in your comment is that you think it's effective   Is your concern about the $20 billion a foreign exchange risk concern?  -47-    3/27/90  SPEAKER(?) It's a political concern   But it seems that we all agree with this I think the issue is How can we be effective in getting that viewpoint across--by playing the game or by picking up our mitt and going home?   But you agree that there are times when it does have an effect?   Would you sketch out what the environment will be like after that point? In other words, what would be our role when we've reached that point where we say we're not going to intervene? What influence would we have? How would that be preferable?   I don't disagree with that, but you say we will pull out at some point After we've pulled out what kind of discipline can we exert?   Ted, I have two questions You mentioned the assumption about the path of the dollar Is that the declining [unintelligible]? Could you give me some numbers? I can't remember what you were assuming before   This year   You pointed to some areas of strength that may show up in Eastern Europe other than in East Germany The second question is Isn't there another side that perhaps doesn't get as much attention, and that is that there could be some very important sources of weakness as well? One gets the impression that in places like Hungary and Czechoslovakia orders from the the Soviet Union have declined very substantially in the steel industry and other areas as well Isn't it conceivable that in 1990 growth in those areas may actually turn out to be less than was anticipated before the--   Right   It's even exaggerated in those countries because prices were being subsidized Thank you   Another point is that in the first quarter the trade-weighted dollar was down at a double-digit [rate] in spite of what happened to the yen So we have a very substantial decline in the trade-weighted--  -13-    3/27/90   But they are weighted according to the amount of trade that's done   Well, that would give more to Japan if they did it on [ancient] history because Japan had a higher weight   Well, you'd use a lesser weight for Japan   Yes   I'll tell you it's the fourth quarter of '89 If you compare that to the estimate of the first quarter of this year is it down, Ted?   17 percent on the weighted average   [Unintelligible]   Well, if you look at Germany, Ted did explain it in the sense that if there's going to be greater economic activity in eastern Germany, it's going to affect western Germany in that the return on capital is likely to rise If the real rate of return on capital in Germany rises, I would assume that investors would make portfolio shifts into--   But you never incorporated change in policy in the intermeeting period just immediately ahead, right?   Sure   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District is also out of phase with the rest of the nation The economy remains strong, although the sources of strength have changed The growth of employment in the past year in the entire Twelfth District has been 34 percent, which is an extraordinarily large gain relative to the 2 percent for the rest of the nation Economic growth in most parts of the region remains very high As an example, over that period there are three states--Washington, Idaho, and Oregon--where growth rates of employment were 6 to 10 percent in the past year Looking at all 9 states, even Arizona, which had a very respectable 35 percent growth rate, exceeded the average in the entire District Construction employment is very strong; it was up 81 percent in the past year And manufacturing [employment] rose 9 percent in the past year, compared to a fall of 14 percent nationally There has been some shift, however, away from California to other parts of the District Employment growth in California is getting much closer to that of the rest of the nation Whereas in 1988 California accounted for 63 percent of all the employment growth in our District, last year it was only 44 percent Also, similar to Arizona, we have seen some weakening of housing prices in some California markets  -22-    3/27/90  If I may turn to the national economy As we've all discussed so far this morning, real growth, inflation, and interest pressures certainly seem to be stronger than they were at the time of the last meeting Even with some restraint from higher interest rates, which is in both the Greenbook forecast and in our own, we would expect real GNP growth of at least 2 percent this year I think some of that strength is going to come from consumption spending, reflecting the past strength in disposable income I would also anticipate that stronger foreign GNP growth will lead to greater strength in net exports than previously had seemed likely We're expecting the GNP fixed-weight index to average something very similar to that shown in the Greenbook, around 4-1/2 percent both this year and next Admittedly, part of this worsening is due to firmer oil prices and the effects of past weakness in the trade-weighted dollar Of course, if these factors were to reverse themselves, then we could get a break on the inflation front Moreover, the fact that wages have been performing well probably does limit the size of the inflation problem However, it's our view that the best way to insure that inflation begins to subside--and that certainly is not something that we see in our forecast--is to maintain moderate economic growth Thank you, Mr Chairman   Just continuing along that line a little If a significant proportion of the increase is due to increases in real rates, what would be the implication in moving the funds rate [up]? How would you see the market responding?   But that's the only rate that hasn't had an increase in real terms over this period--   Would you say the chance of such a move not affecting long-term rates or having them decline slightly is very, very remote?   Okay   Mr Chairman, I agree with you that there is some uncertainty about both the strength of the economy and also the extent of the inflation problems However, I would prefer a small move in the direction of tightness somewhere between Bluebook alternatives "B" and "C" It seems to me that if the Greenbook is correct--and certainly our work would suggest that it is--there will be a need for some fairly significant, or at least eyecatching, tightening in the second half of the year It might be easier to do some of that at the present time and have to do a little less in the second half of the year If that's not in the cards, to me a fallback position is to support asymmetric language in favor of a tighter policy That approach would ensure that policy could be tightened promptly if we had indications that indeed the economy is strengthening and if inflationary pressures look like they're even more of a concern in the seven weeks until our next meeting   My point was somewhat similar to Governor Angell's The sentence on page I-3 [of the Greenbook] says "The recent data reinforced the view long embodied in the staff forecast that restoration of a disinflationary trend is unlikely at current levels of resource utilization" The implication is that if we stay where we are for a very long time, there is only a very small chance of restoring the disinflationary trend and, in fact, it might even produce an increase in inflationary pressures That's the implication   One get's the general feeling, though, that the public feels that if we were to stay where we are we would have a continuation of growth rates of around 2 percent and a gradual [reduction of inflation] What you're basically saying is that if we stay where we are, growth rates are likely to pick up and we will not be able to restore [unintelligible]   But they would not be assuming much in the way of interest rate pressures?   That's my point    5/15/90   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Twelfth District economy remains pretty strong despite slower growth in recent months Employment in the West grew 32 percent in the past year, which is somewhat slower than the kinds of growth rates in employment that we were seeing in 1989 when they averaged 41 percent All of that slowing in growth can be attributed to the state of California California's growth in recent months has been quite similar to that of the rest of the nation but the other states are doing extraordinarily well For example, if you look at the seven fastest growing states in the nation, all seven of them were in the Twelfth District The outlook for western agriculture is positive overall, although this summer's harvest is unlikely to be as profitable as those in recent years Inventories of many agricultural products are higher than they were a year ago and the acreage that has been planted in the West is high as well Even drought-affected crops such as cotton and rice are only going to be cut about 10 percent, so we'll see a large increase in output At the same time, costs for some farm inputs are up dramatically In California we're in the fourth year of drought And in California that means you irrigate in a different way Instead of using surface water, you go to well water or ground water; and that costs a lot more money and is going to cut substantially into the profits of farmers In a state like Idaho where they also use a lot  -10-    5/15/90  of irrigation, they have a shortage of water and the difficulty there is in obtaining irrigation pipe Apparently, it costs three times as much this year--if you can get it--than it did last year So, the agricultural situation really isn't that bad overall, but it's quite likely that agriculture won't be quite as prosperous financially as it was in the last year  I might note parenthetically on this issue of credit availability to farmers and to small businesses that we had two banks give us some very interesting observations, and I'd be interested if others ran into the same thing One of the large banks said that there is a substantial restriction on credit to small businesses Another banker said there were restrictions to agriculture, but he said it wasn't related at all to what has been happening with regard to regulators' views or associated types of events He said it's related to environmental concerns Banks, whenever they take over collateral when there's a default on a loan, are then responsible for the environmental consequences So his bank, for example, which is a large bank, was no longer making small business loans to any gasoline stations, dry cleaning establishments, or any farms which had in- ground gasoline or diesel tanks And any time they were doing large projects they would have to send out an environmental appraiser as well as a value appraiser He said this was having a very significant effect on lending My understanding is that apparently this is such a hot button with the industry that there are a couple of Congressmen who are now in the process of introducing legislation that will rectify this situation It's a little different wrinkle that I hadn't heard before but apparently, at least among our bankers, it's very significant  Turning to the national economy, our outlook for the year 1990 is very similar to that of the Greenbook We do part a bit in 1991, but it's a result of the difference in monetary policy assumptions We don't have the federal funds rate rising as rapidly, and we get a result which actually is quite consistent with the Greenbook's results With an increase in rates of about half of that in the Greenbook we get growth in 1991 of 2 percent and, indeed, there is no basic drop in the underlying inflation rate until 1992 Thank you   Don, if you go back to the period before the latest period, there was a sharp increase in long-term rates I know you can't answer this specifically, but in your view what explains that rise mostly? Was a change in inflationary expectations mainly what caused that? Or was it some development worldwide or here that caused the real rate to go [up]?  -25-    5/15/90   But through this period, then, if most of it was due to expectations of higher inflation, there has not been a tightening in monetary and financial conditions There was a discussion here that implied that this was a tightening and that hasn't occurred to the extent that it's--   Right Thank you   Mr Chairman, I could support your position but for somewhat different reasons It seems to me that the uncertainties about the direction of the economy are perhaps the greatest reason to support alternative B at this point I must admit that looking at the data and hearing the discussion today, I would never use the term "credit crunch" in the classic ways that I've heard that term used  -27-    5/15/90   Okay Then I would hope that we can in our separate Districts and here at the Board find a way to monitor that very closely A credit crunch has real implications   Well, we have [unintelligible] than last year If you recall at this time--   Well, it seems to me it is something that we ought to monitor very closely   Peter, what do you think the number of primary dealers will be a year from now? What is basically happening? I assume these pressures are not likely to get any better in terms of profitability   So we may get back to that?   I have two questions Dave, at the FOMC information call Ted Truman gave us some useful rules of thumb about the effects of a change in the price of oil on real growth and also on the CPI inflation It seems to me that the effects on inflation are rather substantial; I was struck by what you show as a very sharp decline in the fixed-weight deflator for the fourth quarter from 47 to 40 percent I know the impacts on the fixed-weight deflator are different from those on the CPI But even taking that into account, it seems to me that that is a very low number Could you explain that and indicate what contribution oil is making to that number?   So, it's just across the board--smaller increases in quite a few sectors?   Yes, I heard The second point is that I was really struck by the Commerce Department revisions of compensation per manhour in the nonfarm business sector for 1989 In the period from 1984 through [the end of] your forecast the lowest compensation per manhour, excluding 1989, is 37 percent; in the forecast it's about 51 or 52 percent During the whole year [1989] the increase was in the 2 percent area It just seems very difficult to understand what happened in 1989 that would make those numbers believable   Okay   It certainly seems to be that way at this point    8/21/90 -5-   Yes   I think so Thank you   Mr Chairman, in the Twelfth District, employment growth continues to exceed that of the nation, although the rate of growth has slowed more in recent months than has been the case in the nation For example, if you go back a year ago, our growth of employment was about 1-1/2 percent more than the rest of the nation; now it's running a little under 1 percent more Following the national pattern, employment in manufacturing and construction has fallen in recent months, but it has fallen at a rate that is less than half that for the rest of the nation Growth of trade and services industry employment is below that of a year earlier, but the growth rates continue to be in the area of 3 to 4 percent, which are not bad increases Agriculture is performing well in the District as a result of high crop prices and yields and also high livestock prices  If I can turn to California, since California got some attention in the Greenbook as well, economic growth has slowed from last year's pace; there's no question about that But the state's employment is growing at a steady rate of just under 2-1/2 percent on a year-over-year basis Defense and aerospace layoffs are [slowing] and will slow economic growth But even in LA and San Francisco, where the bulk of the layoffs will take place, the loss of jobs in these sectors will be small relative to what are expected to be healthy gains in other nonmanufacturing sectors Real estate activity is slow There's no question that sales and permits are off significantly Median home prices indicate the drop in home prices but, as was indicated in the Greenbook, most of the decline reflects a shift in the composition of sales to lower priced areas, particularly Sacramento, Riverside, and places like that, and also to smaller homes  Turning to the national economy, although the risk of recession certainly is real, the upward revisions in retail sales for May and June, the June drop in the inventory/sales ratio, and the favorable report on June net exports are certainly encouraging It appears as though, with a better balance between inventories and sales, positive real growth in the second half is quite likely Although the Greenbook's oil price assumptions are reasonable, I believe that the effect on inflation in the second half of the year will be larger than that indicated in the Greenbook In addition, the impact of higher oil prices in stimulating business investment could turn out to be a bit greater than implied in the Greenbook forecast Finally, although a future drop in oil prices is assumed and certainly would help to moderate inflation, I don't think we should forget the effects of the dollar depreciation, which has been quite substantial The latter, plus continued upward pressure on wages, should prevent a significant decline in inflation next year Thank you   I'd like to ask a question about what you referred to as the "felicitous" outcome involving an unchanged [nominal] income path after the shock which, of course, leads to an [un]changed interest rate path and M2 path To me that has critical implications for the policy decision we make here What bothers me a little is that it seems to me a bit counter-intuitive; also, I know a couple of models at least where there are different results It would seem more likely, with an oil shock of the magnitude we're talking about, that in the first year we probably are going to see more of the impact on higher prices than on the real side That would suggest that in order to get the same path for nominal income growth we would need higher interest rates and somewhat slower growth of M2 And if indeed the same nominal income path is what we want now, this is a very critical difference I don't know how much effort was spent in trying to verify this or to look at it in different ways, but assuming an unchanged nominal path is what we want, it's critical which interest rate path is consistent   Yes   Well, we had price controls   It seems to me that we made one major judgment that interest rates should be the same or lower, but I have a feeling that we shouldn't take too much confidence in that result It seems to me quite likely that if we make that judgment then we're probably, in effect, going to see higher nominal income and it's probably going to be primarily as a result of greater inflation I think the risk is there and it's a significant risk   Right   Oh, that's true   But it may cast it in a somewhat more [unintelligible] way if indeed the underlying relationships are different than as portrayed by that model But you're right It depends on what you want to set as your objective   Mr Chairman, in light of the uncertainties and concerns that you mentioned, I certainly would be supportive of Bluebook alternative B In terms of my own viewpoint, though, my concerns about higher inflation are equal to my concerns about recession Consequently, if I had my druthers, I'd prefer symmetric language as well   But if it were explained that there would be greater fluctuations in the funds rate, do you think that's something they could live with?    10/2/90   It will?   I'd like to pursue a little more your views on the consequences of passage of the budget compromise If the compromise is passed and signed, you feel that that probably would produce a rally in the long-term end of the market? Is that correct?   That, and you said the consequence, if we then followed that with an easing move, would be that long-term rates would probably [unintelligible] and not move up Is that what you're thinking?   But it would make your job easier to use a range?   You mentioned the conservative inventory policy here, but basically it isn't much of a cycle in inventories Do you feel very confident about that? Typically, one expects some buildup of excess inventories, which are subsequently run off, and then some increased production as the economy picks up We go through these cycles in real GNP But in truth, these inventories are really pretty [consistently] at very low levels; that may be a potential source for some greater cyclicality than was in the forecast   Okay   Mr Chairman, at present it's really not clear what impact the developments in the Middle East are having on the Twelfth District economy On the one hand, there are anecdotal reports that do suggest a considerably less optimistic attitude by business leaders in the District, and we've also seen some slowing in retail sales We do a survey of business leaders asking them whether they expect recession in the next 12 months, and in the most recent survey 40 percent of the survey respondents said they do expect a recession That represents a change from only 4 percent several weeks ago That to us was a rather significant change While the attitudes of most of these respondents have changed considerably, when we then asked them whether they actually had made changes in their business plans, we found that a number are taking an increasingly cautious attitude toward investment and operating costs, but the vast majority really have not changed their plans at this point When we talk to retailers, we find that quite a few have experienced either slower sales or actual decreases in sales of nondurable goods in August and early September These are not published data; these are just reports from individuals At the same time, however, the recent published data don't show very much in the way of weakness Employment, for example, showed some improvement in July and August over what was a bit of a sluggish performance in the second quarter Employment levels in August were 32 percent higher than a year ago That compares to 16 percent for the rest of the nation, so it's a very strong performance  As for real estate, although this number has a little problem with it, real estate loans--single-family and home equity loans--have  -19-    10/2/90  continued to expand at a rate of 227 percent in the past year If you look at the monthly seasonally adjusted increases in the past seven months, they have ranged between 13 percent and 45 percent I must admit that some of that is due to the bank restructurings, because S&Ls are becoming a less significant factor, particularly in the state of California and also in Arizona But even stripping that out, there is underlying strength in real estate loans in single- family and home equity loans in the Twelfth District  If I can turn to the national outlook for the moment, the basic path of the Greenbook forecast certainly seems plausible to us We expect one or two extremely weak--and I guess they could be negative--quarters We would say that is primarily resulting from the oil shock We then would expect that to be followed by a pickup of growth in the first half of next year I think one of the primary sources of strength is going to be in the net export area, resulting from the 15 percent decline in the trade-weighted value of the dollar in the past year We also expect, using the Greenbook's assumptions with regard to oil prices later on in the period, that consumer spending should pick up in 1991 Inflation certainly is going to be higher next year--probably somewhat over 5 percent, as indicated in the Greenbook Inflation will be fueled not only by higher oil prices, but we ought to keep in mind also the impact of the decline in the value of the dollar, and more importantly, underlying wage pressures The unemployment rate at its current level suggests that, even without the oil shock, the economy would have been straining at its capacity to produce in the months ahead and that that would have been a further impetus to strong underlying price pressures   Don, the three alternatives you talked about are different from what was in the Bluebook, right?  -38-    10/2/90   Is there no analytic support at all--something that might suggest that the inflation problem is severe and should be dealt with?   Yes   That doesn't sound very economic   And this is primarily in response to the credit conditions?   Because there's more weakness than that imparted by the supply shock? If, as I thought was stated, most of the weakness was a result of this supply shock, there's nothing we can do about that really   Well, one can do something about the inflation to some extent   That's right  -46-    10/2/90   I guess I see the tradeoffs perhaps somewhat differently You are computing the Greenbook's forecast of what is likely to happen to the oil price but the Greenbook's forecast of interest rates is constant If you had interest rates declining--   Mr Chairman, the price level consequences of the oil shock are my greatest concern, and I would hope that we would take actions to make sure that those price level consequences don't get embedded in underlying inflation And I think the inflationary pressures were significant even before the oil shock It seems to me that the best way to deal with this situation would be to have an unchanged funds rate So, I would support that alternative, whatever it is--"B," or "B-A", or whatever   We could discuss it over breakfast  SPEAKER(?) We'll be here at breakfast   What is the nature of that problem?   Right   Mr Chairman, since you characterized the sentence as an anachronism, why don't we choose the environmentally sensitive solution and eliminate it?   I don't think so either   The Twelfth District accounts for just under 30 percent of US oil production Higher oil prices have stimulated very little additional production in Alaska and California due to uncertainty about how long prices will remain high and also due to problems associated with environmental restrictions Even at current levels, however, higher prices are yielding a windfall of revenues for Alaska's state government and also are stimulating the Alaska economy in a significant way  Home sales have declined sharply and median home prices have declined moderately during the past year in California markets The southern California real estate market is particularly weak; sales activity is down in the previously hot Seattle and Sacramento markets and price increases there are moderating Concerns about overbuilding in nonresidential markets, particularly in southern California, are widespread; and recent declines in rents and leasing concessions are consistent with these concerns After adjusting for the normal relationship between bank lending and economic activity, lending by large banks in the Twelfth District has not been unusually low  Turning to the national outlook, the basic scenario of the Greenbook forecast certainly seems plausible However, real growth may be a little stronger and inflation somewhat higher than in the Greenbook, especially if interest rates follow a lower path than that assumed in the Greenbook We expect negative net real growth in the current quarter and probably also in the first quarter of next year related largely to the effect of oil prices As the effects of higher oil prices begin to dissipate when oil prices decline, however, the economy should pick up by next spring Although consumption spending will continue to be weak for a while, I would agree with the Greenbook that net exports will contribute over 1 percentage point to the growth of GNP next year and help to prevent a serious downturn The underlying rate of inflation is not likely to rise significantly next year, but I expect that the lower value of the dollar will be a factor contributing over 1 percentage point to the inflation in GNP prices next year and even more to consumer prices Thank you, Mr Chairman   I would support it as well   I'm just wondering if the funds rate is going to come down without a change in the discount rate How do you think the participants in the market would view that? Would that confuse them or would that be a non-event?    12/18/90   Would it affect your operations at all?   Easier or more difficult?   Ted, I'd like to follow up a bit on your comments about net exports The decline in GNP for the fourth quarter that the staff has in the Greenbook is about $32 - $33 billion and the improvement in net exports is about $30 billion That improvement has to look highly unlikely, given the October number You usually don't have reversals, though this could be something of an aberration   If the improvement were on the order of maybe half of what was forecast here, we could be talking about a decline of 1 or 2 percent more at an annual rate than the forecast   Right   But you said PCE in October, right?   Mr Chairman, the economy in the Twelfth District continues to be slow overall, with mixed pockets of activity across the region The California economy, which accounts for about two- thirds of the District's employment, has slowed along with the nation If we look at employment, what has happened since August is that employment is actually down slightly and our year-over-year employment growth remains about 1/2 point above the national average Not surprisingly, the slowdown has been most pronounced in trade, construction, and manufacturing, with year-over-year declines in construction and manufacturing that are not that different from the rest of the nation In the near term we expect that the state will continue to move along with the national pattern If you look at the remainder of the District, however, there are some rather interesting developments There are some effects of the national slowdown, but the District's manufacturing employment outside of California is actually at the same level as a year earlier and construction and trade employment are up 43 and 36 percent, respectively Residential real estate sales volumes are certainly down in California, Hawaii, and Washington but up in a fairly sizable way-- believe it or not--in Arizona, Utah, Idaho, and Nevada Home prices continue to rise except in Seattle and the coastal California areas, which, of course, do represent a very substantial part of the District The agricultural outlook, which is very important to us because in some measures it is the single largest industry in the District, is quite bright The USDA points to particularly strong production and export performance for the region's fruits, vegetables, and other specialty crops  If I may turn very briefly to the national outlook In the current quarter we see real GNP declining at a rate of about 4 to 5 percent, which is a bit stronger falloff than projected in the Greenbook I must admit that I can't point to any particular quantifiable factor that would be causing that degree of weakness It's obvious, for example, that the oil shock is not enough to produce that kind of a falloff Our best guess is that we'll see a small rate of decline in the first quarter, similar to that in the Greenbook, followed by a pickup in the second half of the year much along the same lines as in the Greenbook, including improved exports It does appear to us that the underlying inflation rate may have peaked and that with the unemployment rate on the rise we're likely to see some moderate progress in that area over the next year or so Our projections for inflation, however, are somewhat higher than those in the Greenbook Thank you   [Unintelligible], I guess mainly because the Greenbook is a bit more optimistic than I would be I would like to make two points, though It seems to me that the process that we've been going through in recent months does suggest that there is a high likelihood that we will overshoot at some point I feel as though we have to have a view of the future that we have some confidence in We realize that there are rather substantial lags in terms of when these policy changes will have an effect And if we don't do that, and we react primarily to conditions as we see them appear in the statistics, I think that there is a high likelihood we will overshoot Secondly, if that does occur and maybe even if it doesn't--and this is a point that you certainly alluded to--I think we need to be prepared to reverse our actions at some point rather promptly   I want to think about it   Given the current operating procedures, this recommendation of enhanced consultation makes a lot of sense If we were to do that, I think some of the concerns that several of us felt would be much allayed   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy has shown some signs of strengthening in recent months The California economy, which contracted in terms of employment between July and December, is showing some positive signs Although the California unemployment rate rose markedly in February, that largely reflected a sharp increase in the labor force Payroll employment growth actually was up strongly in January and flat in February Moreover, anecdotal evidence suggests that the residential real estate market is beginning to recover in the coastal California cities And recent rains have raised reservoir levels to a point where some of the more drastic rationing plans are now being softened The rest of the District appears to have avoided any significant downturn All Twelfth District states have higher employment growth rates than the national average and most did not experience much of the slowdown [seen  -26-    3/26/91  elsewhere] following the onset of the Persian Gulf crisis Annualized payroll employment growth rates between July and January outside of California ranged from 2 percent in Arizona to 6-1/2 percent in Nevada Increased real estate activity is also reported in Seattle Other real estate markets, which were not as adversely impacted last fall, remain stable The relative strength in the West is reflected in its commercial bank lending Although loan growth has slowed, loan volumes continue to rise Total loans at the District's largest banks rose 7 percent in February over a year ago compared to only 12 percent for the rest of the nation District bank real estate lending accounted for much of the fast growth, increasing 104 percent over the level a year earlier Admittedly, some of this was a result of changing shares as the commercial banks successfully competed against the savings and loans in the District  Turning to the national outlook, we expect a short recession and moderate recovery especially now that the war in the Gulf is over and oil prices have remained low Specifically, we anticipate an economy much like the Greenbook forecast with output declining at a rate of about 2 to 3 percent in the current quarter and recovery, we would expect, before midyear The sectors that have contributed most to the fall-off in final sales, namely consumer spending and also residential investment, should contribute the most to the recovery in final sales Retail sales and housing starts reports for February and the upsurge in consumer confidence in early March are certainly consistent with this kind of outlook Because the recovery in our view is likely to be moderate by historical standards, we expect the unemployment rate to stay in the 6-1/2 to 7 percent range this year and then to decline gradually in 1992 Temporary slack in the economy should produce a moderate decline in the inflation rate between this year and next, as in the Greenbook forecast But we also expect that an increase in the fed funds rate will be required later this year to keep inflation on a flat to declining path Thank you   Mr Chairman, I could support your recommendation of alternative B, no change in policy, since it certainly appears that the economy will be recovering at a satisfactory pace several months from now, especially in light of our recent policy moves I also have a preference for a policy directive that is symmetrical Before any further policy action is taken, consideration of the inflationary implications of such a policy seems necessary I think the persisting high long-term interest rates are indicative of the market's concerns about inflationary pressures in the future as well as its perceptions of the strength of the economy Given that a near-term turnaround in the economy is being widely forecast, such precaution appears especially warranted at this time Also, forecasts of a turnaround would seem to be more credible now that war-related uncertainties have been substantially reduced So, I would support alternative B and symmetric language   Are you surprised by the narrowing of quality spreads at the long-term end of the market? What do you think explains most of that narrowing, particularly that involving less than investment grade securities?   One of the reasons for weakness in the second quarter is the pickup in nonfarm inventory liquidation If you look at what we know in terms of sales and industrial production, which is admittedly very sketchy, do you think it's possible or would you say more likely now that we could actually see the pattern that seemed to be developing in the first quarter continuing in the second? That is, could actual inventory liquidation turn out to be less in the second quarter than in the first?   But GNP has been strong   Again, is that relative to the GNP decline?   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District employment statistics have become a bit weaker since our last meeting, although the District as a whole continues to outperform the rest of the nation In March only the state of Arizona reported a month-to-month gain in employment in our District However, the declines in the District's other states follow several months of relatively robust employment growth Employment levels still are between 16 and 48 percent higher than they were a year ago in District states other than California And that would compare, I think, to a fall of about 12 percent in the rest of the nation California's economy has slowed with the nation Since last July employment has fallen nearly every month; in April the state posted its first year-over-year decline in the level of employment which was down 04 of a percent Durable goods employment continues to fall, led by declines in aerospace and electronics I think some of our losses were gains in the Atlanta District Construction employment has fallen to a level about 8 percent less than it was a year ago but, interestingly, real estate sales and prices have picked up As a matter of fact, the median price of residential real estate in California is now above its previous peak  The effects of California's economic slowdown, combined with growing structural problems in the state's budget, have resulted in a projected $126 billion deficit by the end of the next fiscal year Tax receipts have been low for rather obvious reasons weak sales, weak consumer spending, and also unexpectedly low corporate and bank profits At the same time, case loads in the health area, welfare, and especially at prisons have risen sharply, and mandatory cost-of- living adjustments have further increased required expenditures At the same time Governor Wilson has proposed [reducing] the deficit through a 15 cent sales tax increase--the tax right now is 6 percent or higher based upon some local initiatives--elimination of all COLAs on programs, and shifting some state services to the counties, although no one can figure out where the counties are going to get the money to finance this Where this will all end up is difficult to say because the governor is adamant about not changing income taxes  As far as the national outlook is concerned, our view is not very different from that of the Greenbook We have slightly slower economic growth and a bit less inflation We expect the economy to be roughly flat in the current quarter and then we think real growth probably will average somewhere in the 3 to 3-1/2 percent range in the second half, which is a little weaker actually than the Greenbook Next year, we look for growth to slow a bit to 2-1/2 to 3 percent It's clear that the main sources of expansion should be the easing of monetary policy, which President Black referred to, a gradual improvement in consumer and business confidence, and a pickup in inventory investment It also seems quite obvious that the recent rise in the dollar and slower economic growth abroad are going to limit the contribution to growth that will be coming from the foreign sector In view of the slack in the economy and also the lower oil    5/14/91  prices and the higher dollar, we would expect inflation as measured by the CPI to decline next year to about the 3 to 3-1/2 percent range   Peter, has the equality of the discount rate and the federal funds rate presented any special problems or opportunities in terms of the conduct of operations by the Desk?   Would you expect that to be a serious difficulty in terms of complicating operations?   Yes   The suggestion of introducing greater funds rate volatility under existing operating procedures is not something that I find very attractive And re-establishing an inflexible borrowing reserve target I don't find appealing at all But it seems to me a couple of the things in the papers are really quite [helpful] There are some interesting points conveyed in the examples in Dave Lindsey's memo with regard to a greater role for deviations of M2 in affecting our policy in the intermeeting period I also found Al Broaddus's arguments interesting And in the past we've gotten some [worthwhile] suggestions from Tom Melzer We've done some work looking at Bennett McCallum's monetary base procedures, which are linked to nominal income targeting, and they seem to provide some [promising] procedures as well It seems to me that there are enough things of some interest here that maybe we ought to heighten our look at possibilities Perhaps the System Research Advisory Committee could look at some of these possibilities or we could even have some studies done by the FOMC itself There are some things here that could be useful What    8/20/91  we're trying to do is to find an approach that is better than the current procedure, not one that is necessarily perfect in an absolute sense So, I think these papers are very useful   I guess I'm not as enthusiastic about that suggestion It seems to me that an approach that would solve our problems and in addition enable us to highlight things that we think are important when important events occur is what Don indicated in 4b on page 3 and a slight variation of 4c on page 4 That does involve repeating the long-term objectives, but it states them there and then just indicates the kinds of things we want to put in at a meeting that are of particular importance If we don't go through each meeting ordering the four or five elements, this just focuses on things that at that particular meeting were important To me this has the flexibility and also the emphasis on the longer term, and I think it's very constructive and preferable to what we have   The assumption made in the forecast with regard to the dollar is that it remains constant Is that an exogenous determination? And if it is, what, for example, would the MPS model give for the dollar and what would be its implications?   Thank you, Mr Chairman Following weak activity in recent months, the Twelfth District economy shows few signs of recovery at the present time California's economy, which contracted somewhat less than the nation's throughout most of the recession, remains sluggish Payroll employment has been flat since March; manufacturing and construction employment continue to contract and cutbacks planned for state and local government sectors are expected to weaken employment further I might also add that we're likely to see greater weakness in the aerospace industry primarily located in southern California as well If you look outside California, the conditions are really quite mixed States such as Washington, Oregon, and Nevada have experienced employment declines in recent months and that's a bit of a change from what their experience had been a few months ago Also, as in California, the weakness in their employment has been primarily in construction and manufacturing Three states-- Idaho, Utah, and Arizona--remain relatively strong, with rather impressive increases in employment Nonresidential construction is obviously quite weak; residential real estate construction is showing some signs of recovery Sales activity and median prices are above their year-ago levels in California and in the West in general Permits for new construction are up as are housing starts, at least for the month of June This renewed activity, however, has yet to be reflected in increased construction employment, and we do have quite a few builders reporting difficulty in [obtaining] financing I might note that the banks in general seem to be talking much more about difficulties they are having with the examination process and the impact that is likely to have on their lending decisions I might also point out that it seems to me reasonable to assume--and this was alluded to in the Bluebook--that given some of the major mergers    8/20/91  throughout the country and particularly the one in our District, it's likely that the enthusiasm with which these banks approach new and existing business in the six-month period when they're putting together their mergers will be considerably less  If I can turn to the national outlook, our forecast is not greatly different from that in the Greenbook, if one assumes that the value of the dollar remains constant I think that is a critical assumption In the near term I would assume that the main sources of the strength in the economy would be household outlays on such things as durable goods and also housing Next year perhaps we can look forward to something of a turnaround in business spending for equipment Obviously in this forecast, as has been mentioned by many others and certainly by Mike Prell, there are both downside and upside risks Clearly, the recent slowdown in M2 and concerns about financial fragility do raise the prospect and the risk that the recovery could turn out to be less than that in the Greenbook But I also have to take into account the chance of a more typical post- recession pickup in expenditures It wouldn't be the first time that we've been surprised by the strength of the recovery While I'm optimistic about inflation and I think it will decline over the next year and a half, the recent behavior of wage costs is certainly a concern And those concerns were adequately expressed in the Greenbook I might note in closing that we do have a model forecast where the dollar is treated endogenously In light of what has happened in the last 48 hours, the discussion of a lower dollar doesn't seem as relevant But that forecast includes the possibility of the dollar declining between now and the end of next year at a rate of about 15 percent The impact on real growth in 1992 is very substantial; it adds more than a percent to growth and adds about 03 of a percent to inflation I have to admit that I am more comfortable with the assumption of a constant dollar, but most of the models I've looked at have a tendency to cause the dollar to decline somewhat   Mr Chairman, I would agree with your recommendation on alternative B It does seem clear that the economy is likely to undergo a moderate recovery and that--also similar to the Greenbook forecast--we'll see modest gains with regard to inflation However, I do feel that there are risks on both sides of the forecast and I'm not so sure that they're all that unbalanced So, if I had a preference, it would be for symmetric language   II   I have two questions One is on nonresidential construction of structures There has been a very protracted and also sharp fall-off for 13 quarters Is that almost unique in terms of cyclical history?   The duration clearly is; is it the biggest drop?   I would assume that after that process is completed some of the major excesses that occurred prior to that would pretty well be offset Let me ask a question on inventories Clearly, the pattern for the next couple of quarters is going to be dramatically impacted by what happens in that area What you had for the third quarter is the continuation of a very conservative inventory policy We have July numbers; we have production and sales numbers for August Are they basically consistent with a nonfarm inventory liquidation of that magnitude, which is really still very substantial?   We have them They have that in them?   Sure   Thank you   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth Federal Reserve District economy is producing mixed signals at the present time Several sectors are reporting continued declines For example, unlike the recovery occurring elsewhere in the nation, the District's manufacturing sector continues to contract California has been particularly hard hit, having lost 38,000 aerospace jobs since January of last year Banks are reporting loan levels that have fallen faster than in the nation as a whole; total loans are down 36 percent from the level a year ago Retail sales are reported to be sluggish throughout most of the District, although in the states of Arizona and Idaho there is the report of strength Construction and real estate activity are weak, with continued job losses in July reported in the District; and nonresidential construction activity remains weak, particularly in California Residential sales, after rebounding in the spring, have declined for three consecutive months  There are other indicators, however, that are turning positive Total employment in the District rose in July for the first time in six months The July increase occurred in all District states except Alaska, and it left the District's employment approximately 02 percentage points over what it was a year earlier Trade employment rose for the first time in six months while service jobs were added at a solid 47 percent annualized rate between June and July  If I can turn to the national outlook, we expect to see a modest recovery over the next six quarters, and I'd say it's roughly at the same pace as that in the Greenbook, assuming that the value of the dollar is constant In the near term we expect that the main sources of growth will be in household outlays on durables and housing plus a switch from inventory liquidation to inventory accumulation And then next year we would anticipate a turnaround of business equipment spending We are optimistic that a moderate recovery would be consistent with moderate declines in both the inflation rate and the unemployment rate in the period We also believe that there is a chance that the dollar may drop as much as 10 percent over the next year and a half as long-term interest rates fall and also as the US demand for imports grows If that were to happen, that path of the dollar would add approximately 1/2 point to the growth rate of GNP  -11-    10/1/91  next year but also would add 1/2 point to the inflation rate by early 1993 Thank you   That they're weak and probably have come down  -20-    10/1/91   I think the weakness in prices and its continuation are broadly consistent with the forecast If you had these prices bottoming out now and presumably moving up in the next quarter or so, maybe you would have your [projected] decline in nonresidential construction and maybe within that the commercial [sector] coming to an end But to the extent that that forecast is  -21-    10/1/91  correct, I would anticipate considerable weakness in prices in the months and quarters ahead   The forecast of M2 is adjusted; how are the errors treated?   In other words, using the model, we would have gotten numbers significantly higher than in the Bluebook?   Yes   Okay, so in effect you're saying--  MR, KOHN The growth rates we'd be seeing would be more like 6 percent than 3 percent   Do the errors deteriorate or are you basically--?   Okay   Mr Chairman, as you indicated, the economy does appear to be recovering from the recession; at the current level of the funds rate, the forecast for moderate growth along with some gains against inflation certainly seems reasonable I also think that the downside risk in the outlook has been addressed by the recent decline in interest rates Consequently, I would certainly support the idea that we leave policy unchanged at this time, and I must admit a slight preference myself for a symmetric policy here   You mean you can't make a recommendation on the discount rate independent of that?   Yes, but you--   Is that a one-day meeting?   Looking at the forecast once we get beyond the next two quarters, short rates certainly would be considered acceptable, I think It seems to me that one of the things that has changed rather dramatically is the thinking with regard to inventory investment I wonder if you could comment on how you reached these conclusions because, clearly, if you had some of the previous thoughts about inventories, you probably would have shown a bit more strength   Did you suggest that there would be a possibility of that third-quarter number being revised?   I would assume that they would have incorporated fairly fully what happened in the auto industry in September I think auto inventories were very high in August; I had assumed they'd be down somewhat in September   Yes   But wouldn't they have taken that into [account]?   Thank you   Mr Chairman, economic conditions in the Twelfth District reflect widespread weakness Recent employment data for the western states have been disappointing Total employment fell at an annual rate of 1-1/2 percent in September California continues to show particular weakness Employment in California fell at an annual rate of 4-1/4 percent in September and at a 1-1/2 percent rate in October I might note parenthetically that this issue about the reliability of the payroll series is a very controversial one in California The Department of Finance is estimating that the peak-to- trough decline in employment in California is in excess of 300,000 as opposed to the published data of 100,000 So, it's a very hot issue; and politically it's quite an issue because tax revenues are coming in at a very low level and seem to be more consistent with the more pessimistic outlook that we have for employment Even in states where growth has been robust in the recent past--particularly I'd cite Idaho and Utah--employment has shown lower growth or even declines in recent months Weakness is also widespread across sectors of the western economy as well as in states Manufacturing and construction continue to lose jobs in the District In addition, the growth in the services sector, which has been the region's primary source of strength in recent months, has slowed to a crawl  Anecdotal information also suggests deterioration, as pessimism about poor economic conditions has spread from California to most other parts of the District We conduct a business sentiment survey which, among other things, asks whether or not a recession is anticipated during the next year The last time we conducted it before this most recent period, 7 percent said they thought there would be a recession in the next year; that has risen to 17 percent  If I can turn to the national outlook, the data that we've all seen since the last meeting have certainly led us to revise down significantly our forecast for real GNP for this quarter and the next Our forecast for growth in the fourth quarter is that it will be slower than in the third quarter, although we do not have a double-dip recession and we don't think that is likely Like the Greenbook, we expect growth to rebound to a much more satisfactory rate throughout most of 1992, and the major sources of strength are the interest- sensitive sectors of the economy and inventories as well As far as inflation is concerned, I'd have to say that the news on that front is somewhat encouraging The low fixed-weight GNP price index in the third quarter and the moderation of the employment cost index, especially wages, are encouraging Overall, our expectation is that    11/5/91  there will be some reduction of inflation in 1992 compared to this year, which is a bit of a difference from the Greenbook Thank you, Mr Chairman   In the commercial real estate area there is   And I think if you were to focus on southern California, particularly Los Angeles, there's quite a serious problem Vacancy rates are quite high and they're going to rise over the next year because there is an awful lot of building that will be coming on line in the next 12 months Another area is Orange County, which is suffering as well Those two areas are significant enough to make the general picture of the state with regard to commercial real estate look quite negative When you look at some other areas, such as San Francisco, it's not nearly as bad They put a moratorium on building, which has kept building at very moderate levels for the last several years; so I don't see that [area] as a problem The other point is that the [situation in] residential real estate is quite different from the commercial Residential, at least in terms of prices, has held up quite well, although clearly the sales of new houses are weak It's a problem   Mr Chairman, it's pretty clear that the recent data have intensified doubts about the whole process of the recovery; that's clear to all of us At the same time, we seem to be making some progress with regard to inflation Under these circumstances, I too would favor the middle course, which I would define as a 25 basis point cut in the funds rate I really would not favor the 50 basis point decline It seems to me that gradualism has served us quite well Of course, we reduced the funds rate 1/4 point last week and I think another 25 basis point, presumably on Friday, would be appropriate If we wish to ring the "gong," it's very easy to do that, of course And I guess in some respects I would be in favor of that It seems to me that if the move of 25 basis points that we're talking about were combined with a move on the discount rate, that probably would accomplish a great deal as well Finally, in terms of the language, I would favor asymmetric language on the down side   Yes   Well, maybe Peter ought to address that issue   Yes   Yes   I would support it as well I think it's good to have the distinction between long-run objectives and attention to the shorter-term developments in the economic, financial, and monetary areas in the same basic sentence And I think it's an improvement over what we had   In the key assumptions section, you discussed fiscal policy and indicated that action was likely but that the impact was likely to be quite small in terms of affecting the economy in '92 or '93 I wondered if you could give us some views about what some of the most likely possibilities are This is more a question for Don Winn, I guess   It seems to me that a lot of them, in the effort to try to maintain the integrity of the budget agreement, end up almost with no effect   Thank you   Mr Chairman, business sentiment and confidence and general economic conditions in the Twelfth District have deteriorated since our last meeting Confidence of District business leaders and expectations of retail sales have weakened The comments we receive from our directors and Beigebook contacts are now almost uniformly negative with the only exceptions being those from Utah and Idaho, where conditions are really quite good Department store and auto sales in early December are reported to be extremely weak throughout the District Employment conditions in California and the State of Washington have worsened while remaining the same in other District states--that is, relatively strong with the exception of Arizona After leveling this summer, payroll employment in California has fallen for three consecutive months And employment in the State of Washington has declined in 7 of the past 8 months, with job losses centered in construction and also in trade Manufacturing employment    12/17/91  in the State of Washington remains stable and that's largely a result of the strength of Boeing Conditions in most other District states are relatively stronger In October, employment expanded at annual rates ranging from 16 percent in Hawaii to 13 percent in Alaska, with most states growing in the 7 to 9 percent range Employment in Arizona, however, declined for the second consecutive month  As I'm sure you know, agriculture has become the largest industry in California and it's very important in the District as well We seem to have a series of problems that affect agriculture, such as drought and those kinds of things The new one, of course, is the white fly infestation, which is devastating the Imperial Valley What we now see is of such a magnitude that it actually had a significant impact on the CPI in November So, we're not sure what other natural disasters can befall us, but there probably are one or two more that we could experience  Turning to the national outlook, data since our last meeting have certainly led us to revise down significantly our forecast for real GNP in this quarter and the next Like the Greenbook, we expect the economy to be roughly flat in the current quarter For the first quarter of next year we do have a slight positive; but since the uncertainty is so high I certainly wouldn't argue strongly with the small decline incorporated in the Greenbook In the quarters that follow we have growth rebounding to around 3 percent, with the major source of strength being spending for inventories and also some strength in the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy It seems to us that the outlook for inflation is clearly encouraging It certainly was good to see the lower PPI and CPI figures for November as well as the moderation in unit labor costs Overall, we expect a reduction of inflation in 1992 compared with the average of this year   They really don't have many ways of dealing with it Apparently, the chemicals don't work very effectively, so what they're looking for are some natural predators I think they have found some small [unintelligible] or something like that that is a natural predator But the infestation is spreading; it has already gone into Arizona and is moving a little farther north in California, but it won't get too far north because of the cold But the Imperial Valley, which has mainly truck types of crops--lettuce, tomatoes, strawberries, and things like that--really has been devastated The white flies have wiped out over 70 percent of the honeydew crop, for example   I don't know I'll get the technical description later   Mr Chairman, I could accept "B" asymmetric I would hope that [if and] when the rate is moved that it would be accompanied by a change in the discount rate and that we would find some opportunity to emphasize or highlight our longer-term objective In addition, I'd emphasize the point that we've made around this table that it's important for us to be willing to reverse direction when circumstances dictate And I would like very much to disagree with Tom Melzer, if I am understanding him correctly I don't want to join this dialogue that monetary policy can't do any more I think that's wrong There may be an issue of whether we should do any more, and that's certainly a legitimate question I hope we never join the group that says that we're pushing on a string and can't do any more   I think you said "We can't do any more" Maybe I didn't hear what you said What did you say?   Oh, I thought you said we couldn't   Peter, you made reference to the strong demands for credit as playing a role in terms of what has happened to interest rates But the debt aggregates seem to suggest, when you look at what actually has been new debt, that there really hasn't [been much]; it has been quite weak I guess most of it is mainly [unintelligible] Is that really much of a factor?   But when it comes to the debt aggregate it just doesn't show up as being very strong; it's very weak   Ted, two characteristics of the usual forecast are what was mentioned the downward trajectory for long-term rates and also a flat dollar What are the interest rate developments internationally that are assisting in bringing this about? For example, in our model we almost have to constrain it from pushing the value of the dollar down in that kind of environment   Japan?   Would more conventional linkages among rates produce a decline in the value of the dollar when one uses the model?   They produce an unchanged dollar?   The Prell factor! Thank you   Thank you Mr Chairman, the Western economy appears to us to be moving sideways, although I must admit there are a few encouraging signs that have emerged since the last meeting We do a survey of business leaders and ask them their views about future developments One of the questions that we ask them is whether they expect any declines in output in the next two to four quarters In January, more than 30 percent indicated that they did In the most recent survey, that number was a little over 10 percent We also have seen a bit of a change in the residential real estate market In California, for example, the number of existing homes sold has risen in each of the last four months, and the gain that we saw in February was the sharpest month-to-month gain in five years Moreover, retail sales don't seem to be deteriorating the way they were One major retailer on the West Coast indicated that in the month of February his sales were up 8 percent from the year-ago period and another major California retailer indicated that sales were about 10 percent above year-earlier levels One recognizes that there were some special factors, including the extra day in February and also the war-related weakness that occurred the year before  I'm sure you've heard about or are familiar with the benchmark revisions going on with regard to employment data On a negative note, the California benchmark revisions for employment are expected to show a falloff of 4 percent since July of 1990, which is more than double the decline that we've been working with in the preliminary data  If I can turn briefly to the national outlook, it certainly seems clear to everyone that final sales have picked up rather significantly in the first quarter As a result of these developments, it would seem to me that the risks to the outlook are more symmetrical than they were at the time of our last meeting when the downside risks seemed to dominate Our forecast is very similar to that of the Greenbook Both forecasts include a downward path for long-term interest rates, which to me seems consistent with the fundamentals of a moderate expansion Such an outcome for rates, however, as we've mentioned a couple of times, does not accord with market expectations My own view is that if we do get those kinds of rates, it's conceivable at least that we'll see the dollar decline rather than remain flat Finally, it would seem to me, given the current low level of economic activity and also the prospect of a modest expansion, that the Greenbook's basic outlook for a gradual downward trend in underlying inflation certainly makes a lot of sense Thank you  -12-    3/31/92   Mr Chairman, the Greenbook forecast certainly is more optimistic now than it was at the time of our meeting in February In addition, it seems to me that the recent data suggest that the risks are more evenly balanced than they were, far more than appeared in February That leads me to have a preference for alternative B and a slight preference for a symmetric directive I must admit, though, that I do fear the possibility that we'll see a situation similar to what we had last year And I certainly don't take much comfort from what we just heard about the aggregates So, I would not object to asymmetry   Mike, you went through some of the risks to the forecast It seems to me that there are some areas where the economy could turn out somewhat better Some of the work we've done suggests that perhaps we could get greater strength in the residential sector It's conceivable that the dollar may end up being somewhat weaker than was estimated in the forecast and then net exports would continue to be somewhat better as well And the equipment area could be stronger And finally, inventories--though they are not likely to get back to a traditional relationship--could perhaps not change as much as seems to be implied in the forecast When you look at the risks, do you see a real symmetry of risks in this forecast or do you think there might be a predominance of risks on one side or the other? What strikes me now as opposed to the [forecast at the time of the] prior FOMC meeting is that, at least in terms of visibility, there seem to be some upside risks that weren't there before   Although rates have come down   So, you would say the risks still are relatively balanced?   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Twelfth District economy is experiencing varied signals, with weakness in California offset by modest growth in other District states In California, there is some improvement in the north, with continued problems in the southern part of the state I guess that latter comment is something of an understatement The five-county Los Angeles area accounts for 50 percent of state employment and it also accounts for 80 percent of the 550,000 jobs in the state that were lost between May 1990 and March 1992 So, it's clear that not only is there weakness in the state but it is highly concentrated in the southern part of the state The riots in Los Angeles are estimated to have cost $1 billion in total property damage and to have resulted in additional job losses of around 25,000 Now, I have seen estimates as high as 40,000, and that may be referring to a peak that endured for just the number of days immediately following the riots But the number that we're going with is 25,000; and expectations are that in a number of weeks that could fall below 10,000 as some buildings are repaired and some stores are restocked, because some stores were just looted and not seriously damaged There is also obviously further concern about the effects of the riots on tourism and firm location decisions And while I'm still talking about Los Angeles, I don't think I can give you any of those glimmers of hope with regard to commercial real estate Last year 9 million square feet of office space was added in the Los Angeles area It caused vacancy rates to shoot up quite a bit; it depressed lease rates and property values; and projects under way indicate that the problem is going to get somewhat worse before it gets better So, I have not been able to pick up any improvements, at least in the Los Angeles area I would agree with what Jerry Jordan says in terms of some other areas in the District We even picked up a few optimistic comments coming from some people in the state of Washington where there also was a fairly serious condition of over-building as well  For the state [of California] as a whole, indicators of economic activity are mixed Existing home sales reports indicate a modest rebound; payroll employment rose in April; and it appears as though agricultural conditions are improving However, manufacturing employment continues to contract And while construction employment has risen for two consecutive months, nonresidential construction awards and residential permits are below their year-earlier levels  There is a very big issue that you may begin to read a bit more about in the month ahead Reflecting recent economic weakness, the state faces a severe shortfall of $10 to $12 billion through the end of the next fiscal year Not surprisingly, revenues have fallen substantially below projections The law in California requires that they enter the new fiscal year with tax and spending plans to produce a balanced budget And this is before July 1st There obviously are some things that they can do that are of a rather tricky nature, but in large part they have to find $10 to $12 billion of reduced spending or higher taxes And that's not exactly the Keynesian approach to dealing with California's problems  -14-    5/19/92  Outside of California, District states have performed relatively well over the recession, and they continue to show modest growth Construction activity is rising in several District states as are home sales Cutbacks continue to be reported, unfortunately, in aerospace, with job losses of 6,500 projected for Boeing this year I should point out that Boeing employs over 100,000 in the Seattle area In addition, Boeing continues to have a large backlog of orders and actually has a very strong long-run forecast with growing demand from the Pacific and Asian region Contacts that we have in nondefense manufacturing report a modest rebound, with lumber and wood products manufacturing currently bottoming out, and that was a considerable source of weakness in the past year  If I may turn briefly to the national scene, incoming data since our last meeting seem to add to confidence that a moderate recovery is under way Indeed, as I [noted] in my discussion with Mike, it's not difficult to come up with an outlook that is a bit stronger than is indicated in the Greenbook For example, our analysis points to somewhat greater strength in inventory investment, residential construction, and net exports And we end up with a growth rate over the next year and a half of a little over 3 percent compared to the Greenbook expectation of 2-3/4 percent I agree with the Greenbook that inflation is on a very slow downward trend, but I fear that such slow progress will make others question the resolve of the Fed to deal with inflation longer term It seems to me that we might be at a point soon where we'll have to be more forthcoming about our inflation objectives And probably we can't do that until 1993 Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, I would strongly support your recommendation It seems to me quite likely that the economy could be growing at a rate of 3 percent over the next six quarters At the same time, all of our forecasts are showing that inflation is not going to show significant improvement In that kind of environment and with those kinds of prospects, I think it would be very desirable not to change policy and also to have a symmetrical directive I might also point out that if we get a very significant upward revision of those first-quarter data and the next thing that hits the financial market is the fact that we had an asymmetric toward ease directive, I don't think that would be received very favorably in the financial markets at all So, I believe the case for a symmetric directive is quite strong Thank you   President Forrestal covered it   Mr Chairman, economic conditions in the West appear to have deteriorated further since our last meeting Employment fell in June in all Twelfth District states except Utah The number of jobs fell especially sharply in the state of California, at an annualized rate of 54 percent And California employment remained weak in July, rising only slightly California's budget problems are going to be yet another source of weakness in this troubled area The implementation of the new budget--whenever it comes--will have a much greater negative impact than the stalemate itself Most of the $8 billion plus budget shortfall will be resolved through cuts in spending by state and local governments and schools, which will further weaken the state economy Now, in addition to the $8 billion plus [shortfall], we have a $2 billion carryover from the prior year which is why in Part II of the Greenbook there is a reference to about $11 billion But there's another interesting point to be made, and that is that the estimate of the deficit for the current fiscal year is based upon a forecast that is old They are going to be making a new forecast in a week or so and that's likely to show an even larger budget problem--probably $2 billion above the current estimate of the problem for this fiscal year There is a tremendous incentive for agreement in the next week so they don't have to deal with the $2 billion problem that at this point is unofficial Lawmakers from both parties are strenuously opposed to increasing state taxes, although fees at the state's universities have been raised substantially and some tax increases by local governments are possible as well  Turning to the national economy, we continue to forecast a moderate expansion with most of the strength coming from sectors that are sensitive to interest rates and also to exchange rates Our projection is somewhat stronger than that in the Greenbook, largely as a result of more inventory investment and also somewhat slower growth in imports With activity continuing to fall below the economy's capacity, we expect further downward pressure on the inflation rate In our opinion consumer price inflation is likely to fall from 3 percent this year to around 2-1/2 percent next year While this scenario seems like a reasonable one, there clearly are downside risks to the real economy As has been noted, the expected moderate expansion has seemed likely for a year now and has so far failed to materialize Thank you   Well, the problem now is that quite a few of the large financial institutions are unwilling to accept them Consequently that means that some people who are receiving vouchers in effect have to stick them in the top drawer until they can be cashed in after a budget agreement or they can be given to an institution that will accept them or be returned to the state For example, some businesses--I don't think this is very widespread--that receive money from the state because they sell things to the state are making their sales tax payments with these vouchers   Well, it depends on what the market is at that point If they are just giving them the face value, then the state would in effect be picking up the 5 percent return   I'm not sure where exactly they are!   Oh, they would And the market, if you were to buy them, would reflect that   Well, the budget agreement presumably raises funds to meet all expenditures, including expenditures now being made   The only thing that's not in the budget as a revenue source I assume--and maybe it's being built in--is the accrued interest as these are held over a period of time So, I think the money is there; there may be some timing differences I don't see a problem unless I'm missing something   "B" asymmetric   How effective have the Germans been in sterilizing? I think short-term rates have come down a fair amount, which would suggest that they have [not completed the sterilization]   Thank you   Wells Fargo had a problem too   Mike, relative to previous forecasts, this forecast seems to get started a bit later and when we get to the faster growth it's not quite as strong, at least in 1993, as it was before Would you characterize this as an indication of greater uncertainty on your part as to the strength of the economy, both short and long term?   I would ask Ted a question as well The import numbers are really quite strong; I guess that's attributed to computers If one looks at the normal relationship between an economy exhibiting the characteristics that we currently see, isn't this really an extraordinary increase in imports given what we see for [unintelligible]?   Doing too well?   Do people in the industry feel as though this is going to continue for some period?   They're not making the distinction of whether it's a US purchase or a German purchase   Mr Chairman, economic weakness persists in most of the Twelfth District and it may have intensified since our last meeting District-wide employment fell in August at a 46 percent annual rate, led by weakness in construction and manufacturing Job losses have been most severe in California, where employment fell at a  -19-    10/6/92  62 percent annual rate in August and at a 21 percent rate in September, bringing employment in the state of California to a new cyclical low Other District states also are beginning to show some signs of weakness Previously robust growth in Idaho and Utah has [waned], with employment declining on balance since February Cutbacks in aerospace production are affecting Washington, and the lumber and wood products business is contracting in Oregon in large part due to environmental restrictions Both business contacts and statistical indicators of District activity give little evidence of renewed economic growth The outlook for California is of particular concern Already announced cutbacks in aerospace, defense, and state and local government, together with an overhang in commercial real estate, suggest weakness could persist well into 1993  Turning to the national economy, our forecast is quite similar to that of the Greenbook I would characterize our forecast as one in which the pickup in the economy, instead of being just around the corner, appears to be just around the corner and well down the block In addition, once economic activity gets to that point it doesn't seem to be quite as robust as we had it before That development produces greater uncertainty at least on my part That combined with what appear to be better inflation rates in the offing suggests that a policy move at this time would be appropriate   Mr Chairman, I'd like to set aside for the moment the issues of financial instability and what could happen in foreign exchange markets and the issues associated with being close to the election But it seems to me that in many ways this has been a very different meeting from those we've had in the past In the past, we've seen a forecast where the economy looked as though it was going to pick up almost imminently and that the rate of growth would be something on the order of acceptable There were certainly concerns about whether or not that would be realized That generally would result in our having asymmetric language and then when we saw some statistics come out that confirmed or heightened those uncertainties, we would ease I think this is a unique meeting This is a meeting where the Greenbook has come up with a forecast that is much more negative; it shows that the pickup is coming considerably later and that when the economy does expand it's going to be less strong Based on the discussion, I counted approximately 11 who seemed to be in substantial agreement with that and who voiced concern about the direction of the economy That is far more powerful to me as [an indication of] what we should do on policy--the work has been done collectively by all of us and our staffs and in the Greenbook--than what developments might occur in the next two to three weeks Consequently, I would recommend that we reduce rates--my proposal would be 25 basis points in terms of the funds rate--and that we have asymmetric language   We really have two requests from Mr Gonzalez, isn't that correct? The one that came to you mentioned the memoranda of discussion and videotaping The one that came to the presidents was a bit different I interpreted the question that came to the presidents, although Mr Gonzalez used the word "minutes," as referring to the record of policy actions Is it possible that we presidents could answer that question--and maybe we should even have the presidents provide a group answer--and not even refer to memoranda of discussion or videotaping? What could be given up in terms of the record of policy actions is that conceivably it could be provided sooner than 6 to 8 weeks--maybe a month or whatever time it takes for drafting and reviewing and revising those minutes Would that buy us anything? Would he find that acceptable?   And there have been periods when it has been misinterpreted   That's what they would try   The presidents are coming in for dinner Sunday night   Yes, we are   Mr Chairman, conditions in the Twelfth District are little changed from our last meeting, with continued weakness in California offsetting modest growth in the other District states District-wide employment in September fell at a 11 percent annual rate, led by weakness in California California employment by itself fell at a 38 percent annual rate in September and 21 percent in October; that brings the state's employment to a new cyclical low I might also point out that there's a consensus among forecasters that the actual level of employment is 100,000 less than is being reported in the survey Last year there was a similar view that employment was being exaggerated, and revised figures certainly confirmed that  Outside of California, District employment expanded at a 33 percent annual rate in September The contacts we have in Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Utah report fairly favorable conditions But California is weak; in Washington conditions are flat due to production cutbacks in aerospace; and Hawaii is affected by slumping tourism The weakness that we're seeing in California certainly is a concern Already announced cutbacks in aerospace, defense, and state and local governments, together with an overhang in commercial real estate, have led forecasters to project that we're going to see continued job losses in the state of California through the end of 1993 This weak projected economic performance threatens California with yet another state budget shortfall of at least $4 billion through the end of the next fiscal year, which is 1993-94 Reflecting this ongoing weakness, lending continued to decline in October at large District banks Commercial, consumer, and real estate loan volumes are down from their year-earlier levels  Turning to the national economy, our outlook is similar to that of the Greenbook if we assume no change in monetary policy through the end of that period The modest 2-1/4 percent growth that we anticipate, again assuming no further easing, is down 1/2 percent from what we expected at the time of the October meeting That's mainly a result of the higher value of the dollar and prospects for slower economic growth abroad Consistent with sluggish growth in output, we expect to see only small declines in the unemployment rate over the next year or so and thus continued downward pressure on underlying inflation Our view is that the CPI will come in at around 2-3/4 percent in '93 and a bit lower than that in '94 Thank you   What precisely do we owe the Banking Committee?   But didn't you tell them that?   Okay   With regard to the long-run target ranges, I thought in July that it would be best to lower the [M2] range and I feel that way this time as well It seems to me that the additional information we got from the study suggests that a cut in the range would be appropriate And the staff projection of 2 percent certainly would support that as well So, to me it would make some sense to cut it, and I don't see any harm in doing it now I disagree with something a few people have said, particularly what Governor Angell said if I interpreted him correctly, that we could get some additional benefit as far as inflationary expectations are concerned by taking action now I would say that would only happen if we didn't explain that it was based on technical adjustments If we did say it was based on technical adjustments and people believed that, then we would not get any impact on inflationary expectations So, my counsel would be to change it and not say a heck of a lot about it if we really want to get some effect as far as inflationary expectations are concerned   On the short-term policy, this has been another very interesting meeting We've seen a dramatic change; there are many more people who now see a pickup or at least somewhat improved prospects in their Districts Another thing I find very interesting is that very few people said they have changed their nationwide forecast In fact, many went on to say that things have picked up but that their forecast is very similar to that in the Greenbook, with the notable exception, I think, of the Chairman who seemed to imply that he was a little more optimistic based upon his fiscal assumptions If the forecast that most people agree upon is that of the Greenbook or close to it, which is not very much different in terms of real growth from what it was the last time and has been characterized in the past as being sluggish, perhaps too sluggish, what has changed? Unless we're going to make policy decisions on the basis of what happened to the economy in the last three or four weeks--if we're going to look instead at the longer term--what has changed? If nothing has changed, it seems to me that the case some of us made for a slight easing at the previous meeting is just as strong today as it was before   Mr Chairman, economic conditions in most states of the Twelfth District are improving, but deterioration continues in California In District states outside of California, employment grew at an annual rate of 3-1/2 percent in October, and employment in these states is now roughly 09 of a percent higher than it was a year ago Employment growth is consistent with anecdotal reports of strong retail sales and renewed consumer confidence in much of the West However, contacts in the state of Washington report widespread concern about the area's future due largely to Boeing's announcements of cancellations and delays of aircraft orders and resulting layoffs Despite these concerns, many contacts report that current business conditions in the state of Washington are actually quite good, and employment in Washington actually picked up smartly in both September and October In contrast, there is no sign of improvement in California, a point that I'm sure you've read about in several articles so far this week Employment continued to decline in November, bringing the decline to 155,000 jobs or 1-1/4 percent, compared with a small rise in the national economy Defense cutbacks and commercial real estate problems will continue to be a drag on southern California's economy for some time, and budget problems will  -11-    12/22/92  lead to cutbacks in levels of state and local government spending throughout the state  Turning to the national economy, recent economic data actually have been encouraging It's possible that a moderate expansion may finally have taken hold Although we are not quite as optimistic as the Greenbook concerning economic growth next year, we have raised our forecast moderately to about 2-1/2 percent in 1993, assuming no change in policy Most of the pickup is likely to come from interest-sensitive sectors consumer durables, housing, and business equipment Consistent with this moderate growth, the unemployment rate is likely to decline only moderately over the next couple of years and we would expect the CPI inflation to come in somewhat lower than that forecast by the Greenbook Thank you   Yes, I just want to comment on something Tom Melzer mentioned about regional disparities I mentioned in my report on California the decline of about 155,000 [jobs] in the last six months If we back out California from the statistics, we get almost a completely different picture of what is happening We see an employment picture in terms of nonfarm employment where the rest of the country is up 300,000 in the last six months That's not robust but it is increasing If we back out California from the civilian employment numbers, we get an unemployment rate of 68 percent, and we would have started from the same point   We are not secedingyet! What I'm suggesting is that a majority of people in the country are experiencing something very significantly different from what a group of people in one state, or maybe even half a state, are   There's a significant difference 80 percent of the loss of employment is in southern California They have about 60 percent of the jobs Parts of northern California--for example, the Silicon Valley--show some strength Intel has added 1600 jobs in the last year We now talk about the United States as being the leader in    12/22/92  d-ram chips at this point Biotech is doing quite well So, there are signs of relatively robust activity in the north, although I don't think they approach what we are seeing in the Dallas District or the Atlanta District It's very concentrated Although it's dangerous to take an area out and set it aside, as I said, the national figures in some respects don't give a good indication of what is happening to the overwhelming majority of people   Jerry, in the discussion about nominal income targeting it's clear to me that there are some problems associated with it But what is perhaps more relevant is whether the problems associated with nominal income targeting are greater or lesser than those associated with interest rate targeting I'm afraid a lot of the academic literature would suggest that we probably would reduce the chance of making the kinds of mistakes that we make with interest rate targeting if we followed a nominal income target   It depends on how flexible our policy rule is, I suspect It doesn't have to be [inflexible] We can take into account special effects There are supply-side shocks that we may want to accommodate and some that we don't   Mr Chairman, recent developments suggest that a moderate expansion is underway, and we are seeing numbers in the inflation area that certainly are encouraging That would lead me to recommend alternative B Also, since the economy is picking up, I believe we probably should give somewhat less weight to the risk of stagnant real economic activity and more weight to the possibility that it may accelerate more sharply, and that would lead me to a symmetric directive at this point So, I would favor "B" symmetric   I think the change is a good one I wonder about the executive summary The draft that I read seemed good to me I have no problems with it But I can envision times when there would be an awful lot of disagreement about what should have priority, etc Did you discuss whether or not this would be a very difficult process?   I have a question about some of the reasons why long-term rates in particular responded so strongly in this period There are a number of candidates for why that might have occurred The one that you referred to was that it appears as though the markets buy the idea that there will be future deficit reduction, and I think studies of forward rates would suggest that There are other possibilities as well Most of the people who have looked at the Clinton program contend that it's going to produce weakness over the next several years, and that could be a factor Thirdly, the interest rate developments--maybe not the declines that have occurred already in foreign markets but expectations of further declines there--could be a factor as well Is there any discussion in the markets on the importance of these or is it just focusing on the one you mentioned, which is the increased chance of future reductions in the deficit?   Or short-term weakness in the economy   If the prospect of short-term weakness were a substantial explanation?   I think 1-year forward rates are a quirk because if you looked at 1-year forward rates 3 years out last year, they were coming down At the same time the [1-year forward] rates at 10- and 30-year [horizons] were basically flat So that would be in accord with the idea that it is reflecting more short-term weakness What has happened in the last several months is that we've seen a reduction in those 1-year forward rates at all the maturities, which would be more consistent with a change in views about inflation   I assume that the forecast of the rate of inflation is basically from a Phillips curve framework One question I have is this To the extent that there's a real output surprise-- that is, a growth in real output that exceeds expectations--is there any attempt to incorporate the possibility that this could change expectations about inflation independently of traditional [unintelligible]?   As they did in the last six months   Mr Chairman, widely varied economic conditions continue in the Twelfth District Job growth in the District states over the year ending in January ranged from among the strongest in the nation--about 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent in states such as Idaho, Utah, and Nevada--to among the weakest, which was a negative 14 percent in California, second only to Connecticut The recent benchmarking of employment data increased our measure of 1992 job growth in Arizona, Idaho, and Washington However, California data were revised only for 1992, with revisions for prior years expected in June This creates considerable uncertainty about California economic statistics in recent years We understand that the data for prior years are likely to be revised down significantly to correct for an overcount that occurred prior to January 1991 The revision likely will reduce our estimate of job losses in California during the recent business cycle The official figure now, with this break in the series, is about an 800,000 loss since the peak of employment That will probably be cut to somewhere closer to 500,000  The cutbacks in defense spending and aerospace continue to receive an awful lot of attention in the District In California proposed military base closings threaten a net loss of 32,000 military jobs Civilian job losses on those bases probably will be greater than 32,000; in addition there is some multiplier associated with it Most of these losses as it turns out will be in the San Francisco Bay area and not in southern California I also heard that the morning papers suggest that [McClellan] Air Force Base, which is a big one, and the Monterey Presidio, which is not so big, both were taken off the list by Defense Secretary Aspin about a week ago They are now thought to be somewhat more iffy but they could be closed as well In Washington, Boeing has confirmed that it intends to eliminate 15,000 jobs in the state during 1993 and an additional 4,000 jobs in 1994 This would bring the total reduction of employment to about 25 percent from its 1989 peak, so that is a significant development for that area of the District Although the company remains bullish regarding long- term demands for aircraft, recent airline weakness and cancellations of orders further threaten the company's short-run outlook I'm sure you all saw that there was a big cancellation or at least a postponement by United at the same time they decided to continue to take delivery of the Airbus  Turning to the national economy, it seems to us that recent data continue to suggest that the economy is in a sustained, though moderate, expansion Assuming no change in monetary policy, our forecast of growth over the next two years is almost the same as the Greenbook, with the main impetus to growth coming from the interest- rate-sensitive sectors of the economy We do project somewhat stronger growth in investment and a little less consumption than the Greenbook Obviously, the effects of the Clinton economic program are uncertain; however, the program effect to us at least appears to be a slight positive for real GDP growth in '93 and a small negative in '94 In any case, the effects of the program are likely to be less than that of traditional forecast errors Despite the recent spurt in consumer prices, the outlook for inflation in our view is reasonably  -16-    3/23/93  favorable with real GDP remaining below potential And with relatively moderate growth rates, we expect the downward trend in inflation to continue even with the passage of the BTU tax Specifically, in our forecast inflation in the CPI is expected to drop from 3 percent in 1992 to about 2-1/2 percent by the end of 1994, which isn't all that different from the Greenbook Thank you   I could support that recommendation both for staying with alternative B and for symmetry for the reasons that you suggested, including the fact that we really don't know at this time whether the signs of inflation that we have are of a temporary nature or are more likely to be sustained I do have a comment and then a question The comment is that even with symmetry, we certainly have the capability of taking action in the period between now and the next meeting The asymmetry would be mainly a communicating device which, of course, is communicated the Friday after the next meeting So, if we have some concerns about what we should be doing [in the period ahead], I'm not so sure that acceptance of symmetry limits our field of action Therefore, I can very easily--   Yes, but it seems to me that the symmetry does give flexibility I have one question, though For a long time we've talked about the advantages of being ahead of the curve and I think we complimented ourselves on doing that and talked about how that has served us very, very well As I listen to this I get the impression that we may be rethinking that view and going in the other direction I just wondered what you thought about that   But not too far ahead of the curve   You indicated that the market reaction to the shortening of the maturity of the debt was muted Was there much discussion as to the motives for shortening? Has it been received well by the market? I know there wasn't much of a move in rates   Short term   Mike, when I look at the forecast of quarterly growth rates for gross domestic product and inflation and compare it to the previous forecast, I see a couple tenths weaker growth rate throughout the entire period and a couple tenths higher inflation It almost seems that a supply shock of some sort would produce this because typically a model is constructed so that if the economy runs into a slow period [the model] will pull it back--in effect make up for that [slowing] within a relatively short period But when there is a supply shock, that's not necessarily the case What, in effect, did you have in mind that caused it?   I can see that [you have made an adjustment], but do you have any particular feeling as to why that tradeoff may have changed?   Right   We would really have to have a convoluted impact on inflationary expectations to get the kind of effects that you have with the weather   Mr Chairman, economic conditions continue to vary in the Twelfth District In California some evidence has accumulated that the economy actually may have hit bottom in recent months We have seen, for example, that payroll employment is a little higher than it was in December; and taxable sales also appear to have bottomed out with increases experienced in the fourth quarter of 1992 and the first quarter of 1993 Nevertheless, we are faced with significant further defense cuts, state and local fiscal problems, and lingering weakness in commercial real estate that make it unlikely that the California economy is going to grow at any time in the next year The Seattle area, which until recently was expanding briskly, has stagnated in recent months I must admit that recent new orders for Boeing aircraft are encouraging The economies of most other areas of the District continue to flourish Utah, Nevada, Alaska, and Oregon are ranked in the top ten states in terms of employment growth between December 1992 and March 1993 And even the eastern Washington economy continues to be strong Throughout the West, and this is similar to what Tom Hoenig picked up, many business leaders have noted to us that uncertainty about federal fiscal policy, particularly tax policy, is delaying investments and other major business decisions  On the issue of inflation, in general report little price pressure, but there was one anecdote that I thought was rather interesting  and he reported that they periodically conduct a price survey of packaged and canned goods Now, this doesn't get into the problem with fresh fruits and vegetables At the wholesale level, the latest survey revealed more widespread increases in the prices they pay for these goods than they had ever experienced before The interesting thing is that he went on to say that he doubts that they will be able to pass those price increases along It remains to be seen whether they will or not  Turning to the national scene, it appears at least to me that the changes in the Greenbook forecast since the last FOMC meeting are large and, I'd have to say, quite disturbing Real GDP seems to be on a decidedly lower path and inflation on a discouragingly faster track Our own forecast is also more pessimistic in the short run, but by 1994 we have stronger growth than we had before and an unchanged rate of inflation The change to our forecast reflects the defeat of the Clinton stimulus package, general concern about the extent of higher taxes, and slower-than-expected growth in the first quarter as well as the unexpected buildup of inventories The change to the Greenbook forecast would appear to result from more permanent influences in  -18-    5/18/93  addition to the factors that I noted It would seem, if the Greenbook forecast proves to be correct--and that certainly is a possibility-- that the policy tradeoffs are likely to be far less attractive than I'd earlier thought   In alternative C you state that you think the impact of higher rates would cause the prime rate to go up by 1/2 percentage point How strong are your convictions in light of this historically large spread between the cost of funds and the prime and also the very weak demand for bank credit?   I guess I'm persuaded by the arguments for asymmetry It seems to me that if what we want to do is to deal with inflationary expectations, then the most effective way to do it--in terms of when we change the rate--is to do it by vote to show the full Committee's participation in that decision I'd say it would be even better at a meeting, either this one or the next one, but certainly by telephone if not that   Thank you Mike, there was an appendix in Part II of the Greenbook on the Budget Reconciliation Act that I think was very informative and interesting It would seem as though the one- for-one in terms of tax increases and spending cuts looks fairly legitimate there I also got the impression that perhaps it was not quite as backloaded in terms of expenditure cuts as originally had been the case Are there any defining issues in terms of spending cuts that are making it less than the pure number? Are they of any significance, because I know that was a major criticism earlier in the process? And I wonder if you could just comment on how this has all changed because I know the last Greenbook had a ratio of 8 to 1 for 1994 in terms of tax increases versus expenditure cuts And, of course, Boskin had that article in the Wall Street Journal that had a 9 to 1 ratio for the entire period It seems as though there have been some very dramatic changes   In some past times there have been fee increases that were counted as expenditure cuts; is there much of that?   Thank you, Mr Chairman Economic activity in much of the Twelfth District clearly remains weaker than that for the nation as a whole District employment fell at a 2 percent annual rate in June, marking the fourth consecutive monthly decline The fall in employment was due largely to job losses in California and Washington California has now completed three years of recession; between July 1990 and July 1993 the state lost 560,000 jobs, with 180,000 of those jobs lost during the last year However, the July employment report was somewhat more encouraging We did see an increase in California of 34,000 as far as payroll employment is concerned But half of this increase was due to a rise in state and local government employment that is linked to unusual seasonal factors Civilian employment also increased during July However, there was a very large surge in the labor force and it caused the unemployment rate to rise from 91 to 98 percent Despite the July report, already announced layoffs and reports from contacts suggest continued weakness in several sectors of the California economy We believe that the state will bump along the bottom and remain a drag on District growth for the foreseeable future  Conditions in the state of Washington are also of concern, particularly in the Puget Sound area Recent employment reports for the state have been disappointing; for June employment in the state actually fell at an annualized rate of 57 percent Significant losses were seen in manufacturing, construction, and trade In aerospace, employment has fallen 74 percent over the past year, largely as a result of cutbacks by Boeing In addition, recent reports suggest that Boeing may cut its production more than called for by currently published plans  Conditions in the rest of the District are mixed, with robust conditions in the inter-mountain states and flat or sluggish conditions elsewhere A depressed visitor industry has stalled the Hawaiian economy In contrast, the Nevada boom continues Three major hotel projects will add 10,000 rooms in Las Vegas this coming winter to the existing stock of 76,000 rooms Construction jobs in Nevada are up 20 percent over the past year  Turning to the national economy, although one could certainly quibble with specific numbers in the Greenbook forecast, I think the basic message of moderate growth is certainly the most likely outcome over the next year and a half I'd have to admit, though, that I'm a bit more optimistic about inflation than is the Greenbook We have had three consecutive months of very low inflation, which is consistent with the view that a good part of the inflation scare that we had earlier this year was an aberration And given the current slack in labor markets and also the prospects for continued moderate economic growth, it seems to me that inflation could come in a bit lower than is shown in the Greenbook Thank you, Mr Chairman    8/17/93   That shouldn't be hard!   Coming back to Bob's question--   Okay   Mr Chairman, I think the risks to the forecast in the intermeeting period are clearly balanced so, therefore, I would prefer a move toward symmetry I do think it is important that that not be misinterpreted, and I would assume that we certainly can make that point clear in the minutes   There is a rather slow decline in the unemployment rate in the Greenbook forecast and there's no decline from where we are now   And you had included an upward revision of the growth in trend productivity and higher potential output as well If one looks at the growth rates, the real growth rates appear to be roughly equal to or in some cases below the growth rate of potential Why is there such small progress made in the inflation area? I think you mentioned health care, gasoline taxes, etc, but it seems to me as though it's surprisingly small progress  -8-    9/23/93   Thank you   Mr Chairman, economic activity in the Twelfth District is still weak, and it's not a surprise to indicate that that is due largely to poor conditions in California We saw employment down in August; since the peak of employment in July of 1990 there have been 588,000 jobs lost in the state It's also interesting to note that if one were to back the state out of the national figures we'd probably have an unemployment rate of about 63 or 64 percent as opposed to the 67 percent Residential construction activity shows no signs of picking up in the state and this, of course, is despite the low interest rates and also reduced home prices The number of housing permits is down 13 percent from a year ago and stands at about a third of the level that was reached in 1989 On the commercial side, the only thing I could say that would be of a positive nature is that property values have fallen so low that we seem to see some serious buyers in the markets Actually, there are some transactions taking place If you looked at the situation a year ago there was virtually no activity Reflecting California's economic troubles, net migration to other states rose to 150,000 in fiscal 1993 In contrast, the number of legal foreign immigrants to California rose 23 percent in 1992 to a record 237,500 Now, the official estimate is that illegal immigrants are 100,000; I think that's really low So, in spite of the moves to other states, the state's population is growing very rapidly  Conditions are much better in other parts of the [District] In fact, we have two states that are among the top five in the nation in terms of growth rates, Utah and Nevada Homebuilding activity is very strong The number of housing permits during the three-month period that ended in July was up 22 percent in Idaho and 35 percent in Utah Home prices are rising dramatically From 1990 they're up 27 percent in Boise, up 18 percent in Salt Lake City, up 16 percent in Las Vegas, and up 13 percent in Reno Manufacturing growth is also strong and outpacing the national average in many of these states We've seen 43 percent growth in manufacturing in Idaho, 34 percent in Nevada, and 17 percent in Utah  If I can turn for a moment to the national economy While I agree with the Greenbook pattern of modestly accelerating growth and decelerating inflation, I'd have to say I'm a bit more optimistic about the magnitudes in 1994 We're expecting that real growth will be up a bit more--not quite half a percent--with somewhat less inflation On the price side, while some factors--certainly one-time factors--are going to have the effect of tending to raise the CPI a bit in 1994, our estimates are that we're going to see some greater improvement in the CPI than is indicated in the Greenbook   Agree   In terms of the past meetings, it seemed to me that what you were [expressing] as something of a preference is alternative three Is that correct?   Okay And would you explain why you prefer that over alternative one?   May I ask a second question? I assume in terms of the future meetings that whatever alternative we come up with would apply equally to the conference calls?   But it seems to me that there wouldn't be much problem leaning over to the side of greater exposure of [the contents of] these conference calls I don't see any [resulting] damage; even if we were getting updates on issues, it probably would be something that would be in the spirit of greater openness And I can't see any damage that would result from that   Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman Somewhat along the lines of Jerry Jordan's comments, I believe that we have a rather significant obligation to current and past members of the Committee And that leads me in terms of the past meetings to Memoranda of Discussion and a five-year lag However, I certainly wouldn't be against lightly edited transcripts; I just have a preference for the Memoranda knowing full well that they would be quite expensive to  -31-    11/16/93  provide But I think we do have a special obligation to people who didn't realize that this would ever see the light of day even in a lightly edited fashion In terms of how that would be constructed, I think it's only practical that the Secretariat staff have an overwhelming share of the responsibility but I would hope that in some instances where there might be a need they could consult with participants who are currently in the Federal Reserve System if there is a real question as to what was meant by a particular comment  With regard to future meetings, I must admit that I found the enhanced minutes to be quite interesting One of the things it clearly does is give accountability, and I thought accountability was the major issue The other thing I like about it is that it seems to me a pretty low-cost way to deal with this accountability issue This is [an option] I hadn't thought about much until I got Don's memo; I had a short discussion with him [after] that and I find it attractive If that were rejected, my second alternative is the Memorandum of Discussion and my preference would be for a five-year lag if that were the case   Could I ask a question?   In terms of your preference for the enhanced minutes you stressed non-attribution   What about the wrinkle that Don put on it that at the end, I presume, there would be some accountability in terms of the decision that is made so that--   Well, I guess you had some discussions with people and Congressmen--   Oh, from the Board's current minutes I see   I guess my first is the Memorandum of Discussion and my second is lightly edited   Ten and five   Enhanced minutes first and MOD second   How did enhanced come out?   Two current and two enhanced?   On the vote   Shouldn't our agreement to release these lightly edited transcripts with a five-year delay buy us some votes in the Committee anyway?   I would think that that would be significant and that the chances of Chairman Gonzalez getting his way with his own Committee would not seem that high   Mike, one characteristic of some of the recent Greenbook forecasts has been a relatively lean inventory picture, particularly business inventories; and I think there were even discussions about just-in-time inventories, etc It seems as though things have changed dramatically in this current forecast in that there is anywhere from $10 to $20 billion a quarter more in nonfarm inventories I wondered what has changed your thoughts?   But the '94 number is probably about twice what it was before?  -68-    11/16/93   Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman States in the Twelfth District are moving along two distinct and divergent paths The California economy continues to weaken according to most statistics that we see Employment has fallen 51 percent or by 642,000 in the state since July of 1990 In the last 12 months it has fallen 13 percent In fact, if we look at California's employment losses and what they do to the national totals, actually instead of the 16 percent increase, employment in the nation outside of California has really risen 2 percent, which is a fairly significant difference California's unemployment rate is 98 percent in October The volume of loans at large banks in California continues to decline although at a somewhat diminishing rate And loan growth in the rest of the Twelfth District is positive [Hawaii is reporting] weakness as a result of the problems in California and Japan The rest of the District's states are reporting relatively strong economic conditions Utah remains the fastest growing state in the nation and Nevada is reporting robust growth Three major projects will have added 10,000 new hotel rooms by year-end in Las Vegas, and contacts report that the major hotels are 100 percent booked for weekends through April of 1994 Arizona and Oregon are reporting solid year-over-year employment gains in September of 16 and 19 percent, respectively And anecdotal reports suggest even more strength since September Contacts report a shortage of construction workers in Phoenix while Tucson is experiencing a building boom with rapidly appreciating home prices I should note that there are some companies moving into the Tucson area like Hughes Aircraft Similarly, a contact in Portland reports that three major new office buildings are being planned and it seems very likely that at least two of those will be constructed Finally, while western Washington's economy has slowed because of all the cutbacks at Boeing, which you've heard an awful lot about, the eastern part of the state is reporting a boom  If I can turn just for a moment to the national economy, we basically agree with the Greenbook's outlook for moderate growth in real GDP over the next two years as tighter fiscal policy is counterbalanced by relatively low real interest rates However, I am a bit surprised that the Greenbook shows such a small decline in inflation next year and the year after Given the expectation that output will grow only modestly over the next two years and that the unemployment rate is likely to remain at roughly the present level, based upon past relationships it wouldn't be surprising in my view to see labor market slack of this size reduce the CPI inflation to a lower number than that included in the Greenbook   "B" symmetric   The question I have is that it seems to me that in terms of the price distortion effects of inflation, there are pretty strong results The effect of that on productivity, etc, doesn't show up too strongly Is that correct?   But aren't there strong theoretical and analytical reasons to think that there would be a negative effect? The fact that the quantitative results are not always very strong to me focuses too much on the data, which can be affected by so many things I would say that if you can establish something theoretically or analytically--and I think that's been done--it's very, very [probable] So I would say that in some respects your results are much stronger than you've portrayed   And analytically from that conclusion [inflation leads to] a lot of problems in terms of productivity and probably also growth    12/21/93   But I think their work indicated that at moderate rates of inflation the price distortions are statistically significant   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation I do have two questions If we were to deny access, how likely in your mind is it that Chairman Gonzalez would try to get his Committee to  -48-    12/21/93  issue a subpoena? And secondly, how likely is it that he'd be successful since this isn't a monetary policy issue and is probably viewed by a lot of people in the House as something where we sort of got together to develop tactics for testifying?   Is the fact that we're going to take up this other issue at the next meeting going to affect the starting or ending time? How long will it continue?   Mike, in the 1992 GDP revisions some of the discrepancy that we thought we saw initially between hours worked and output was removed and, of course, GDP was increased very substantially In the first half of 1993 there were some of the same phenomena in the numbers but [that could change in] the revision as well If one had sort of a pro forma revision, making it similar to what occurred in 1992, what are the implications for the amount of slack that we would have at this point? Or how would you [view that]? Toward the end of your presentation you mentioned a few concerns and cautionary measures [unintelligible]--   Thank you, Mr Chairman My report from the Twelfth District economy is more optimistic, although the changes for California are small and mixed In October employment in the District states outside of California showed considerable strength, with employment increasing 40,000 Annualized economic employment growth rates for the month ranged from 2-1/2 to 4 percent for most of the states; and Idaho and Nevada, which have been incredibly strong, actually recorded double-digit rates of expansion One thing that was a bit of a surprise in the last month or two is what's happening in the state of Washington Washington's employment growth outpaced that in most other District states, expanding at 8 percent in October following the 6 percent growth in September And while eastern Washington continues to reflect what I think can be correctly characterized as boom conditions associated with those in the inter- mountain states, contacts also report that business activity in western Washington is stronger However, cutbacks in aerospace, of course, remain a drag on that region's performance California's economy remains weak although current conditions are more mixed than they have been in recent months November payroll employment was little changed from the recession low reached in October Moreover, job losses have continued in such areas as construction and manufacturing On a more positive note, reports from contacts in California are no longer uniformly negative Retail sales are improving some, and there certainly are good conditions in some sectors such as motion pictures, entertainment, and also agriculture Within the state, economic conditions are clearly weakest in southern California, especially the Los Angeles area Layoffs continue in aerospace and defense, and construction remains quite depressed Real estate values appear to be continuing to slide in that area Conditions are relatively stronger in the huge agricultural area of the Central Valley and also in northern California, despite falling employment in the Bay area  Turning to the national economy, at this point we think that the most likely outlook for growth is roughly that which is incorporated in the Greenbook It seems to us that following what is    12/21/93  going to be clearly a very strong fourth quarter we will see a reduction in growth rates along the line of what is indicated in the Greenbook I would say that based upon [the Board staff's] forecast and ours it wouldn't be surprising to see labor market slack and a reduced core rate of inflation below that incorporated in the Greenbook However, at the same time I think there is a reasonable chance that growth in inflation will turn out to be stronger than projected, along the line Al was talking about New orders and production have picked up in areas besides autos, and we think GDP for 1993 may be revised up to some extent, providing more momentum for growth next year As a result, it's possible that the gap between potential and actual GDP may be diminishing at a faster rate than is anticipated in both forecasts Thank you   Mr Chairman, I think it is quite likely that after the current quarter we will see more moderate growth next year and, therefore, I could support alternative B It's a little hard for  -33-    12/21/93  me to reach the conclusion that the risks are symmetrical, which leads me into the direction of thinking that there is a case for asymmetry toward restraint But I could easily buy the symmetry if I also would get what Ed Boehne offered   Well, I must admit that I can support the recommendation What concerns me most, however, is its potential use, a concern related to Jerry's I recall the paragraph in the Maroni memo referring to the fact that in 1988 the swap line was used for window-dressing operations to enhance the announcement of the country's reserves scheduled to be made by the Director General of the Bank of Mexico on August 4 and the President of Mexico on September 1 I think of swap lines as being used to deal with disorderly markets I think someone who wants to could make a case that perhaps they were being used for political purposes The kindest light one could put on it is that they were used to prevent the occurrence of disorderly markets, a view with which I'm uncomfortable as well It's not so much the authority that bothers me; it's the potential in my view for misuse of the Mexican swap   Hasn't there been a tradition to use swaps to deal with disorderly markets or do we also use them to prevent disorderly markets?   But these Mexican swap lines were used in 1976, 1982, and 1988 as well The political aspect seems apparent   I certainly would not favor disengagement and I don't have problems with the numbers that are being proposed Is it feasible to have an agreement among the Treasury, Mexico, and us--and for that matter others with whom we have swap arrangements--that the swaps would be used to deal with disorderly markets? I would feel much more comfortable    3/22/94   That's helpful to me   Yes, point of clarification You are quite correct that it's sometimes difficult to define what is a disorderly market, and everybody would agree that we should give the authorities the judgment on that issue But the issue is whether the authorities should attempt to prevent what might turn out to be a disorderly market versus dealing with a disorderly market   I hope so   The same thing could happen with the term "reserve restraint" In saying a slight change, the "slight" may equivocate--   I would favor the announcement   This is out of order!   I'd like to ask a question about unemployment that I don't think is related to that excellent memo that deals with some of the problems with the new series It may be a bit related to your answer to Jerry Looking at the unemployment rate and the amount of slack implied in labor markets, it looks as though you have either a new Okun's Law relationship relative to your previous forecasts or some kind of an intercept change that resulted from observing where the first quarter's unemployment rate is Real growth, if you compare the two forecasts, is less than it was in the prior forecast and the unemployment rate is also a fair amount less Is that just an intercept change or some conclusion that Okun's Law is operating in a different way?   And when you do that, does that raise any questions or issues about one's view of NAIRU?  -17-    3/22/94   Well, to the extent that the NAIRU doesn't change, it clearly has significant implications   Thank you   Mr Chairman, information we received about the Twelfth District's economy since the last meeting suggests that the economy has strengthened, although I would point out that California's economy continues to lag The District outside of California is experiencing very strong growth District employment growth outside of California was 41 percent between January 1993 and January 1994 Nevada, Utah, Idaho, and Arizona all ranked in the top five states in employment growth during the last year, and strength in these states is widespread and is absent only from the mining industry Construction is very strong outside of California, with double-digit construction employment growth in most states Moreover, strong permits and nonresidential awards suggest that activity will continue in the months ahead  California continues to show mixed signals Payroll employment declined again in February Employment is off about 12 percent in the past year and since July of 1990 it is down 644,000 But it appears that real estate conditions are improving somewhat Residential sales in California were up 20 percent in January from the level of a year ago, which could have something to do with weather Contacts also report more multiple offers for housing in many parts of the state And the commercial real estate picture is improving, with stabilizing rents and slight declines in vacancy rates reported There are a few prominent forecasters that people follow for California One is UCLA and the other one is Salomon Brothers Both of them recently have revised upward their forecasts for the state, predicting that economic recovery will begin in the second half of the year primarily as a result of the improved picture with regard to real estate and also the infusion of earthquake relief funds  Turning to the national economy, I agree with the Greenbook forecast as far as GDP is concerned, with it averaging approximately 2-1/2 percent over this year and next It's worth emphasizing, of course, that this forecast assumes a rise in short-term rates from current levels The strong growth that we saw in the last half of the year has all but eliminated the gap between actual and potential GDP, as mentioned by Mike Prell, and has brought unemployment close to most estimates of the natural rate The further growth projected for this year would seem very likely to eliminate any gap that might remain  It seems, as Ed Boehne and others said, that there are few downside risks to this forecast and conceivably there could be some upside risks The Greenbook and the financial markets presume a significant increase in short-term interest rates this year but, even if these come about, I wouldn't expect to see any further progress in  -25-    3/22/94  bringing inflation down Therefore, my expectation for CPI inflation over the forecast period is very similar to the Greenbook average of approximately 3 percent   Mr Chairman, I think that robust growth in real GDP in recent quarters has sharply diminished the slack in both labor and product markets And if growth does not slow as much as anticipated, we could be facing significant upward pressures on inflation Despite the action taken at the last meeting, the real federal funds rate still appears to be, in my view, unsustainably low I think those who favor moving toward a neutral policy stance should therefore support a significant increase in the federal funds rate Even if a neutral stance were to require a real funds rate of only 1 percent, we would still need a large increase in the nominal rate to reach that level Those who favor such things as nominal income targeting rules should also support a significant increase in the federal funds rate We have looked at various nominal income rules, and they suggest that we fell behind the curve at the last meeting and that we now need a large increase to catch up And finally, financial markets appear in my view to be expecting significant increases in interest rates over the next six months Thus, I feel that a 50 basis point increase is needed An increase of 25 basis points would probably not be sufficient to prevent an increase in inflation and certainly would not be sufficient to make further progress in reducing inflation Therefore, my first preference would be Bluebook alternative C However, since I believe that whether we do things today or a couple of weeks later doesn't make all that much difference in terms of impact on the economy, I certainly could accept 25 basis points today if we had asymmetric language to the up side and at least the possibility that a move could come prior to the next meeting   Mike, I have a question about the inflation numbers Last year at this time we had an unpleasant inflation surprise This year it seems, if you look at the year-over-year comparisons at least, that the consumer inflation numbers are coming in somewhat below the forecast Part of that is probably due to recent changes in the seasonal factors for the CPI, but that probably is not a complete explanation; I don't think it is Is there some perspective as far as that development is concerned that ought to be brought into this discussion? I know you cited the 6-month inflation rates and they don't look quite as favorable   Did you say that the very latest data are in accord with expectations?   Well, the thing I'm thinking about is that the 24 percent change in the total CPI over the past 12 months and the 27 or 28 percent change in the core rate over the same period are a little better than expectations   Okay   Thank you, Mr Chairman Part of the Twelfth District continues to show very strong growth Outside of California, the growth of employment between March 1993 and March 1994 was 33 percent And over that period three states--Nevada, Idaho, and Utah-- ranked first, second, and third in the nation in terms of job growth, and Arizona ranked seventh In the Pacific Northwest, we see economic growth that is best characterized as being pretty solid, but at a less spectacular pace than in the other states that I mentioned I might note that I had an opportunity to meet with the head of a major construction company based in Oregon; he's been in the business for 30 years and he said this is the strongest period that he has ever seen His biggest client is Intel, and they have a huge project going on in Albuquerque, another one likely to start soon in Arizona, and another one in Oregon itself One of the interesting things is that these projects are not all for the Pentium chip As a matter of fact, they're building plants for the next generation--which are still in the design phase But in any case, these are major projects  Hawaii's economy remains weak and the job losses continue in that state On a mildly positive note, though, the visitor count seems to be up from what it was a year ago California appears to have hit the bottom of its long down cycle, but the current pace of activity seems to be improving very slowly If you look at the California employment data--and they seem to be revised very frequently--they show a trough in December but job growth between December and April is up only 1/2 percent at an annual rate Other broad-based measures such as state tax revenues, retail sales, and personal income show basically no trend I'd say the only area in California where there are convincing signs of significant improvement is real estate and other construction Existing home sales, housing permits, and nonresidential construction awards all improved very significantly during the last two quarters compared with the same levels in early 1993  -15-    5/17/94  Turning to the national economy, our policy assumptions are very similar to those in the Greenbook, and we come to similar conclusions about what is likely to happen in the economy However, we do seem to have a somewhat different view on the responsiveness of the economy to interest rates In our model, that responsiveness appears to be a little larger Consequently we have a little weaker economy in the second half of this year, and next year we have a little stronger growth because we have long-term rates coming down a bit more than in the Greenbook With regard to inflation, with the small amount of unused capacity in the economy, we do not see the prospect for improvement in inflation from this point on, and we certainly don't rule out the possibility that the inflation numbers could begin to look even worse in 1995 Thank you   I, too, would support a 50 basis point move and I prefer a symmetric directive I must admit I'm not convinced at this point that our gradual approach was the wrong one, and it still may serve us well in the future But I do think 50 basis points is appropriate at this time The other point I'd like to make is that I hope any public statement we make doesn't convey either the impression that we are likely to do anything in the near term or that we are likely to rest on our oars for a while I think that--   Good   Mike, in the Greenbook forecast inventory investment comes down to more traditional levels And I think as a result the inventory/sales ratios, if I remember them from Part II of the Greenbook, also come down Would you comment on the risks to the assumptions about inventory investment because it seems to me possible at least that we could see more inventory building in the forecast period than is incorporated in what may be a conservative forecast   Mr Chairman, trends in the Twelfth District economy are little changed since our last meeting Employment has grown 1 percent during the past year with strong gains in many parts of the region offset by flat conditions in California Idaho, Nevada, and Utah remain the three fastest growing states in the nation in terms of employment Moreover, Arizona and the Pacific Northwest states are reporting year-over-year employment gains ranging from 2 to 4 percent  -10-    8/16/94  Unfortunately, California's economy still shows few signs of growth Employment in the state has risen only 1 percent on an annualized basis since December, and July's level was off 5 percent from a year earlier Moreover, the change from a declining economy in 1993 to a flat economy in 1994 has followed a pattern that does not suggest an imminent rebound The flattening is due more to a cessation of large employment losses in areas such as construction, wholesale trade, and local government rather than to rising strength in other industries In fact, there is only one sector, business services, that has shown consistent growth Meanwhile, defense- related industries, banking, and communications continue to experience substantial job losses  As I'm sure you know, we are at the current time suffering from many fires throughout the District It's a little early to estimate what the impacts are likely to be I don't think there will be major impacts in dollar terms, but we are just entering the fire season, so it is something to keep a watch on  Turning to the national economy, our outlook differs somewhat from the Greenbook for the latter half of this year We actually have a little more of a slowdown than was incorporated in the Greenbook for the second half because of the effects of the tightening moves so far, and also as a result of a decline in the amount of inventory investment However at present levels of short-term interest rates, we clearly would see a strong bounceback in real GDP growth next year  Even with slower growth in the near term, I have significant concerns about the longer-term inflation outlook Although estimates of slack are subject, as we all know, to considerable uncertainty, it seems likely that most if not all of the unused capacity in labor and product markets has been used up That point certainly was emphasized in the Greenbook Given the present stance of policy, we are running a substantial risk that the future trend of inflation will be in an upward direction Inflation accelerates in 1995 in the Blue Chip consensus and in both the structural and vector auto-regressive models used by our staff In our structural model, a significant rise in the funds rate in 1996 is required through the nominal income policy rule that is built into our structural model Thank you   I also enthusiastically support the complete package As I indicated in my earlier go-around comments, I think the chances of inflation accelerating significantly next year and beyond are great if we do not move   With regard to your answer to Al Broaddus, are there more comprehensive changes in processes that would be desirable than are proposed here? If so, what stands in the way of implementing them?   In the intermeeting period there has been a lot of discussion of the exact wording of the announcement that we made in August Do you think that that has had any impact either on Desk operations or in markets in general?   I'd like to ask a question about imports In the forecast for the third and fourth quarters the growth rates of imports are the lowest we've seen since, I think, about 1991 Clearly, the direction of effects from exchange rates is supportive of this, but it seems as though it's a rather unrealistic slowing given the strength of final demand in this country   So they showed up in inventories?   I see   Mr Chairman, a number of signals suggest that economic conditions in the Twelfth District are improving The current data indicate that the number of payroll jobs in the District rose 12 percent over the 12 months through August, the strongest annual growth that we have seen since 1990 Moreover, payroll employment data for a number of states are expected to be revised up substantially when the 1994 state benchmarks are released next March We already know that there will be large upward revisions in California, Arizona, and Washington, and several other western states may see substantial revisions as well I should note that systematic revisions in the state data do not necessarily mean that national payroll series also will be revised up, since the national figures already include bias adjustments that generally are not used in compiling the individual state data Utah, Nevada, and Idaho had the nation's fastest growth in payroll employment during the past 12  -14-    9/27/94  months In Oregon, Washington, and Arizona, the pace of growth is less robust but appears to be picking up  In California, it now looks as though the economy bottomed out and remained essentially flat roughly from early through mid-1993 At the last couple of FOMC meetings, we pointed to the bottom as being at the end of 1993, but these revisions in payroll data have changed that picture somewhat However, the subsequent recovery that we have seen has been slow, sporadic, and uneven across sectors While retail sales jumped 24 percent in the first quarter of this year, they fell back 6 percent in the second quarter The unemployment rate remained stuck around 9 percent, just a little less than the present rate Aerospace manufacturing continues to shed jobs at a double-digit annual rate  Turning to the national economy, real GDP growth appears to have slowed somewhat from the robust pace in the first half of this year However, growth is likely to average slightly above its potential rate in this half of the year Moreover, at present levels of short-term interest rates, I would expect to see a modest increase in the pace of the expansion in 1995, putting growth a bit above the potential rate in that year also Labor and product markets currently appear to be tight This impression was reinforced by the sizable increase in capacity utilization rates in the most recent release While estimates of what constitutes full utilization in product or labor markets are inherently uncertain, it seems safe to say that without a further increase in short-term rates such as that contained in the Greenbook, there is a significant risk that inflation will be on an upward trend in the next few years Thank you   Mr Chairman, it seems obvious that since our last meeting, pressures on capacity in product and labor markets have grown as have prospects for higher inflation in the future Thus, it seems to me that we should raise the funds rate again fairly soon I don't think we have to do it today, but I certainly would prefer an asymmetric directive tilted toward raising the rate if incoming data imply greater pressures for future inflation Thus, I would accept your recommendation   There may be times when what you want to do for monetary policy purposes is consistent with what the Treasury wants to do to affect the exchange rate I have difficulty relating that to what Governor Lindsey said It sounds like he wanted a tool for all time for you to put in the closet, and I don't understand that This Committee will have a view about what is appropriate monetary policy It may be that today it would be consistent with what the Treasury may want to do, and that's good for today   Right   So the trip factor would be a request for intervention When we have asymmetry, what we are assuming is that we or the Chairman will be looking at a set of data that will lead him perhaps to request a rate increase Are you saying that there is one development we are going to focus on and that is a request from the Treasury to intervene?   Mike, in your verbal presentation and also in the Greenbook you twice referred to more lenient lending terms by banks as a factor in the strength of the economy I want to make sure I understand the point Are you saying that banks are more lenient than one typically would see at this stage of the cycle, or is this just what we typically see? My own discussions with bankers suggest that they are not doing anything unique for this cycle As a matter of fact, I think that in some respects they are a little more cautious Are you seeing something exogenous to what our experience has been in the past at this stage of the cycle? If so, how important is it?   A little later?    11/15/94   Right   I guess I'm a little surprised that in the past we have seen a tightening of terms in the first year of rising interest rates I would have thought that it would have come later   I don't think there is any doubt about that I really wonder if that's unique   Mr Chairman, the economic recovery in California appears to be taking hold while conditions in the rest of the District generally remain strong Abstracting from month-to-month volatility, the California unemployment rate has fallen about 1 percentage point since the first quarter of the year, although it remains about 2 percentage points above the national rate In the rest of the District, state employment growth has outpaced the national rate in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Utah Contacts in District states other than California and Hawaii generally indicate that regional wages are accelerating Labor markets are regarded as especially tight for construction workers, computer programmers, as well as banking and retail sales personnel Consumer prices have been fairly weak in California in large part because of weak housing prices More recently, housing sales in the state have picked up noticeably, and many of our contacts expect a pickup in housing cost inflation  Turning to the national economy, real GDP growth has continued to be surprisingly strong, showing no signs so far of falling below the potential rate of growth As a result, as already has been mentioned, tight labor and product markets have become noticeably tighter since our last meeting Moreover, at present levels of interest rates, I would expect to see further robust economic growth and declines in the unemployment rate in the remainder of this year and in 1995 Under these circumstances, it has become increasingly clear that inflation would be on an upward trajectory in the years ahead without a substantially tighter stance of policy   Mr Chairman, since our last meeting, the economy certainly has shown considerable momentum and labor and product markets now appear to be extremely tight I feel that if we don't act strongly, it seems likely that the economy will substantially overshoot its potential and that inflation will take on a rising trend It seems clear that interest rates need to be raised considerably above current levels, and therefore I support your recommendation of a 75 basis point increase in the federal funds rate Moreover, I would not be surprised if a further tightening in policy is necessary in December Therefore, my preference would be for asymmetric language toward tightening in the directive I would not want the press release to imply that there would be a pause in further action While I am at it, since I am making suggestions, I would find any mention of the dollar as a rationale for the change a mistake   Mike, you talked about the inflation forecast and indicated that you made, in effect, an intercept adjustment in the forecast to carry forward the favorable experience that we seem to have had in 1994 Would you talk further about why we have had that favorable experience and why it might continue? We may be seeing actual growth in excess of potential As we get closer to capacity isn't there a risk that we will have seen a delay in the typical Phillips curve relationship? If it were to reassert itself in 1995, might inflation turn out to be a fair amount higher than you indicated in the forecast?   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District's economy is growing solidly Outside of California, the pace of growth is moderating in some of the intermountain states, although Oregon's economy seems to be accelerating Economic indicators for California show continued improvement, aside from the financial problems in Orange County  The current estimate of the Orange County investment pool's losses is $2 billion, but the ultimate loss probably is going to be slightly higher That $2 billion is equivalent to around 2-1/2 percent of Orange County's $75 billion personal income or around 3 percent of total state income However, the comparison with a single year's personal income overstates the economic impact of the financial losses, since a large proportion of the funds was earmarked for capital expenditures that are spread over several years Since more than 97 percent of the funds in the pool were invested by government entities within Orange County, most of the economic effect will be felt in Orange County itself, which accounts for roughly 10 percent of California's economy The county and other participating governments appear to have been largely successful so far in finding ways to meet immediate cash needs There is still a great deal of uncertainty about how the effects will be distributed among the affected jurisdictions However, it is clear that these local government entities will cut spending substantially Orange County already has postponed some large capital projects and put a freeze on hiring and all nonessential spending A number of other jurisdictions are making similar moves  One of the immediate effects has been to raise the cost of borrowing for Orange County governments and for the State of California As was discussed earlier, credit spreads rose on municipal securities all over the country after Orange County filed for bankruptcy These spreads generally have fallen back to the levels that prevailed before the problems in Orange County became public The exception seems to be the State of California Credit spreads on state issues rose more than on most other tax-free bonds Subsequently, spreads have come down only a little from their post- bankruptcy peaks, and they remain higher than they were before the bankruptcy This might reflect market speculation that the state government, which already is financially weak, eventually will be asked to bear some of the cost In this regard, I should point out that in contrast to California State bonds, the credit spreads for actively traded city and county issues within California look about like those for municipals in the rest of the country  -12-    12/20/94  Exposure of Twelfth District banks to Orange County has been and continues to be minimal Loans and direct holdings of Orange County debt by banks are small, and the same goes for exposures under letters of credit However, a few banks face some indirect exposure through sponsorship of mutual funds with Orange County holdings Sponsors of some affected mutual funds, notably the money market funds, bought the funds' holdings of Orange County debt to prevent their funds from realizing the full losses In other words, they wanted to make sure they didn't "break the buck" on the money funds In general, the market seems to have differentiated among various mutual funds according to the extent of their Orange County exposure We also learned that one of the banks that has a tax-exempt money market fund, instead of buying the Orange County paper at par as was done by a few other banks, issued a letter of credit for the Orange County debt, which of course increased its price and reduced the problem  I'd like to turn to the national economy now and hopefully I will remain on the right side of the fence as well, but I certainly don't want to be on top of the fence [Laughter] The national economy continues to exhibit surprisingly strong growth in employment, output, and spending Indeed, the evidence suggests that the current pace of real economic activity has not been diminished very much by the tighter stance of monetary policy this year, or at least that any policy effects have been more than offset by other factors Simulations of our own structural model, which has a monetary policy response similar to models such as DRI's and Ray Fair's, suggest that the tightening so far this year has reduced the growth rate of GDP by about 1/2 percentage point in 1994 The tightening also is projected to reduce GDP growth by a full percentage point in 1995, and another 1/2 percentage point in 1996 Long bonds have moved up more quickly than they often do in response to a policy tightening; there were charts in Part II of the Greenbook that illustrated this This early increase has probably accelerated the effects of policy, so a greater proportion of the effects of the monetary restraint than suggested above may already have been achieved I might note parenthetically that this has a rather interesting implication for the MPS model where one-half of the effect is in the third year That is very different from any other model The more conventional models are showing a faster effect  Even assuming that monetary policy tightens further, as in the Greenbook, our structural model sees a substantial risk that inflation in 1995 and 1996 will be somewhat above its current pace   Mr Chairman, in my view the economy has picked up more momentum since our last meeting, and the degree of tightness in labor and product markets has risen even further Our analysis agrees with the Greenbook that further tightening is needed in order to prevent an increase in the inflation trend Therefore, I would prefer a 50 basis point increase in the funds rate Frankly, I don't see the problems of Orange County as a reason to hesitate in doing what is best at this point for the national economy Financial futures markets expect a 50 basis point increase in the funds rate by early January Thus, I doubt that a policy move at this time would cause much disruption However, I can support your recommendation since I interpret your comments as indicating that a change in policy is quite likely by roughly the middle of January If the tone of the economic data does not change, I am concerned that further delay beyond that point would lead to a deterioration of inflationary expectations   This is a question for either Peter or Ted In terms of causes of the weakness in the dollar, you referred to the change in expectations about future US fiscal deficits One way to look at the effect of deficits is that if monetary policy has an inflation objective, the impact of greater deficits is to increase the real rate of interest Very often that would lead to a higher value of the dollar In fact, there are many macro models that have that type of linkage For you to get a lower value of the dollar, I think  -11-    3/28/95  there has to be an assumption that the debt would be monetized My question is, of these two types of influences on the dollar, what roles do you think they play over the longer term and what role have they played in the most recent period?   I guess the point I want to make is that it keys off what monetary policy--   Mike, in terms of the growth rates for the baseline forecast of real GDP, it looks like almost a perfect soft landing in some respects But as one focuses more on what the economy looks like in 1996, it seems to me that there are some very troubling aspects, particularly if one considers what a simulation for 1997 might produce For example, we see that at the end of the year the unemployment rate is below conventional estimates of the natural rate That suggests to me that if we were to simulate through 1997 we probably would have higher inflation Therefore, the conclusion is that on the baseline forecast we not only are making no progress toward reducing inflation, we actually are going to see a period of three years in which inflation at best would stay about flat, but in terms of models most likely would worsen Is that a correct assumption?   Thank you   The point I wanted to make was that clearly your projection does not show any improvement on inflation; we are not making progress   Yes   Mr Chairman, growth in the Twelfth District economy as a whole remains moderately strong The District's unemployment rate has dropped 1-1/2 percentage points in the past 12 months The intermountain states have experienced very rapid growth, although we have seen some moderation recently In California, the modest recovery may gain some momentum this year Revised payroll employment data for California show that the recovery so far has been characterized by a rebound in construction, recent strength in non- aerospace manufacturing, and continued growth in services Payroll employment in southern California now is growing at the fastest pace among the regions in California after falling at the fastest rate during the recession  While overall conditions remain strong in the District, several special factors will damp growth in some areas In California, the estimated damage from March rains and floods is expected to reach $2 billion, including $400 million in crop losses The recent storms also will depress state employment, construction activity, and retail sales Recent developments in Mexico likely are beginning to restrain growth in California and Arizona Arizona's dependence on trade with Mexico is about three times the national average, while California's dependence is about 1-1/2 times the nation's To date, the anecdotal evidence confirms initial estimates that developments in Mexico will reduce growth in US real GDP by a few tenths of a percentage point in 1995--Ted indicated roughly a third of a percent in his forecast--which implies a moderate-sized shock to both California and Arizona However, I must admit there is concern that a severe recession in Mexico could bring about more substantial effects on these states, particularly as one gets closer and closer to the Mexican border In Washington State, the widely publicized cutbacks at Boeing will hold down employment in the near term However, it appears to us that these cutbacks are more indicative of a restructuring effort than of a downturn in the longer- run outlook for aircraft production in the state of Washington  If I may turn briefly to the national economy, the broad contour of our forecast is similar to that of the Greenbook, although we seem to have differences that are very similar to those mentioned by President Minehan Throughout this year, the economy most likely will remain above levels of labor and capacity utilization that are consistent with steady inflation, despite a slowing of growth in real GDP Thus, we anticipate that inflation will increase a bit this year and next Of course, there is always considerable uncertainty in such  -22-    3/28/95  forecasts and this is a particularly important consideration at this early stage of a slowdown in growth that now appears to be under way I find it interesting that several of the spending equations in our model are predicting levels that are below the actual data in the fourth quarter, suggesting that there may be some downside risks to the real side of the forecast Moreover, I guess we have all noted that forecasts from a model often underpredict the amplitude of cyclical movements in the economy Thank you, Mr Chairman   Don, in your discussion of symmetry and asymmetry, you indicated that if the Committee were to favor asymmetry to the up side, it might be as a result of its concern about the path that inflation is expected to take over the longer term In your discussion of symmetry, you talked about the Committee maybe concluding that the risks are roughly balanced I assume that this primarily means risks in terms of economic growth What do you think the Committee would be communicating in terms of its views about inflation if it were to favor a symmetric directive?   Thank you   Mr Chairman, because I find the path for inflation in the baseline forecast unacceptable, my first preference would be for a small increase in rates However, I could support alternative B because of the significant uncertainties that we see in the very short-term prospects for the economy I also would strongly favor asymmetry toward tightening, given the expected unsatisfactory path for inflation for the next several years if the baseline policy assumptions are accepted   Ted, your forecast for Japan indicates a fairly respectable pickup in 1995 and 1996, and I saw that the consensus of about 15 international forecasters is very close to your forecast I was wondering how important fiscal stimulus was in that forecast We have had instances in the last couple of years where the degree of    5/23/95  fiscal stimulus in Japan has been a disappointment I wondered if you would comment in general about that projected pickup   Does your forecast have an explicit assumption about trade relations with the United States?   Mr Chairman, growth in the Twelfth District economy still has considerable momentum, although the pace of expansion has slowed recently Household job growth in the first quarter was fast enough to bring the District's unemployment rate down about 1/4 percentage point since the end of last year However, growth in District payroll employment slowed about 1 percentage point in the first quarter relative to the 1994 pace In California, the moderate recovery has continued and the state and local government fiscal climate has improved a bit, although one gets a different impression from recent articles in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times Payroll employment growth through April of this year continued at near last year's pace  Orange County is reported to have moved closer to reaching an agreement with bondholders to reschedule about $1 billion in short- term debt that begins to come due in early July Some bondholders have been lobbying the state government to help the county honor its obligations as originally scheduled Thus far, the state government has distanced itself from Orange County's woes, actually leaving it to the county's residents to finance eventual debt repayment The spread between California state government bond yields and other similarly rated municipal bond yields has remained well below the peak attained when the Orange County crisis first erupted California's own fiscal situation, we believe, has improved noticeably, although a substantial amount of the debt that accumulated during the recession remains to be worked off The earlier California deficits were financed largely by a run-up in loans to the general fund of about $6 billion More recently, state government revenues have firmed with the pickup in economic activity, creating moderate budget surpluses and allowing a payback of about $1 billion of these loans  Turning to the national economy, our forecast is about the same as the Greenbook forecast We certainly agree that output is going to be weak in the near term as businesses work off excess inventories While there is some uncertainty about how sharp this correction might be, we do not expect it to be prolonged In particular, we expect final sales to keep growing at or even somewhat above the growth rate of potential output through next year We  -17-    5/23/95  expect CPI inflation to stay slightly above 3 percent over the period as the beneficial effects of the recent slowdown in wage inflation are offset by inflationary pressures from the dollar and the rising prices of intermediate goods Thank you   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation I agree that in the short term the risks seem reasonably well balanced, although I share the same views as President Minehan about emphasizing the possibility that inflation may be a little higher than our forecast in the shorter term I would suggest, however, that if we in fact are somewhat agreed about the direction that we would like to see the rate of inflation go in the longer term, it will make us rather cautious in moving toward lower rates   Dave, I would like to ask two questions about labor force developments As I am sure you know, in the last year or so there has been a lot of volatility in participation rates and in particular a very sharp decline in May and a further decline in June I wonder if the staff has had any thoughts about what is going on in terms of this volatility of participation rates Secondly, is it possible that there is somewhat greater elasticity in the participation rate such that the current 57 percent unemployment rate    8/22/95  may be giving us misleading information about the degree of tightness in labor markets?   Thank you   Didn't the previous Greenbook mention a switch from basing productivity on income to basing it on expenditures as a more realistic way to assess productivity because of the increase in    8/22/95  the statistical discrepancy? Doing that will reduce the growth of productivity   Hasn't it gotten wider in recent quarters?   That's a factor that is going to work in the same direction as the chain-weighted index   Mr Chairman, economic growth in the Twelfth District accelerated a bit in early summer after slowing earlier this year A pickup in California is evident from strengthening retail sales, faster job growth, and a falling unemployment rate Employment gains have been particularly large among California's manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronic components Growth in high- technology industries also is spurring employment gains in the Pacific Northwest In Oregon, much of the strength is also at manufacturers of electronic components and other electronic equipment In the state of Washington, employment in the software industry continues to expand rapidly from a high level Farther inland in the District, economic activity in states such as Nevada and Utah is growing fast and construction continues to boom Excluding these fast growing intermountain states, the District construction sector had weakened in early 1995, but more recently employment growth and residential permit activity have picked up  Turning to the outlook for the national economy, I guess I have a pretty rosy scenario in mind, which is probably a good reason for suspicion Although real GDP growth virtually halted in the second quarter, I believe its composition bodes well for the future The modest sustained rate of increase in final sales was encouraging In addition, it seems clear that firms made progress in working off the inventory overhang that had built up in the first quarter This development in combination with continued modest growth in final sales sets the stage for resumption of real GDP growth in coming quarters, perhaps to the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range    8/22/95  Finally, the recent slowdown in real GDP growth should help nip in the bud any potential surge in inflation It should help eliminate excess demands in labor and product markets that otherwise might have boosted inflation next year In addition, our model suggests that the so-called speed effects on inflation of swings in the economy will restrain inflation, perhaps by 1/2 percent in 1996 Overall, I would expect to see CPI inflation come in at around 2-3/4 percent next year   That's too high  -34-    8/22/95   He's talking about the two nominal effective yield curves?   The same   Mr Chairman, I believe that the Mack bill has much to recommend it The bill would clarify our goals and place the primary emphasis on price stability I also like the fact that it requires a numerical goal, which would add to the public's understanding of monetary policy and hopefully enhance our credibility over time At the same time, the bill gives us the freedom to define the numerical inflation goal and the timeframe for achieving it Finally, I like the fact that the bill removes the requirement that we establish and report on ranges for the monetary aggregates, which have become only a minor part of our deliberations Overall, I think the Mack bill would be a big improvement on Humphrey-Hawkins   Have you had any input from the Administration recently?   Mike, you referred to what is happening to labor costs If you look at what models seem to tell you about what is happening there, in the last three quarters, at least in terms of the model that we look at, inflation in the employment cost index has been lower than predicted by 3/4 percentage point My impression is that that may be related to developments in medical costs, and it is possible that the effect will be of short duration When you look out over the next two years, what assumptions do you make about what will happen to the ECI? Have we seen an intercept change or are we going to see an error decay? What assumptions have you made?   So, the inflation assumptions, which are really quite reasonably optimistic, presume that things are moving back to normal   Thank you   Mr Chairman, economic growth in the Twelfth District picked up this summer The annual rate of job growth in California has accelerated by about 1 percentage point--from less than 1 percent this spring to about 2 percent currently The early 1995 declines in manufacturing employment have been reversed and locally oriented sectors such as retail trade have shown increases Also, retail sales have been running well above a year earlier Elsewhere in the West, some of the most rapidly growing states in the nation have resumed their quick pace of expansion In Utah, manufacturing jobs expanded rapidly this summer, and construction employment surged in both Oregon and Nevada In contrast, payroll jobs continued to decline in Hawaii Other District state economies are slowing but appear resilient In Washington State, fast growing industries like software development, most notably of course Microsoft, are offsetting the effects of the large job losses at Boeing In Idaho, the rural areas dependent on agriculture or forest products are weak, but high- tech manufacturing such as that at Micron Technology has been holding up growth in the Boise area The previously rapid growth in Arizona's manufacturing economy was stymied earlier this year by the drop back in exports to Mexico, but the overall Arizona economy continues to expand  Turning to the national outlook, real GDP growth has picked up to a moderate pace in the current quarter, following the inventory correction in the second quarter Our forecast shows GDP growth of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent through the end of next year as inventory investment stops declining and housing picks up briskly A downside risk to the forecast, one very similar to that mentioned by Mike Prell, is that equilibrium real interest rates may be shifting down in response to prospects for lower federal deficits, making our current policy stance tighter than it would otherwise be Recent inflation news also has been favorable and market inflation expectations seem to have come down a bit For the future, the speed effects from the slowdown in the economy in the first half of this year should restrain inflation late this year and in 1996 As we have discussed, labor costs have come in below expectations But before euphoria sets in, I don't anticipate any progress unfortunately this year and next in reducing inflation below last year's rate Despite favorable inflation numbers, both CPI and PPI inflation so far this year are above last year's rates The unemployment and capacity utilization rates indicate that it is unlikely that there currently is any excess capacity pushing down on inflation Overall, under the assumption of a roughly constant federal funds rate, our forecast shows CPI  -15-    9/26/95  inflation at 3 percent or slightly less in 1995, 1996, and 1997-- somewhat above last year's 26 percent rate Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for Bluebook alternative B I think we have pretty solid evidence that the economy is growing at a faster rate than in the second quarter,and it looks as though the economy is going to continue to grow at an acceptable rate in the future as well Although we have seen a modest fall in inflation and a modest increase in the real funds rate, I don't think there is much evidence that inflation will be on a declining path Therefore, I would be reluctant to cut the funds rate at this time   Mike, in Part II of the Greenbook, there is a reference to the prospect that manufacturing capacity growth is going to be revised up in light of some surveys in 1993 and 1994 and also  -13-    11/15/95  the new investment that has occurred in 1995 I wonder how much of an effect these pending revisions will have in terms of the staff's assessment of price pressures in various product markets and also what impact it might have on either the level or growth of potential?   Isn't it mainly computers?   Mr Chairman, economic growth in the Twelfth Federal Reserve District has accelerated through September Recent California employment growth has been significantly faster than for the United States as a whole Very rapid growth has continued in Utah and Oregon Although Nevada and Arizona show signs of cooling, they are growing very rapidly Idaho and Washington also are growing more rapidly than the United States as a whole, but with some areas of weakness The limited information that we have on activity in October suggests less robust economic expansion The official California employment and unemployment figures for October suggest some slowing, although other state data indicate that the recovery is still on track Boeing's 23,000 machinists located in the state of Washington are continuing a strike that was begun in early October; the strike is likely to pull down overall economic activity in that state in the fourth quarter I might note parenthetically, as you may have seen, that Boeing received an incredibly large order from Singapore Airlines for their new 777 In California, there is an ongoing debate over creation of higher paying jobs versus lower paying jobs during the state's prolonged recession During this period, the shift from  -22-    11/15/95  higher to lower wage industries has been more rapid in California than in the nation as a whole due primarily to large reductions in defense- related employment More recently, we believe that this trend has been reversed, due largely to job creation in high-tech-related sectors since those sectors have been growing very rapidly in the last year or so  Turning to the national outlook, our forecast shows real GDP growth averaging about 2-1/2 percent or somewhat more through the end of next year In our view this would leave the economy with some resource constraints in labor and product markets even if the NAIRU has fallen a bit Recent inflation news, as we all know, has been favorable Although I hope it continues in this vein, it seems to me there are some reasons to worry about whether that will happen First, there will be upward pressure on inflation to the extent that the economy is pressing on full employment Second, I believe there are reasons to be skeptical of arguments that the moderation in employment cost inflation over the past year will be a major factor holding down price inflation for long As was mentioned by Mike, most of the slowdown in the employment cost index since 1993 has been in benefits, especially health care costs This has caused employment costs to decelerate since mid-1994 However, in the long run this should affect only the level of benefit costs with presumably no permanent effect on compensation inflation Second, research at our Bank and in the academic literature--and I would cite here work done by Robert Gordon and also Yash Mehra from the Richmond Bank--questions the direction of causation between wages and prices We don't talk about that very much This work suggests that more often than not, these two variables are brought into alignment by wages adjusting to prices rather than the other way around So, despite the favorable CPI numbers in recent months, the unusual decline of labor cost inflation relative to price inflation during the past year or more could be resolved in large part by somewhat faster wage inflation in the future In this regard, I found the Greenbook projection of rising labor costs in 1996 and 1997 certainly plausible Taking these factors into account, I end up concluding, as did Tom Hoenig, that I don't see us making any progress in 1996 and 1997 in reducing inflation below this year's rate Under the assumption of a roughly constant funds rate, our forecast shows the CPI at around 3 percent in 1996 and 1997, a little above this year's 2-3/4 percent rate Thank you   Couldn't that announcement in itself have the impact of slowing down progress in resolving the budget problem?   John's choice of 5 for each coefficient is convenient pedagogically Have you ever looked at estimating it? The two coefficients are quite different if you use estimates As you can see, they produce much higher federal funds rates I think in the most recent period the coefficient on the income variable is closer to 8 and the coefficient on the price variable is about 3   Yes  -43-    11/15/95   It's a closer representation of what the Fed actually did than just the selection of the 5 and 5   Okay   The other thing that's interesting is that the constant is about 27 as opposed to 20 and, of course, that's the real rate   Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation and I also would prefer symmetry It seems to me that we have had a modest temporary increase in the real funds rate, but I think we ought to be willing to accept that Our forecast and that in the Greenbook expect some pickup in inflation That suggests that the increase in real rates is temporary, and until we see that that is an incorrect forecast, I can't see a good reason to move today So, my preference clearly would be to leave the nominal federal funds rate constant at this point   Mr Chairman, economic growth in the Twelfth District slowed this fall California lost a considerable number of government jobs in October and November, particularly at the local government level This job loss apparently boosted the state unemployment rate However, private-sector growth appeared to have substantial momentum in the state Economic activity in the State of Washington paused during the Boeing strike Retailers there worried  -12-    12/19/95  about slow holiday sales, as about 1 percent of the state's workforce missed paychecks from Boeing during the strike However, under the new contract returning workers are getting a big Christmas present, a 10 percent lump sum payment that will make up the income lost earlier Elsewhere, labor markets remain tight in much of the District Employment growth slowed but generally continued to outpace the nation In fact, in terms of employment growth over the past year, the District now has three of the four fastest growing states in the nation Nevada and Utah are number one and number two, and Oregon has moved up to number four I should also note that the Arizona economy continues to expand rapidly despite the adverse effects of the situation in Mexico So far this year, exports to Mexico from Arizona and California have fallen 8 percent, a bit less sharply than overall US exports to Mexico Apparently, Arizona and California are providing a lot of the components and materials to Mexican maquiladora plants whose production has been increased  Turning to the national economy, despite sluggish growth during the current quarter, our model forecast calls for real growth at a rate between 2-3/4 and 3 percent over 1996, which is somewhat higher than the Greenbook Our structural model predicts that inflation will remain close to 3 percent over the next year or so but will eventually go up because the economy is operating at a high level The acceleration in inflation occurs despite the fact that the policy rule in our model acts to restrict the growth of nominal GDP by raising the funds rate by a small amount late next year and follows through with further increases throughout the forecast However, I expect that the economy will turn out somewhat weaker than the model is predicting Surveys suggest that inflation expectations of both long and short horizons have come down about 20 to 30 basis points over the last quarter, and perhaps around 50 basis points since the beginning of this year I believe that the behavior of financial markets is consistent with this evidence If inflation expectations have indeed come down this much, the implication is that the real funds rate has gone up As a consequence, policy may be somewhat more restrictive than in our forecast since the model we use is based on backward-looking expectations Thus, both real output growth and inflation could come in somewhat lower than in our forecast Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman Don, I would like to focus on the middle column of your bottom chart Would you speak specifically as to what this column means to you in the current situation? When I look at the Philadelphia survey of inflationary expectations, it seems to me that the first thing to make assumptions about is how much of the drop is permanent If I wanted to keep the real rate constant and thought it was all permanent, I would probably need to reduce the rate by 50 basis points If I wanted to take more of a Brainard approach and not go the full distance, the rate reduction might be a quarter What does it mean to you?   Mr Chairman, I don't believe that a rising real funds rate is warranted at this time Also, our nominal income targeting rule that we follow calls for a cut in the funds rate of about 25 basis points Therefore, I favor your recommendation and also the symmetric language you proposed At least in terms of the work that my staff has done, it is quite possible that we may have to reverse that reduction sometime in 1996 if we maintain our longer-term price stability objective As I think I indicated in July, clearly a move down at this time should be accompanied by the recognition that it may have to be followed by a move in the other direction at some later time   Mike, you talked a little about PCs, and the Greenbook indicated that in recent history we have all underestimated the amount of investment in that area I also saw The Wall Street Journal article on Monday Is your reasoning as to why such investment is going to be weaker in the future similar to that in the article, or are there different reasons that lead you to that conclusion?   Yes   Thank you   Mr Chairman, economic growth in the Twelfth District has picked up after a brief lull at the end of last year Over the past 12 months, growth in the District has been substantially more rapid than in the nation according to recently revised employment figures The increased pace of activity largely reflects a pickup in    3/26/96  California, where job growth also has exceeded the national figure over the past year It is encouraging that as the economy in California has improved, job growth has become more broadly based During the early stages of the state's recovery, job growth was concentrated in several sectors that were growing even more rapidly nationwide, such as business services During 1995, these sectors continued to grow rapidly but accounted for a smaller share of state job growth Several key durable manufacturing sectors, primarily electronics, outstripped the rest of the country  In the rest of the District, employment has been very robust in Nevada, Utah, Oregon, and Arizona, which continue to be among the five fastest growing states Washington's economy slowed over the past year, but the state's outlook for the rest of 1996 appears stronger in part because of increased orders at Boeing District employment has been particularly strong in the services, trade, and construction sectors Manufacturing employment in the District has expanded by just over 1 percent over the past 12 months This compares favorably, of course, with declining manufacturing employment at the national level However, declining semiconductor demand may slow District manufacturing growth in the near term  Turning to the national economy, as Mike Prell stated, the substantial amount of economic news released since our last meeting has taken us on a bit of a roller coaster ride Nonetheless, it probably has had little net effect on the outlook for this year Assuming a constant funds rate at the current level, I would expect to see real GDP growth perhaps slightly above its 2 percent potential rate in 1996 Of course, the GM strike will have some near-term effect on GDP volatility What I find most striking about the current situation is the consistency of many inflation indicators They all seem to be pointing toward core CPI inflation remaining around 3 percent, roughly the same rate as in the past 3 years For example, both the unemployment and the capacity utilization rates are near common estimates of their natural rates Also, the employment cost index rose by nearly 3 percent in 1995; this would be consistent with about the same increase in the CPI if experience over the past 15 years is a guide Finally, inflation expectations as measured by Ed Boehne's survey are around 3 percent This isn't surprising given the inflation indicators I have mentioned as well as experience with inflation in recent years So, if we maintain the current stance of policy, it appears that conditions in the economy are likely to maintain roughly the status quo when it comes to inflation over the next two years Moreover, if we do end up seeing a change in inflation, it is more likely to be on the up side since measures of unemployment and unused capacity appear to be slightly on the low side of their natural rates Thank you   They are setting up, but it will take a few more minutes   Mr Chairman, much of the evidence that we have received since the last meeting suggests that economic activity has strengthened, as the gains in February have more than made up for the weakness in January Even with the GM strike this month, it now appears that there will be a marked pickup in real growth in the current quarter as a whole At the present time, there appears to be little upward or downward pressure on inflation, although I do think that the inflation risks are on the up side Accordingly, I would agree with your recommendation that we make no change in policy at this time It seems to me that further easing would be inappropriate, given the increasing strength of the economy and the risks that this could lead to higher inflation in the future It would also seem prudent to me to wait for more information before we decide on our next action If economic activity continues to pick up, it might soon be appropriate to increase the funds rate Thank you   But how are the numbers characterized in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony? My recollection is that they are characterized as what the FOMC expects to happen   I don't have any disagreement with what Don is recommending, and I think it can be done in terms of what one sets as a policy objective for a year like 1998 We use policy rules at the San Francisco Bank We have some idea about what we think price stability means, and I think we would be able to do what Don is proposing quite easily In a way it does put the cart before the horse because the real discussion is about what we as a Committee mean by price stability and over what timeframe we should seek to achieve it Since we haven't been able to talk about that for 10 or 11 years, [Laughter] if Don's proposal gets us closer to it, I am all for it   I hope that we can have two discussions I would set aside the question of strategy and discuss it sometime later because I think the two different approaches to strategy raise a lot of other issues So, confining the discussion to our goals and objectives and the time period for achieving them would be very useful   Mike, the core rate of inflation in the forecast increases 1/2 percentage point between the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of next year If one were to assume an unchanged policy and to extrapolate that out into 1998, what do you think would happen to core inflation in 1998?   You have a fairly large increase forecast for 1996 and 1997    5/21/96   Mr Chairman, our monthly indicators model suggests that economic growth in the current quarter should be close to that in the first We believe that this relatively high growth rate is temporary because it reflects the building of inventories by business firms Thus, we see the economy slowing toward its long-run growth trend of 2 percent in the second half of the year, assuming that interest rates remain near current levels We expect 2 percent growth in 1997 as well, which is just slightly below the Greenbook forecast  Such a forecast is not as attractive as it might appear at first glance The problem is that with the economy operating around full employment, it will be difficult to make any progress in getting the inflation rate down In fact, our structural model suggests that there will be a small amount of upward pressure on inflation over this period, and of course that is what the Greenbook says as well I find this forecast alarming and would like to be in a situation where the inflation rate is projected to come down gradually  Moreover, it seems to me that the downside risks we were worried about earlier in the year have dissipated and that the risks are largely on the upside now Economic growth could easily come in above our forecast For instance, our structural model predicts a slowdown in the second half of the year, in part because of the recent rise in long-term interest rates However, given that the market's expectation of future economic activity is embedded in long rates, it may be more appropriate to treat the recent rise in rates as an indication of a future robust economy Since we are already operating at a high level of resource utilization, growth above trend even for a few quarters could present an upside inflation risk  Turning to the region, economic expansion in the Twelfth District is continuing at the solid pace that was established in 1995, which remains more rapid than that for the rest of the nation California is making a significant contribution to District expansion While current employment statistics indicate that annualized job growth in California during the first four months of 1996 was below the 1995 pace, the recent statistics are likely to be revised upward Other recent indicators such as a declining unemployment rate, substantial gains in state tax revenues, and reduced outmigration suggest greater underlying strength in the state economy  -8-    5/21/96  After a relatively slow 1995, the Washington State economy expanded sharply in February and March, with noticeable job gains in all major sectors Rapid expansion continues in Nevada, Utah, Oregon, and Arizona, with Arizona accelerating since November after slowing in the middle of 1995 Alaska and Hawaii remain somewhat weak, however  Expansion in District employment continues to be particularly strong in the construction, services, and trade sectors The growth of construction and real estate loans has been strong in the District, and planned construction remains high in several states Growth in the District's boom states is still being spurred by expansion in manufacturing employment, and with a shift to higher-paid jobs, average manufacturing wages have risen substantially in several states Consistent with the recent slowdown in the semiconductor industry, employment growth in the District computer and electronics sector slowed in the first quarter However, our industry contacts believe that the semiconductor industry is experiencing only a temporary glut and that the computer industry will undergo rapid expansion in the remainder of 1996, although at a somewhat less robust pace than in 1995 Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, as it turns out I want to talk about insurance policies as well I believe that it would be wise to tighten policy at this time We cut the rate in January because an apparent moderation in growth was reducing inflationary pressures and because we wanted insurance against the risk that the economy might weaken further Since then, the growth picture of the economy has brightened considerably Growth in the first half of the year now appears to be exceeding the trend rate Since the need to guard against a slow economy has evaporated, it makes sense to undo the January reduction in the funds rate Indeed, it seems to me that the risk we now need to insure against is an increase in inflation This view is supported by the forecasts of both our staff at the San Francisco Fed and the Greenbook At a minimum, it is safe to say that there is little reason to expect inflation to show a downward trajectory at current levels of interest rates  In my view, these two considerations support a 50 basis point increase in the funds rate However, given that an increase in the rate would represent a change in the direction of policy and would be a big surprise to the market, it would seem prudent to me to go for a 25 basis point increase at this meeting Thank you   Mike, revisions in the Greenbook forecasts prepared for recent meetings have been quite small But I think they have been in the direction of raising the rate of inflation and to some extent, I guess, the level of real GDP In light of that, could you comment on the likelihood that the slowdown during the forecast period will be enough to relieve inflationary pressures?   The change in the forecast in the last couple of meetings and some of the comments in Part I of the Greenbook, which I must admit I found striking, seem to suggest that you see the prospects of a more favorable outcome as probably lower now than you did at the time of the previous meeting or the meeting before that   I see Thank you   Mr Chairman, economic growth is strong in the Twelfth District In California, job growth picked up noticeably in the second quarter, and the unemployment rate fell about 1/2 percentage point In July, the California unemployment rate edged down further, and payroll jobs continued to expand at about the  -16-    8/20/96  second-quarter pace Economic activity in the State of Washington also is picking up as aircraft production rebounds and the software business continues to be good Job growth has continued to be strongest in Nevada, Utah, and Idaho In the second quarter, employment growth in these three states was about 7 percent at an annual rate, twice as fast as the accelerated 3-1/2 percent second- quarter pace for the nation Employment growth in Oregon and Arizona has continued in the 3 to 4 percent range, and we even have seen some improvement in our laggard state, Hawaii, where economic conditions were deteriorating until recently  For the national economy, the recent news is consistent with our forecast of a moderate slowdown in real output and employment during the second half of this year Thereafter, we expect real growth to stabilize at around 2 percent in 1997, although our projection is predicated on a slight tightening of policy over the forecast horizon However, the recent news is also consistent with our general assessment that the economy faces an acceleration of wage and price pressures We have reached levels of labor and capacity utilization that are inconsistent with steady inflation Indeed, we anticipate an acceleration of inflation in 1997 on the order of 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point in a wide variety of price and compensation measures Thank you   Mr Chairman, although the pace of economic activity seems to be slowing as expected, my best estimate is that the level of activity will remain somewhat above its long-run potential The economy's capacity and the effects of worker insecurity on wage pressures, of course, are subject to uncertainty In my opinion and that of the Greenbook, we face rising inflation The inflation increases projected by the staffs at our Bank and the Board imply that the current level of short-term rates will cause inflation to accelerate through the forecast horizon and beyond I am persuaded by this year's pickup in labor costs and the projected increase in all of the inflation indexes in the Greenbook Therefore, I believe it is prudent to raise the funds rate by at least 25 basis points   I would like to move! [Laughter]   Mike, the information coming from the employment data may be somewhat clearer than you have suggested in the sense that, while admittedly the unemployment rate number is questionable and the labor force has been very volatile with large declines, the nonfarm payroll message is very consistently strong and seems fairly reliable In addition, I have a feeling that we are going to have upward revisions in that area We have had such revisions in the last couple of years because the survey does not take into account, as well as it should, hiring by new businesses There was a big upward adjustment when the last revision was made, and I would expect to see another So, although I agree with your point about the ambiguity surrounding many of the numbers that have come out in recent weeks, when it comes to the production side, particularly employment, it seems to me that we do have very consistent strength    9/24/96   Mr Chairman, strong economic growth is continuing in the Twelfth District, although with some slowing in July from the very brisk second-quarter pace The California economy has performed very well in recent months, with annualized payroll employment growth averaging 34 percent during May through August Although Los Angeles county continues to be somewhat weak, other parts of southern California are gaining jobs and residents, with many of these coming from Los Angeles county The Washington State economy has accelerated further in recent months, spurred by rapid manufacturing job growth associated primarily with the resurgence at Boeing Payroll employment growth in most of the other District states is very strong, ranging from about 4 to 7 percent at an annual rate Slight recent slowing is reflected in decelerated manufacturing employment growth in the District boom states of Nevada, Utah, Oregon, Arizona, and Idaho The only exceptions to strong growth are Alaska  -12-    9/24/96  and Hawaii Alaska's growth has been slow in 1996, and Hawaii has actually lost jobs in recent months There are signs of increasing growth in average wages in several parts of the District The increases have been large and accelerating in Nevada and Utah, which one would expect, and they have occurred in the construction and trade sectors in addition to manufacturing Wage increases in other states mostly have been moderate There are signs of a slight pickup in California, although from relatively low rates  Turning to the national economy, production-side data, particularly employment as we discussed, have been quite strong lately On their own, they portray a robust economy However, on the spending side, consumption and retail sales have not been doing as well When this information is incorporated into the recently revised nonstructural model that we now use in San Francisco to forecast current quarter output growth, it produces a growth rate of 2 percent in the third quarter Combining this forecast with that from our structural model, we expect output growth in the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range in the second half of this year as well as in the first half of next year This forecast assumes that the recent slowdown in consumption spending is temporary If consumption spending fails to pick up, obviously output growth will be slower  To my mind, however, the growth forecast is simply icing on a cake that already has greater wage and price inflation baked in Even if growth comes in, say, 1/2 percentage point less in the second half of this year, we will still be left with a quite low unemployment rate of probably less than 5-1/2 percent Based on this, we anticipate an acceleration of inflation on the order of 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point in a wide variety of price and compensation measures during 1997  I realize that there is some uncertainty associated with this forecast For instance, the coefficients of the underlying Phillips curve are associated with sizable standard errors However, as far as I know, the Phillips curve is still the best model available to forecast inflation and our analysis suggests that the Phillips curve is basically on track With unemployment clearly below the natural rate, wages are accelerating and price pressures are building   This is going to be a little more difficult given what the Vice Chairman just said, but I would like to indicate that I think there are a number of different arguments that can be put  -32-    9/24/96  forward to make the case for raising rates, and I am going to argue in favor of doing that  My first and foremost concern involves the level of resource utilization in the economy The economy has been operating at a level somewhat above its long-term potential for some time now While I expect growth to slow, and I certainly indicated that is our forecast, I do not think that the slowdown will lead to a reduction in the gap between actual and potential output Indeed, the gap could well grow larger over the next few quarters At a minimum, it is safe to say that I do not see any reduction in inflationary pressures in the near term At this time, inflationary pressures are being masked by certain favorable developments, most notably the marked slowdown in the growth rate of health care costs In my view, we should be using this opportunity to lock in lower rates of inflation instead of using it to put off needed action on interest rates  Finally, we have talked at times about the level of the real funds rate While this rate does not appear to be low by historical standards, the data suggest that we are in a period of relatively high investment demand and perhaps a supply-driven expansion that implies higher equilibrium real interest rates In view of these considerations, I believe it would be prudent to raise interest rates 25 basis points at this meeting This may not be the last increase we will need unless the economy slows down more than I anticipate Thank you   Mike, one interesting aspect of the forecast is the strength of consumption PCE goes up 27 percent in 1997 I assume that one of the reasons is the strong growth of income--you have a strong 27 percent increase in real disposable income A bit of a puzzle to me is why there is such a difference between the growth of real disposable income and that of real GDP The 05 percent difference is greater than anything we have seen in the 1990s, and I do not know how far back one would have to go to see that kind of difference in the growth of those two measures   They push up real disposable income?   So maybe what one is using for the deflator shows up in disposable income versus GDP?   Okay   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy expanded briskly in the first half of 1996, and it remained on track during the third quarter Growth in total payroll employment slowed only slightly between the second and third quarters, from 36 to 33 percent at an annual rate The District's performance this year is attributable largely to a strengthening in the State of California For example, growth in construction employment in that state has accelerated substantially since the first quarter The overall expansion has been stronger in northern California than in other parts of the state The northern region has benefitted from low    11/13/96  unemployment and a substantial recovery in housing values, factors that gradually are spreading to southern California The Washington State economy continues to benefit from stepped up production at Boeing Twelve-month gains in total employment in the state have increased from 1 percent at the start of the year to 31 percent in September Increased demand for manufactured products related to aircraft production also spilled over to Oregon and added to a third- quarter surge there The intermountain states--Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, and Utah--continued to post large year-over-year employment gains About the only weak part of the District is Hawaii, which showed a decline in jobs during the third quarter  Turning to the national economy, data released since we met in September caused us to lower our projections for near-term real GDP and, to a lesser extent, inflation in 1997 We now expect real GDP growth to fall below its 2 percent trend this quarter, in part because inventory investment should drop off following its strong increase in the third quarter At the same time, inflation in the ECI and the GDP-based price measures all came in below expectations Over a longer horizon, underlying inflation has shown a slight downward trend according to most measures despite the low unemployment rate  We have updated some earlier work that looked at conventional inflation equations incorporating historical relations among unemployment, inflation, and other variables These equations over- predicted inflation by a wide margin in the third quarter, and this noticeably intensified the more moderate pattern of overprediction that we have seen for some time As a result, we have lowered our forecast for CPI inflation in 1997 to just under 3 percent, in effect putting somewhat less weight on upward pressure from labor markets However, I still consider the risks for inflation to be on the up side because it is quite possible that the historical relationship with labor market conditions will begin to reassert itself Thank you   Mr Chairman, formulating policy under present circumstances obviously requires finding the right balance between likely future outcomes in the economy and recent developments Labor market conditions, as you have indicated, appear to be on the tight side Even if the natural rate of unemployment has decreased a bit, that tightness would suggest a moderate uptrend for inflation in the future And as I said earlier, we could see a substantial rise in inflation if the normal historical relationship between unemployment and inflation were to reassert itself These considerations make it likely that we will need to tighten policy in the future However, recent inflationary developments have been surprisingly favorable, and economic growth slowed in the third quarter and may slow further this quarter These developments suggest that it might be prudent to wait a while to see how things unfold before tightening policy On balance, therefore, I would prefer to leave the federal funds rate unchanged for the time being, and I support your recommendation for alternative "B" and asymmetric language  -33-    11/13/96   Mike, I have two questions The first deals with the PCE in the fourth quarter Based upon the data that we have, which of course include the PCE for October, retail sales for October and November, and what we are hearing about retail sales for the Christmas season, do you feel that this is consistent with a PCE growth rate in excess of 3 percent in the fourth quarter?   The second question relates to what I heard you say about the distribution around GDP numbers for the fourth quarter Based on the data you have seen, particularly the more recent data, would you, if you were to give us a new estimate, revise that estimate as well?   But probably up?   Thank you   Mr Chairman, relatively fast economic growth continued in the Twelfth District in recent months, making this a very good year in the West Almost 1/3 of the jobs added across the 50 states over the last year have been in the Twelfth District states As a matter of fact, the percentage growth in employment in our District states has been twice that of the other states In terms of year-over-year employment growth, the District's inter-mountain states of Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and Idaho have been the four fastest growing states in the country The 12-month pace of job gains in the inter- mountain West exceeded 4-1/2 percent Although employment growth has slowed a bit in recent months, it has maintained a healthy pace The  -11-    12/17/96  Pacific Northwest is the next fastest growing region in the country After the four inter-mountain states, Washington and Oregon rank fifth and sixth in terms of the underlying pace of job growth, which has been about 4 percent Employment growth recently picked up to this fast pace in Washington largely owing to the rebound at Boeing, although companies such as Microsoft are contributing as well  The sizable California economy is growing faster than the national pace, with employment in the state recently growing at a rate of about 3 percent Not all sectors have shared equally in the long- delayed California recovery, but we now see a pickup in some of the lagging sectors The state government budget situation finally has improved enough to allow the hiring of many needed public school teachers, and much additional hiring is expected next year In the residential real estate sector, sales, prices, and new construction were weak throughout the first half of the '90s but began to increase in 1996 in some areas of the state As a matter of fact, the Silicon Valley area surrounding San Jose is actually booming  Turning to the national economy, if the current stance of policy were maintained, I would envision the economy for 1997 as a whole growing at its trend rate as a result of several roughly offsetting positive and negative factors On the positive side, it does seem that exports should be boosted by the healthy growth of our trading partners, and spending on computers and related products most likely will continue to grow rapidly On the negative side, it appears that strong increases in consumer spending on real assets like housing and durables to satisfy pent-up demands has largely run its course Of course, fiscal policy will continue to be on the restrictive side With the economy slowing in the current quarter and then advancing at around its trend rate next year, we have scaled back our estimate of the level of resource utilization for 1997 Of course, judging resource utilization is particularly difficult right now, especially in labor markets My best estimate is that there probably will still be a slight degree of excess demand in the economy next year, which suggests that there will be only a very gradual upward trend in underlying inflation Our forecast shows core CPI rising from under 2-3/4 percent this year to close to 3 percent in 1998 In the longer-term context, our model simulations suggest that it actually would take a slight tightening of the stance of policy next year to make the inflation rate settle in at around 3 percent in future years However, it appears unlikely that a downward tilt to inflation, which I think would be desirable, would be forthcoming unless policy were tightened more substantially next year Thank you   Mr Chairman, our forecast suggests that it may be necessary sometime next year to tighten the stance of policy to impart some downward momentum to the underlying rate of inflation However, there would seem to be little or no reason to take action now At our Bank, we consult two monetary policy rules as a starting point for thinking about the appropriate stance of policy an estimated version of Taylor's rule and a nominal income growth rate rule Even if we assume a 2 percent target for core CPI inflation, both rules suggest that the funds rate should be left at about 5-1/4 percent at the present time, although when applied to our forecast they do suggest higher rates will be needed in the future In addition, it appears to us at least that there is considerable uncertainty at this time about the prospective strength of economic activity Therefore, I support the Bluebook alternative B, with a 5-1/4 percent funds rate and asymmetric language on the side of tightening   Mike, I was a little uncertain as to the wealth effects on consumer  spending in the Greenbook forecast I had the impression that there certainly was an impact  from higher equity prices in particular, but in the Monday staff briefing to the Board, you  seemed to be saying that there was not much of an effect Would you go into that a little,  please?   Thank you   I think it was useful to get those alternatives, but which of the  alternatives do you think would be most closely aligned with an opportunistic approach?   Mr Chairman, strong growth has continued in the Twelfth District  in recent months following large gains last year Although severe winter weather slightly  disrupted economic activity in January, we have seen indications of a large bounceback since  then In 1996, District payrolls expanded by about 3-1/2 percent Employment growth in  the fastest growing states--Nevada, Arizona, and Utah--currently is averaging between 4-1/2  and 7-1/2 percent I might note parenthetically that Utah is perhaps the state with the tightest  labor conditions in the entire nation; its unemployment rate is 32 percent I would also note  that if one wants to find slack labor conditions, I would like to recommend Alaska and  Hawaii, which were 49th and 50th in terms of employment growth, and you could also  choose a broad spectrum of weather as well [Laughter]  Revised data indicate that California's recovery accelerated throughout 1996  California payroll employment grew by 3 percent last year, well above the 23 percent rate  recorded in 1995 The rate of growth picked up in most areas of California last year, and  although severe winter weather held down employment in January, the February numbers  showed another large job gain The fastest growing sectors in California are high-tech  manufacturing, business services, and engineering management services, although other  sectors such as construction, trade, and real estate are growing steadily    3/25/97  Turning to the national economy, the concerns I had in February about the  inflation outlook have been intensified by recent developments Real GDP growth appears to  have turned in another strong performance this quarter following a rapid advance in the  fourth quarter The economy's surge in recent quarters means that it is operating at a  noticeably higher level than seemed likely only a few months ago While judging resource  utilization is difficult, the unemployment and the capacity utilization rates as well as  estimates of the GDP gap taken together suggest that excess demand pressures most likely  are building in the economy A number of factors, including the high dollar and tight fiscal  policy, seem likely to slow growth later this year However, I do not think the basic problem  of excess demand for resources is likely to be solved anytime soon with an unchanged funds  rate Therefore, I see a significant risk of an increase in underlying inflation in the years  ahead I emphasize the word "risk" because we have not actually seen signs of rising  inflation in the data This fact obviously raises uncertainty about the future For example, it  is difficult to judge the magnitude of possible roles for enhanced productivity and for  changes in the labor market in holding down inflation However, given the long lags in  monetary policy, we are left, I believe, with little choice but to use forecasts in gauging  policy My best judgment at this point is that even with the measurement improvements  being introduced by the BLS, the core CPI would still show a modest upward trend this year  and next if monetary policy remains unchanged Our forecast shows core CPI inflation of  around 2-3/4 percent in 1997 and 3 percent in 1998 compared to just 2-1/2 percent last year  I do not think we should risk an upward trend in inflation because, if it becomes established,  it would be costly to turn around Thank you   Mr Chairman, I should mention that the estimated Taylor Rule,  which we use as a policy reaction function in our forecasting model and which I think is  preferable to the original Taylor formulation, suggests a gradual rise in the funds rate totaling  about 100 basis points, with the increases beginning in the second quarter and continuing  through the end of this year The degree of tightening is very similar to the one assumed in  the tighter policy simulation in the Greenbook According to our analysis, a path like this for  the funds rate appears necessary just to hold the line at around 3 percent on core CPI  inflation It certainly is time to take an initial step in tightening policy While I think the  case for a 50 basis point increase is stronger than you do, Mr Chairman, I would support a  25 basis point increase to 5-1/2 percent I also would strongly prefer to have language in the  directive that is asymmetric toward further tightening since I think that course of action is  likely to be appropriate in the future It seems to me that there was very little, if any,  discussion around the table that would be consistent with a symmetric directive Thank you   Throughout this period, wasn't there evidence of a reduced appetite  for US securities by Japanese investors and some speculation that the Ministry of Finance  actually had played a role in this reduced appetite?   There will be data on that?   From the Republic of Texas [Laughter]   Mr Chairman, strong economic growth has continued in the  Twelfth Federal Reserve District in recent months, although the pace has slowed slightly in  some of the fastest growing states During the first quarter of 1997, District jobs expanded  by 3-1/2 percent at an annual rate In the fastest growing states--Nevada, Arizona, Utah, and  Oregon--growth is averaging between 3-1/2 and 7 percent With the exception of Alaska and  Hawaii, employment growth in the other District states is running at or above 3 percent  Construction and services continue to be the fastest growing sectors in the District economy,  but manufacturing is becoming a key contributor to the growth in District employment  Manufacturing employment grew by 3 percent at an annual rate during the first quarter, as  rapid expansion in high-tech and aircraft production was boosted by growth in food  processing and textile industries  Accompanying strong employment growth has been a recent surge in the District's  labor force In most states, labor force growth has been broad-based In California, however,  our estimates are that perhaps one-half of the new labor market entrants have transitioned  from welfare to work and are competing for a narrow range of low-skilled jobs Of the total  number of US welfare recipients who must leave the rolls before July of this year, over 38  percent are in California If all of these individuals move into the labor force, labor force  participation in California will increase by 1/2 percentage point  Despite rapid labor force growth, strong employment demand is creating tight  labor market conditions in several parts of the District The District-wide unemployment rate  has fallen by 1/2 percentage point over the past quarter, and in several areas in the District    5/20/97  competition for employees is so fierce that employers are holding job fairs and offering  finder's fees and signing bonuses to recruit new hires  Turning to the national economy, the risk that inflationary pressures are building  seems to me to have increased since our March meeting The economy's rapid growth in  recent quarters means that it is now operating at a noticeably higher level according to both  the unemployment rate and the estimated GDP gap The unemployment rate is now clearly  in the inflation danger zone even when we take into account the rather large standard errors  that characterize estimates of NAIRU, and the excess of real GDP over its potential level rose  to about 1-3/4 percent in the first quarter according to our estimate In addition, the  industrial capacity utilization rate is somewhat above the level at which inflation typically  has accelerated in the past  With these indicators presenting a fairly uniform picture of excessive pressure on  resources, I believe there is good reason to be worried about the trend of inflation in the  future Given this situation, the key question is whether real GDP is likely to slow enough  and for a long enough period of time to eliminate inflationary pressures Like the  Greenbook, our forecast for the current quarter shows a rather sharp slowing of growth; our  estimate is 2 percent for the current quarter It certainly would not be surprising to see such a  pause in activity following the torrid pace of the first quarter Looking to the second half of  the year, we expect growth to come in at around the trend rate of 2 percent This would still  leave the unemployment rate at just under 5 percent at the end of 1997  The bottom line is that it is unlikely that the basic problem of pressure on  resources would be solved anytime soon with an unchanged funds rate My best judgment at  this point is that underlying inflation would show a modest upward trend this year and next if    5/20/97  monetary policy remained unchanged Of course, when we look at the CPI, a good deal of  the upward trend would be obscured by the higher dollar and lower price of oil, not to  mention the methodological changes being introduced by the BLS As always, of course, we  should acknowledge that this forecast of rising underlying inflation could turn out to be  wrong for a number of reasons For example, it is difficult to judge the magnitude of  possible roles for enhanced productivity or changes in the labor market in holding down  inflation However, I believe that even with a slowdown in growth in the current quarter, the  risk of rising inflation in the future has increased to a serious level   Mr Chairman, for me the policy choice comes down to assessing  alternative risks It appears to me that the risk associated with raising the funds rate is  smaller than the risk of not raising it If we tighten policy and that action turns out to have  been unnecessary, we would slow the expansion a bit, but there would be relatively little risk  of a prolonged period of weakness If we do not raise the funds rate and the inflation rate  begins to show a clear upward trend, the long lags in policy mean that we could end up with  a problem on our hands  On the basis of these considerations, I would prefer to raise the funds rate by 25  basis points at this meeting However, since I do not see a possible pickup in inflation as  imminent, I am willing, somewhat reluctantly, to support a policy of no change in the funds  rate for the time being and asymmetric language even though I believe we are running the  risk of a larger rate increase later  Finally, I very much look forward to our next meeting and the opportunity for us  to reconsider our decision not to change the rate   Ted, have you had any discussions either with the Peoples Bank of China  or the Hong Kong Monetary Authority about the political commitment to peg the Hong Kong  dollar? It would seem to me that there would be a lot of vulnerability associated with making any  change very soon   Mike, I wanted to ask you a question about inflation forecasts that in the  view of some have become particularly unreliable recently We did an exercise--an out-of-sample  forecast--that looked at the inflation forecast in our model As one would have expected, it turned  out that we were overestimating inflation, but the overestimate did not exceed the 90 percent    8/19/97  confidence level If we look back to, say, 1994-95 the errors actually were greater then and in the  other direction There were times, one in particular, when the 90 percent confidence level was  exceeded in the sense that inflation was so much understated My question is whether you  conclude in terms of your model that that relationship has broken down, or do you find in a  statistical sense that you cannot state that conclusion? We feel we cannot   It strikes me as interesting that if we wanted to make a point that we are  in some new era, we would not use these equations to support that conclusion   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District's rapid economic expansion has  actually gained momentum in recent months Payroll employment grew by 32 percent at an annual  rate in the second quarter Growth in durable manufacturing employment accelerated between the  first and second quarters as Boeing's expansion combined with the continued strength in high-tech  industries and a recent resurgence in wood products industries Construction employment growth  also accelerated in the second quarter Districtwide, this sector expanded nearly 9 percent on an  annual basis during the first half of the year I might note parenthetically that in the last year  construction increased 92 percent in California, generating more than 46,000 jobs, and 149  percent in Nevada Normally, I would say that a percentage increase that large is unsustainable, but  when I discuss the Nevada economy, I do not use the word "unsustainable"  The second-quarter acceleration was evident in most District states Payroll employment  in each of the District's growth leaders--Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Washington, and Oregon--grew by  4 percent or more at an annual pace Furthermore, the unemployment rate has fallen this year in all  District states except Hawaii, and labor markets in virtually all major urban areas are extremely  tight  The impressive turnaround in California's economy has continued this year; payroll  employment grew nearly 3 percent at an annual rate during the first seven months of the year  Although the pace slowed in recent months, the state's unemployment rate continued to fall Other    8/19/97  California economic data also point to a continued rapid expansion Unexpectedly strong growth in  state income tax receipts recently led to a substantial upward revision in state government revenues  Also, the recovery in residential real estate markets has spread to most areas of the state, and  housing prices statewide are back on the rise  Turning to the national economy, recent data suggest that over the next year or so, real GDP  is likely to grow at a rate close to the 2-1/4 percent pace now reported for the second quarter Like  the Greenbook, I think underlying demand may be somewhat stronger than this in the near term,  but firms are likely to satisfy part of the demand out of inventories While the economy is not  likely to grow much faster than its trend rate over this period, conventional measures, as we all  know, suggest that it is already operating at relatively high levels of resource utilization Thus,  there is still a risk that inflation may trend upward in the future Of course, recent data on wages  and prices have been highly favorable and now actually show a modest downward trend While  part of this can be explained by factors such as the higher dollar, part remains unexplained by  conventional relationships Is inflation being held down by temporary factors such as unusually  small increases in benefit costs or higher worker insecurity or is the change of a more permanent  nature because it reflects developments such as an increase in trend productivity? Taking these  factors into account, my best judgment is that, while remaining low, underlying inflation is likely to  pick up a little over the next six quarters For instance, our forecast shows measures of core  inflation going up between 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point between this year and next Finally, I would  classify myself as an old paradigm, newly found optimist [Laughter]   I agree as well   Mike, the ECI forecast in the Greenbook has an increase of just a couple  of tenths over the forecast period There is reference in the Greenbook to the fact that the  increasing role of bonuses and other incentive payments may be having some influence in  moderating measured increases in employment costs You mentioned in your oral presentation that  medical premiums may be rising significantly We, too, hear a lot about the possibility that  medical premiums will be going up considerably in 1998 It seems to me that in your ECI forecast  there is almost an implicit flat-to-down path for wage and salary increases Do you think the risks  are fairly symmetrical in that forecast? Are there factors that I am not taking into account that  could moderate the increase in medical premiums? The latter seems likely to be very large   Thank you   Mr Chairman, economic growth has continued to display strength in the  Twelfth District in recent months Payroll employment grew by almost 3 percent at an annual rate  this summer The number of jobs expanded briskly in the construction, real estate, and local  government sectors in the District states that have fast-growing populations Total manufacturing  payrolls were boosted by the pickup in Washington State where we see a lot of growth in aerospace  employment This, of course, is the effect of Boeing's increased production as well as the effect of  that production on supplying industries However, aside from the aerospace industry, growth in  District manufacturing employment has slowed a bit recently Job gains have been most rapid in  Washington and Nevada where payrolls are expanding at about a 6 percent annual rate For  example, the competition for skilled workers has stiffened in the Seattle area where Boeing,  Microsoft, and other high-tech employers are expanding rapidly In the Las Vegas area,  construction of resort and other commercial projects continues to boom The pace of expansion in  California has remained strong in recent months, but it no longer appears to be accelerating  Payroll employment growth slowed to about a 2 percent average annual pace this summer, and that  is down from a 3 percent gain in the preceding 12 months    9/30/97  The national economy has continued to yield good news, as we have all seen Economic  activity appears to have turned in another strong performance in the third quarter and inflation has  fallen further Looking forward, I think there are a number of reasons to expect aggregate demand  to slow in the quarters ahead Inventories appear to be a bit on the high side as do stocks of most  other types of real assets held by businesses and households At its present level, the dollar is a  restraining influence, and fiscal policy certainly remains somewhat restrictive As a result, we  expect to see a slowdown in nominal GDP growth from 5-1/4 percent this year to about 4 percent in  1998, with real GDP expanding by about 2 percent next year However, I think there is upside risk  to the outcome for next year, given that the economy has surprised us on the strong side over the  past year or so and the possibility that a significant positive supply shock is affecting the economy  With regard to inflation, the roughly 2 percent increase in the GDP price index that I  expect for 1998 represents a relatively small rise over the 1-3/4 percent increase anticipated for this  year Of course, conventional measures of resource utilization suggest upward pressure on  inflation It is difficult, however, to know how much weight to put on these indicators While there  are reasons to be concerned about their reliability at present, it is too soon to tell if their historical  relationships with inflation have broken down Our analysis suggests that inflation forecasts in the  past two years based upon these relationships are within normal statistical bounds Even if we do  get some upward pressure on inflation from high resource utilization, there are other factors in our  forecast for 1998 that tend to restrain inflation at least temporarily These include negative speed  effects from the slowing growth of the economy and the high level of the dollar Thank you   Mr Chairman, given uncertainties about the magnitude of a possible  supply shock, I am somewhat more comfortable with data and forecasts of nominal GDP growth  than with forecasts of the split between real GDP growth and inflation Nominal GDP has grown  moderately over the past year and is projected to slow in both our forecast and the Greenbook I  think there is a reasonable chance that nominal GDP growth will slow, and such an outcome would  make it unlikely that a significant inflation problem would develop Therefore, I am willing to  leave the funds rate unchanged for now, and I can support Bluebook alternative B with asymmetric  language to the upside I do believe, however, that a strong case can be made to take out a small    9/30/97  insurance policy against the likelihood of higher future inflation, but delaying such a decision until,  for example, November is not likely to be the difference between success and failure   Peter, we do not have primary regulatory responsibility for the parents  of some of the primary dealers Do we have a dialogue with the primary dealers about century  date change compliance and is it an issue?   Also, there is the issue of foreign banks, which I think has become  more of an issue in recent months   Right   Would it be appropriate to have a discussion with the primary dealers  regarding their handling of century date compliance just as we would with banking institutions?   Okay   In the Greenbook forecast, the funds rate is kept constant through this  quarter and then begins to move up, rising 75 basis points by the middle of next year Was there  any thought as to how sensitive the forecast might be to this assumption, in view of recent  developments in Asia? In particular, if this path were embarked upon somewhat sooner than is  assumed in the Greenbook forecast, would you modify the response of the economy in light of  the possibility that it might generate some financial consequences that are not incorporated in the  forecast?   Mr Chairman, labor markets have remained quite tight in the Twelfth  Federal Reserve District in recent months, as employment growth has proceeded at a strong but  moderating pace The District unemployment rate fell about 1/2 percentage point in the first half  of the year and remained at this low level through September With the notable exception of  California, unemployment rates in most District states now are at lows not seen in several  decades Although California's unemployment rate is still high relative to those in other states, it  has been falling sharply and labor markets in some of the major metropolitan areas are very tight  Unemployment rates have fallen to new lows in San Diego and the San Francisco Bay area  Labor market conditions also have improved noticeably in the Los Angeles area, which until    11/12/97 46  recently had been experiencing a strong out-migration of people who lacked good job  opportunities there  For the District as a whole, although third-quarter employment growth was strong, the  rate of increase was about 1 percentage point lower than the very rapid pace in the first half of  1997 This includes California and Washington where the slowdown follows a pickup in growth  earlier in the year Moderation in growth rates in the intermountain states of Arizona, Nevada,  and Utah appears to be related to a slowing in population growth This is partly a result of fewer  new residents relocating from California Job growth has tapered off this year in the  population-oriented sectors of the economy such as residential construction and state and local  government  Recent data show that the national economy continues to perform well, with robust  output growth accompanied by low inflation Traditional models still predict that the economy  will grow at around a 2 percent rate next year, with the slowing based on factors such as high  stocks of real assets, the dollar's appreciation over the last year, and the relatively high level of  real interest rates The latter have been nudged up a little by recent declines in expected  inflation I agree that the turmoil in East Asia may contribute a bit to the growth slowdown, but I  think the contribution is unlikely to be large However, I believe there is plenty of room for  skepticism about whether a slowdown as big as that predicted by traditional models will occur,  especially when one takes into account the inability of these models to predict the robust  performance of the economy over the past year and a half It is possible that we are experiencing  the effects of a positive supply shock, which means that the uncertainty extends to predicting  inflation as well The recent moderation in inflation certainly is consistent with a positive supply    11/12/97 47  shock, and some market-based indicators provide room for optimism For example, the rate  spread between nominal and inflation-indexed bonds has now fallen below 2-1/2 percentage  points; we talked about that a little earlier But I believe recent data provide reason for concern  as well For instance, the unemployment rate has fallen even further below most estimates of the  natural rate This leads me to expect higher inflation, and both ECI and hourly earnings data  show that wages are beginning to move up somewhat In balancing these considerations, I  would expect the core CPI to rise about 2-1/2 percent in 1998 compared to about 2-1/4 percent  this year Thank you   Mr Chairman, some indicators show that the economy is experiencing  a positive supply shock For instance, despite the robust growth in real GDP, nominal GDP  growth since early 1996 has not been that much higher than its average since the end of the last  recession At the same time, other indicators such as the unemployment rate suggest that we  have overshot potential and risk a sustained increase in inflation I believe one way to balance    11/12/97 100  these conflicting signals is to look at the recommendation from a policy rule that takes into  account both risks in inflation and output behavior Our version of the estimated Taylor Rule  suggests that tightening policy by roughly 50 basis points by next quarter would be appropriate  Ordinarily, this would make me vote for an increase in rates as a form of insurance against rising  inflation, and it is very tempting to take that position today However, given the recent  instability in financial markets, I would be willing to wait a while before raising interest rates  Consequently, I support alternative "B" with asymmetry   A question about Yamaichi It was closed on the 23rd of November,  and I guess they ceased being a primary dealer on December 4th Could you talk a little about  what our financial relationships with them were just before the 23rd and then between the 23rd  and the 4th?   Yes   Ted, I have a question about China and Hong Kong In early 1994,  China abolished its official foreign exchange rate, and I guess that produced a depreciation of  about 40 percent in their currency That obviously had an adverse impact on the relative  competitive position of Southeast Asian countries The real appreciation of the Southeast Asian  and Chinese currencies since early 1994 and the problems in their banking systems led last  summer to depreciation of their currencies and related capital outflows We now have China's  relative position very adversely affected by foreign exchange developments What adjustment is  likely to occur in China and Hong Kong? China's currency is not convertible but I guess there  could be capital flight out of Hong Kong In fact, we could get a depreciation of both currencies  It seems to me there is the possibility of a rather significant adjustment in these areas, and we do  not seem to be focusing on that   It seems to me that, without getting into specific probabilities, if one  were constructing another worse case, Brazil would be an interesting dimension to add to it   Okay, thank you   Mr Chairman, the pace of economic growth in the Twelfth Federal  Reserve District remained solid in recent months, although down slightly from its trend during  the first half of the year Despite the slowdown, economic activity is expanding more rapidly in  most District states than in the nation as a whole Employment growth in the District continues  to outpace growth in the labor force, pushing unemployment rates down and creating very tight  labor markets, particularly in urban areas The District-wide unemployment rate fell nearly 1  percentage point over the last twelve months  The generally positive outlook in the District is tempered by reports of tight labor  markets, shipping bottlenecks, and recent problems in East Asia In several areas in the District,    12/16/97 24  competition for employees has become so fierce that employers reportedly are converting  temporary part-time jobs to permanent full-time jobs in an effort to attract workers Shipping  bottlenecks associated with the Union Pacific rail scheduling problems reportedly have caused  delays in deliveries of both final and intermediate goods, with the most affected sector  apparently being agriculture  Initial reports from District states indicate that recent developments in East Asia have  reduced the demand for exports of some commodities, primarily raw and processed agricultural  goods and lumber and wood products At this early stage, other vulnerable industries such as  high-tech equipment reportedly have not been greatly affected, although we recently heard that  Microsoft is talking about some weakness as a result of problems in Asia Data on merchandise  exports indicate that in percentage terms the Twelfth District exports about twice as much of its  estimated gross product to East Asia as does the United States as a whole Thus, the effects of  recent developments in East Asia on economic growth likely will be larger in the Twelfth  District than in the nation  Turning to the national economy, the data certainly indicate that real GDP growth  remains robust in the current quarter and that inflation continues subdued But traditional macro  models strongly suggest that growth will slow next year We expect real GDP growth of just  above 2 percent in 1998 Our pure model forecast actually showed a more pronounced  slowdown than this, but we boosted it a bit to reflect the effect of a possible favorable  productivity shock Just to mention very briefly a couple of the factors behind the projected  slowdown First, the dollar's appreciation over the last year and the projected slowing in foreign  demand in 1998 certainly should reduce demand for US products Of course, both of these    12/16/97 25  factors are being reinforced by recent developments in Asia In addition, real short-term interest  rates appear to have been nudged up by recent declines in expected inflation I must add,  however, that there is plenty of room for skepticism about whether a slowdown this big will  actually occur next year Traditional models have been incorrectly predicting slower growth for  the past year and a half As I mentioned, it is quite possible that economic activity is being  boosted to some extent by a positive productivity shock, but it is certainly too soon to tell how  much of an effect this factor may be having or how long it may last  With regard to inflation, we have reduced our forecast since the November meeting  Certainly, the continued appreciation of the dollar will help to hold down prices Secondly, the  results of the last Philadelphia Fed survey of inflation expectations were impressive The sizable  drop in long-term expectations provides an important confirmation of the evidence that we have  seen from the inflation-indexed Treasury bond market And third, recent productivity data have  been encouraging, and it may be reasonable to build in a modest reduction in future inflation  from faster productivity gains There is, of course, one major factor that goes in the opposite  direction The unemployment rate has continued to fall and is now well below the natural rate  Given all these considerations, we expect that price inflation will hold steady in 1998  and 1999 at about this year's rate At our last meeting, it seemed more likely that there would  be some upward tilt to inflation I must add, however, that the risk to this forecast may be  skewed to the upside If economic activity does not slow as much as we expect, labor markets  could tighten further and add upward pressure on inflation Thank you   Mr Chairman, in view of the situation in Asia, I certainly would  recommend against a change in rates at the present time So, I would support alternative B I  have a slight preference at this point for asymmetry because I do not think the distribution of  likely outcomes with regard to inflation is unbiased In my view, it is biased toward higher  inflation, but in the short run--at least in the very short run--it may be less biased than it was in  the past Therefore, I would not object to symmetry   Mike, I have two questions that are somewhat related The Greenbook  stresses that labor markets are very tight and that the tightness could lead to increases in real  compensation But increases in real wages in the Greenbook forecast actually decline in 1999  For example, the ECI decelerates by 5 percentage point relative to the CPI In fact, real wage  inflation may even be going down more than that if one believes that wage earners bargain in  terms of what they see on Main Street rather than what they read in the newspaper about the CPI,  which, of course, is affected by the technical adjustments Could you comment on why real  wages are decelerating in the forecast where you have the economy operating at such a high level  and with such little slack?    3/31/98   Related to a point that you made in your comments about the anecdotal  data pertaining to inflation and how they might be at variance with some of the published  statistics, might that be related to the fact that the anecdotal data reflect what people see? The  CPI certainly includes the effect of technical adjustments Might this discrepancy actually  increase over time because, as you show in the Greenbook, the technical adjustment to the core  CPI is probably going to be on the order of 6 percent in 1999? Of course, people do not see  that; they only read about it   They never see it except when they read about it   Thank you   Mr Chairman, Twelfth District economic growth accelerated in 1997,  led by a surging California economy We believe that the District economy entered 1998 with  considerable momentum Recently revised figures show that growth in California payroll  employment jumped to 38 percent in 1997, about a percentage point greater than in 1996 and  also a percentage point greater than the increase for the nation as a whole The pickup occurred  in most major sectors, but not surprisingly it was largest in the construction industry where  employment grew by over 11 percent Furthermore, we see that all areas of the State of  California shared in that surge The most pronounced acceleration occurred in Southern  California, led by San Diego and several counties that surround Los Angeles County Although  demographic factors held growth in Los Angeles below that of the rest of the state, the Los  Angeles economy did pick up substantially in 1997 Employment grew at a solid rate,  unemployment declined by nearly 1-1/2 percentage points, and the housing market improved  considerably  For the state as a whole in 1998, a weather-related pause in January employment  growth was followed by strong expansion in February, suggesting that California remains on or  close to the path that we saw in 1997 As the California economy continues to heat up, there are  signs of a shift in economic activity away from other states in the District Employment and  construction indicators generally showed that Nevada, Arizona, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and  Idaho all expanded less rapidly in 1997 than they did in 1996 Despite the gradual cooling trend  outside of California, the District as a whole remains on a stellar growth path    3/31/98  One development that we are watching carefully is the impact of conditions in  Southeast Asia, which certainly are having a moderating effect on District export sales of various  agricultural and manufactured products But the net impact on employment growth in our region  is quite limited to date  At the national level, the economy has once again shown surprising strength Indeed,  our monthly indicators model projects first-quarter real GDP growth well above the Greenbook  estimate It is in the low 4 percent range Some of this strength may be transitory, perhaps a  result of unusually warm weather If that turns out to be the case, then the robust expansion in  the first quarter may have little implication for the longer-run outlook because it may be the  result of some borrowing from the second quarter However, we think it is more likely that the  considerable momentum of the first quarter will carry forward The latest gains in disposable  income, which should support further purchases by households, are particularly impressive in  this regard Thus, at the current funds rate and even taking into account the fallout from East  Asia and a slowdown in inventory investment, we see real GDP growth remaining near potential  throughout the remaining quarters of 1998 Given our outlook for real growth, there is little  question that labor markets will remain very tight this year There is already significant upward  pressure on wages and salaries, and we see annual compensation growth increasing several  tenths this year and again next year However, as all of us have noted, the outlook for prices is  considerably more favorable than that for wages With falling import prices, lower prices for oil  and other commodities, as well as recent productivity enhancements and additions to capacity,  core price inflation probably should come in at a rate of around 2 percent This would certainly  represent further modest progress toward our objective of price stability    3/31/98  Looking beyond this year, it is uncertain in my view whether the special factors  moderating inflation will endure and whether our recent progress toward price stability can be  maintained Thank you   Mr Chairman, I certainly support your recommendation of no change  at the present time and I very enthusiastically support the move to asymmetry It seems to me  that the discussion strongly supports such a move    3131/98  I have a question It relates to my recollection that when we talked about how we  were going to handle the public announcement of a no-change decision, we discussed the  possibility of making a statement to accompany such an announcement If one thinks that  economic developments are moving in a direction where it is likely that a change in policy would  occur--say, at the next meeting--and given that you have stressed the importance of laying a  foundation for a policy change, the adoption of asymmetry clearly could lay a foundation But  under our current procedures the asymmetry is announced two days after the next meeting, so the  public is not put on notice on a timely basis I wonder if there is some virtue to making a  statement in our announcement about the strength of the economy   Mr Chairman, I can appreciate the viewpoint that Bill McDonough  expressed, and I can understand that there may be opportunities for you to lay that foundation It  is obvious that if we do not change our current procedure, then going to asymmetry does not  accomplish what we want Asymmetry would serve to alert the public only if a decision to  change our policy were delayed beyond the next meeting   I have two questions about your forecast, one about your new estimate  of the trend growth of productivity and the other about the outlook for inventories Could you say  something about the educational and job experience composition data that were referred to in  Monday's briefing by the Board staff and also in the Greenbook? The evidence must be    5/19/98  compelling because it seems to be the basis for your revision in the trend growth in productivity or  at least in the assumption that it is now 1/4 percentage point faster   On the inventory forecast, I think a distinguishing characteristic of the  Greenbook forecast, certainly for the current quarter and the following two quarters, is what  happens to inventories Given the expectation for the second quarter, shouldn't we be seeing more  signs of the projected deceleration at this point in terms of surveys, inventory-to-sales ratios, and so  forth? We are slightly beyond the middle of May, and the kind of runoff that is part of that forecast  is, I would use the word, "huge"   Thank you   Mr Chairman, economic activity has remained strong in the Twelfth  District in recent months We have seen particularly strong job growth in Arizona and Utah where  the rate of expansion has reached 4 percent Job growth in Washington State is running above 3  percent, and the local unemployment rate is falling rapidly With a tight Seattle area labor market,  Boeing aircraft recently announced a decision to shift some if its production to southern California  But the supply of available workers in southern California is dwindling too The Los Angeles area  unemployment rate has fallen almost a full percentage point over the past year to 5-1/2 percent  For California as a whole, employment growth remained solid in the first quarter of 1998, although  not quite as robust as it was in 1997 Growth was boosted by sectors such as construction that are  benefiting from low, longer-term interest rates  We do see some slowing in some manufacturing industries in California and other  District states, with exports diminishing and import competition from Asia picking up The volume  of cargo through the District's six major seaports--and of course two of those, Los Angeles and    5/19/98  Long Beach, are huge--showed a large rise in imports and a drop in exports in the first quarter  Employment in District computer and electronics industries has been weak in recent months and  additional job cutbacks have been announced In many cases, the high-tech firms that are cutting  back have lost market share to other domestic firms and are now making competitive adjustments  to cut costs I'm sure you've seen the list of these companies National Semiconductor, Silicon  Graphics, Syntax, Netscape, Apple, etc The adjustments have proceeded quite quickly, so it is  possible that this recent period of intense, competitive adjustments among domestic firms may be  nearly complete Even with these pressures restraining manufacturing employment in our region,  the overall District manufacturing sector still managed to add jobs at about a 2 percent rate in  recent months  In the national economy, the continued combination of strong economic growth and  low inflation in the first-quarter GDP report made it more likely that economic events are being  driven by favorable aggregate supply conditions Based on that experience, I am leery about  predicting even a modest slowdown in economic activity in the immediate future However, some  slowdown does seem to be the most plausible outcome We show real GDP growth of around 2-3/4  percent in the current quarter and also in the second half of this year The economy appears to be  experiencing modest contractionary effects stemming from the problems in East Asia In addition,  employment growth in March and April taken together recently provides a bit of evidence of a  slowdown  With regard to inflation, tight labor market conditions certainly represent the main  risk of inflation problems ahead The large recent drop in the unemployment rate has intensified  this risk a bit even though the rate may bounce back somewhat in coming months Fortunately, a  number of other factors have been holding inflation down including, as we know, ample    5/19/98  manufacturing capacity, some increase in productivity over the past year, a higher dollar, lower oil  prices, and diminished inflation expectations In light of these considerations, our forecast shows  core CPI inflation holding steady at just over 2 percent this year and next However, even if there  has been a positive supply shock, I doubt that recent economic growth rates are sustainable I  remain concerned that if real GDP growth does not slow soon, the effects of tight labor markets  will begin to show through to price inflation Thank you   Mr Chairman, I think there are good reasons that one could cite to  justify raising rates today However, for goods prices at least, a number of factors are offsetting  labor market pressures In addition, I think the recent declines that we have seen in inflation    5/19/98  expectations have raised the real funds rate to what appears to be a moderately high level In light  of that, it may make sense to wait a while longer before deciding to raise the funds rate I assume  that a "no change" decision would include an asymmetric directive Thank you   Mr Chairman, I have two questions Ted, when I went to Asia in June  one of the comments that I heard, particularly in Korea, was that a lot of exporters were facing  tremendous difficulties in getting financing to support their businesses More recently, there have  been discussions about a shortage of shipping containers and the need actually to build them in  Asia The reason I guess is that most of the containers are in the United States at this point Do    8/18/98  you think these developments are major factors affecting Asian exports to the United States? If  these two problems were to be dealt with, would that lead to a significant increase in our imports  from Asia?   Thank you Mike, I thought the staff survey on recent trends in  compensation practices produced some interesting results, as did the related discussion of the  ECI One thing that struck me is that variable compensation practices clearly have become much    8/18/98  more significant for many firms in different industries In the past, at least when we had an  economic slowdown, sticky wages were an important automatic stabilizer Have you done any  analysis that can give us some insight into how the more flexible compensation practices will in  fact affect total compensation when the US economy goes into a slowdown and what the effects  on spending might be? I ask because it appears that we will be facing a different situation from  what we have experienced in the past   There certainly are a lot of studies that suggest that the marginal  propensity to consume would be lower if variable incomes were expected to regress to Friedman's  original permanent income levels   Thank you   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy expanded at a strong pace  during the first half of 1998 Payroll employment grew by 29 percent at an annual rate,  noticeably above the pace of growth in the rest of the United States Among District states,  growth has been most rapid in Arizona, Nevada, and Washington during recent months Vigorous  construction and real estate market activity has helped to maintain the District's expansion  Construction jobs have grown at a sizzling pace in California and Nevada this year, and  construction activity remains at high levels in most parts of the District Although District growth  has outpaced the nation's this year, it has been slower than in 1997 Oregon, Utah, and Idaho  have cooled the most, and employment was flat or down slightly in the second quarter in those  states Employment growth also is moderating in California this year Among sectors, slower  growth has been most evident in durables manufacturing  This slowing is consistent with what might be expected from the restraining effects of  the East Asian financial and economic problems Data for the first five months of 1998 compared  with the same period in 1997 show that growth in total District exports has fallen essentially to  zero following substantial growth in previous years This slowdown appears to be almost entirely  attributable to East Asia For example, in the first quarter of this year, California's exports to key  East Asian countries were down about 13 percent compared to a year earlier Exports have  slowed substantially throughout the District, and Hawaii's struggling economy has been hit hard  by additional losses in their Asian tourist business this year Although these effects may grow as  the year progresses, the problems in East Asia have not derailed the District's expansion so far    8/18/98  Turning to the nation, it remains to be seen whether the long awaited slowdown will be  sustained during the second half because a good deal of the slowdown was due to temporary  factors Despite these doubts, I think that the most likely outcome is moderate growth of around 2  percent through the end of next year, with activity being restrained by problems in East Asian  economies, the high dollar, restrictive fiscal policy, and relatively high real short-term interest  rates The recent drop in our stock market adds another potentially moderating factor  The news on inflation certainly continues to be outstanding The GDP price index  came in under 1 percent for the second straight quarter and, as we all know, inflation as measured  by that index has averaged only 1 percent over the past year In our Bank forecast, the  unemployment rate does not quite reach 5 percent by the end of 1999 This low rate perpetuates  the acceleration in the ECI that we have seen over the past year However, I expect this pressure  on price inflation to be offset by diminished inflation expectations, the higher value of the dollar,  ample industrial capacity, falling commodity prices, and somewhat higher trend productivity  growth As a consequence, our forecast shows CPI inflation staying between 2 and 2-1/4 percent for  the remainder of this year and next Thank you   Mr Chairman, I also support your recommendation for "B" I agree that  the risks are greater than they were at the time of our previous meeting, and I think there has been  some shift toward the downside So, I would favor moving toward symmetry I would suggest,  though, that it is a little unfortunate that we will be releasing information on Thursday that is not  going to be consistent with this proposal I hope that we will be coming back to the discussion on  disclosure with Don Kohn at a later point   I know   I basically support what the three Presidents who preceded me said  about making a prompt announcement, and I would release the operational paragraph when we  change the tilt I have to say that I find the language in Option 2 relating to the tilt to be  somewhat preferable to that in Option 1, though both certainly are better than what we have    9/29/98  today Option 2, it seems to me, captures the essential element of asymmetry in that it refers to  the likelihood that we will move policy in one direction rather than the other, and I think that is  highly desirable What I like about Option 1 is the reference to the long-run goals So, some  combination of Options 1 and 2 would be my preference   I have a question for Peter Fisher or Don Kohn on a somewhat  different issue The spread between 10-year Treasury bonds and the inflation-indexed bond has  narrowed very significantly I think it has narrowed to a little over 1 percent That is amazing  when we consider that the spread presumably includes the effects of expected inflation and  inflation risk Is that due to a lack of liquidity in the inflation-indexed bond, and if it is, why  hasn't the market been selling the 10-year issue and buying the indexed bond in an effort to  reestablish a more sensible relationship?   That was my question!   When can we do that? After the end of the meeting? [Laughter]   Did this program produce a default of any loan?   Then how can the investments be a part of DPC [debt previously  contracted], Virgil?   I have two questions Ted, it seems to me that our international  assumptions are now fairly close to the worse case scenario that was presented to us last year in  terms of the real impact on the economy Would it make sense to think in terms of a worse case  again, and what would be its probability? Do you have any thoughts about where the risks are in  terms of such a forecast?   Sure   I have a question for Dave Stockton The assumption in the forecast is  that the saving rate remains basically constant at one half percent That seems a little surprising  given what happens to the equity market and particularly with the coefficient that you have in  terms of net worth I presume that what is happening is that the weakness in the equity market is  being offset by such things as lower interest rates, which stimulate consumption Would you  say that your forecast that the saving rate will not be moving up as a result of the assumed  decline in the stock market might be a downside risk to the outlook?   I see   Thank you   Mr Chairman, solid overall economic growth continued in the Twelfth  District in recent months, although the pace slowed from earlier in the year Between June and  August, District payrolls expanded by 23 percent at an annual rate, down from the 3 percent  pace of the first half of the year Construction and services as well as finance, insurance, and    9/29/98  real estate continued to grow rapidly in recent months However, the District's manufacturing  sector has not fared as well Reduced export demand and a more general slowdown in high-tech  manufacturing have led to a significant weakening overall in manufacturing District  manufacturing employment has contracted slightly so far this year after rising 37 percent in  1997 The deceleration in manufacturing has been concentrated in California, with  manufacturing employment falling 1/2 percent so far this year While many sectors of  California's manufacturing have slowed in 1998, producers of high-tech products have been  particularly hard hit However, employment growth in high-tech software and business services  remains strong  Turning to the nation, the outlook for economic activity has deteriorated since we met  in August largely because of a continued decline in our stock market and a worsening outlook for  growth in the rest of the world Under the assumptions of an unchanged federal funds rate and  no further change in the stock market, we have lowered our forecast for real GDP growth for the  remainder of this year and 1999 by 1/2 percentage point to only 1-1/2 percent I actually see risks  on both sides of this forecast On the upside, the economy has consistently outperformed most  forecasts for the past three years On the downside, of course, the stock market is still  overvalued according to most models In addition, it is possible that the expected economic  performance of the rest of the world could be even worse than we all have been forecasting and,  of course, we cannot rule out future shocks in financial markets Real GDP growth in the  neighborhood of our forecast, we believe, would help to ease tight labor markets, and this would  reduce the risk of higher inflation in the future Under our forecast, upward pressures from labor  markets would moderate over the next couple of years Moreover, any pressures from this  source most likely would be offset by diminished inflation expectations, the higher dollar, ample  industrial capacity, falling commodity prices, somewhat higher trend productivity growth, and    9/29/98  negative speed effects as the economy slows As a consequence, our forecast shows inflation as  measured by the core CPI falling from 2-1/4 percent this year to about 2 percent in 1999, and then  going below 2 percent in 2000 Overall, since we met in August the risks of higher inflation  have receded, while the downside risks for the real economy have increased noticeably   Mr Chairman, I support a 1/4 point reduction in the funds rate I also  think the current situation may require more than one 25 basis point cut in the funds rate in the  future, and therefore I would prefer a directive with asymmetry toward ease   Mr Chairman, I prefer Option 2, and I would like to remove that third  sentence because I, too, believe it is redundant It seems to me, though, that both Options 2 and  3 are a tremendous improvement over the wording we have been using in recent years   Mr Chairman, I forgot to note that if we do eliminate that sentence,  there is in my view an advantage to referring to "the federal funds rate operating objective"  instead of just to the "federal funds rate" The former is really what we deal with   Karen, I think it was a little more than a year ago that we looked at a  worse case alternative for East Asia One of the two countries that played a role in that was  Brazil, and it is obvious from our discussion why that was the case The other one, of course,  was China It seems to me that there are interesting things going on in China about which it  might be worthwhile to update the Committee either at our next meeting or even as part of one of  the Monday morning briefings China's growth rate, at 8 percent at least by the official statistics,  is remarkably good Their external position is quite strong Yet at the same time, one does see  some financial problems with the ITICs in some of the provinces Of course, they are  experiencing actual deflation, which might suggest that the renminbi is overvalued I would find  it interesting, and perhaps some of my colleagues would as well, to know what your latest    11/17/98  thoughts are about either why they have been so successful in dealing with the problems of East  Asia or whether we, in looking at the official statistics, are being deluded by what might indeed  be the pressures in China   Of course, their approach to the problems is quite different with  exchange controls and so forth   Thank you   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy has expanded at a solid  pace in recent months, although the disparity across states has increased and the pace of growth  has moderated from earlier this year Employment growth in our fastest growing states, Arizona,  Nevada, and Washington, is averaging between 3 and 5 percent on a 12-month basis It is  interesting that the State of Washington is also the state that probably is among the most  vulnerable to developments in East Asia in terms of trade Five other District states, Alaska,  Idaho, Hawaii, Oregon, and Utah, are expanding at or below the national pace of growth In  California, employment growth remains solid at 28 percent, although it is significantly slower  than the 38 percent pace of expansion in 1997  Construction and services as well as finance, insurance, and real estate have continued  to be the strongest sectors of the District economy Slower overall growth has yet to loosen    11/17/98  District labor markets significantly District unemployment in September was just 01  percentage point above the average for 1997  Returning to California, the East Asian economic slowdown has reduced employment  growth throughout the state, but its impact has varied significantly across regions Strong trade  ties to East Asia, especially in the high-tech manufacturing area, have pushed employment  growth in the San Francisco Bay area below that for the state as a whole for the first time in three  years In contrast, the more diversified southern California economy has remained relatively  immune to global economic turmoil, with little deceleration in growth from last year The  changing pattern of growth in California is helping to equalize the levels of economic activity in  the Bay Area and Southern California following the deep recession and slow recovery in the Los  Angeles/Long Beach Area  Turning to the nation, we believe the outlook for economic activity has improved  since the Committee met in September largely because of the easing of monetary policy, the  decline in the value of the dollar, and increases in US stock prices Under the assumptions of  an unchanged federal funds rate and no further changes in the stock market or the dollar, we have  raised our forecast of real GDP for 1999 by about 1/2 percent to 2 percent I see risks on both  sides of this forecast On the upside, growth in the economy has outperformed most forecasts for  the past three years, and this certainly could continue On the downside, the stock market is still  overvalued according to most models, and although US debt markets have stabilized somewhat  in recent weeks, risk spreads are still elevated, and confidence remains vulnerable There  obviously are still many risks in the international arena as well  Under our forecast, there is continuing upward pressure from tight labor markets on  wage and price inflation next year, although the magnitude of this effect diminishes over time as    11/17/98  the unemployment rate rises However, price inflation continues to benefit from low inflation  expectations, ample industrial capacity, falling commodity prices, higher trend growth in  productivity, and negative speed effects as the economy slows As a consequence, we expect  inflation in the core CPI to average 2-1/4 percent both this year and next, and that is using a  consistent definition for the CPI Overall, if we assume an unchanged monetary policy, our  projections show a constructive outlook for the economy with moderate real GDP growth and  moderate inflation as well Thank you   Mr Chairman, I would prefer to leave the funds rate unchanged at the  present time for a couple of reasons First, despite the forecast to the contrary, the economy  continued to show some strength in the third quarter, and the few available monthly data that we  have for the current quarter indicate solid growth Second, I believe that the chance of a  recession or major slowdown in the economy in the quarters ahead has been significantly  reduced by recent financial developments, including the two federal funds rate cuts I recognize  that prospects for our economy could change rather suddenly given the continuing vulnerability  of our financial markets and of many foreign economies While this could require another    11/17/98  change in policy in the near future, I would prefer to retain the 5 percent funds rate for now along  with the asymmetry toward easing   Mr Chairman, I think the compromise proposal you have made makes  some sense To me it is a move in the right direction As I'm sure you will recall, I have  indicated in the past that I would like to see the directive included in the statement released  immediately after each meeting But there is no question that if we do that, we cannot go back if  we find that we are not comfortable with that in practice So to me at least, this is a step in a  direction that I think many of us wish to go As you indicated, if it looks as though we might  want to go even further, we will have that alternative available at a later point So I view this as  a reasonable compromise and one that I certainly can live with   Mr Chairman, I have a comment and a question First the comment  Karen, I would like to thank you for the memo on China that was done by John Fernald It was  very responsive to the questions I raised at the last meeting and also provided a lot of good  information It explained why China has performed better over this period, particularly since  July of 1997 If any of my colleagues have not had an opportunity to read the memo, I would  highly recommend it  Second, in Part II of the Greenbook there was reference to an attempt by Boeing to  make a lot of deliveries in the month of December My recollection from the past has been that  at times that has had impacts both on production and certainly on the composition of GDP,  particularly if a lot of those deliveries were to foreign buyers Can you tell me what some of the  effects of that are likely to be and if they are included in the fourth-quarter numbers?    12/22/98   So they end up in inventory?   Right   They are one of the few companies where a change in their sales can  show up in the GDP numbers   Thank you   Mr Chairman, economic activity in the Twelfth District has expanded  at a solid pace in recent months, and our business contacts are less downbeat concerning growth  prospects than they were during the summer and early fall Total payroll employment has grown  by 26 percent at an annual rate since midyear, above the 2 percent rate of growth in the rest of  the country California's expansion remains on track, and growth in the San Francisco Bay area  picked up recently after slowing earlier in the year Growth is rapid in several other states, with  Nevada and Arizona ranked first and third in the national employment growth ranking  Construction activity in the District has been robust Construction employment has  grown rapidly all year, largely due to strong demand for new homes Although nonresidential  construction plans have fallen a bit in the District this year, conditions in commercial real estate    12/22/98 22  markets remain healthy, with low office vacancy rates in most areas of the District and only  limited effects of the year's turmoil in the market for commercial real estate finance  The ongoing slowdown in manufacturing is the weak spot in the District economy  After earlier gains that far outstripped the national pace, employment in District manufacturing  has fallen since the first quarter The role of East Asia has been critical For example, the  declines in California's exports to East Asia have worsened as the year has progressed Relative  to the same periods a year ago, California exports to East Asia in 1998 fell 127 percent in the  first quarter, 175 percent in the first half, and 206 percent in the first nine months Moreover,  the employment situation at Boeing has exerted a moderating influence on the Washington State  economy This restraint will become more pronounced as Boeing implements a 20 percent cut in  its workforce during the next two years The impact on Boeing and its suppliers in the Los  Angeles area already is evident in the loss of nearly 1,500 aircraft manufacturing jobs so far this  year  On the national front, just three months ago it appeared that the chance of a US  recession, or at least a major slowdown, was uncomfortably high This prospect, in my view,  had shrunk noticeably by our November meeting and has fallen further since then Although the  economy faces substantial risks, the most likely outcome over the next year appears favorable  Recent data on economic activity in the third and fourth quarters have continued to follow the  pattern of surprisingly strong output growth and low inflation that we've seen for about three  years  In addition to this factor, the outlook has improved since November because of our  most recent funds rate cut, the better-than-expected economic performance in the rest of the  world in the second half of this year, and the rebound in the stock market Our forecast for real    12/22/98 23  GDP growth in 1999 has been revised up by 3/4 percentage point to 2-3/4 percent under the  assumption of no further change in either the funds rate or the US stock market We expect  inflation to hold steady next year despite upward pressure from tight labor markets The familiar  list of favorable inflation factors seems likely to apply robust productivity growth, ample  industrial capacity, low commodity prices, and subdued inflation expectations Overall, we  expect inflation in the core CPI to come in at around 2-1/4 percent in 1999  Although the most likely outcome for the economy next year appears favorable, the  risks are large The potential problems stemming from fragility in many Asian and Latin  American economies as well as in international and domestic financial markets are obvious But  on the other side, the pattern of positive surprises in our economy could continue, especially in  light of the very rapid growth in money and credit this year Thank you   Mr Chairman, I believe our easing of policy and the associated stock  market rebound have significantly reduced the chance of recession or a major slowdown over the  next year or so, and for now I think we should leave the funds rate at 4-3/4 percent Although I  believe the upside risks to growth, at least in terms of the rate of growth forecast in the  Greenbook, are greater than those to the downside, I can support a symmetric directive for this  meeting Do you want comments on the options?   Okay That's all I have for now   In option 3 I would take out "in coming months" for the same reason  that President Moskow indicated I also have a preference for removing the last sentence   Mike, I have a question about real wages With the forecast   that you have for the ECI and the core CPI, real wages are up about 1¼ percent in 1999   and about 1 percent in the year 2000 I know that represents a continuation of the pattern   that seems to have existed at least since 1992 in terms of the Greenbook numbers But it   seems perplexing given the fact that you have productivity, one assumes, growing at an   average rate of 19 percent and also very tight labor market conditions In such a case   one would normally expect the growth rate of real wages to be in excess of 2 percent Do   you have any ideas about what is happening and how realistic that forecast might be for   the next two years?    Mr Chairman, the pace of economic activity in the Twelfth   District has been solid in recent months and only a little slower than last year’s rapid   pace In the State of Washington, the overall job count recently increased at about a 1½   percent annual rate despite the beginning of large cutbacks in the aerospace sector   Arizona also has been able to shrug off cutbacks by major manufacturers Despite job   losses in the Phoenix area, the local unemployment rate is still below 3 percent In   California the economy also is strong outside of manufacturing A pickup in state   population is boosting activity in retail trade and the housing-related sectors such as   construction and real estate And state tax authorities report strong receipts from sales   taxes and personal income withholding in early 1999 Initial claims for unemployment   insurance have remained low in California With a relatively low rate of layoffs and   continued strength in hiring, the state unemployment rate drifted down further in the last   few months Tightness in the labor and housing markets is particularly evident in the San   Francisco Bay area, where the unemployment rate has remained below 3½ percent and   housing prices have jumped 15 percent in the past year   Turning to the national economy, developments since our last meeting have   not caused us to change the tenor of our outlook for this year We continue to think that     3/30/99 25   the most likely outcome is a slowdown in real GDP growth to around 2¾ to 3 percent,   with inflation in the GDP price index of 1 to 1½ percent The slowdown of the economy   in our forecast results in part from the waning effects of past increases in stock market   wealth I felt more confident about that assumption when we ran the model than I did   when I was putting this report together last evening after yesterday’s stock market rise!   While this appears to be a reasonable forecast, there are large uncertainties   The economy has defied expectations of a slowdown for several years, and I am more   convinced that we are seeing the effects of a favorable supply shock, perhaps related to   technological developments, that is not being picked up by standard models I believe   that recent data have reinforced this view I am referring to the evidence for the fourth   quarter of even more rapid real GDP and productivity growth and very low inflation, as   well as indications for the current quarter of very low CPI inflation in combination with   moderately strong growth I would not be at all surprised if this year’s growth once again   exceeded our forecast   On the other hand, we can’t ignore other possible developments that could   undermine economic activity this year For example, growth could be seriously reduced   if some shock were to undermine the US equity market However, neither of these   uncertainties, from a positive supply shock or a negative financial shock, would seem to   pose a great threat to inflation in 1999 Prospects for inflation next year, however, are   more uncertain and, I believe, more troubling Thank you    Mr Chairman, I basically agree with your recommendation I   am somewhat more inclined to favor the adoption of an asymmetric directive to the   upside But, quite frankly, there does not seem to be much risk in waiting to see how   events unfold between now and the next meeting    Don, are banks executing all-asset pledges?  Isn’t that a way to--   We have done that in the past     5/18/99 9    But there is a problem with the Federal Home Loan Banks    Mike, I have two questions, and the first one is on productivity as   well Estimates of the productivity trend seem to have been revised quite frequently in   the last few years To me, this suggests greater uncertainty about the productivity   forecast Wouldn’t you have to conclude that the uncertainties associated with our   forecast of real output and inflation must be greater given the uncertainties that are   associated with the productivity forecast?    The second question relates to the fact that the Y2K effect in the   Greenbook forecast appears quite large Compared with the consensus of Blue Chip   forecasters, for example, it is considerably larger  Do you want to comment a little on   what your thought process was?    Thank you    Mr Chairman, economic growth in the Twelfth District has   shown some signs of moderation, but it is still rapid In Nevada and Arizona, the pace of   job growth has slowed somewhat from last year’s very fast pace, but these states still rank   first and third in terms of employment growth over the past twelve months In the Pacific     5/18/99 28   Northwest, employment growth picked up in Oregon but cutbacks in aerospace   manufacturing jobs held down such growth in the state of Washington California’s   relatively rapid pace of job growth also moderated a bit in recent months as a contraction   of the state’s manufacturing payrolls partly offset employment gains in other sectors   Overall, California employment has grown at roughly a 2 percent rate so far this year,   which is down about 1 percentage point from last year’s pace Even so, California’s   unemployment rate of 56 percent is down significantly since the end of last year   Turning to the national scene, obviously the data have revealed a stronger- than-  expected economy once again, causing us to revise our real GDP forecast upward The   contour of the forecast has not changed very much, however We still expect the   economy to slow, only now the phrase “slowing economy” means a growth rate of about   3¼ percent for the remaining quarters of the year The GDP price index is projected to   grow at a rate of about 1 to 1½ percent over the same period However, recent forecast   errors suggest that there is considerable uncertainty associated with this outlook We are   all well aware that real output has consistently grown faster than predicted in recent   years And if we had somehow known how fast the economy would grow over this   period, we would have overpredicted inflation even more than we actually did It seems   clear that we are experiencing a positive supply shock but one whose magnitude and   duration are hard to determine The existence of a supply shock makes it hard to judge   inflationary risk by looking at real output growth, since such shocks tend to change the   output/inflation mix in the economy   A reasonable response to this uncertainty is to follow a strategy that is fairly   robust in the face of such shocks One such strategy would be to pay more attention to   the growth in nominal GDP or spending As supply shocks change output and inflation   growth in opposite directions, they will obviously have a smaller impact on nominal   GDP Keeping an eye on spending would allow us to keep inflation within reasonable   bounds, even if we are unsure about the economy’s potential growth rate Using nominal   GDP in this way--that is, as an indicator--is similar to the way that we actually employed   the monetary aggregates before velocity shifts made them hard to interpret The data   show that nominal GDP growth has averaged close to 5½ percent over the previous three   years This suggests to me that, despite the uncertainties associated with the supply     5/18/99 29   shock, the policy choices made during this period have been appropriate By allowing   growth to come in higher and prices lower than anticipated, we have in effect been   stabilizing nominal GDP to some degree In this light, however, the recent acceleration   in nominal GDP in the past two quarters causes me some concern Thank you    Mr Chairman, since we met in March we have had a number of   conflicting signals about the future course of core inflation Taken as a whole, however, I   believe there are upside risks to inflation, although they may not be sufficient to warrant   an increase in the funds rate at the present time I must admit it would not take much   more evidence of upside risk to convince me to raise the rate So, I would be enthusiastic   in supporting an announced upward tilt to the directive at this time    I have a question about the reserve needs The Treasury balance is   expected to be twice as high as usual at year-end What are the major reasons for that?    I have another question on needs with regard to currency There is no   indication at this point, is there, that the estimates on currency needs are anything different   from what we’ve been assuming?    But I mean the amount that we’ve accumulated is also running far   ahead of normal    Exactly But I was wondering if anything has led us to revise our   estimates on that?    Okay    Mr Chairman, I don’t have any question about the need for these types   of tools But I do have a question--if we can put on our BS&R hat for just a moment--that   relates to us as a central bank If a bank or other financial institution were to engage in these   types of activities, we would be interested in whether or not they had conducted simulations   to ascertain what the impact of these activities was likely to be on that institution Then   we’d expect that to be shared with management and their board of directors, and so forth Is   that a step we should take?  And if so, should that step be taken before we approve this?  In   my experience that is something we think is very important for private institutions It seems   to me that we could have simulations showing extreme events that could have rather   important impacts on the Federal Reserve System and the financial system, and I think it is   something we ought to look at    I’m sure there are differences Does that lead you to conclude that   looking at such simulations is not appropriate?    We seem to be learning a lot    Mike, given the surprisingly strong growth of income, profits, and also   tax receipts in recent years, can we draw any inferences about what we might see with the   October benchmark revision--in particular, what it might imply for real GDP and, of course,   productivity?    Thank you    Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy has expanded at a solid   pace so far this year, although the disparity across states has increased District payrolls   expanded at a 24 percent rate during the first seven months of the year, down from the 31   percent pace of 1998 Employment growth rates in the fastest growing states--Arizona,   California, Nevada and Utah--averaged between 25 and 42 percent  In five other District   states--Alaska, Idaho, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington--employment expanded at or below   the national pace Despite slower overall growth, District labor markets remain tight   Construction and services as well as transportation, communication, and public utilities have   continued to be the strongest sectors of the District’s economy   In contrast, District manufacturing payrolls have declined at a 16 percent pace this   year Employment reductions have occurred in both the durable and nondurable sectors In   the durable sector reductions have been broad-based, although employment has declined   most rapidly in the aircraft and resources-related industries In the state of Washington,   Boeing and its suppliers have cut 11,000 jobs since last December In the nondurable sector   weak demand for agricultural commodities has continued to damp employment growth in   the food-processing industry   During the past few years, prices and profits of agricultural producers in the Twelfth   District have been held down by weak export demand caused by the appreciation of the US   dollar and the economic crisis in Asia District exports of agricultural products fell by   nearly 20 percent between 1997 and 1998, and data for California suggest that agricultural   exports have continued to decline in 1999 As a result, gross sales and net farm income in   the District have fallen However, relative to other areas of the United States, District   agricultural producers are in reasonably good shape since only a small percentage of the   District’s production is in the bulk commodities experiencing the largest price declines   Turning to the national economy, from 1995 to 1998 core price inflation measures,   even on consistently measured bases, generally were trending downward This decline   probably reflected favorable supply shocks that more than outweighed strong demand   However, several special factors helped out as well Since mid-1998 this disinflation has     8/24/99 48   stalled Price inflation and survey expectations of future inflation appear to have flattened   out This halt in the progress toward our goal of price stability sounds a cautionary note in   assessing the current stance of policy This is particularly true given the context of tight   labor markets and our forecast, which predicts strong output growth through the rest of this   year and steady to slightly rising core inflation through next year Such a path does not   continue the gains that we have made toward price stability during the past few years and   may even give up some of those gains   We have examined a variety of risks to this outlook, some of which are similar to the   alternative scenarios in the Greenbook In one alternative not covered in the Greenbook, the   favorable supply conditions of the recent past are assumed to dissipate by lowering   underlying trend productivity growth for the forecast period from 2¼ to 1¼ percent In   2000, real growth slows by ½ percentage point and inflation begins to accelerate I believe   this scenario demonstrates that an unwinding of the positive productivity shock poses a risk   to our recent progress toward price stability Thank you    Mr Chairman, I’m increasingly concerned that aggregate supply may   not keep up with aggregate demand, particularly in light of a probable pickup in foreign   demand If that turns out to be the case, we risk an acceleration in inflation at a time when   I’d personally like to see further progress toward price stability I, too, would prefer to raise   the funds rate ¼ point at this meeting Although we might have to move again this year, I   would prefer a symmetric directive in part because we don’t know how fast aggregate   supply will continue to grow and also because I agree with much of what President Poole   said about the symmetry issue    Karen, the recent Greenbook forecast of real GDP for China indicates   growth of 34 percent in 1999 and 54 percent in the year 2000 Of course, those growth rates are   much below what China had experienced in the previous five years or longer Is that consistent   with a gradual, as opposed to a sharp, decline in the value of the renminbi, continued reform of   state owned enterprises, and further financial modernization?    Thank you    Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District’s expansion has gained momentum since   early in the year Following moderate growth in the first quarter, job growth picked up to a 28   percent rate during the second quarter and that pace was maintained in July and August Economic   activity has been expanding more quickly in California than in the rest of the District This has   helped California attract jobs and residents from other states and has spurred substantial gains in   construction activity Nonetheless, conditions outside of California have remained robust For   example, Nevada’s economy has picked up steam recently with gaming revenues growing at their   fastest pace since 1994   Rapid job growth has tightened District labor markets After remaining roughly constant in   1998, the District unemployment rate has fallen by ½ percentage point so far this year This is due   to improved conditions in California where the August unemployment rate of 51 percent was the   lowest recorded since 1969 Although the unemployment rate remains higher in the Twelfth   District than in the rest of the nation, labor compensation costs have risen more rapidly in the West,   with a strong upward trend evident over the past several years Moreover, tight labor markets have   prompted employers to find alternative methods for attracting and retaining workers These   methods include the provision of on-site benefits that conserve workers’ time and enable them to   spend more hours on the job     10/5/99 21   Despite strength in the economy as a whole, the District’s high-tech and aerospace   manufacturers face significant challenges California’s makers of semiconductors have begun   expanding again, but employment in that industry remains below its peak of early last year   Manufacturers of computer equipment throughout the District have continued to shed jobs in recent   months, with makers of disk drives being especially hard hit Moreover, the recent earthquake in   Taiwan interrupted that country’s extensive semiconductor and computer equipment production   and that has clouded the outlook for prices and the availability of computer components in the fall   and winter In the aerospace sector, Boeing is well on its way to its target of 53,000 job cuts by the   end of 2000, having eliminated about 35,000 since early last year Most of these cuts have been in   Washington State, but the rate of reduction picked up recently in Southern California where Boeing   is phasing out several models of aircraft that it inherited from McDonnell Douglas   In contrast to the computer hardware and aerospace sectors, computer software and service   providers have been expanding employment and output at a torrid pace That has caused total   employment growth in the Seattle area actually to pick up in spite of the cuts at Boeing It also has   kept Silicon Valley’s economy healthy despite job losses in the hardware sector As a result,   housing prices in Silicon Valley rose about 15 percent during the 12 months ending in July   Turning to the national economy, the data made available since we met in August certainly   suggest that the supply shock of recent years has not yet run its course Based on recent monthly   data, we have revised up our estimate of third-quarter real GDP growth from 3½ to 4½ percent,   similar to the projection in the Greenbook This has combined with favorable news on the core CPI   in August, which brought the most recent 12-month increase to just under 2 percent This apparent   supply shock makes forecasting especially treacherous, but our best estimate continues to show a   modest slowdown in the rate of real GDP growth next year Under the assumption of no further   change in the federal funds rate, we now project a 3 percent increase in real GDP in 2000 as   domestic demand slows in response to the recent tightening of monetary policy, combined with an   assumed flattening of the stock market’s trajectory  Growth at this pace would leave labor markets   tight next year and continue to indicate upward price pressures We are showing a 2½ percent   increase in the core CPI next year despite a slowing of GDP growth to just below trend  And with   labor markets projected to be tight through the end of 2000, more upward price pressures would be   forthcoming in 2001   Obviously, there are a number of important risks to this outlook First, the modest drop in   the dollar and a pickup in foreign growth could add significantly to inflationary pressures if they     10/5/99 22   were to gain momentum Second, the recent modest drop in equity prices reminds us that the   economy remains vulnerable to a much larger stock market correction from today’s very high   levels And finally, there is simply no way to determine the size or persistence of the current   supply shock A review of forecast errors in recent years indicates that this shock has consistently   surprised us on the positive side Although we don’t know how long the supply shock will last, I   don’t think there is reason to believe it has ended yet Its continuation, supported by recent data,   reduces the chance of an inflation problem in the foreseeable future Thank you    Mr Chairman, before this meeting I favored “B” but concluded that the time   for raising rates is probably not that far off As a result of the discussion today, I think it’s even   nearer but I still would favor alternative B   With regard to the symmetry issue, I must admit that I found the experience we   encountered--in terms of market reaction to the May press release about asymmetry--so distasteful     10/5/99 63   that it makes me want to try to use words to describe our views about the risks to the outlook   Clearly, we are not talking about a symmetrical situation So I’d like to indicate a preference to use   words to deal with this issue of risks to the outlook But if we can’t do that in an efficient way, I   certainly could buy an announcement of asymmetry    I favored alternative II [Laughter]    And it was for many of the reasons that were mentioned by Larry and   Bill I saw it as the alternative that would be consistent with the fewest additional sentences of   explanation, which I viewed as a great virtue And based on our experience today, I see that as a   really big virtue for which to aim  Moreover, it seemed to me that the most important point was     11/16/99 68   that the focus clearly be on the implications for policy I think if we were somewhat more   explicit about that, over time our experience would be good in providing that information    Karen, you made the point that economic prospects in the United States   are certainly affected by the improved situation in foreign countries I wonder if you would   comment briefly about how your views have changed on Japan It seems to me that the situation   there still looks quite troubling in the sense that the Greenbook projects deflation to continue   through 2000 and really through 2001 since prices are flat in 2001 The fiscal stimulus program   they are proposing is very large and it suggests that they have significant concerns about real   growth prospects in the future I just wonder how your views have changed about Japan, which   is certainly an important ingredient to the foreign GDP prospects    Thank you    Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economic expansion continues to   outpace the average for the rest of the nation During the third quarter, employment grew at a   24 percent rate, exactly equal to the pace during the first half of the year However, growth in   most of our states, including California, has been slower this year than it was in 1998, so that the   District growth rate has been edging down toward the national average Other than Alaska and   Hawaii, District states remain strong, though I would point out that tourist spending is producing   even a further pickup in Nevada this year California has been expanding a bit more rapidly than   the remainder of the District, and the state unemployment rate has fallen just over a percentage   point since the end of last year to 48 percent in October The short-run outlook for the District   expansion remains quite favorable Housing market activity has been vigorous, although the   increases this year mostly have been in fast-growing southern California Growth has been   somewhat slower elsewhere and residential construction activity has been flat or down in several   urban areas Slower appreciation in sales prices for existing homes is evident in some areas as   well   On the upside, we are seeing renewed demand for District electronic products   Following three lean years, prices and sales of key semiconductor products have picked up this     11/16/99 24   year, and in California electronics manufacturers have gained back many of the jobs lost during   1998   Turning to the national economy, labor markets certainly have tightened a bit further   since we last met The rapid real GDP growth in the third quarter led to a further slight decline   in the unemployment rate, and our forecast for real GDP growth of about 3½ percent next year   is, of course, very similar to that of the Greenbook This suggests that labor market pressures are   unlikely to abate any time soon But while labor costs may well pick up in the future, these costs   do not appear to have been particularly burdensome to businesses in the recent past Despite   apparently tight labor markets the ECI has risen only 31 percent over the past year And while   compensation per hour has risen much faster, unit labor cost increases receded last quarter due to   strong productivity growth Moreover, rapid real GDP growth and low price inflation in the   third quarter, together with what appears to be a pickup in profits, also suggest that aggregate   supply has continued to expand at a robust pace This provides room for at least guarded   optimism about inflation   After balancing these signals, we come out with a slight upward trend for the core   CPI Our forecast shows a rise from 21 percent this year to 23 and 24 percent respectively in   the next two years Even such a slight upward trend in future price inflation is a concern As we   know, however, such an upswing has looked likely for several years but has not materialized In   deciding on policy, we will be faced again with whether to put more weight on forecasts of   problems ahead or on past results that have been quite favorable Thank you    Mr Chairman, this month we once again face the issue of how much   weight to put on a forecast of rising inflation, a forecast that so far has been on the high side   compared with the more favorable actual results When the October meeting concluded, I was   fairly confident that we would need to raise rates at this meeting However, the wage and price   inflation data in the intermeeting period have been better certainly than I expected As a result, I   would prefer to leave the funds rate unchanged at the present time and to retain a bias toward a   tighter policy But I must admit that if we do that, the strong likelihood that we will stand pat   until at least mid-January makes me anxious, since I do believe our next move will be up And   that need could be compelling before we feel comfortable in moving in the new year    I started out at a position that was very close to Bill Poole’s, although   I indicated that I probably could live with either option I’ve moved a bit more in the   direction of Option 1 recently The advantage of Option 2, of course, is that it’s very direct   To me the disadvantage is that it may not accurately convey the probabilities of a change in   policy Clearly, we were using the tilt language in the past in a way that very often did not   lead to a change in policy after we had adopted an asymmetric directive And I even worry   about the possibility that markets may almost force us to make a move if we’ve indicated   asymmetry, as has been the case once in the recent past   With regard to Option 1, what I like about it is that it seems to capture how I’ve   interpreted symmetry in the past I concluded what I thought was appropriate with regard to   the funds rate and then considered the question of where the balance of risks, in terms of the   economic outcomes, was likely to be in the period ahead, knowing full well that things   could change very quickly So it seems to me that perhaps Option 1 would provide a little   more flexibility than Option 2    Mike, I thought the section in the Greenbook on alternative   simulations was particularly interesting, especially the comparison between the baseline and   the flat funds rate scenario It seems to me, if one compares the effects of monetary policy   actions on inflation expectations in the economy, that there is a greater sensitivity now than   may have been the case a couple of years ago And that makes sense to me We are   basically saying that markets are learning and responding to policy actions But what is a   bit confusing is that there is also, I would assume, considerable sensitivity to developments   in equity markets as well If one looks at those two Greenbook alternatives, there is a big   impact on expectations as a result of the effect of a change in rates on equity prices Could   you talk a little about how expectations enter into the model now versus how they used to?   Is there a greater sensitivity now to policy actions?    Thank you    Mr Chairman, economic activity in the Twelfth District has   continued to expand rapidly in recent months, with the expansion broadly based across   major District states Every major sector in the District added jobs in recent months, with   construction posting some of the largest gains And manufacturing has been a new source   of job growth in recent months despite a continued loss of aerospace jobs A rebound is     12/21/99 18   particularly evident for manufacturers of high-tech equipment, who recently have benefited   from improved exports to Asian countries that had suffered recessions in the 1997-1998   period   High-tech firms have created a lot of jobs and wealth recently in the District,   especially in California This year a record-breaking amount of venture capital has been   invested in California firms, particularly those in the Bay Area that are developing Internet   applications  Proceeds from initial public offerings also have surged this year, following   moderate amounts of IPO activity in 1997 and 1998 The strong performance of technology   stocks is boosting spending not only in California but in other District states as well For   example, one of our directors reported that Californians are using their newfound riches to   bid up the price of beachfront real estate in Hawaii Analysis done by our staff suggests that   successful IPOs have made a large number of employees wealthy, at least on paper More   than 150,000 persons are employed in the roughly 300 California- headquartered firms that   have made IPOs in the last three years About 125,000 of these employees probably have   received stock or stock options as part of their compensation, giving them as a group about   15 percent ownership in their firms Given the strong stock price performance this year, the   aggregate market capitalization of these 300 firms recently jumped to about $450 billion   dollars As a result, about 125,000 Californians have seen the value of their stock or stock   options jump to an average level of more than $300,000 per employee Just as this newly   created wealth is boosting demand, especially in California, it is clear that a collapse in   market values would impose obvious downside risks   Turning to the national economy, recent data continue to show the rapid growth in   economic activity and moderate inflation that we have seen for four years now These data   serve to reinforce the impression that the supply side of the economy is expanding rapidly   Our forecast under an unchanged federal funds rate and flat stock market shows growth of   just under 3¾ percent and 3½ percent respectively over the next two years   With regard to inflation, tight labor markets are expected to impart an upward trend   to the ECI, which rises in our forecast to 4¼ percent by 2001 However, the acceleration of   productivity in recent years can be expected to counteract part of this pressure on goods   prices Moreover, corporate profit margins remain high, providing a further cushion   between wages and prices Balancing these factors, our staff forecast shows a slight upward     12/21/99 19   trend in core CPI from 21 percent this year to 23 and 24 percent in the next two years,   considerably below the forecast in the Greenbook constant funds rate scenario   There are significant risks on both sides of the forecast The evidence of a   continuing supply shock represents a downside risk for inflation This shock has proven to   be difficult to model, and inflation, once again, could come in lower than expected In   addition, the possibility of a significant stock market correction cannot by any means be   ruled out, and that also would reduce inflationary risks However, labor market tightness   could begin to show through to price inflation in a more dramatic way, as would be   expected from historical experience This risk is illustrated rather forcefully by the   Greenbook with its forecast that CPI inflation would rise to 32 percent in 2001 with no   further tightening of monetary policy   The key policy issues appear to remain the same Accelerating productivity and   actual results for inflation suggest room for guarded optimism, while labor market tightness   implies problems ahead for inflation While I am perhaps not as pessimistic as the   Greenbook, I must admit that it has shifted my focus a bit toward the inflationary risks that   we face with an unchanged federal funds rate Thank you    I favor, by a small margin, the symmetric directive as well When I   read the two, the symmetric one seems to speak a little more clearly about our thoughts and   concerns I don’t see big differences, but if I had to state a preference it would be for the   symmetric alternative     I certainly am in favor of the study and I think the suggestion that Tom   Hoenig made was constructive  To deal somewhat with the issue Bill Poole was raising, is it   possible to have the temporary suspension extended for a shorter period?  In other words, is this   study of sufficient importance that it ought to be done much more expeditiously and then perhaps   our decision could be reached much more quickly?              - 23 -       So move     Mike, how would you characterize the degree of monetary restraint in   the year 2000 in this forecast versus the January forecast?  I ask that because nominal rates are   about 1/2 percentage point higher in the latest forecast and inflation rates in overall price indices    like the CPI are up by almost the same amount, but the core rates are about the same as in the   previous forecast  I'm not sure, in your deliberations and the way you look at this, how you   formulate your views about real rates  And I was curious about how you see the difference in   this forecast versus the previous one       So there isn't a major change     Thank you     Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy entered the new year with   considerable momentum  The pace of job growth in the District has picked up in recent months,   further widening the gap in employment growth relative to the nation  The acceleration was   most pronounced in California, where payrolls expanded at a 3-1/2 percent average annual rate   in January and February, about 08 percentage point faster than the pace of growth in 1999    Employment growth in the fastest-growing states--Nevada, Arizona, Idaho, and California--  currently is averaging from 3 to over 5 percent on a 12-month basis  In other District states   employment is expanding at or below the national pace  But in all but Utah economic activity   has picked up in recent months  Robust gains in construction and services have continued to   drive the District economy  Collectively those two sectors created about 60 percent of net new   jobs added during the past twelve months  Job growth in construction has been broad-based,   boosted by strong demand for both residential and nonresidential building   In the services sector, rapid expansion among providers of Internet and software   services remains the key component of growth  But recently providers of services related to   population growth--health care is one example--and to tourism also have added jobs at a brisk              - 41 -     pace  Strong job growth over the past twelve months has further tightened District labor   markets  The District unemployment rate fell to 4-1/2 percent in January, down 06 percentage   point from the average in 1999  However, as of yet, tight labor markets have not resulted in   greater wage inflation in the District  In fact, data from the ECI point to slower wage growth in   the District in 1999 than we experienced in 1998  This pattern of declining unemployment and   slower wage growth owes in part, we believe, to three factors  First, increases in the use of   alternative and uncounted forms of employee compensation such as stock options and hiring   bonuses, and also job reclassification of workers receiving pay raises; second, a decline in wage   growth in high-tech manufacturing associated with slower employment growth in that sector; and   third, the rapid movement of less-qualified workers into existing job classifications at lower   wages   Looking forward, some of the factors tempering wage growth in 1999 may be reversed   in the coming year  For example, improved demand within District high-tech manufacturing has   begun to boost employment growth, making further decelerations in wage growth in that sector   unlikely  Also, data for California indicate that the number of potential workers is diminishing    The flow of new entrants into unemployment is slowing, and unemployment rates among   subgroups with lower-than-average skill levels are falling   Turning to the national economy, the data released during the past month showed no   slackening in domestic demand  Real final sales rose about 5 percent at an annual rate during the   second half of last year and our forecast is for much the same pace of growth during the first part   of this year  This rate of sales growth most likely is unsustainable and is especially a concern   given the current levels of resource utilization  Therefore, our forecast assumes a significant   further tightening of financial conditions over the next six months  This tightening includes a              - 42 -     rise in corporate and mortgage rates, a flattening of broad stock market valuations, and--   underpinning these developments--a gradual increase of 75 basis points in the funds rate  Such   financial restraints help to slow real GDP growth to 4 percent this year and 3-1/4 percent next   year in our forecast     Still, even with the slowing of real economic activity, our inflation projection is   disappointing  During the past few years, the core PCE price index has risen about 1-1/2 percent   each year, which is somewhat above my view of price stability  Unfortunately, our forecast   anticipates that core PCE inflation will rise to almost 2 percent by next year, giving up the gains   made toward price stability since the mid-1990s  As we all know, there are many risks to such   an inflation forecast  In particular, we are uncertain about how much and how fast energy prices   will pass through to other prices, about how much demand will increase from the economies   abroad, and about whether stock prices or productivity growth will surge or fall  However,   despite all the possible scenarios that could be constructed, the underlying tightness of labor   markets and the recent extraordinary growth in demand imply a very high risk that core inflation   will rise at a faster pace this year and next  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation with regard to the funds   rate  I also think it is important to reinforce to the public that we are focusing on the heightened   inflation risks for the future     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Vince, beginning in 1999 and   continuing through 2001 the foreign real GDP growth rates are quite strong, especially in the   industrial countries  Would you characterize this primarily as a cyclical development or is   there an indication that perhaps some of the “new economy” developments, which certainly   have affected us over the last four or five years and have produced forecasts that were   consistently too low, are at work as well?      33    Let me just add a footnote  You made the point that we see foreign   growth slowing; that happened as well in our own forecasts for the US economy  So it may   be that you would not find signs of the new economy in the macro forecast  But looking at   different sectors in the economy could result in a forecast that is more nontraditional in nature    I don't disagree with you, incidentally, about the limited importance of the new economy   element, certainly in Europe  But it is something that could become a factor at some point     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Twelfth District economy has   continued its robust expansion so far this year  California's economy remains on a strong   growth path, spurred by unusually rapid gains in income and consumer spending  During the   first four months of this year, employment increased at a 3-1/2 percent pace, well above last   year's pace  Personal income gains were sizable last year  And data on state government   revenues suggest that income growth picked up further in the first quarter of this year    Moreover, growth in consumer spending appears to be even more rapid than income growth in   the state  Last year's growth rate in taxable sales was the largest since 1984  Demand for   housing and commercial real estate remains very strong in California as well  For example, in   the San Francisco Bay area, high-tech equity wealth has helped to push up median prices on   existing homes by 25 percent during the past year   Real estate markets in the remainder of   the District also have shown little or no signs of cooling      45  In the District manufacturing sector moderate job losses have continued this year,   but output and sales have been rising in response to improvements in export demand    Although Boeing's employment fell further in the first quarter, the pace of job losses has   slowed  And rising East Asian demand is evident in accelerated delivery schedules on some   previously delayed orders  Moreover, semiconductor manufacturers have benefited from   substantial improvement in worldwide demand  As one example, Intel and another maker of   semiconductors plan investments totaling $3 billion in additional manufacturing capacity in   Arizona  Probably the strongest source of growth in the District recently has been the   software and Internet services sector  The pace of investment in that sector likely will be   reduced by the recent sharp decline in high-tech equity valuations  However, for promising   investments the pool of available venture capital remains very large   Turning to the national economy, recent data certainly have raised a red flag about   inflation  First, although real GDP slowed in the first quarter, real spending--as measured by   real final sales--actually picked up from the very strong fourth-quarter results  Retail sales did   flatten out in April, but it's obviously too soon to conclude that consumers have downshifted   their spending  Second, the further tightening of labor markets in April is not a good sign for   inflation  And third and most importantly, the news on inflation itself has been worrisome    With inflation coming in on the high side in the first quarter, we now have had two straight   quarters with inflation rates that were above the previously established level  The core PCE   price index rose by an average of 19 percent in the past two quarters versus l3 percent over   the four quarters before that  While part of this acceleration could be caused by a one-time   passthrough of higher energy costs to core prices, it is also quite possible that we are   beginning to see a sustained upward trend        46  With regard to our own forecast, we've assumed that the funds rate will reach 6-3/4   percent by the fourth quarter of this year and that the broad stock market will remain   unchanged at recent levels  Under these assumptions we expect to see a gradual slowing in   activity, with real GDP growth averaging 46 percent in the final three quarters of this year   and 39 percent in 2001  But labor and product markets are expected to remain tight through   the end of next year and core inflation to show a gradual upward trend, despite an assumed   rapid growth rate in productivity  The core PCE price index is projected to average 21   percent this year and 22 percent in 2001  Our inflation forecast is up only slightly from   where it had been for some time  The really important new development is that we've seen a   pickup in actual inflation in the past two quarters that might be the beginning of a new trend    In any event, it is now clear that the previously established downward trend has ended at a   level above price stability  Overall, developments since our last meeting have certainly raised   my concerns about inflation significantly  Thank you        Mr Chairman, it seems clear to me that we need to tighten policy   further at this meeting, and I enthusiastically support your recommendation for a 50 basis   point increase  I also believe that the balance of risks remains weighted toward higher   inflation, and incorporating that view in the press release is for me an important part of the   recommendation as well     Second     Karen or Dave, the new Greenbook assumptions for potential growth and   your forecast for actual GDP growth are, I believe, way above the market consensus if one looks at   the Blue Chip forecasts, for example  What do you think the chances are that the baseline forecast   may actually be accompanied by a stronger foreign demand for our capital and also a stronger   dollar?  It seems to me that that would be the most likely outcome, given these changes in the   assumptions in the Greenbook forecast  I think this is particularly important since, as your   alternative simulation indicated, that would take some of the pressures off inflation     Well, I’m not saying that their forecast is right     But when they are more convinced about the truth--which is found in the   Greenbook, of course--that would probably affect investors’ appetite for dollars     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall, economic growth in the Twelfth   District picked up in recent months, though we see signs of slowing in housing construction  Also,   high and volatile electricity prices have led to some disruptions in production  For the four months   ended in July, employment in the West grew at an annual rate of 36 percent, up from the 26 percent   pace reported for the first quarter  This is not just due to strength in California, as employment in   five other states in the West is growing well above the rate for the nation  Within the region, job   growth in the Northwest is lagging the rest of the region, but it’s close to the US growth rate  With   the strong growth in the West, labor markets remain tight  The gains in jobs have been broad-based   among the service-producing sectors  While dot-coms are facing a tougher environment, available   evidence in business services points to continued strong employment growth at software and   Internet-related firms  However, signs of slowing in the single-family housing market are present in       32  much of the West  For example, single-family permits have declined this year  Moreover, outside   of California, construction employment has been relatively flat in recent months  Even in rapidly   growing Arizona, construction employment has contracted  In California, conditions in the housing   market are more complicated  Recent weakness in single-family permits has been offset by strength   in multifamily permits  There also has been substantial upward pressure on house prices in much of   the state, primarily because the supply of housing has lagged woefully behind the growth in   underlying demand for several years  Also, analysis by our staff provides support for the commonly   held view that housing prices in the San Francisco Bay area have been boosted by the substantial   increase in wealth of high-tech employees as a result of stock options  Moreover, the analysis   suggests that even with the correction in stock prices this year, those wealth effects are continuing to   boost housing demand in the region     Another notable development in the West is the hike in electricity prices  This has led to   higher direct costs to some users not shielded by rate freezes or fixed-rate contracts  Higher prices   have meant disruptions to and rescheduling of production at some firms  In the Northwest,   aluminum producers drawn to the region by the allure of low-cost hydroelectric power have   announced layoffs and shutdowns of some facilities  In California, the governor reduced the cap on   the wholesale price of electricity from $500 per megawatt hour to $250  Last week prices hit the cap   on each of the five weekdays     Turning to the national scene, the second-quarter slowdown in the growth of real private   demand, especially consumption, was encouraging  Like the Greenbook, we expect slower spending   growth to show up in the real GDP data this quarter  Our forecast is that real output will grow at a   rate of roughly 3-3/4 percent over the rest of the year and at about the same pace next year  In   making this forecast I’m aware that no slowdown is evident in investment spending  These data       33  suggest that there is a risk that output growth may not slow as much as we’re expecting  They also   suggest that productivity growth is likely to remain robust  Robust productivity growth helps keep   the roughly 5 percent ECI growth we are projecting from pushing up inflation  In particular,   incorporating the Board staff’s productivity assumptions leads us to predict slightly less inflation   than does the Greenbook for 2001  Part of the reason is that we incorporated a higher path for the   dollar than is in the Greenbook  This higher path seems appropriate to us in light of the rapid   acceleration assumed for productivity  Nevertheless, core inflation this year and next is still   expected to be higher than it was last year  And it seems to me that the balance of risks remains   tilted toward higher inflation  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation  I think this would be a   good time to leave the funds rate unchanged so that we can see how things unfold before considering   another tightening action  I also believe it is important to retain the statement adopted in June that the   balance of risks continues to be toward higher inflation     Peter, my recollection of previous interventions--let’s say going back 10 or   12 years--is that we would be approached by the Treasury which, of course, was receiving a lot of   pressure from another country, and we would act at the request of the Treasury  It sounds as if the   dynamics were a little different this time because you emphasized your discussion with the ECB and                                 discussion with the Chairman  Did you just leave out a part or was it different?      10    And that was the case this time?     That wasn’t clear to me  Thank you     So there’s an institutional change that has really produced the different   approach      Right      11    Good  I think that explains it     It sounds good!     Mr Chairman, I think this information is very helpful and certainly   provides a good grounding for what is to come  And I am sure that is going to be extremely   interesting and also challenging  First, I was wondering if we know anything about the lead times   we would have in terms of being able to look at the material prior to discussing it  Secondly, I      90  wondered whether time would be set aside so that we can discuss this in an environment that may be   slightly more leisurely than, say, after an FOMC meeting and before lunch     This is one of the more significant issues we will have to deal with     Of course     Most of the growth is overseas     It beats taxes     Mr Chairman, it is, but in a way we do have some time to consider the   right decision, particularly if we are willing to change the 25 percent  I agree that there is a sense of   urgency but what really comes through is the importance of the issue, I think     Mr Chairman, employment in the West continued to expand at a solid       2-3/4 percent pace in July and August  In contrast to the remainder of the District, California’s job   count has slowed somewhat in recent months  The data show weakness in business services, in part   due to layoffs at some dot-coms, although indications are that those laid off are having no trouble   finding jobs  Construction employment also has tailed off  Even so, the employment statistics may   be overstating the slowing in the State, given that growth in income tax withholding in California   has remained strong     An area of strength in the District has been high-tech activity related to semiconductor   manufacturing  The semiconductor industry has added manufacturing jobs in the District this year,      38  following two years of job cuts  And worldwide semiconductor sales are running well ahead of last   year  The pickup reflects strength in the demand for chips used in Internet-related products, hand-   held computers, and communications devices     Across the District, however, real estate activity--both commercial and residential   construction--is moderating  Office rents have leveled off in a number of cities in the region,   including Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City  In contrast, rents   continue to climb in the San Francisco Bay and the Seattle areas  Prices for wholesale electricity   remain high and volatile in the West  The California Public Utilities Commission has adopted a rate   stabilization plan for the deregulated San Diego area  However, this plan, along with the existing   rate ceilings in other parts of California where deregulation has been only partly phased in, has only   put off the decision about who will cover the billions of dollars in revenue shortfalls for companies   such as San Diego Gas and Electric, Pacific Gas and Electric, and Southern California Edison     Turning to the national economy, I find it encouraging that core inflation hasn’t   accelerated in recent months despite higher oil prices and that the pace of economic activity seems to   have moderated in the third quarter  Like the Greenbook, our real GDP forecast for that quarter   shows an increase of 3 percent, which is down about ½ percentage point from our August forecast    Obviously, it’s too early to tell if the slowdown will be sustained, but developments in financial   markets this year, with modestly lower equity values and a higher dollar in combination with our   past tightening actions, should help to contain demand  Of course, the wild card for both inflation   and economic activity is energy prices, which have defied expectations of a substantial decline for   some time now  Our longer-term forecast shows growth in real GDP slowing from 4-1/4 percent   this year to a range of 3-1/2 to 4 percent next year under the assumptions of no further change in the   funds rate and a constant value of the US dollar       39  Even with the slowdown we are expecting, labor markets will remain tight through the   end of next year, generating some upward pressure on core inflation  Higher energy prices also have   boosted our forecast of core inflation to some extent  As in the Greenbook, our forecast assumes   that energy prices will decline over the next several quarters, which works to obscure upward   pressures in our core inflation measures  We expect core PCE prices to increase about 2 percent this   year and slightly more next year  Overall inflationary risks may have lessened a bit since we met in   August as it now seems more likely that the economy really has entered a slowing phase  But to me   the balance of risks for inflation going forward still is on the up side and I don't think we should be   content with core inflation measures as high as 2 percent, especially given the likelihood that they   may be rising  Thank you     I support your recommendation       Dave, over the past year the core CPI is up about 2-1/2 percent and the   core PCE is up about 17 percent  Part II of the Greenbook suggests that the difference between   these two indices is almost exclusively due to the imputed prices for non-price services like bank   services  Given that, which index do you think is providing the best indication of core inflation?     On medical care, of course, businesses tell us that they have seen huge   increases over the last 12 months in terms of their costs  I’m not saying which one looks as   though it’s--      The usage has risen  But there’s no doubt that when we budget for   premium increases that we charge our employees, the increases are huge across the board     Sure     Thank you     Mr Chairman, employment in the Twelfth District has continued to   expand at a solid pace in recent months, although growth has slowed slightly from earlier in the   year  District payrolls expanded by 2-1/2 percent during the third quarter, down about 1/2   percentage point from the pace recorded in the first half of the year  The most pronounced   slowing occurred in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, but growth also slowed in California and   Idaho  However, with the exception of Alaska, each state added jobs at a faster pace than the   nation  In the remaining District states--Arizona, Hawaii, Nevada, and Utah--growth remained   robust or actually accelerated  Overall, the Twelfth District has continued to expand more   rapidly than the rest of the nation in recent months, and as of September contained four of the               35      five fastest growing states in the nation  Solid overall job growth further reduced the District   unemployment rate to just over 4-1/2 percent in September, down about 1/4 percentage point   from August  Despite layoffs among dot-coms and in some areas of manufacturing, employers   in most District states continue to report difficulty finding qualified workers  Many District   firms are increasing investment in labor-saving technologies in response to persistently tight   labor markets, rapid employee turnover, and rising wage and benefit costs  Consistent with low   and declining unemployment, labor costs nevertheless picked up in the third quarter  Employers   in the District report that while hiring and recruitment bonuses remain prevalent, recent stock   market volatility has tempered the use of stock options by Internet-related firms   Construction and services have provided the main boost to the District economy in   recent months  Collectively these two sectors created about 65 percent of net new jobs added   during the third quarter  Job gains in construction were particularly rapid  Payrolls increased by   nearly 7 percent in the third quarter  The services sector expanded by about 4 percent at an   annual rate over the same period, as rapid growth in consumer services offset slowing in business   services   District banks have tightened credit standards and terms for business borrowers    Although overall economic growth has been solid in the District, there is more uncertainty about   the outlook and there have been problems with the quality of loans to some large borrowers  The   small business and middle market portfolios are holding up so far  However, some of the firms   are vulnerable, and credit standards also have been tightened for them  For example, small   businesses that are highly dependent on energy, especially in the San Diego area, have been hit   hard by the high cost of electricity  Also, the building of multiplex theaters has slowed and a               36      large number are expected to close, which could have ripple effects on the other tenants in the   same shopping centers   Turning to the national economy, recent developments have been encouraging and I   have become somewhat more optimistic that inflationary pressures can be contained without   additional action on our part  We have hard evidence of a slowdown in economic activity, at   least in the third quarter, and based on early readings for October the fourth quarter got off to a   moderate start as well  Importantly, productivity growth held up remarkably well in the face of   slower real GDP growth, supporting the view that the supply side of the economy is still   expanding briskly  And core inflation remained moderate in September, even after having been   boosted a bit by higher oil prices Although the case for a sustained slowdown in the economy   has been strengthened, it's still far too early to tell if demand will settle in at a low enough rate to   prevent a significant rise in inflation  And, of course, energy prices remain a wild card    Our current forecast shows real GDP growth of 3-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter    Reflecting recent developments, that figure is down about 1/2 percentage point from our forecast   in early October  We also have lowered our projection for the first half of next year by just   under 1/2 percentage point, based largely on a modest tightening of financial conditions since we   met in early October  Under the assumption of no further change in the federal funds rate, the   broad stock market, or the dollar, we expect to see real GDP increase 3-1/2 percent in 2001    This is a bit weaker than in the Greenbook forecast, but the difference may be largely accounted   for by the dollar's depreciation in that forecast  Despite the slowdown we are anticipating, labor   markets would still be fairly tight by the end of next year and could be expected to put some   upward pressure on core inflation, even assuming the favorable path for structural productivity               37      growth that is in the Greenbook  Assuming that oil prices will decline over the next several   quarters, we expect core PCE to increase by about 2 percent next year  Overall, inflationary   risks appear to be a bit lower than when we met in October, as it now seems more likely that the   economy has really entered a slowing phase while productivity growth has remained robust  But   to me, continuing tightness in labor markets leaves the balance of risks on the up side for   inflation going forward  This risk is an especially serious concern because I’d like eventually to   see inflation below recent levels  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I certainly support your recommendation for an   unchanged funds rate, and I also think it's important to retain the statement of prior   meetings that the balance of risks is toward higher inflation  I believe it is important as   well to explain this in terms of developments that have occurred since our last meeting    And in my view the statement that you read to us accomplishes that very well     Dave, in the forecast, your estimate of potential growth for the next two   years is in the low 4 percent area or something like that  We have forecast GDP growth of 2-1/2   percent, roughly, and have discussed the risk that it could be even slower than that--perhaps by a   percent or two  Should our response and thoughts about policy be different now, given that potential   is quite a bit higher than in the past?  In other words, should the prospect of 0 to 2 percent GDP   growth generate the same level of concern that we would have had maybe five years ago with a 0 to   -2 percent forecast?     But the consequences of the growth rate declining to, say, 0 to 2 percent   could be even more significant  One could get greater employment effects et cetera, and the impact   on inflation eventually could be even stronger     Mr Chairman, employment growth in the Twelfth District has continued   to moderate in recent months  District payrolls have expanded at a 2-1/4 percent pace in recent   months, somewhat below the 3 percent pace of the first half of the year  More moderate   employment growth and declines in the market values of high-tech stocks have begun to show   through to personal income and spending  Data through the third quarter indicate slower growth in   District payroll withholding and other personal income and sales tax revenues  In retail sales, data   for the holiday shopping season point to a slower pace of consumer spending in the District  During   the first 2-1/2 weeks of the shopping season, year-over-year same-store sales increased 3 percent in   the West, down from the 38 percent pace a year earlier    The dot-com shakeup continues but at a slower pace  However, the outlook for District   high-tech manufacturers also has softened recently  In the past couple of months, several high-tech      42  manufacturers in the District have announced downward revisions to earnings forecasts, sending   their stock prices lower  These revisions were based on a number of important fundamentals,   including slower growth in sales of semiconductors and computers, declines in new orders for   electronics and other electrical equipment, a pickup in order cancellations, and increased inventory   accumulation     Rising energy costs have become a major concern for many Twelfth District states  On   the producer side, record-setting prices for natural gas and electricity have pushed a number of   agricultural producers into the red and induced some manufacturers to shut down, with some opting   to sell their forward contracts on energy in the spot market  On the consumer side, as you have read   in the press, major utilities nationally have warned customers that natural gas bills could increase by   50 percent over last year's level  Pacific Gas and Electric estimates that the increase in California   will be 75 percent, due to an especially tight gas market in the West     The most pressing problem in energy markets in the past week occurred in California and   concerned the financial health of major utilities  Due to the gaping divide between wholesale and   retail electricity prices, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison have accumulated   billions of dollars of undercharges financed largely by borrowing  Given the increasingly uncertain   outlook, the debt of both PG&E and Edison was downgraded last week  Ultimate solutions to the   problem will be political, a process that is currently evolving  Until recently, the bulk of electricity   contracts have been confined to the day ahead in spot markets  The Federal Energy Regulatory   Commission's ruling on Friday is a small positive step in that it will improve forward contracting in   the California electricity markets  The California Public Utilities Commission also has indicated that   it will at least consider some increase in retail electricity prices  However, the increase being   discussed is unlikely to provide much of a solution to the problem      43  Turning to the national economy, recent developments suggest a more pronounced near-  term slowdown than seemed likely when we met last  At the same time, the downside risk to the   outlook certainly has intensified  The recent weakness in consumer spending is especially   noteworthy and the large drop in the preliminary December Michigan index of consumer sentiment   demonstrates a risk that consumers could cut back even more sharply in the near future   We have revised down our forecast of real GDP in both the current quarter and the next   one by about one percentage point to around 2-1/2 percent  Under the assumption that the federal   funds rate, the stock market, and the dollar are all unchanged, our best guess is that growth will pick   up in the second half of next year and that real GDP would rise by just under 3 percent for the year   as a whole  This slowdown in growth from the 4 percent rate expected for this year is readily   explained by tightening financial conditions on a broad range of fronts  And this may be the   slowdown we need to contain inflationary pressures  However, even with a slowdown of this   magnitude, our forecast shows a modest increase in core PCE inflation next year to around 2 percent   from the 1-3/4 percent rate expected this year  While this prospect concerns me, I’m also concerned   that adverse expectations are posing a risk that the economy will weaken more than seems warranted   by the tightenings we've seen in the financial conditions themselves  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, I can certainly accept your recommendation  When I was   thinking about that possibility at the end of last week, I was concerned that the markets might find it   a bit confusing in terms of what we are trying to communicate  Ironically, as it turns out, the article   that appeared in the Wall Street Journal may make that less of a problem  In addition, it seems to me   that our press statement should be very carefully worded because my concern is that the markets   might be a little confused about how weak we think the economy is and might raise the issue of why      76  we didn't change the funds rate today  So, how our decision is written up could be an important   element in terms of the success of your recommendation      Mr Chairman, I thought the article was abominable     Okay     Karen, I’d like to ask two questions about Japan  The first is,   does the change announced by Japan indicate that in terms of policy they’re embracing   some form of inflation targeting?  Secondly, about a month ago there was some   discussion, in the press at least, indicating that if Japan reverted to its previous policy of   zero interest rates, Hayami would be forced to resign  I haven’t heard anything about that   in the last few days  I wondered if you could comment on both of those elements     Right     Thank you     Mr Chairman, economic growth in the West has undergone a   notable retrenchment this year from what had been a very rapid expansion  However,   revised data now put Twelfth District job growth for last year at 3-1/2 percent, making it   the fifth consecutive year of growth at 3-plus percent  But this year, tangible signs of   slowing are evident on a number of fronts  In high-tech--beyond the direct effects of the   return to reality in the dotcom sector, which are modest--softening is apparent in   manufacturing  Across product lines we see producers cutting investment plans and   reducing jobs as they transition from their considerable optimism in the year 2000 to   weaker demand this year  The shakeout among Internet firms continues to have some   impact on commercial real estate in tech centers, though office markets are basically   sound  Residential markets are mixed, with some pickup in permits  However, price   performance outside of California and Hawaii is somewhat weaker  In coming months,   home prices likely will be affected further by the decline in stock prices and withering   options values, especially in California where exercised options accounted for about 13   percent of wage and salary income in 2000   The energy situation remains a distinct negative  For natural gas the most   extreme example of price hikes is the 150 percent increase over the past year for   customers of PG&E in northern California, more than twice the national average    Regarding electricity, milder weather has brought down wholesale electricity prices in the   West, though on-peak spot prices still are more than five times higher than on the East   Coast  In California, power outages this summer seem inevitable unless we see at least a     3/20/01 31  10 percent reduction in usage  This inevitability was dramatically illustrated by the   rolling blackouts experienced yesterday  Also, average wholesale costs in the West will   be high again this summer since a good deal of the states’ power will be bought on the   spot market to cover peak usage  However, rate payers in California continue to be   shielded from the high wholesale prices, with the State buying most of the power and   accumulating the undercharges  We estimate that a full pass-through of wholesale   electricity costs would mean another 70 percent rate hike       Yes, 70  Data on the recent performance of the national   economy have been mixed  Job growth, for instance, has held up better than we had   expected  On the other hand, the industrial sector is contracting sharply  Overall, the   recent data have been roughly offsetting, resulting in no change in our forecast that the   economy will grow at a rate of 1 to 1-1/2 percent over the first half of this year     By contrast, recent developments in the financial markets are more negative   for the longer-term outlook  The lower stock market likely signals slower growth in   spending  And the stronger dollar, which is probably a reflection of worsening   conditions in some key foreign economies, could slow our output growth  In response,   we have lowered the assumed funds rate path by 50 basis points  As a consequence, our   forecast of output growth beyond the first half of the year is just marginally lower than it   was last time  We now expect the real GDP growth rate to come in at 2-1/2 percent in the   second half of the year and almost 3-1/2 percent in 2002, as the positive effects of the   recent technology shock gradually reassert themselves       3/20/01 32  Since output growth in our forecast remains below potential throughout the   forecast horizon, labor market tightness is eliminated by late next year  That helps to   contain inflation  Core PCE inflation is projected to come in at 2 percent this year and   just a bit lower next year  Despite the assumed reduction in the funds rate, I must admit   that we still see downside risks to the economy  My concern is based in part on the   recent declines in consumer confidence surveys  Some recent work by our staff shows   that these surveys may provide useful information about contemporaneous conditions   before other data on the economy become available  This concern is reinforced by the   recent behavior of the stock market  Taken together these expectations-based indicators   suggest that many households and businesses expect to see an economy that is weaker   than in our forecast  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support a 50 basis point cut in the funds rate   and I also support a statement that the risks remain weighted toward economic weakness    I, too, share your concern about a 75 basis point cut at this time  To me the recent data   on employment and spending do not suggest that things are as bad as the stock market, or     3/20/01 95  for that matter consumers in general, seems to think  This makes it likely that at least   part of the market’s decline represents a return to more rational stock valuations  Under   these conditions, a 75 basis point cut in the funds rate now could provide a false sense of   security to the stock market  People might be led to believe that the Fed is attempting to   validate recent historically high valuations in equity markets  Thank you     Why don't you read it?      Mr Chairman?     This is a question for Dino or for Don Kohn  As shown on page 2 of   Dino’s handout, the yields on 10-year and 30-year Treasury bonds actually hit a low point at   roughly the time of the March FOMC meeting and, of course, have moved up since then  It’s   rather interesting that since that time in March the Greenbook forecast--and also I think most   private forecasts--has become a little more pessimistic about the economy’s prospects, at least   for the shorter term  Does this mean that the movement in rates is really due to a reevaluation of   longer-run expectations for inflation?     Well, usually there are two reasons  Your answer implied one, which is   that the decline in the funds rate raises the prospects that the economy will recover  And the   other is the possibility that inflation could become more of a concern        Right     Of course, the Greenbook forecast would suggest that the price   pressures, if anything, are likely to be a little less      Thank you     Karen, I have a couple of questions about Japan  The Greenbook   projection indicates that by the end of 2002 consumer prices will have declined in Japan in each   of the preceding four years  And the quarterly table has consumer prices declining in every   quarter over the three years through 2002  What would you say are the implications of such an   outcome for the banks in Japan, given the problems they face, and for the equity markets?  Have     5/15/01     21   policies been put in place that will end this downward spiral?   If not, what do you feel the   Japanese should do?     Right     Thank you     Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District economy has slowed considerably in   recent months  District payroll employment expanded at an annual rate of less than 1 percent in   the first quarter, a significant change from the near 3 percent pace reported in the fourth quarter    Slower employment growth has boosted unemployment rates in most District states in recent   months  However, as of yet, slackening labor markets have not resulted in lower wage inflation   in the District  Data from the March ECI showed that total compensation in the West grew by 5   percent over the past four quarters, a little above the rate for the prior four quarters and well   above the rates of the other three US regions  Still, District contacts report greater ease in   finding qualified workers and a reduction in employee turnover     The District’s technology sector has continued to weaken in recent months  On top of   the ongoing shakeout among dot-com firms, nearly every major high-tech manufacturer in our   area has announced layoffs  A number of software firms have scaled back as well, especially in   their demand for contract staff and temporary workers  High-tech companies increasingly are   instituting forced furloughs and across-the-board wage reductions for remaining staff in an effort   to control costs      5/15/01     36   Because of the prominent role that high-tech firms play in many District states, slowing   in the technology sector has begun to damp expansion in other sectors of the economy  For   example, vacancies are up and lease rates are falling in a number of commercial office markets    And personal income gains have slowed noticeably  Data through the fourth quarter point to   substantial slowing in personal income tax revenues, with additional weakening expected this   year  Slower personal income growth and the decline in the stock market have begun to temper   consumer spending and state government budgets  Retail sales in the West grew by about 3   percent in nominal terms during the first quarter, well off the 8 percent pace of 2000  Home   price appreciation also has eased, with weaker price performance even in the District’s hottest   markets  And a number of state governments have announced that revenues in 2001 likely will   fall below budgeted expenditures   Turning to electricity, warm weather in California earlier this month resulted in the first   rolling blackouts of the summer season  The California Independent System Operator, which   operates the power grid for most of California, estimates that unless usage is curtailed the state   could hit peak loads that exceed forecasted supply on 34 days this summer  That estimate is   based upon assumptions that weather conditions and usage are similar to those experienced last   summer  Other states in the District expect to have ample supplies of electricity this summer    However, spillover effects from California will push up the average cost of power for consumers   in some states, especially those in the Pacific Northwest       Turning briefly to the national economy, recent developments taken as a whole have   led us to revise down our expectations for real GDP growth this year and next  Our current   forecast is for growth of less than 1 percent this quarter, followed by an increase of around 2   percent for the third quarter  If we assume a further cut in the funds rate at this meeting, our best     5/15/01     37   estimate is that economic growth will rebound to the low 3 percent range late this year and next   year  However, there are some significant downside risks  One of them relates to consumption    With consumer confidence and stock market wealth down from last year and the unemployment   rate on the rise, consumers may wish to boost their saving, which could weaken economic   activity  At the same time, business investment appears fragile and the perceived over-capacity   of high-tech capital may damp investment more than we anticipate    With respect to inflation, we expect increases in the core PCE price index of just over 2   percent this year and just under 2 percent next year, up from a 16 percent rise in 2000  That is   certainly higher than I would like  However, any remaining upward pressure from tight labor   and product markets is likely to have dissipated by sometime next year, setting the stage for an   improved inflation outlook over the longer term  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I believe that it would be prudent to cut the rate further   and I support your proposed reduction of 50 basis points  For this meeting I also prefer to retain a   balance of risks statement weighted toward economic weakness  However, I think we are getting   close to the point where we should seriously re-examine that stance  Thank you    Second    David, you mentioned three considerations that we might want to take   into account as we look at the forecast  The second was that the variability in aggregate supply   gets translated pretty much on a one-for-one basis into the variability in aggregate demand  I     8/21/01 12   must admit I was a little surprised by that in the sense that although current short-term prospects   for earnings and for income are likely to affect demand, I believe that permanent income also   plays some role  If that’s the case--if there are more permanent influences--in terms of aggregate   demand, wouldn’t there be less of a response than a one-for-one change?    Permanent income as well?    Thank you    Mr Chairman, the economic climate in the Twelfth District has turned   negative as the high-tech downturn has intensified and spilled over into other sectors  During the   three months ending in July, District employment contracted 03 percent at an annual rate for a   net loss of about 19,000 jobs Downsizing among technology firms was especially pronounced    Between May and July, employment at high-tech manufacturers and business service firms   combined fell by about 8 percent at an annual rate, substantially above the pace of contraction   during the first four months of the year  The intensity of the cutbacks among District technology   firms has begun to drag down employment growth in other sectors  Employment contracted in   construction and also fell in shipping, trucking, and warehousing during the three months ending   in July And job gains in retail and wholesale trade have slowed to an anemic pace  The general   impact of the technology-driven downturn is evident in the District’s high-tech centers  For   example, the San Francisco Bay area has lost almost 35,000 jobs in the past four months, as both   tech and non-tech employers have scaled back  Employment in Portland and Phoenix also has   contracted in recent months and job growth in Seattle has slowed substantially  In general, the   technology-driven downturn has dramatically altered the regional pattern of growth in the   District this year, with last year’s fast-growing areas either contracting or moving laterally     8/21/01 21   Turning to energy markets, cooler temperatures, sluggish economic activity, and   continued conservation have reduced electricity usage in California in recent weeks, easing the   demand and supply imbalance that has plagued the state for most of the year  Better market   conditions and lower natural gas prices have resulted in wholesale spot electricity prices of   around $50 per megawatt hour in mid-August, well below the $200 average recorded for May    While lower wholesale prices generally are good news for California, the declines are not likely   to reverse the trend in retail rate hikes that took effect in June  A number of factors will keep   those rates up The California Department of Water Resources, which currently is purchasing   electricity for California’s major utilities, needs the revenue to cover past costs and what have   turned out to be relatively high prices on long-term contracts  And the public utilities want   assurances that retail rates will allow them to recoup past losses in addition to covering costs   going forward Right now concern on the part of utilities over the adequacy of the current rate   structure is holding up the issuance of $125 billion in revenue bonds meant to repay the state for   the billions of dollars the Department of Water Resources has spent on electricity this year  At   this point, it looks as if the bonds will not be issued before October or even November  Given   the delay in issuance, cash flow constraints likely will lead the state to issue revenue anticipation   bonds The state controller has indicated that these bonds, which would be issued after Labor   Day, could amount to $57 billion   Turning to the national economy, the industrial output and retail sales reports for July   may raise a glimmer of hope that the economy is beginning to turn around  However, it seems   fair to say that the recent data taken together show few, if any, signs of a pickup in activity  Our   best guess is for growth of around 1 percent in the current quarter  After that, several factors   should operate at about the same time to stimulate faster growth, including the stimulus from     8/21/01 22   monetary policy and a tax cut that has turned out to be timed almost perfectly  We should have a   better idea of how much of an effect it is having on consumer spending by our next meeting  In   addition, the substantial turnaround in energy prices this year should help to promote a pickup in   activity    For next year our forecast, which like the Greenbook assumes no further change in the   funds rate, shows real GDP growth increasing to more acceptable rates of around 3 percent  Of   course, there are some notable downside risks in the economy, having to do especially with   consumer spending and developments abroad  Overall, our forecast would leave labor and   product markets about in line with their average long-run utilization levels and there would be   little upward or downward pressure on inflation next year  We are looking for inflation in the   core PCE price index of just below 2 percent both this year and next  While it’s obviously good   that we don’t appear to be facing rising inflationary pressures, I think it’s also worth noting that   the current period of slow growth could be completed without the kind of reduction in inflation   that often accompanies such periods  This outcome would be disappointing since I certainly   would like to see a further modest decline in inflation over time  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, for me the policy choice is a close call  While I can   support the proposed easing, I do think there are some reasonable arguments for leaving the   funds rate unchanged at this time  First, there appears to be a consensus--supported by our   outlook, the Greenbook, and even the lower 10 percent of the Blue Chip panel of forecasters--  that there already is enough stimulus in the pipeline to produce a significant pickup in activity in   the next year or so Second, although I certainly hope you are correct in your expectation that     8/21/01 72   the inflation figures may turn out a bit better than most forecasts indicate, there is a chance that   the current period of slow growth will end with little or no reduction in inflation  So we might   be missing a chance for a little opportunistic progress on inflation  Third, we will know quite a   bit more by our October meeting, especially about the effects of the tax rebate  So an argument   can be made that we should wait for more information  While I’m concerned about these   considerations, I do support a 25 basis point cut in the funds rate as some insurance against   additional downside surprises for economic activity  I also would prefer to retain the balance of   risks statement weighted toward economic weakness    I had a question about Japan as well  When I look at the tables   in Part I of the Greenbook it seems stunning--I don’t know if that’s the right word--to see   with the addition of the forecast for 2003 what will be five years of deflation for Japan   and a pickup in economic growth that is quite modest  And, of course, we’ve seen those   projected pickups disappear in the past This certainly says something, I think, about the   effectiveness of their policy, not just in 2001 but over the next two-plus years  It surely   has some major economic implications but possibly political implications as well  I   wonder if you’d comment on that    Thank you    Mr Chairman, economic activity in the Twelfth District was   weak even before the terrorist attacks  Employment contracted in July and then was   nearly flat in August On net it fell about 1 percent at an annual rate in the two months    The main source of weakness was the high-tech sector  High-tech equipment   manufacturers have been shedding jobs all year and the pace of decline accelerated   substantially in July and August, with cuts at double-digit rates reported in California,   Arizona, and Oregon High-tech service providers also have been cutting jobs, including   the loss of over 5 percent of employment in that sector in the State of Washington during   July and August alone   The slowdown was also evident in other sectors such as construction  Vacancy   rates for office space have risen substantially in most metro areas, and home sales and   price appreciation have come down as well  The slowdown in construction activity so far   this year is most evident in the San Francisco Bay area, where the number of permits for   new homes is running 13 percent below last year’s numbers  Consumer spending and   confidence in the District, which had been holding up well in the spring and early     10/2/01 32   summer, showed signs of weakening in early September  Of course, these weaknesses   have been exacerbated in the aftermath of the attacks     The immediate economic effects of the attacks included substantial reductions   in consumer spending and some disruptions in business activity  Since then retail sales   among large discount stores have recovered, though sales at department stores have   remained depressed  As a result, for some apparel manufacturers clothing orders for   spring reportedly are running well below pre-attack expectations  By contrast,   construction activity in recent weeks has not been affected to any appreciable degree    However, the postponement or cancellation of some projects means that the pipeline is   not filling up as fast as before   The largest negative effects of the attacks have been on air travel and tourism,   as was indicated by President Moskow Due to the resulting bleak outlook, Boeing--and I   think our numbers about Boeing are similar to those presented by President Moskow--   immediately cut its estimated deliveries of commercial aircraft next year by 20 percent,   with substantial additional cuts expected in 2003  In Seattle as many as 20,000 jobs   could be lost at Boeing by the end of next year  District contacts have reported that   airline bookings have been running 50 percent or more below normal  And in cities like   San Francisco, where 85 percent of the hotel demand is derived from arrivals by air, hotel   occupancies are very low As a result, substantial layoffs are under way or planned by   airports, airlines, and firms in other segments of the travel industry  Although this has   been felt nationwide, the impact will be especially hard on some Twelfth District states   that have unusually large tourism and travel sectors, notably Nevada and Hawaii, whose   tourism sectors had already begun to struggle prior to the attacks        10/2/01 33   Let me turn to the national picture  I certainly won’t take exception to the   widely held view that the terrorist attacks probably ended any chance of avoiding   recession In this regard, a member of our staff has taken a careful look at the monthly   indicators and methods used by the NBER to date recessions He concludes that if, as   seems likely, activity falls enough in coming months for the NBER to declare a recession,   the business cycle peak could well be backdated to the first half of this year and perhaps   as early as March This date would represent a compromise among the unusually diverse   peaks in the various data series that the NBER relies upon     In any event, our forecast for the second half of this year is similar to that of   the Greenbook It shows a small decline in real GDP in the third quarter and a drop of   1/2 to 1 percent in the fourth quarter Assuming a funds rate of 2-1/2 percent, the most   likely scenario for next year seems to be a gradual pickup in growth, especially in   response to the easing of monetary policy as well as recent and expected fiscal actions    However, while growth should be more acceptable, it will likely remain well below the   potential rate for some time  The exceptionally large risks surrounding the outlook are   skewed to the weak side, especially in view of the potential hit to confidence that would   go along with likely military action and possible additional terrorism  Another risk is the   deepening stagnation of economies around the globe   We have revised down our inflation forecast by about 1/2 percent since the   August meeting, obviously in response to the greater expected slack in labor and product   markets and a lower path for oil prices, but also due to negative speed effects  Our best   estimate is for inflation of about 1-1/2 percent in the core PCE price index in 2002    Given the economic outlook as well as its downside risks, there is a strong argument for     10/2/01 34   implementing the additional cut in the funds rate that underlies our forecast and that in   the Greenbook Thank you    Don, I’d like to ask you and Dave a question about the chart   and table in the Bluebook on Chart 4 following page 10  We’ve talked a bit about the   equilibrium real rate as a way to measure the current stance of policy  If one believes that   the equilibrium real rate is within the range of the shaded areas, the range has gotten so   large that it leads one to believe, based on the Treasury inflation-indexed securities, that   our policy is incredibly expansive On the other hand, if one looks at some of the lower   estimates, particularly the one based on historical data and the staff forecast, it appears as   if we’re providing an anemic amount of stimulus  I was thinking that perhaps you have   some feelings or views about what rate within this historically wide range it might be   reasonable for us to focus on    So you think the degree of monetary ease is, pick one  huge,   moderate, or meager?    Thank you     10/2/01 81    I support your recommendation    Dave, I have a question and also a comment about the forecast  In looking   at the sources of weakness in the short term, a large portion of it comes from residential investment    It strikes me that there certainly are some positive fundamentals in this area  In September, for   example, starts continued to increase  Moreover, the financial fundamentals in housing are still quite   good and the falloff in permits was actually quite small  I can see that the negative effects of higher   unemployment rates and the impact on confidence might be playing a role, but why does that seem   to have so much of a role in the residential sector and, in my view, not much of a role in personal   consumption expenditures?  I ask because in your forecast personal consumption expenditures in the   current quarter and even in the subsequent quarter aren’t all that weak    Eight-tenths of a percentage point of the decline in real GDP this quarter is   due to residential investment, and that’s a small sector    I also have a comment about the partial expensing investment tax   incentive Given that the proposal is for a three-year period, and recognizing some of the points Al   Broaddus made--that the capacity utilization rate is so low and that the current economic situation is   so poor and likely to remain so for a while--why wouldn’t the resultant investment be back-loaded   more?  The lead times needed for much of the equipment are short  I don’t know how you made the   decision about how to spread out the investment, but as an alternative I think you clearly could have   spread it in a way that is much more back-loaded than you did    Have we gotten any greater visibility about what is likely to happen in   terms of Congressional action on this?    That incentive is for a period of months versus three years    Right    Mr Chairman, the fallout from the September 11 attacks has intensified   existing weakness in the Twelfth District economy  The high-tech sector has been struggling for the   past year and now the timeline for recovery has been pushed back by business firms in the aftermath   of the attacks The latest figures show that California’s high-tech manufacturers reduced payrolls by   more than 12,000 in the third quarter alone, which accounts for nearly half of the 29,000 jobs lost on   net in the state The impact has been especially visible in the San Francisco Bay area office market   where vacancy rates recently rose above those in Los Angeles for the first time in recent memory    And with struggling companies accounting for much of the space made available through subleases,   the full financial effect on landlords has yet to be felt       11/6/01 27   More generally, construction activity has fallen throughout the District in recent months   and a sharp drop in September may herald further weakening    It’s primarily commercial  Southern California had been the main pocket   of economic vitality in the District through August, showing substantial strength in housing demand   and population-based services like education and health  But weak September employment numbers   suggest that the slowdown may be taking hold there as well  The slowdown in southern California   will be exacerbated by the ongoing reduction in travel spending resulting from the terrorist attacks   Compared to most areas of the country, the Twelfth District is somewhat more exposed to the travel   slowdown, with states such as Hawaii and Nevada relying heavily on tourism dollars  Although   travel sectors overall are less critical to District activity than the high-tech sector, a continued   slowdown in travel activity on the order of 10 to 15 percent will reduce District growth noticeably    Some impacts of the travel slowdown already are evident, with the latest data on new   unemployment insurance claims confirming a sharp increase in District layoffs, especially in Hawaii   and Nevada, in the weeks following the attacks  And Seattle will soon feel the impact as well when   Boeing initiates production cuts and implements its planned layoffs of up to 20,000 commercial   aircraft workers there Moreover, state and local governments and their creditors are on alert in   much of the District as many areas expect significant revenue shortfalls of up to 8 percent this fiscal   year compared to pre-September 11 predictions  The negative impacts of the travel slowdown will   be offset somewhat by increased spending on military hardware in some areas, including weapons   systems manufactured in Arizona and southern California  However, the amounts spent by the   federal government are likely to represent only a partial offset, especially in the short term     11/6/01 28   Let me now turn to the macro picture  An official recession this year appears   unavoidable With the October employment report, the data in hand now have the depth and   duration to declare a recession Furthermore, given last summer’s weakness in various monthly   indicators, it seems likely that the start of the present recession will be dated back into the spring    Looking ahead, the recession in our forecast is not as deep as the Greenbook’s  But our projected   recovery next year develops more slowly than in the Greenbook forecast  Assuming a funds rate of   2-1/4 percent, we anticipate a more gradual pickup in growth, largely in response to monetary and   fiscal policy actions  This recovery primarily mirrors the unusually gradual slowdown over the past   year It took a year for real GDP to decelerate slowly from growth of about 1-1/2 percent during the   second half of last year to last quarter’s decline of 04 percent  This slow erosion of growth reflected   a long sequence of causal shocks the jump in energy prices, the slowing in demand abroad, the   bursting of the asset price bubble, the related re-evaluation of desired capital stocks, and, of course,   the events of September 11th Some recessions in the past resulted from one big shock, but this one   seems to have had many causes  The unwinding of these many shocks also will take time, and in our   forecast, recovery progresses fairly slowly     Our inflation forecast is little revised  Our best estimate is for inflation of about 1-1/2   percent in the core CPE price index in 2002  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Wow!    Mr Chairman, I agree with your preference for a 50 basis point cut in the   funds rate For me the downside risks to the outlook are sizable as illustrated by emerging data,   which keep signaling lower and lower forecasts for real GDP growth  Also, as noted in the   Bluebook and commented on by Governor Meyer and by you, a larger preemptive easing move now   may reduce the risk of being constrained later by the zero nominal interest rate bound  I think that’s   another compelling reason to do 50 basis points at this time    Or how about just the “reallocation of resources”?    “May restrain advances?”    I’d like to ask two short questions  The first one is to Dave Stockton and   perhaps Don Kohn In the Greenbook and also the Monday morning briefing there was a report about   the Michigan survey of one-year-ahead inflation expectations, indicating that it dropped to 28 percent   in September, to 1 percent in October, to 04 percent in November, and then bounced back to 16   percent in December  It seems to me that there’s some potentially very interesting information there    After all, we’re very much interested in what is happening to the real federal funds rate  I just   wondered how those data, admittedly volatile but still considerably below what we have been looking   at in the recent past, are influencing your views about the real interest rate as far as the fed funds rate   is concerned?    So, you don’t think policy is as easy as you previously thought?    I’d also like to ask Dave Howard a quick question  The revision to the   forecast for Japan is pretty stunning, particularly real growth being revised down 1/2 percent in 2002    In addition, there’s deflation in every quarter through 2003  One has to begin to wonder about the   impact of this in the financial sector  My question is  What is your current view about the   probabilities of a crisis in the financial sector in Japan in light of this possible forecast outcome for the   next two years?    Thank you     12/11/01 25     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in the Twelfth District   have been weak, but there were a few signs of improvement recently  It’s now clear that the terrorist   attacks severely damaged economic conditions in tourist-dependent areas  In October, travel-related   employment fell about 3 percent in Hawaii and Nevada  Significant losses were evident in most other   states as well and on net the District’s transportation and services sectors contracted substantially  As   a result of the shrinkage in these sectors and others, new claims for unemployment insurance surged   and unemployment rates increased noticeably in most areas  Since mid-October the surge in such   claims has receded somewhat but the levels of claims remain elevated, suggesting that unemployment   rates in these areas probably rose in November as well  The San Francisco Bay area has seen rapid job   destruction all year, especially among high-tech companies  Unemployment there has increased by   around 11,000 people per month since the first of the year and that pace doubled in October    Accordingly, the share of job losers in California’s unemployment pool has risen  And if   unemployment durations last as long as usual, we’re likely to see additional increases in the   unemployment rate in the future       12/11/01 27    On the positive side, housing markets remain healthy  A primary exception is the San   Francisco Bay area where home prices have started to decline a bit  But in most other areas, demand   for new and existing homes has been solid and the pace of residential construction remains high     Moreover, industry output and sales figures show some indication of a turnaround in high-  tech manufacturing  At this point, however, a rebound in demand for high-tech equipment that is   strong enough to get the industry back on a solid growth track does not appear imminent  And with   Boeing committed to cutting about 15,000 jobs nationwide between December 14th and January 25th--  most of them on the West Coast--the outlook for the District’s manufacturing sector more generally   remains weak in the near term    Also troubling are the District’s state and local fiscal positions, which have deteriorated   further since we last met  Most states have cut or have proposed cutting agency budgets by up to 15   percent and several have frozen hiring as well  This will put a damper on economic activity,   especially in California, where growth in state and local government jobs has been a key factor   supporting continued expansion in Southern California and the Central Valley this year     Let me turn to the national picture  The weakness in November employment put a bit of a   damper on the generally more positive tone of recent economic data  Still, there are more positive   signs that I believe are worth noting  Car and truck sales have been outstanding in October and   November  Of course, that reflects a temporary surge in response to zero interest rate financing deals    Still, I believe it is encouraging from the standpoint of consumers’ confidence in the future that so   many people are willing to undertake such commitments  The recent increase in the admittedly   volatile new orders series also is encouraging, especially since the surge was led by orders for   computers and semiconductors, sectors that had led the recession  And finally, even though third-  quarter productivity growth was revised down recently, I believe the 1-1/2 percent increase is robust     12/11/01 28    considering the decline in real output in that quarter  Relatively strong productivity growth over the   past year reinforces the view that the economy is cycling around a trend growth rate that continues to   be significantly higher than the one that prevailed before the mid-1990s     Overall, recent data seem broadly consistent with our forecast as well as the Greenbook’s   that the recession is likely to be relatively mild  And financial market developments since our   November meeting reflect greater confidence in that view  The steepening trajectory for federal funds   and Eurodollar futures rates is notable in this regard     Our forecast shows a drop in real GDP of 1-3/4 percent in the current quarter  We’re   assuming another 25 basis point cut in the funds rate at this meeting and we anticipate a rather gradual   pickup in growth in response to monetary and fiscal actions in combination with the end of the   inventory and investment cycles  The recovery in 2002 in our forecast is less pronounced than that in   the Greenbook in part because we are a bit skeptical about how quickly firms would take advantage of   the proposed partial expensing rules for investment  Of course, such legislation has to pass   Our inflation forecast is little revised, with slack in labor and product markets holding the   increase in the core PCE price index to just over 1-1/4 percent in 2002  While the recession appears   likely to be fairly mild at the present time, that outcome is quite vulnerable to the possibility of   negative shocks It’s not difficult to come up with a list of candidates  Confidence is fragile and could   be adversely affected by expected increases in unemployment, a negative turn in the war, or more   terrorist activity A large decline in equity or real estate values could deepen the recession  And given   the deadlock in Congress, it’s not clear how much additional fiscal spending or fiscal stimulus will be   forthcoming  Thus, even though it seems likely that economic growth will rebound next year without   any further policy action, a case could be made for an additional easing of policy as a bit more   insurance Thank you     12/11/01 29     Mr Chairman, it seems fairly likely to me that economic recovery would   occur next year without any further easing of monetary policy  However, that outcome is vulnerable   to a number of negative shocks that could hit the economy at any time  With inflation well in hand   and Federal Reserve credibility in good shape, I believe we have the flexibility to respond to these     12/11/01 86    risks Therefore, I strongly support your recommendation of a 25 basis point reduction in the funds   rate as some insurance against downside risks  I also prefer a balance of risk statement that   emphasizes economic weakness    Isn’t a lot of the debt denominated in dollars?    Right     March 19, 2002 Page 8 of 117   Mr Chairman, in spite of their shortcomings as well as their advantages, I   think that both alternatives, as well as the ACF, are probably going to have to be arrows in the   quiver for SOMA at some point  So at some time in the future, certainly after the contingency   studies are completed, I think we ought to proceed  It’s not immediately obvious to me which   option should be addressed first I would say, though, that the experience of the last year   certainly indicates to us that things can change very dramatically in terms of the fiscal position of   the US government as well as what we’re seeing with regard to currency  I don’t know how   cautious we should be I think we ought to move with good dispatch or aggressively after we’ve   dealt with the contingency issues    I think we came out at the right place in terms of the announcement and   how it would be done The only issue that I thought might at some point be worth more   discussion is when the blackout should end There’s a certain logic to having it end at the close   of the day on Thursday Having it terminate at the end of Friday means in effect that it really   ends Monday morning  It’s no big deal Sometimes it’s great to have an excuse not to accept a   speech assignment  But I think there is a logic to having it end on Thursday after the release of   the minutes    Thank you Karen, in Japan one hears a great deal about the amount and   speed with which manufacturing is being moved to other parts of Asia where costs are   significantly lower, particularly in the high-tech sector  Does that suggest that this outsourcing   of manufacturing in Japan will lead to a different response on the part of Japan to growth in other   parts of the world?  Will Japan perhaps not experience quite as much strength as has been the   case in the past when economic activity picked up throughout the world?    It may be that the currency would have to move more to accomplish the   same amount of stimulus    Thank you    Mr Chairman, our contacts indicate that economic conditions in the   Twelfth District are improving, although areas of weakness remain that could restrain the pace of   recovery District contacts report a pickup in economic activity over the past several weeks, and   job growth has turned positive in most states  The turnaround appears to be broad-based across   sectors but is especially solid in those industries hit hardest by the aftermath of September 11    Recent job growth has helped keep the District’s unemployment rate steady despite strong labor   force growth However, it remains a buyer’s market, with numerous job applicants to choose   from and little or no upward pressure on wage inflation     Despite broad signs of recovery throughout the District, areas of weakness do exist    Commercial construction is a prime example  Dramatic declines in the demand for office space   in 2001 left many commercial real estate markets in the District with excess supply  In some   IT-sensitive areas, vacancies more than doubled, and lease rates dropped 40 percent  Although   contacts report that conditions in commercial office markets have begun to stabilize, it’s likely to   be some time before we see any significant resumption of new commercial construction    Durable goods manufacturing is another area that may be slow to recover  The District’s durable   manufacturing sector depends heavily on exports, especially to Asia  The value of District   exports has been falling consistently since the end of 2000, with especially large declines in   exports to Japan Given the ongoing strength of the dollar and our disproportionate exposure to   some of the weakest global economies, a rapid turnaround in export demand for District   manufactured goods does not appear imminent         March 19, 2002 Page 45 of 117  The strength of the District’s recovery in coming months will depend heavily on the IT    sector Conditions in that sector have improved in recent months  For example, orders, sales,   and output among IT firms in the District have risen, and the pace of job loss in the IT sector has   eased However, we might not see significant improvement in profits and payrolls for some    time, and a lagging recovery in the IT sector could well slow the District’s return to full strength    Turning to the national picture, my interpretation of the economic news since we met in   January is broadly consistent with the consensus  The data have been decidedly on the positive   side, suggesting that the recession is over; the trough may well be dated at December or January    We’ve revised up noticeably our forecast of real GDP growth both for the current quarter and for   all of 2002 This revision includes, I might add, a steady tightening of monetary policy   beginning in the second half of this year until the funds rate in our forecast reaches 4 percent in   the second half of 2003   Our forecast looks a lot like the one in the Greenbook, with growth of real GDP of   3¼ percent in the current quarter, 3½ percent in 2002, and 4¼ percent next year  Faster growth   this year and next is accounted for mainly by a swing in business investment, both for inventories   and for equipment and software  Since we now expect current excess capacity in labor and   product markets to evaporate faster than we did before, our revised inflation forecast for 2003 is   up about ¼ percentage point, with the core PCE price index rising by just under 1½ percent    That is about the same as we expect for this year     I believe it’s too soon to begin raising the funds rate at this meeting, but we’ll probably   need to start this process before long How much and how quickly we tighten will depend   importantly on where we want inflation to end up  Typically, inflation is lower in the year after a   recession than in the year before, and that appears likely to happen this time around as well  At     March 19, 2002 Page 46 of 117  issue is whether these declines in inflation will be permanent  The latest edition of the Blue Chip   economic indicators shows a long-run ten-year consensus forecast for inflation of 2¼ percent for   the GDP price index and 2¾ percent for the CPI  So it would seem that many business   economists, at least, expect us to let inflation rise from recent levels  I’d like to see us hold the   line at around 1½ percent for the core PCE price index  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Vince, this exercise is very interesting  If you were to show me the   bottom two charts of exhibit 3, I think I would talk a long time  about the attractiveness of the   blue line, particularly relating it to some of the studies we’ve had in previous meetings about the   zero bound I’m troubled, though, that that outcome occurs by tightening policy a year from    now I’m troubled in the sense that it’s hard for me to believe, and I don’t know if I can   articulate that concern well  Could you help me understand your analysis a bit?  I ask because I   see in the forecast what I view as rather strong economic activity and, given the long lags   involved, to wait another year seems to me to be extremely dangerous, although I clearly see big   advantages to that alternative outcome      Very interesting Thank you    I also endorse both parts of your recommendation  And I think that   you’ve articulated well the kinds of challenges we’re likely to face at the next meeting  Thank   you    But there’s an interest arbitrage condition    Dave, in the baseline forecast you assumed that the prices of equities   would increase through the end of next year In view of the concern about corporate earnings               May 7, 2002 22 of 81  and also the fact that almost every valuation model suggests that equity markets are overvalued, I   wonder if you could elaborate a bit on the reasons why that assumption was chosen    Thank you    Mr Chairman, economic recovery is taking hold in most of the West, as   indicated by the modest increase in District employment in recent months  One lagging area is   the Pacific Northwest, reflecting that region’s dependence on high-tech manufacturing and   aerospace Consumer spending and confidence are up in the West at about the same pace as in   the nation, supporting growth in many of the service-producing sectors  This includes travel and   tourism, although that sector has not yet fully recovered from its September 11 setback   Residential real estate markets are holding up well  In California we’re hearing more   about multiple bids and selling prices above asking prices for existing homes  These high and   rising home prices combined with low new house inventories are stimulating construction,   though not to the point where we’re seeing many speculative building projects  Commercial real   estate, however, is not doing well This is especially true in San Francisco  In the city the   overall vacancy rate is approaching 20 percent  And in Silicon Gulch—the neighborhood in the   city of San Francisco that was home to the dot-com boom—the tech slump has pushed the rate to   nearly 50 percent   For businesses more generally, “caution” is the appropriate byword  With many firms   satisfied to wait awhile before making technology upgrades, the weakness in high-tech services   in California continues to be a drag on the economy  For most high-tech manufactured products,         May 7, 2002 27 of 81  demand is still off, and firms indicate that they have capacity to spare  However, we see some   signs that conditions are firming  Many businesses are removing hiring freezes  In Idaho, for   example, Micron Technology is hiring again and has rescinded earlier salary cuts  Outside the   telecom sector at least, the tendency is to postpone rather than to cancel capital investments   State and local governments continue to deal with the fallout from the recession  This is   especially true in California where the recession, along with a decline in income from stock   options and capital gains, led to substantially slower growth in personal income last year     For the national economy, our forecast reflects a set of fundamental trends that are   similar to those in the Greenbook  While real final sales will likely rise only modestly this   quarter, the growth rate picks up gradually through the end of next year, largely because of an   acceleration in business spending on equipment and software  However, inventory investment is   expected to account for less output growth next year than it did this year  As a result, in our   forecast real GDP growth averages about 4 percent in both years, even after accounting for a   substantial anticipated tightening of monetary policy over the next four quarters    We see little evidence of inflation pressures outside the energy sector, with the core PCE   price index expected to come in at 1½ percent or slightly lower both this year and next  Our   output and inflation forecasts reflect the effects of a modest upward revision in our estimate of   potential real GDP growth, which we have made in response to the surprisingly strong   performance of productivity during the recession and, of course, last quarter as well  It’s true   that a good deal of the extraordinary increase in productivity during the last two quarters is   temporary, representing a response to the uncertainties following September 11  However, it’s   also possible that some of the productivity growth is a lagged response to the huge amounts of   equipment and software investment that firms made during the late 1990s As we discussed at         May 7, 2002 28 of 81  our June 2001 meeting, it often takes time for workers and firms to make efficient use of new   investments  So it also takes time for the full effects to become evident in the productivity data    It seems likely that at least some of the recent strong productivity growth warrants a more   optimistic view of underlying productivity growth going forward  I must admit that I’ve been   surprised that financial markets have reacted so negatively to the mixed evidence contained in   recent monthly data releases and have seemed to shrug off the implications of recent evidence on   productivity   I agree with the standard list of downside risks to the outlook the stock market, the price   of oil, and corporate profits At the same time, I believe that productivity growth represents a   significant upside risk to our real GDP forecast, as illustrated by an alternative simulation in the   Greenbook That simulation shows that faster productivity growth would mean less inflation   over the next couple of years as the unemployment rate is temporarily boosted and growth in unit   labor costs is temporarily depressed  So the upside potential for real GDP growth from a   positive productivity surprise actually gives us more breathing room in deciding when to begin   raising the funds rate  Thank you    Don, I have a question about the perfect foresight policy  I think that’s a   very useful exercise, and one thing that’s interesting to me is that there is an assumption that the   value of the dollar depreciates at a rate of 3 percent per year  That certainly is reasonable, but   our experience of recent years suggests that other outcomes are possible  So I think it would be   interesting to know what the effect of different assumptions for the dollar would be  For   example, if the dollar didn’t depreciate or even appreciated at 3 percent per year, I have a feeling   that the perfect foresight policy would be very different  It probably would indicate relative to   the baseline that we would have a lot more leeway in terms of when policy would have to change   and also how rapidly rates would have to increase in the future    Well, it would be interesting to know the degree of sensitivity of that on   the perfect foresight policy discussion    Okay Thank you    I agree    But didn’t the turnaround occur in nonfinancial commercial paper?    David, in the Greenbook forecast the growth rate has been revised down a   full percentage point, roughly, for the second half and about 06 percentage point for next year    It seemed to me in looking at the Greenbook that a very large portion of that change was a result   of the annual revisions and the effects of those revisions on productivity and potential  Not   much of the change appeared to be due to what I guess was referred to in yesterday’s Board   briefing as the “headwinds” and some of the negatives you’ve been talking about that have   affected the economy very recently  Would you agree with that assessment, or do I have those   proportions differently parsed?    Thank you    Mr Chairman, economic activity in the West continues to expand but at a   modest pace Lackluster job growth, stock market volatility, and the daily announcements of   corporate scandals have worked to damp consumer confidence in the West in recent weeks    More-uncertain consumers appear to have reined in spending somewhat, especially on   nondiscounted products Consumers also have pulled back on investment activity, prompting   another round of layoffs at local brokerage firms  Charles Schwab, for example, recently   announced that it will lay off 1,000 more people in coming quarters, about 5 percent of its   current staff On the bright side, aggressive pricing practices have kept car sales robust, and   home sales continue to increase, although there are some signs that real estate markets are   cooling Visitor counts and travel spending also improved in the District, driven by solid   increases in domestic demand  Although job growth remained subdued in most District states,   productivity growth likely has kept output expanding  However, District growth probably is not   outpacing the rest of the nation, as we appear to have lost most of our productivity growth   advantage over the last year     The District’s high-tech sector has continued to expand recently but at a more subdued   pace than many had expected  Demand for personal computers, consumer electronics, and   telecommunications equipment has fallen in recent months, moderating the outlook among   District semiconductor makers  Intel, the District’s largest chip producer, announced plans to lay         August 13, 2002 24 of 92  off 4,000 workers, and about half of Intel’s 83,000 employees actually reside in the Twelfth   District Conditions among software makers were mixed, with Microsoft announcing plans to   expand payrolls but firms like Oracle cutting costs to maintain profitability  Overall, District   technology contacts have pushed back their time frame for full recovery in the sector  Moreover,   a number of firms are saying that things may get slightly worse before they get better  The long   downturn in the tech sector is taking a toll on a number of District investment companies  The   technology-oriented investment bank, Robertson Stevens, closed its doors last month, as you all   know, letting go more than 800 employees  Venture capital firms also are feeling the strain  We    now expect a number of these firms to merge or to go out of business by the end of this year     I’d like to comment on the West Coast port situation  There’s no doubt that any work   disruption at West Coast ports would be extremely costly  However, the threat of such an action   either by labor or by management has diminished significantly over the last several weeks    Contract negotiations resume today, and our contacts believe that both sides are eager for a   settlement  As the probability of a strike has decreased, reports we’ve received of precautionary   importing on the part of firms have subsided   Turning to the national economy, while some recent news on real activity has been on the   weak side, we have lowered our forecast for GDP growth in the second half of this year only   about ½ percentage point, not nearly as much as the reduction in the Greenbook forecast  After   the surge in the first quarter, domestic demand has held up fairly well  We believe the   11 percent increase in real GDP in the second quarter gives an overly pessimistic impression, as   several temporary factors such as a spike in imports and mild winter weather probably restrained   second-quarter growth and boosted growth in the first quarter  Furthermore, real consumer   spending and disposable income turned up strongly in June, and auto sales, of course, jumped in         August 13, 2002 25 of 92  July Both of these developments bode well for third-quarter growth  I would add that I think   the retail sales data that we have just received are certainly supportive of that as well   In addition, I’m encouraged that real capital spending on equipment and software posted   a long-awaited increase last quarter  Of course, some other recent indicators of economic   activity have fallen short of expectations, especially payroll employment, aggregate hours, and   orders for capital goods Also, the roller coaster that financial markets have been riding should   sap some strength from the economy, particularly next year, although interest rates often have   tended to follow equity prices up and down and may have partially offset the damage     On balance, we continue to see a moderate expansion as the most likely outcome  In   particular, a double-dip still seems to be only a remote possibility  We anticipate growth in the   second half of this year of almost 3½ percent  Assuming a steady funds rate, we project real   GDP growth of about 4 percent in 2003, and we continue to expect inflation to remain well   contained, with the core PCE price index increasing about 1½ percent next year  I’d also say that   significant slack in resource utilization certainly remains, especially in manufacturing  However,   the current easy stance of monetary policy appears well calibrated to provide sufficient stimulus   to ensure economic recovery  Thank you    I have a question  In the Bluebook, the Taylor rule recommendation and   the recommendation of the perfect foresight simulations are quite different Which of those two   approaches would best really model or characterize past policy?    Okay, thank you    Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation with regard to the funds   rate At the time of the last meeting, the risks for the economy and inflation were fairly well   balanced But it seemed to me that there was some sense in the room that it would take quite a         August 13, 2002 81 of 92  bit to induce a further easing of policy and that the bar would be lower for shifting policy into a   tightening mode This time around I think we face a more evenly balanced set of risks    Therefore, I have a preference for retaining a balanced statement of risks, and I believe that we   could communicate our current concerns through the wording of the press statement without   changing the actual balance of risks sentence    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Dave, when I read the Greenbook one of the   things that struck me was how little inflation is projected to decline over the period  I appreciate   your taking the time to explain why that is the case  But it seems to me that over a two-year   period a more conventional rule of thumb—along the lines of what would come out from a   Phillips curve analysis—would have the inflation rate going down maybe not to where Al was   talking about but close to ½ percent  The chance of that happening doesn’t seem to me to be   small  I believe that there is some significant probability that it could occur  Did you think in   terms of what the chances were that some more traditional relationships could reassert   themselves and how significant that might be?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Twelfth District’s economic recovery   has been proceeding at a moderate pace, with perhaps a slight weakening this summer    Technology companies in the West continue to struggle with rapidly falling prices and weak   earnings Recent news from the sector indicates job reductions rather than expansions  In   California the pace of job losses among tech manufacturers slowed earlier this year but then   picked up again in July and August  And a recent drop in average hours worked in these sectors     September 24, 2002 31 of 115  confirms the weakening of labor demand  An exception in the District’s tech sector is Microsoft,   which recently announced plans to add 5,000 people to its workforce by mid-2003     More generally, total employment has been flat to down slightly in most parts of the   District in recent months  In California the unemployment rate actually fell in the last two   months, but this masks a drop in civilian employment that was, of course, more than offset by an   even larger drop in the number of job seekers  Some of the state’s job seekers may be   discouraged by rising long-term unemployment, which is a bit higher than in the rest of the   nation California also is struggling with a large state budget gap induced by a drop in revenues   that was due largely to extensive exposure of the state’s tax base to stock market fluctuations    Recently enacted spending cuts and tax increases equal nearly 1 percent of the value of total   output in the state And other budget-balancing measures shift the adjustment burden forward,   creating a likely drag on future economic growth     There is some positive news, however  Throughout the District,  household spending on   consumer durables and home purchases has been robust  After surging in the first quarter, home   sales have come down a bit but remain at high levels  And home prices have continued their   upward march to levels that are somewhat high relative to rental rates  However, the adjustment   necessary to bring prices back in line is not exceptionally large in most markets  Seattle and San   Diego are notable exceptions where home prices are significantly high relative to rental rates     The southern California economy has been the District’s most reliable source of   expansion this year, and it will soon receive an additional boost from several large Pentagon   contracts One of these will keep Boeing’s 7,000 worker facility in Long Beach open for years   to come  In Seattle, Boeing’s commercial aircraft division avoided a major strike on   September 13, when its largest union of 25,000 machinists voted to accept the contract offer         September 24, 2002 32 of 115  This improves the company’s immediate outlook, but it still faces significant challenges  The   strike was averted in part because soft demand strengthened Boeing’s bargaining position by   reducing potential strike costs And the underlying labor discontent may be a problem when   Boeing’s second largest union comes to the bargaining table on October 29  Labor unrest also   remains an issue at West Coast ports  But despite the long, bumpy negotiations and a few   limited work slowdowns in the past couple of weeks, the likelihood of a protracted slowdown or   stoppage remains low     For the national economy, our forecast for the near term and for the next year has   changed very little since the August meeting  Recent economic news has provided very mixed   signals, with spending indicators largely on the strong side while labor market indicators and   industrial output have been weak At the same time, financial markets have been volatile but   have not changed enough on balance to alter our outlook significantly   We continue to be on the optimistic side of the Greenbook with a forecast of 3¾ percent   and 3 percent growth in the current and fourth quarters of this year and 4 percent next year  An   alternative simulation in the Greenbook implies that one reason for this difference may be the   assumptions about the growth of structural productivity and potential output  We incorporate a   smooth path for structural productivity growth of just around 2½ percent for 2001 through 2003    This is well above the path in the Greenbook, which tends to vary more with the business cycle    Last year the Committee discussed the pros and cons of these alternative approaches in its first   special topic session, and I won’t get into that here  However, I do want to point out that this   issue has significant implications for the outlook at the present time   With regard to inflation, our forecast shows moderate increases of a bit over 1¼ percent   in the core PCE price index in the latter half of this year and also next year  Having expressed a        September 24, 2002 33 of 115  fairly sanguine view of the future, I have to admit to being a bit uneasy about prospects for the   economy  The reason is that most of the risks seem to be skewed to the downside  another   terrorist attack, war with Iraq, declines in house or equity values, and fragile business   confidence Based on our outlook and risk assessment, at this point I would see no reason to   change the current stance of policy  Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support both parts of your recommendation  I’m not yet   ready to lower rates, and I hope that the data we receive over the coming period will clarify the   issues we have discussed, although I doubt that they will clarify the situation greatly  My hope   also is that a decision can wait until the next meeting          No As a matter of fact, I think it’s a subset of the broader statement in   the first half of the sentence  I don’t think of it that way at all    Mr Chairman, starting out with the fifth point, it seems to me that it is a   very good staff study, and I hope that it will be released at some point for public comment and   discussion As for the options suggested for additional study, I favor consideration of the   purchase of Ginnie Mae securities  Where such fully federally guaranteed debt is available, there   is a presumption, I believe, that it should be included in our portfolio  And if I remember   correctly, at our previous meeting there was considerable support for looking at that alternative    I also like the proposal for the ACF  It seems to me that the experience we would get from the   ACF would be useful for creating a contingency ACF if that were needed  Given current   projections for the federal budget, however, we are not pressed for time on these alternatives      It may be useful to initiate small Ginnie Mae and ACF pilot programs in   order to gain some experience  You asked also about the timing  I would suggest, somewhat   arbitrarily, six to twelve months of further study of those two options and a subsequent update to   the Committee    Dave, in the near-term outlook in the Greenbook, especially through the   middle of next year, inventories are very lean  As a matter of fact, I think the inventory–sales   ratios reach historically low levels  Have you given any thought to how large and how likely the   upside risk to the forecast might be if inventories were actually larger than those assumed?        Thank you    Mr Chairman, Twelfth District economic activity has expanded further   recently, but the pace of growth is sluggish, and the District appears to be pulling down growth   in the national economy  After showing solid gains in the previous month, consumer spending   fell in September as households cut outlays on automobiles and smaller retail items as well    Home sales and construction activity have remained at high levels, but signs of cooling are         November 6, 2002 25 of 122  cropping up, including a sharp drop in the pace of existing-home sales in California during the   third quarter   Conditions in the District technology sector have weakened recently  Job cut   announcements by industry leaders HP and Sun Microsystems, and a mixed financial   performance in the sector as a whole, suggest that the industry continues to struggle  However,   there are a few bright spots  Recent strong financial performances of Microsoft and Internet-  based companies such as e-Bay, Amazon, and Yahoo indicate that the Internet and computer   services shake-out may be largely complete  This development and the focus on leading edge   manufacturing imply that the District tech sector is well positioned to participate in an eventual   recovery in demand for tech products nationwide  Boeing’s problems are likely to be longer-  term because of weak travel demand and gains in market share by Airbus  Although Boeing has   nearly achieved its originally planned cuts of about 20,000 jobs in Washington State, it recently   announced that a further weakening of expected sales will require additional job cuts next year     After a volatile and frequently bitter month at West Coast ports, longshore workers and   shipping companies found common ground last Friday, tentatively agreeing on the introduction   of productivity-enhancing technology  The logjam broke when both sides relaxed some of their   prior demands  Under the compromise, shipping companies get to invest in labor-saving cargo-  tracking technology, potentially eliminating 600 union jobs  However, they will have to retain   current workers displaced by these technologies and give the ILWU the jurisdiction over any   new jobs created by the investments  Actually, I think the number of new jobs created by these   investments is probably going to be about one-tenth of the number of jobs displaced by them    No, it has not But both sides made concessions to reach an agreement on   technology, and that has been the major stumbling block  There are other issues, but that’s the   major one  Although talks still could break down over pensions and arbitration, clearing the   technology hurdle substantially eased tensions between the two parties  That being said,   operations at West Coast ports have yet to return to normal  The pace of work remains well   below capacity at ports throughout the West  And in some ports, the backlogs of container ships   have hardly shrunk at all since the workers returned in early October This is particularly true at   LA/Long Beach, which of course is the largest port  Only the port of Seattle has completely   recovered from the lockout, having no ships queued in the harbor at the present time  More   generally, congestion, truck and railcar imbalances, and periodic work disruptions have delayed   deliveries and shipments and boosted freight costs for many District businesses  Companies   have reported that deliveries and shipments are running one to four weeks behind schedule  The   largest delays are for automobiles moving through the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach    Ongoing disruptions have prompted some retailers to accelerate their shipment schedules in   order to get merchandise in stores for the holiday sales season  In a preemptive move, Target   stores reportedly chartered a ship in Asia in mid-October and moved cargo to be sold in the   December holiday season through the port of Seattle  Target usually would ship through Los   Angeles and Long Beach three to four weeks before it needs to have the goods in its stores  With   shipping problems continuing, we are hearing many reports of congestion fees for the use of   ports, rising truck and warehousing costs, and the near doubling of airfreight charges for new   clients   Turning to the national economy, obviously recent data have been disappointing The   31 percent growth rate for third-quarter real GDP was not very encouraging, given the large             November 6, 2002 27 of 122  contribution from the temporary surge in autos  Moreover, both business investment and   personal consumption expenditures weakened as the quarter progressed, even outside of motor   vehicles And, of course, the October employment report provided little reason to believe that   this period of weakness is behind us   While our near-term forecast remains somewhat higher than that in the Greenbook, the   revisions since September are similar  We have revised down growth in the current quarter by   more than 1 percentage point, to 1¾ percent We continue to believe that we are likely to see a   modest expansion in the economy next year  However, recent developments dimmed prospects   somewhat for the first half of next year  The recent weakening in capital goods orders is   especially worrisome since capital goods investment is critical to a rebound in economic activity   next year Overall in our forecast, real GDP growth does not rise above its potential rate until the   second half of next year, and the economy ends 2003 with considerable excess capacity  Under   these circumstances, we expect inflation to trend down, with the core PCE index rising by   1½ percent in 2003 and 1¼ percent in 2004 I would add, somewhat similar to what Dave talked   about in terms of the Greenbook, that analysis at our Bank—based on historical inflation forecast   errors—finds that the risk of outright deflation in 2003 and 2004 appears to be quite small  It   seems to me that the case for easing policy is strong  There is little inflation threat, recent data   have been weak, and significant geopolitical risks appear to weigh on the economy  Thank you    Mr Chairman, to me it makes a lot of sense to go with the 50 basis point   cut, one that is large enough to have a noticeable effect  My main concern about this large cut is   that it might send the message that the economy is weaker than we currently think  But by   adopting a risk assessment that is balanced I believe we mitigate that possibility  So I think in   combination it’s the right choice    David, my question is related somewhat to the interchange you had with   Michael Moskow about deflation  I had a chance to look at the Board staff’s domestic   nonfinancial briefing and the exercise of estimating the probability of attaining deflation, as you   define it, over a four-quarter period I was struck by how large that probability is  I wondered   what level of concern you had about that probability; 28 percent is not a small number  We had   done a similar exercise for a previous meeting, but we didn’t have quite the same definition  I   actually like your definition better because I think it is more realistic in terms of assuming a   ½ percentage point error in the core PCE measure of inflation  How did the probability numbers   strike you when you got those results?     This may be more like a China version of deflation, where the deflation   probably reflects what is happening to productivity    Right, and for growth    What would the numbers be if you used the post-1983 period?    That would be interesting    I am!    David, I agree with the points you made about the timing of those   spending cuts in California  But that’s because the budget deficit is about $6 billion in the   current fiscal year and an estimated $21 billion in the subsequent year  So these announced cuts   are only part of the program      If they’re going to get to a balanced budget            December 10, 2002 27 of 87   I think they’re meeting this week to figure out how they’re going to do the   rest of it because what has been proposed so far—the numbers that David mentioned—are   mainly cuts in spending, half of which are in education because that’s half the budget  I’m sure   there are short-term actions they can take, but those actions probably are not going to be the   solution to the problem    Yes, I did see it It struck me as a very surprising number  I can’t   remember who made that comment    I don’t know, but I’ll take a look at that    Mr Chairman, the economic recovery in the West has proceeded   sluggishly in recent weeks, although some tentative signs point to a pickup in momentum going   forward Many District customers remained on the sidelines in October and much of November             December 10, 2002 42 of 87  However, early tallies of holiday retail sales indicate that consumers in the West may have re­  engaged Store traffic is high, and sales are stronger than retailers expected  Several retailers   have had to place additional orders for the hottest selling items     The tone in the housing market has moderated some, with buyers less eager than they   were earlier this year We’re beginning to hear about buyers canceling contracts and actually   forfeiting deposits Some builders have responded by delaying construction  In San Francisco,   work on some multifamily properties has been put on hold  Elsewhere, start times for residential   developments have been pushed back  Overall, however, housing is still solid, and builders are   optimistic about the future and are investing time and money acquiring permits to build once the   economy improves     Job growth in the District has been lackluster, in part reflecting businesses’ preoccupation   with reducing costs Several financial and tech firms announced additional layoffs as a part of   cost-cutting measures  Businesses more generally are emphasizing productivity gains to improve   margins  One retail consultant noted that she now spends more time helping firms to increase   output per worker than she does helping them to boost market share  Some contacts indicate that   the focus on productivity has begun to boost profits, likely easing pressure for additional layoffs   The closure of West Coast ports in October disrupted vessel traffic and increased   shipping times and costs well into November  For the most part, however, goods continued to   move Businesses worked around the disruptions by diverting cargo to other ports and by   shifting to other modes of transportation  Available data and reports from contacts indicate only   modest amounts of preemptive importing     The good news is that the backlog of ships is cleared, as are most ground transportation   bottlenecks More important, a tentative contract settlement between longshore workers and               December 10, 2002 43 of 87  shipping lines on November 23 makes further port closures unlikely  The contract will be put to   a vote in early January  Most people familiar with the negotiations and the settlement expect the   contract to be ratified   In contrast to most other District sectors, there is little room for optimism in commercial   real estate markets Vacancies have increased, and lease rates have fallen in several areas, in part   because a number of IT and financial companies did not renew leases  Pessimism about   recovery in commercial markets is leading some developers to look to residential development as   an alternative In Silicon gulch, which was the home to San Francisco’s dot-com boom,   developers are pushing the city to allow mixed commercial-residential properties to be converted   to residential only   Turning to the national picture, the economic data that came in since we last met have   been on the weak side We basically agree with the Greenbook forecast and expect weak growth   in the current quarter Some of this weakness can be expected to spill over into next year, though   maybe in a fairly limited way  Recent data on holiday spending and auto sales suggest that the   payback effect from the third quarter may be dissipating  And uncertainty appears to have   receded to some extent, at least as gauged by measures of risks in the bond and stock markets     Overall, the longer-term outlook seems reasonably good and the risks relatively balanced    Our forecast shows growth picking up from 3 percent in the first half of next year to 4 percent in   the second half We see downside and upside risks to economic activity going forward  Of   course, the geopolitical situation remains a risk But on the upside we have been surprised by the   rapid productivity growth And we continue to believe a good deal of this reflects fundamental   technological change that will bolster growth  Our inflation outlook is about the same as in early               December 10, 2002 44 of 87  November; we expect the core PCE index to rise 1½ percent next year and 1¼ percent in 2004    Thank you    Brian, I’d like to ask you a question about the path for monetary policy in   chart 4 in the Bluebook, which is right before page 9  The chart in question is at the upper left   The Greenbook path for the funds rate is above the perfect foresight alternative for about a year   and then falls below it I have two questions about that  First, could you talk a little about why   that path was chosen?  And second, if we go for a period of a year, say, where the path is above   the perfect foresight alternatives, is there a risk that markets might begin to think that our   inflation objective is below 1 percent?               December 10, 2002 70 of 87   But there is an implied view about policy    And that’s better because?               December 10, 2002 71 of 87   I agree, but there is an implied objective function in what does get put into   the baseline, and I think it had some interesting characteristics this time    I agree    I agree again [Laughter]     Second     Dave, a common theme of many forecasts is that a gradual slowing of   consumer spending, especially for durables and residential investment, will be more than offset   by a pickup in business investment  Somewhat in contrast to that, the Greenbook forecasts   considerable strength in spending for durables and for residential investment  As a matter of   fact, such spending accelerates in the second half of the year, and expenditures for durable goods   grow 8 percent in 2004 with market rates, on Treasuries in particular, rising  I was wondering if   you could comment on why the projection shows that strength and if you think it might be fairly   optimistic     There is a mention of an increase in Treasury rates     Thank you     Mr Chairman, economic expansion in the West remained sluggish in the   recent weeks  District consumers reined in spending in February and early March, making   profitability a challenge for many retailers  A number of District auto dealers also faced more   difficult times as unit sales and profit margins fell  Rising gasoline prices apparently constrained   sales of SUVs, leaving several dealers with excess inventories  One contact noted that   manufacturers’ incentives are no longer enough to entice borrowers  Customers want dealer   discounts as well   Like consumers, many firms also have hit the pause button, postponing investment and   hiring decisions until the future looks clearer  Some notable firms in the IT sector are actually   scaling back  Micron Technology of Boise, Applied Materials of Santa Clara, and Agilent of   Palo Alto recently announced plans to lay off 10 percent or more of their respective workforces    A large San Francisco IT oriented investment firm said it will release up to 20 percent of its   workforce over the next several months    March 18, 2003 35 of 101    State and local governments in the West have been handing out pink slips as well    Several thousand California teachers received layoff warnings in recent weeks, joining the ranks   of park rangers, reserve fire fighters, and library staff  Elsewhere in the District, states are   looking at salary cuts and program reductions rather than layoffs to balance budgets    California’s credit rating is now tied with Louisiana’s for last place after a round of downgrades   by major rating agencies  Although these downgrades increased states’ borrowing costs, our   estimates indicate that the increase will be small relative to the size of the budget and the budget   deficit  While state budgets have constrained government spending in the West, federal   increases for defense and homeland security expenditures have been a significant positive for the   District  The importance of defense dollars to the West can be seen at Boeing, where defense-   related business has helped offset declines in the commercial aircraft side  Boeing now employs   more people in the defense systems units than in commercial jets     Turning to the national economy, recent data have been negative on balance  Given these   data and intermeeting financial developments, we have lowered our expectations of growth this   year, even after allowing for some further easing of monetary policy  We now expect that real   GDP will grow 3 percent this year versus 3½ percent last time  As a result, excess capacity rises   further over the next few quarters, which puts downward pressure on core inflation  The core   PCE price index is now forecast to go up by just 1¼ percent in 2004  Along with the weaker   forecast we have heightened concerns about the potential downside  The longer the economy   remains partially paralyzed by high energy prices and uncertainty, the more serious the downside   risks  Our forecast that the pace of output growth will pick up during this year depends on   business fixed investment rebounding before consumer spending falters  Recent data on retail   sales and auto sales have not been reassuring in this regard  And there is as yet no convincing   March 18, 2003 36 of 101    evidence that investment spending is ready to take up the slack  Of course, the situation in Iraq   is contributing to some extent to the recent deterioration in economic activity  However, it’s not   certain that a quick favorable outcome is imminent or that such a resolution would provide an   immediate boost to the economy that would remove the need for additional stimulus  Some in   the private sector have postponed hard-to-reverse investment and hiring decisions in the face of   uncertainty     As in the Greenbook, our most likely scenario shows subpar growth and rising excess   capacity for the next year  Also, I agree with my colleague, President Minehan, about the risks    While the risks on both sides are sizable, the downside risks to both inflation and output are of   much greater concern to me  In my view a significant easing of policy seems appropriate as a bit   more insurance that we could take against these downside risks  Thank you     Mr Chairman, although I think an economic case can be made for easing   policy, I support your recommendation  I would also suggest that the idea of having a   March 18, 2003 80 of 101    conference call strikes me as very useful  It may be that a call wouldn’t necessarily be scheduled   only for the purpose of considering a policy change  If we’re going to have the events that we’re   all anticipating imminently, it seems to me that a call next week or even—     I’m thinking only in terms of getting updates from the staff about how   things are unfolding, not in terms of any consideration of policy action     We did     Fine     David, I have a question about plant and equipment spending  In the last   forecast you indicated that geopolitical uncertainties and risks were likely to be taking a toll on   businesses’ plans for equipment and software spending  Of course, to some extent those   concerns have been resolved, but the forecast for plant and equipment spending in the second   half of the year has been revised down significantly  Does that suggest that there are more-  fundamental factors that have been at work for quite a few quarters in terms of the weakness in   plant and equipment spending?     One short follow-up question  The acceleration of equipment and   software spending in 2004 is quite marked  Is a significant portion of that due to the end of the   favorable tax treatment for equipment and software?     Thank you     Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District expansion continues to be sluggish but   seems only mildly affected by the Iraqi war and the SARS epidemic in East Asia  The main   impact of both events was a sharp reduction in international travel, especially from East Asia    As a result, airlines suspended some regularly scheduled East Asian flights, and load factors on   remaining flights fell by half or more  Some firms have reported increased difficulties in   maintaining overseas supply chains due to travel restrictions and scattered plant shutdowns in   May 6, 2003 28 of 115    East Asia  However, the production and supply effects of SARS have been quite limited to date,   and a recent pickup in domestic tourist travel suggests that war-induced anxieties are subsiding    More generally, the lack of bad news on the consumer side has been striking  Solid automobile   sales were fueled by generous incentives  And while sales of most small retail items have been   slow, they did not fall noticeably because of the war  Moreover, the existing vigor in housing   markets was largely maintained throughout the District   On the business side, firms have remained reluctant to expand employment or capacity in   anticipation of improved demand and bottom lines  Moreover, some firms stated that their   caution was not directly tied to the war with Iraq  Businesses have been investing in new   information technology equipment but mainly for replacement and upgrade purposes, and   District tech contacts are not especially sanguine about short-term prospects in the industry  For   example, the search for cost savings has led to increased reliance on overseas suppliers—  especially in China, where firms have undercut domestic production of some tech products  Of   course this has an upside as well, with US technology leaders such as Intel seeing strong   exports of their products for use in low cost assembly operations overseas   On a final negative note, District states are still struggling with budgetary woes  Revenue   flows have been uneven lately; and despite some successful efforts to bring spending in line,   most District states still face a large current year budget gap  Moreover, preliminary data for   April suggest that revenue in California may fall below even the more modest targets that it set   in January  That increases the need for borrowing and for other measures to ensure short-term   cash flow   Let me turn to the national economy  In light of weaker-than-expected economic data,   we like nearly everyone else revised down our real GDP forecast for this year  We now project   May 6, 2003 29 of 115    growth of about 2¾ percent, which is below most estimates of the potential rate  The risks to the   outlook have shifted in a favorable direction with the end of the armed conflict in Iraq, and it’s   certainly possible that this will lead to the rebound in activity that we’ve been looking for  But   substantial downside risks related to external developments remain, including the aftermath of   the war and ongoing geopolitical concerns, as do the risks from a well-known list of more   fundamental domestic economic concerns  These downside risks, combined with the   expectations for subpar growth, could have rather serious consequences in view of the low level   of inflation  With excess capacity in labor and product markets likely to remain at or above   current levels through the end of 2004, we expect core PCE inflation to fall to just over 1 percent   both this year and next  As Dave mentioned, the Greenbook has a similar forecast  After   adjusting for a reasonable estimate of measurement bias, the two forecasts imply true inflation of   about ½ of 1 percent  An analysis by the San Francisco staff of typical forecast errors for core   inflation suggests an uncomfortably high 20 percent probability that true inflation could fall   below zero next year  Of course, as we’ve just heard and as we read before in the Greenbook,   the Board staff puts this probability at 35 percent     This possibility brings to mind familiar research suggesting that, given the long lags in   the effects of policy, it’s best to move sooner rather than later when the economy is within range   of deflation and the zero bound  Therefore, as insurance against downside surprises to both   economic activity and inflation in the future, it would seem prudent to ease policy further    Thank you     Mr Chairman, I have just a comment  We’ve discussed the probability of   deflation quite a bit today, and a lot of attention was focused on the 35 percent probability in the   Board staff’s exercise  In answer to Tony’s comment about the time period used in that   simulation, I would note that we did do the exercise beginning in 1985, which is a much more   tractable period, and the probability we got was 20 percent as I indicated  It strikes me that both   of those exercises suggest that the probability of deflation is higher than I think we’re all   comfortable with      Mr Chairman, I think a good case could be made for a further easing of   policy today  The most likely scenario for the economy over the next year or so leaves   significant excess capacity in place  With low inflation and the economy in a weakened state, I   believe that erring on the side of ease most likely would entail very little cost whereas erring on   the side of inaction could be significantly more costly  The cost of inaction could be especially   large because we are within range of deflation and the zero bound  Finally, I believe that being   preemptive has served us well in the past  Quite frankly, if my recollection is correct, at times   our acting in a preemptive manner has involved surprising the markets, and I don’t think we’ve   suffered as a result of that     I also would say that the third paragraph is helpful to me  Let me make a few comments    I never thought when we talked about the upside and downside risks that it was in terms of   commenting on sustainable growth  It always meant to me the risks to our forecast of growth—  that we saw either upside or downside risks to our projection of growth, not to sustainable   growth, which I think is a very different concept  Also the last two sentences help me a bit   May 6, 2003 99 of 115    because they do point out clearly the issues that I think we ought to be focused on, particularly if   we’re still interested in acting in a preemptive way  Thank you     But it’s your baby!  [Laughter]     Do we have any data on shipments of euros?  Could there be a   substitution process under way?     One thing we could do is to check with the cash product office  They and   New York work closely together on such issues   August 12, 2003 8 of 110      The meeting could start at 5 o’clock in the morning     Dave, for some time now, market forecasts of inflation have been quite a   bit higher than the forecast of the Board staff or for that matter of the Committee members  As   an example, the inflation forecast for next year of the 10 lowest Blue Chip forecasts is about   ½ percentage point higher than ours, and of course, the midpoint of the Blue Chip forecasts is   even higher  Can you explain why that difference persists for so long?  Second, are you at all   concerned that, if other forecasts began to line up with ours, that development in itself could put   some downward pressures on inflation?  It would be an indication that the market’s expectations   for inflation were changing and we already have a very low inflation rate     I know     Well, what about the second point I made—that, if others were to change   their forecasts and become more convinced about the possibility of inflation rates being lower,   that could put some downward pressures on inflation rates as well going forward     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Twelfth District economy appears to have   gained some momentum coming into this quarter, although attitudes are still more cautious than   optimistic  Consumer spending is holding up generally and is actually picking up for leisure-  related businesses such as restaurants The recent rise in mortgage rates appears to be   accelerating home sales, as buyers on the fence look to lock in interest rates that are still below   historical norms     The IT sector is benefiting from the effects of a pickup in investment in equipment and   software  Jobs are being shed at a slower pace in IT manufacturing  And Intel and Apple   reported strong revenue growth in the second quarter, while Microsoft plans to increase R&D   and also hiring  Nonetheless, firms remain focused on cutting costs and increasing efficiency    So although they will be adding jobs down the line, growth will be muted, and many of the jobs   lost in the recent downturn are not expected to come back  Residents of tech-dependent areas   such as San Francisco and the Silicon Valley seem to agree, as on balance people are moving out   of these areas     August 12, 2003 25 of 110    In the Northwest, sour conditions in Boeing’s commercial side remain a drag on the   economy  Boeing recently announced yet another series of job cuts, this time of between 4,000   and 5,000 workers  Boeing’s commercial woes apparently are due to three trends  a decline in   the overall demand for commercial jets, a loss of market share to AirBus, and a shift in airline   demand toward smaller planes     All District states except Oregon have signed budgets for this fiscal year  Despite   widespread press reports of drastic cuts in spending, most states, including California, actually   will show a small increase in nominal spending in fiscal year 2004 compared with 2003    California avoided a decline in expenditures without raising general taxes, mainly by putting off   some hard choices for at least another year  The state’s near-term fiscal problems were handled   through a combination of spending deferrals, fee increases, use of one-time revenue sources, and   just over $14 billion in debt financing  On the heels of the budget signing, Moody’s downgraded   the state’s general obligation bonds, while Standard and Poor’s reaffirmed its earlier downgrade    The rating agencies’ concern is not the state’s immediate debt burden but rather its inability to   address the long-term imbalance between planned spending and expected revenues, which is   somewhere on the order of $8 billion   For the national economy, recent economic data generally were somewhat stronger than   expected  It was encouraging that real final demand by domestic purchasers jumped sharply in   the second quarter and that the increase was not only because of strong auto sales but was broad-  based and included investment in equipment and software  The recent improvement in   manufacturing output and the strengthening in corporate profits also raise the odds that the long-  anticipated investment-led rebound in the economy may be under way  However, there still is   plenty of room for uncertainty about the next few quarters  First, disappointing labor market   August 12, 2003 26 of 110    developments may suggest that businesses aren’t very comfortable about the future and also may   undermine the confidence of households  Second, there is the issue of how to interpret the   tightening of financial conditions since we met in June, especially the increases in interest rates    To some extent these increases suggest slower growth going forward, since they may represent   the market view that policy will be tighter in the future because we are less concerned about   deflation than we were in May and because the situation with respect to the federal deficit has   deteriorated  But part of the increase in rates also probably indicates stronger growth prospects   for the economy     On balance, we have changed our forecast very little from last time, although our   confidence that an acceleration in activity is under way has strengthened somewhat  Our   forecast is a little weaker than the one in the current Greenbook  We expect real GDP growth of   about 3½ percent in the latter half of this year and 4½ percent in 2004  As before, this   performance doesn’t appear strong enough to eliminate excess capacity in the economy by the   end of next year  As a result, we expect core PCE inflation to average about 1 percent in 2004,   which is about as low as I would like to see it go  Thank you     Mr Chairman, recent data give me more confidence that an acceleration   in economic activity has finally begun  At the same time, however, there is an uncomfortably   high risk that inflation may move lower than would be desirable  On balance, I do favor leaving   the funds rate unchanged at the present time and waiting awhile to see if the incipient rebound   continues to develop  I favor retaining our current risk assessment, with the risks being balanced   for growth and weighted toward the downside for inflation  In expressing our risk assessment, I   would prefer to use the wording in the Bluebook that we actually vote on rather than an   interpretation like the one in the last press statement  I’d feel more comfortable voting for a   particular risk assessment if I knew in advance exactly how it would be expressed to the public    This is an issue that I hope will be on the agenda for our discussion of communications in   September     The “mixed” is because of the initial claims data     Yes   August 12, 2003 85 of 110      That’s what we did last time   August 12, 2003 91 of 110      Could you read it again, please?     “Judges” or “believes”?  You said “believes” the first time     Eighteen     Mr Chairman, I was planning to comment on some of the points that were   made by Vincent and by implication you as well  Is this the right time?  [Laughter]     Okay  Let me start by noting that I have never thought it was clear that   the post-meeting press release was a statement of the FOMC  I always considered it more the   Chairman’s statement than the Committee’s, and I thought it was presented at the meeting   September 15, 2003 26 of 78    mostly for information purposes about how policy would be communicated to the public    However, if the statement is to be used as an ongoing policy tool of the Committee, then in my   view it should be drafted in a way that reflects the views of the Committee in setting policy  For   example, if a risk assessment is included in the press statement, then it should be the same one   that was voted for by the Committee and not a restatement or reinterpretation of it  If the   wording in the Bluebook isn’t suitable for the press release, then it probably should be changed     Again, I’d feel more comfortable voting for a particular risk assessment if   I knew in advance exactly how it would be expressed to the public  Given this general principle   that the statement should be from the Committee, the remaining questions revolve around how   the Committee will draft its statement  One choice to be made is whether various alternative   wordings will be available to the Committee in advance or whether the statement will be   composed and edited during the meeting  My preference is for the former  Another choice is   whether to rely more on formulaic wording options or whether to use language basically tailored   to each meeting  I prefer primarily formulaic wording  I think some of the recent press releases   were too nuanced and inadvertently injected noise into the bond market  In general, I’m not   convinced that including more words in the release necessarily advances the cause of   transparency     In terms of process, I suggest that we “routinize,” to use Vincent’s term, the wording   options for much of the statement and circulate alternatives in advance  Editing should be a last   resort in which wording changes are suggested and then approved or rejected by the Committee    In terms of content, the wording of the risk assessment is at times ambiguous to me and should   September 15, 2003 27 of 78    be considered a work in process  I feel it has been useful to separate the risks, but they still need   considerable clarification  For example, the reference to the risks to economic activity should   include a level concept in my view, and I don’t think the current phrasing is up to that task     Some idea that we’re talking about the gap, sort of a Taylor rule     Right  But we know at times that it’s getting larger or getting smaller  At   least we have some views about that; otherwise it’s a little difficult to make policy     The “coulds,” “woulds,” and “mights”     When you say get back to Vincent, I want to clarify what you mean  For   example, if we use the current Bluebook, the staff set out two alternatives  I assume there would   be a discussion about each and the only question would be how the verbiage associated with one   of those alternatives should be modified?     I would hope Vincent wouldn’t have too great a burden as a result of that    I hope the language would stick to what I’d call the high points  I don’t want to use the word   “formulaic”       Mr Chairman, with regard to the first sentence of the proposed addition, it   seems to me that in the past we’ve referred to the objectives of fostering economic growth and   price stability as long term  So it would make some sense to stay with language that refers to our   objectives as being long term     No  I don’t think that’s what we meant in the past when we’ve used that   language  I think we knew that we couldn’t achieve our objectives in every instance, but they   were set out as long-term objectives     No, that’s fine     I agree   September 16, 2003 5 of 106      Dave, the Greenbook projects that the bond rate will fall as markets learn   that the economy can grow at above-potential rates without stoking inflationary pressures  As   you noted, the estimate of structural productivity growth has been revised up significantly That,   of course, should raise equilibrium real rates  Do you think the market will begin to incorporate   the higher equilibrium real rates at some point?  Wouldn’t that counteract the tendency for bond   rates to fall in response to changing market expectations for the funds rate?     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Twelfth District   appears to have picked up recently, but employment remains flat overall  Our contacts in the   manufacturing sector indicate that, although they’ve been continuing to shed jobs, they’re more   upbeat about business prospects  Several high-tech producers are reporting improvement in their   businesses  Revenues and production have been rising at Intel, and higher prices for memory   chips over the summer reflect the stronger demand at firms such as Micron     September 16, 2003 46 of 106    The improvement goes beyond the high-tech sector  For example, machine-tool makers   and metal fabricators in the District indicate that orders are up, and the majority of those   businesses are telling us that they are increasing capital spending  Consumer spending also is   rising  Back-to-school sales are reported to be strong in southern California  More broadly,   retailers are saying that price discounting has become less prevalent as demand has increased    Several District tourist destinations have started to see a rebound in activity after the lull   associated with SARS and the Iraqi war  At Los Angeles International Airport, international air   traffic has been increasing strongly, and some domestic routes are seeing increases as well  In   fact, Southwest and Song Airlines, a subsidiary of Delta, reportedly are planning to add flights   from Los Angeles to Las Vegas  San Diego hotel occupancy hit more than 83 percent, which is   among the highest in the country  In Hawaii the increase in domestic travelers has more than   made up for the decline in international travelers  At this point, total visitor traffic for the State   of Hawaii has regained pre-September 11 levels  Housing markets remain strong throughout the   District, especially so in southern California, Arizona, and Nevada  Along with that housing   strength have come reports of significant spending on major appliances and furniture     The fiscal situation in the District remains challenging  [Laughter]  The Oregon   legislature decided to meet its budget shortfall by passing a temporary increase in personal   income and corporate taxes, which will expire when the economy improves  In one of the more   original new tax proposals—and hoping you are all still alert—the citizens of Seattle will vote   soon on an initiative to place a tax of 10 cents a cup on espresso drinks  [Laughter]  In   California, with a structural shortfall of nearly $8 billion looming and uncertainty about the   recall election, investors still are requiring a premium on the state’s general obligation bonds of   September 16, 2003 47 of 106    about 40 basis points, only about 10 basis points lower than before the signing of the state’s   budget    For the national economy, the recent positive data strengthen the case that we’re finally   in a sustained rebound  I’m encouraged by the broad-based increase in demand, especially in the   key element of equipment investment, and by the upbeat news about corporate profits, equity   values, and productivity  Still, I won’t be convinced that we’re out of the woods until I’ve seen   some job growth  We’re not quite as optimistic as the Greenbook, but we have revised up our   projection of real GDP growth moderately—to 4 percent in the second half of the year and   4¾ percent in 2004  Although this faster growth absorbs some excess capacity and therefore   tempers my concerns about further declines in inflation, it doesn’t entirely mitigate them  Recent   productivity data do raise the odds that the trend is a bit higher than we thought  Of course, that   would offset some of the gains against excess capacity that we might have expected  The GDP   growth we anticipate going forward doesn’t appear to be fast enough to eliminate excess capacity   by the end of next year  This is an issue—considering that we expect core PCE inflation to   average only about 1 percent both this year and next, which is already at the low end of what I   consider to be the desirable range  Thank you     Mr Chairman, given the strength of the economy that we see, at least on   the basis of the most recent data, I support leaving the funds rate at 1 percent  However, even   with the expected pickup in growth, there’s an uncomfortably high risk that inflation may move   lower than would be desirable  Certainly in the Greenbook, with the revision to productivity, it’s   clear that the gap is probably greater today than we thought was the case in the past     I favor retaining our current risk assessments, with the risks being balanced for growth   and weighted toward the downside for inflation  But I do want to make a parenthetic point    When I read the Bluebook and heard Vincent’s presentation, I was struck by the case that was   made for an easing  In particular, one or two scenarios seemed to indicate that an easing might   be appropriate as something of an insurance policy—and one that I can’t see as having any cost    So I would suggest that, if indeed there is a perceptible lull in the economy, we ought to jump on   the chance to ease and the exit strategy will not be an issue     At the last meeting I came away with the impression that what we seemed   to agree on was that the directive wording and the risk assessment we voted on should be what   we communicated to the public  It was important to many of us—maybe to all of us—that the   communication directly reflect our vote  Is it naive, Vincent, to think that we could focus on the   directive wording and the risk assessment, which we didn’t seem to have too much trouble   agreeing to and voting on today, and find a way for that language to be what we release?  How   long did it take us to agree on that wording today—two nanoseconds?     What we agreed on is what is going to appear in the minutes     Yes    MR REINHART  That isn’t identical to what is in today’s press release for the   following reason—     Oh, I know that     Okay  Isn’t the goal to get the language in the vote and the press release   the same?  Why should that be so difficult?  Based on what I’ve read in the last couple of weeks,   October 28, 2003 96 of 126    it’s extremely difficult  I don’t understand why  Maybe we need an English teacher or   grammarian     Yes, I noticed     We have to address the issue of whether we would get the same kind of   product as we do now     My question is related to that of President Moskow  At the end of the   forecast period, when the output gap in the baseline is close to zero and inflation is close to   1 percent, a neutral nominal federal funds rate would be around 3½ percent, which is about   where financial markets actually expect it to be  Isn’t that a more reasonable baseline   assumption than that of the Greenbook?   October 28, 2003 21 of 126      It would seem to me that perhaps one reason the financial markets might   have higher expectations with regard to inflation is that they’re looking at different models    Those models could have expectational effects that would be quite pronounced if our exogenous   assumptions about interest rates were to be incorporated     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Recent economic growth in the Twelfth   District appears to have kept up with the national pace  In fact, Nevada and Hawaii have grown   quite rapidly with a boost from strong tourist trade  Arizona also has had relatively strong   growth, though our contacts tell us that this comes in part at the expense of California    October 28, 2003 33 of 126    Throughout the District our contacts have noted more cases of employees working longer hours   and of plans to add positions in coming months  However, it is also clear that firms are   continuing efforts to increase efficiency  Manufacturers in the District are reporting increases in   orders  The demand for building materials in the Northwest has been growing  On the   technology front, most IT producers are reporting improved business conditions  It is also   encouraging that R&D spending by IT and biotech firms generally has held up relatively well in   the downturn     With business conditions firming, office vacancy rates edged down recently in San   Francisco and Seattle, two areas that have been hit hard  The housing market in the District   remains strong, especially in the Phoenix area  In California much attention is on how the   governor-elect, Arnold Schwarzenegger, will deal with the state’s fiscal situation  For example,   the budget agreement worked out last August left the state with a structural budget shortfall of   about $8 billion for future fiscal years  Even more pressing, though, are the cracks forming in   the state’s budget agreement for the current fiscal year  In September the courts disallowed the   sale of $2 billion in pension bonds the state planned to use to make payments to its retirement   fund  More recently, a suit was filed challenging the legality of a proposed bond sale of $107   billion to pay off the short-term debt supporting current spending  Also thrown into the equation   is the governor-elect’s vow to reduce the car registration tax by $4 billion—which, of course,   would be a direct hit to state revenues  One plan put forth by the Schwarzenegger team to meet   funding needs is to issue about $20 billion in long-term general obligation bonds  This was not   well received in Sacramento or by the rating agencies  The reality, though, is that without new   debt of some kind the state will be in a cash flow crisis come next June   October 28, 2003 34 of 126    Once again we’ve been pleasantly surprised by the recent data on the national economy    As a result, we, too, have raised our estimate of how fast the economy is likely to grow in the   near term  We now expect real GDP to grow at a pace close to 5 percent in the second half of   this year and in 2004, which is really not that different from the Greenbook forecast  However,   we have a less accommodative path for monetary policy that is much closer to market   expectations  Output is expected to grow noticeably faster than its potential rate next year and to   continue to grow somewhat above potential the year after that, but the economy does not reach   full employment until the second half of 2005  So inflation is expected to remain around current   low levels  Although these low levels of inflation imply that disinflationary shocks could still   impose substantial costs upon the economy, recent data suggest that the risks are not as large as   before  In fact, recent developments such as the lower dollar have caused us to raise our   inflation forecast slightly  To me this suggests that it may be time to consider modifying the   risk-assessment statement to indicate that the risks to the inflation outlook are at least close to   being balanced       Vincent, in the top panel of exhibit 4, there is a column labeled   “unwelcome fall”  One thing we’ve learned in the last two quarters is that productivity has been   extraordinarily strong  Certainly the probability of a decline in inflation from, let’s say, the level   in the forecast may be reasonably remote, but the proportion of it that may be welcome may have   changed because of a shift in supply  There’s no mechanism for reflecting the fact that not all   declines in inflation are unwelcome     Of course     But it appears as though it would be less unwelcome than we may have   thought before we knew what was happening to productivity     Well, in my effort to communicate better with you, I feel better    [Laughter]     I agree with your recommendations     Roger, Cathy referred to these three options as having lots of moving   parts  I think they are different  The number of moving parts and the number of things we have   to agree on are very different  One of the proposals has language we’ve actually used for years   and never had any problems with—or at least very few  While I agree that we don’t want to   have a lot of moving parts, I do not think that all three of the options are the same in that regard    So it seems to me that we can look at these three alternatives     Dave, your comments today as well as a memo that was sent to the FOMC   contained a discussion of how rapidly employment is likely to grow  The view is that   employment growth basically is going to be consistent with what we’ve seen in the past    Frankly, I don’t really have much of a problem with that view  But one certainly hears a lot in   the public arena—from editorial writers, commentators, and so forth—about the impact of   special factors that are going to make such growth less likely to occur  These observers refer, of   course, to outsourcing, the loss of manufacturing jobs, and those kinds of things  My impression   is that the numbers attributable to those developments are really too small to make much of a   difference  Do you have a view about it?     Well, I think what’s involved now is a rather vocal group of skilled   workers, who are getting a lot of attention  We hear stories about financial analysis being   conducted in India       I agree  But nearly everybody one talks to believes this is happening    That’s the point I’d make     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Twelfth District economy gained   momentum in recent months, posting solid growth in a broad range of sectors  Consumers   continue to do their part  Early reports for the Thanksgiving holiday weekend suggest that   shoppers were out in force and were spending  Contacts noted that retailers are approaching the   holiday season with leaner inventories, hoping to avoid the heavy discounting that cut into   margins last year    District businesses also increased spending by entering into contracts with advertisers,   marketing firms, and IT support firms  One advertising consultant said that, after months of   cutting costs, firms have begun to turn their attention to building revenues  The improvement in   business conditions has been good news for commercial landlords  Several contacts noted a   pickup in the number of firms renewing rather than relinquishing their leases  Finally, the effects   of sustained economic growth have started to show up in the labor market  The pickup in hiring   has been broad-based, with only a few sectors still shedding jobs  Contacts suggest that this   improvement is not transitory  Many firms say that they will need to increase payrolls as   demand grows; nonetheless, they plan to remain cautious   Despite improved economic conditions, state budget troubles continue to be an issue,   especially in California  California lawmakers once again are in a special session in an effort to   gain control of the state budget  First they need to close a $17 billion hole in the current fiscal   year  Once the near-term hole is filled, legislators will still need to close a $14 billion structural   December 9, 2003 40 of 133    gap for the coming fiscal year  The governor has proposed resolving the near-term shortfall with   $15 billion in deficit-reduction general-obligation bonds and $2 billion in spending cuts and   deferrals  He wants to close the longer-term structural gap with a cap on expenditures next year   and rules limiting spending growth for all future years  The governor is taking his budget plan to   the public, campaigning across the state  At the same time, State Treasurer Angelides also is   going to the public, making a case against the governor’s plan  Angelides and other Democrats   prefer to cover the near-term shortfall with tax increases and intermediate-term borrowing  Their   plan for closing the $14 billion structural gap consists of modest reductions in spending together   with ongoing deferrals and additional loans  Despite the vast differences between the parties, the   heat is on to reach a compromise  The governor’s proposal requires voter approval, and the   legislature will need to act quickly to get the proposal on the March 2, 2004, ballot  Without   some resolution, California will be in a cash flow crisis next June and in fiscal trouble for some   time to come     Turning to the national economy, recent data have been better than expected once again;   and like the Greenbook, we are optimistic about the economy going forward  We expect real   GDP growth to be about 4 percent this quarter and to average about 5 percent next year and   4 percent in 2005  Unlike the Greenbook, this forecast assumes that the funds rate will begin to   move up as early as the middle of next year  Naturally, these growth rates imply rising levels of   resource utilization over the forecast period  We expect the unemployment rate to fall to about   5¼ percent by year-end next year and to 5 percent by the middle of 2005  Still, the economy will   have considerable slack over the near term, so inflation is likely to remain subdued, with core   PCE prices rising a shade more than 1 percent in each of the next two years     December 9, 2003 41 of 133    Although this inflation forecast is about the same as last time, it seems to me that the   risks are not the same  Specifically, the recent data appear to have reduced the risk of deflation    I’ve already mentioned the faster-than-expected output growth; I am also less concerned about   the inflation data than I was earlier  You may recall, and I think this was even mentioned earlier   today, that core PCE inflation showed zero growth during several months in the first half of the   year  That has not been the case of late  Financial market developments point in the same   direction  For instance, the dollar obviously has been falling recently  I don’t mean to claim that   there’s no risk of deflation  Continued high productivity growth, for example, could exert   downward pressure on prices  However, I’d be less worried about deflation from that source  In   any case, my point is that the risks with respect to inflation appear balanced now, and it seems to   me that our statement should reflect this change in the risk assessment  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As you know, I’ve indicated a preference for   balance in terms of the inflation risk  It seems to me, however, that the suggestion you have   made moves us a long way in that direction and, therefore, I’m very comfortable with your   recommendation   December 9, 2003 99 of 133      It’s two more than I know about!     Thank you     Dave, there is a simulation called “rising inflation expectations” in the   Greenbook in which inflation expectations increase gradually by 1 percentage point  I don’t   March 16, 2004 21 of 107    know from what level to what level, but I do know that some of the surveys that we see, such as   the Blue Chip survey, suggest that inflation expectations are quite high—around 2¼ or   2½ percent  I think it would be interesting to know what the results of a declining inflation   expectations scenario would be because, if indeed the market expects 2 percent, it’s possible that   view could change  If that were to occur, I would assume that conceivably we could see   inflation rates moving down from current levels  So I’d find that to be a more interesting   alternative  But I just don’t know what the levels were in the scenario where the inflation   expectations number rose 1 percent  It went up from what to what?     I bet it’s a lot lower than 2½     You could exogenously make it 2½ percent      Okay, thank you     Mr Chairman, economic activity in the Twelfth District is moving ahead   solidly, with some areas growing quite rapidly  Many of our retail contacts are upbeat about   sales, even as they remain concerned about competitive pressures holding down prices  Housing   March 16, 2004 39 of 107    prices have boomed in many parts of the West recently  Low interest rates are part of the reason,   but local economic conditions also are important  House prices are up the most in Southern   California and in the state’s Central Valley, two areas with relatively rapid population growth   and expanding economies  At the other end of the spectrum, the hard-hit IT centers such as   Silicon Valley have seen little appreciation in home values  Conditions in the manufacturing   sector have become more upbeat  Part of the boost has come from a pickup in exports, including   increased sales of semiconductors to Asia  Competitive pressures, however, continue to force IT   producers to cut costs  That’s why Intel plans to move production of flash memory chips along   with 300 jobs to Oregon from its headquarters in California   In some parts of the District, strong economic growth has translated into notable gains in   jobs, though overall job creation has been tepid  Our contacts say that health care costs are   restraining hiring These costs were a central issue in the five-month long strike by grocery   workers that was recently settled in Southern California  That settlement will result in a shifting   of some health care costs to employees, and it likely sets the stage for a similar outcome in   upcoming contract negotiations in Northern California  The cost of workers’ compensation also   is a big issue, especially in California  Governor Schwarzenegger wants the legislature to reform   the law by the end of March  If the lawmakers don’t deliver, the governor plans to put his own   workers’ compensation reform package before the public on the November ballot  This is being   taken seriously given his recent success in convincing voters to pass two propositions that make   up phase 1 of the governor’s fiscal recovery plan     On March 2, voters overwhelmingly passed Propositions 57 and 58  Proposition 57 lets   the state issue up to $15 billion in general obligation (GO) bonds to finance accumulated deficits   from the current and previous fiscal years and to supplement revenues in the upcoming fiscal   March 16, 2004 40 of 107    year  Proposition 58 is Proposition 57’s quid pro quo  Once the $15 billion is gone, lawmakers   are barred from additional borrowing to meet budget shortfalls  Moreover, they must put aside   money to accumulate a state reserve fund  Rating agencies and market participants seem   encouraged by the vote  Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s upgraded their California outlook   statements, and spreads on California GO bonds narrowed slightly  State administrators have   placed Prop 57 on a fast track  An initial offering of $6 billion in bonds is planned for early   June  The state will use the proceeds, along with deferrals of payments to certain state programs,   to finance its accumulated deficits of $86 billion  Once the accumulated deficit is taken care of,   the remaining bond allowance can be used to fund current and future spending  Governor   Schwarzenegger supports this option, wanting to avoid drastic cuts  But several legislators are   urging tax increases or spending rollbacks to restore balance  With the state facing a $15 billion   structural gap in the upcoming fiscal year, California’s fiscal health likely will require a   combination of all of these elements   Turning to the nation, recent data have been mixed and taken together are moderately   weaker than we expected  While the data are still broadly consistent with the economy’s being   on a robust path of growth, they do heighten concern about downside risks  Disappointing   payroll employment and consumer spending are particularly relevant in this regard since the   household sector seems to be the main source of downside risk to a robust investment-led   expansion  In any event, we have lowered our forecast for the current quarter to 43 percent and   reduced our projection for the year as a whole by 04 percent, to 47 percent  Under this   scenario, resource utilization would rise a bit over the year, and the unemployment rate would   fall below 55 percent by the fourth quarter  Here the latest data on payroll employment and   labor force participation continue to raise questions about the amount of labor market slack going   March 16, 2004 41 of 107    forward  The most recent data on core inflation continue to indicate that we are close to price   stability  Our expectation for core PCE price inflation in 2004 remains at 1 percent, and for core   CPI inflation it is around 1¼ percent  As I mentioned, the latest edition of the Blue Chip   economic indicators includes long-range inflation projections suggesting that the Fed is going to   allow inflation to rise to around 2¼ to 2½ percent over the next ten years  Given that this is the   last time I will participate in these meetings, I’d like to say that I hope the Blue Chip panel turns   out to be wrong on that one!  [Laughter]     Mr Chairman, I certainly support your proposal  I also think that it’s a   very close call with regard to the balance on inflation  I must admit that recent developments in   energy prices and the value of the dollar have led me to conclude that it probably would be better   to talk in terms of balanced inflation risks  But for now, I could support your recommendation  I   think a change in our statement about the inflation risks is imminent; it’s just a matter of exactly   when it will be made     The old guy!
