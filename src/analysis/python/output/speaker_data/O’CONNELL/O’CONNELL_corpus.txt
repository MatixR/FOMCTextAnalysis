  Yes, Mr Chairman  The Committee will recall that the lawsuit of  Merrill versus the FOMC, pending in the District Court, had been subject to the court order  announced from the bench, and [as of] the last [FOMC] meeting [the lawsuit] had not been the  subject of a final written order entered in the District Court  Since the date of the oral opinion,  that court order has been entered, and it quite accurately sustained the oral statement from the  bench With respect to the record--minutes of record--which is the subject of the first portion of  the court’s order, the Record of Policy Actions would be provided immediately [to the plaintiff]  upon its completion by the Committee  As the Committee will recall, [that order] was made  subject to a stay by the court so that the Committee could file an appeal     That appeal was noted and filed on March 16 So, until further order of the appellate court  or as otherwise ordered by the District Court, the requirement with respect to the Record of  Policy Actions will not be in place, and, effectively, the 45-day lag is still the operating date for  the Committee     The second phase of the court’s order, you’ll recall, dealt with the Memorandum of  Discussion The second phase required that the Committee, through its staff, remove from the  January and February 1975 memoranda reasonably segregable facts and that they be given in  proper form to the plaintiff as promptly as that could be done  And should there remain from the  two memoranda any portion of facts that the Committee claims could not be reasonably  segregated, then that portion of the memoranda would be submitted in camera to the District  Court for inspection by the court and a further judgment and order as necessary  That was  required to be done by March 19  We got an extension of time by stipulation of counsel until the  March 24, last Wednesday, and on that date, on behalf of the Committee, there were filed with  the District Court the documents that you have in the package in front of you     I haven’t presumed for a moment that anyone has had a chance to look at these documents  or that, having had the opportunity, you can fully appreciate what’s in them  In front of you is a  report to the court, prepared on behalf of the Committee, in which we advised the court of what  we have done, accompanied by an affidavit executed by Mr Broida in which he recites under  oath the steps that had been taken  Attached to that affidavit are the January and February  memoranda separated into two parts     [The first part] exemplifies that which was given to the plaintiff and resembles, I must say,  a blank pad of paper for the two months The second part, the full Memorandum of Discussion,  [contains] bracketed [material] to exhibit to the court that which was given to the plaintiff and,     3/29/76 - 2 -    [in] nonbracketed fashion, that which remains--as to which we asked the court’s judgment in  concurrence in what the Committee has done     Now, in the affidavit, I direct your attention for future study and reference to the recitation  by the Committee, to its counsel, of the areas of factual representation that were not made known  to the plaintiff  That’s found on page 2 of the affidavit  The statement is made that, while  certain portions of the materials withheld from the plaintiff can arguably be considered factual in  nature, they have not been given to the plaintiff because they fall into one of the following  categories Then, three categories are stated, the third of which we are referring to first; these are  the materials that were covered by paragraphs 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the court’s March 9 order  Those  are merely the record with policy action types of materials as to which we have an appeal  Our  position is that, having had that order stayed--so we are not required to disclose them within the  45-day lag--we did not intend to make such disclosure from the Memorandum of Discussion   For that reason, where similar types of materials were found in the memorandum, we withheld  them     In the first category are statements principally descriptive of procedure, which if disclosed  would [reveal] the deliberative, consultative process of the Committee and its staff for  exemplification purposes  [On page 6 of] the January Memorandum of Discussion, which was  given to the court as a full memorandum, the first two full paragraphs exemplify that which  we’re speaking of  It reads, “Chairman Burns observed that the Committee had planned to  discuss the first stage of the report of the Subcommittee on the Directive this afternoon”  And  then it proceeds through two paragraphs to recite procedures that either the Chairman has  suggested would be taken or had planned to be taken, but it contains references to substantive  thought and process which, in effect, lead to the deliberative process of the Committee We  elected to remove that from disclosure to the plaintiff [because] it would lead them to knowledge  of the deliberative, consultative process of the Committee     The February Memorandum of Discussion, page 18, will give you a suggestion of the type  [of material] covered in the second category in the affidavit  Turning to the so-called B type of  [material]--that is, information received in confidence from foreign central banks and  information relating to negotiations with or among such banks, disclosure of which could  irrevocably and totally damage relations with these banks and result in the cessation of the flow  of essential information from them     [There are] numerous instances [of this type of material] in the Memorandum of  Discussion--references are made to reports from members of the Committee, comments from our  Chairman with respect to conversations that are being held with representatives of foreign central  banks I won’t take the Committee’s time to indicate specific examples, there are several--a  common market agreement with respect to serving of the intervention agreements, the rate for  which they would be made, and so forth  This type of reference, although containing some  factual material that arguably could be disclosed, would inferentially lead to the type of  disclosure of discussion of highly confidential foreign central bank exchange [unintelligible] that  we felt should not be disclosed  And for that reason, we have identified to the court, quite  frankly, [what] we have withheld and the reasons for it       3/29/76 - 3 -    The affidavit then closes with a request that, if the [judgment of the] court differs from that  of the Committee and [the court] intends for any reason to issue a contrary adverse order for  further disclosure, then we be so advised and be given the opportunity to note this on appeal--and  thus we would seek an emergency stay of this order in the Court of Appeals     Mr Chairman, implicit in our affidavit is an opportunity to appear before the District Court  and perhaps take suitable steps to comply with whatever further order the District Court has in  mind  We have heard nothing from the court on its reading, if any, of this document  We have  had a phone call from counsel for the plaintiff, who asked for somewhat of a verbal description  and explanation of the three withholding categories that I have briefly discussed here  Counsel  talked with plaintiff’s counsel and gave examples of both A and B  He seemed satisfied, he  didn’t raise any further question, and we haven’t heard any further comment  Mr Chairman, I  think that constitutes a report on this filing as the Committee now has it     Mr Chairman, Governor, we’ve had no conversation with the court  or the court’s clerk, so I’m unable to give you any reaction or impression from him  Our  conversation with the plaintiff’s counsel did not give us any feeling of total dissatisfaction or  surprise on the part of the plaintiff’s counsel that the portion given him was as sketchy as it was   One or two comments he made, as a matter [of] fact, suggested that he anticipated that it would  be just about like this  As I say, the only questions he had were to exemplify the types of  categories we had withheld  We did so, and subject to Art’s further knowledge, I got no  impression that he was umbraged or that he would push hard for further disclosure     That might well be the explanation of--may I hold the Committee’s  attention for one more moment, Mr Chairman, to indicate what our possible time schedule may  be  I noted that we had filed a notice of appeal  The DC Circuit Court calls for the filing of a  record in the Court of Appeals 40 days after the notice of appeal  The notice having been filed  on March 16, [the requirement] means that, by April 26, we as counsel for the Committee must  designate to the Court of Appeals the portions of the District Court record that we wish the Court  of Appeals to review on our appeal     Forty days after that date, or, by my calculation, June 6, the Committee must file its brief  [to the Court of Appeals] in support of its appellate points  From its submission on--as I’ve     3/29/76 - 4 -    calculated--June 6, the plaintiff himself has 30 days, or until July 6 or July 7, to file an answering  brief  Within [14 days after] that period of time, this Committee can file a rejoinder brief, so  that, in total, all briefs being filed, the case [could be] ready for argument as early as July 21, or  [it] could be later, subject to any extension of time or orders of the court  That’s all I have, Mr  Chairman     I should say, too, that in those conversations, where severe reluctance  was expressed on the part of the New York Bank staff, we did our best, and I think successfully  in two instances that I can recall, to withhold under a valid claim  In all cases, Governor, I  believe we satisfied to the fullest extent possible the concerns of the New York Bank staff about  each of these items     I know of none, I haven’t heard any, Governor     He may have, but it hasn’t been brought to my attention     No, I haven’t President Balles, and certainly he did not appear to be  either surprised or irritated in the conversation we had with him when he was directing the  questions to us  I’ve heard of no complaint yet     [Yes--] at this point in time and subject to some word from the  District Court as to the court’s satisfaction [or] not with what we’ve done with the Memorandum  of Discussion  If an adverse order follows which is more stringent than is now entered, we have  every intention to advise the Committee in pursuing an appropriate appeal   SPEAKER(?)  Thank you     My earlier statement, Governor, at the last meeting, was that we felt  we were in [a] poor position to directly appeal a court order on the issue of segregable facts  because that’s a direct part of the law  On a court mandate for specific portions of the  memorandum, [which would differ from] our judgment as to what is a fact and what is not, I  believed we can appeal, and we intend to do so     [Unintelligible] if I may, Mr Chairman, I brought to the attention of  the Board [of Governors] at its last meeting the [unintelligible] of the Judiciary Committee, in a  two-day session last week, to enquire into possible conflicts of the existing Sunshine legislative  proposal with the Administrative Procedure Act, the Freedom of Information Act, and the  Privacy Act provisions  The Deputy Attorney General has called to the Committee’s attention  several areas in which he felt the proposed legislation, if enacted in its present form, would  conflict with existing provisions of law and with these other statutes  He has offered amendatory  language in several instances, the exact impact of which we don’t know at this moment, but it  could somewhat improve the position of the agencies But the Chairman, I think, is quite correct  that substantive provisions of the law as now proposed, generally requiring open meetings, stand  pretty well in place and they won’t be impacted by these other amendatory proposals     It is, sir  Does the Chairman wish me to comment at all? I don’t  intend to--     Governor, my “backseat” opinion is that it would depend on the full  applicability to this Committee of the Government in the Sunshine law as finally enacted  If it  should be judged fully applicable to this Committee, and thus [require] an open meeting, then I  think the issue now of what form a Memorandum of Discussion [unintelligible] [would take  would be] academic because [unintelligible] you would then have to determine what portions of  that Committee meeting could be closed  If closed, and all discussion having been transcribed,  what portions could be deleted? And then we’re back in the same game we’re now playing with  the Memorandum of Discussion  It is involved, Mr Chairman, that’s my point     Mr Chairman, Art has correctly stated the premise on which we have  chosen, on recommendation, not to take a formal vote on longer-term ranges  They have not  been considered a matter of Committee position in policy actions  Thus, that is why Art is  urging that it be in the form of a consensus rather than a voted action by the Committee     It could be [that] a final order of the court, after appeal, Mr  Chairman, would direct that the portion of the total record containing these figures be made  available immediately following the May meeting  The action vote itself would be immediately  made available and thus deprived of the so-called wrap-around language that Governor Holland  has indicated would be compatible     Mr Chairman, in the light of, I think, the wisdom of your concern for  [having the] first statement being made in your testimony under [House Concurrent Resolution  133], and the fact that I fail to find a significant deficiency in the difference between the formal  vote and seeing the consensus of the Committee [unintelligible] to that committee, I would think,  Mr Chairman, that I would still recommend a consensus statement by this Committee on the  ranges rather than a formal vote     Pardon?     It’s my judgment, Governor, that the figure itself [unintelligible]  could be arguably a segregable fact     Yes, Mr Chairman  As a point of reference, I’ll direct the  Committee’s attention to the facts recited at the last meeting; to the filing--pursuant to court  order--both with the plaintiff and with the court; and to designated documents flowing from the  court’s order     We delivered to the plaintiff’s counsel segregable facts drawn from the Memorandum of  Discussion of January and of February 1975, accompanied by certain related materials that we  felt added sense and added a certain flow of understanding to the facts given  And except for  that, we delivered to the court a totally complete package of the Memorandum of Discussion,  indicating on the court’s copy that which we had given the plaintiff and explaining, in an  affidavit executed by Mr Broida, our reasons for withholding certain portions of that  Memorandum of Discussion     We heard nothing from the plaintiff until April 5, at which time he served on us a  memorandum filed that day with the court, in which he took objection to each of the three  categories of materials [that were] withheld from him and [that had been] indicated to the court       4/20/76 - 50 -           At the Committee’s last meeting, we had indicated the three types of materials generally,  and they related to, very quickly in summary form, [first,] statements principally descriptive of  procedures, which if disclosed would result in disclosure of the deliberative processes of the  Committee  Second, the information received from foreign central banks and information  relating to negotiations with or among such banks, disclosure of which the Committee claimed,  or would, constitute a result highly undesirable, namely, the cessation of flow of such exchange  in information  And finally, materials of the nature covered by that portion of the court’s earlier  order which the Committee had authorized and as to which an appeal had been taken  And we  felt that, when we had refused disclosure in another form, disclosure in the Memorandum of  Discussion was not required by the court’s order, and thus we were disinclined to [disclose in  such cases]     The plaintiff has filed a memorandum of objection stating in principle that he doesn’t  really understand the three bases for withholding and that he doesn’t understand what is meant  by procedural matters that could lead to identification of the deliberative process  He objects to  the total withholding of the types of materials that we described in memorandum, and he let this  be known to the court  He asks no relief in his memorandum  He merely makes known his  objection for the reason, I’m certain, that he anticipates that Judge Waddy will issue a further  order more narrowly construing against this Committee his earlier mandate for production  And  thus the result would be that the court would require the Committee to disclose more of the  Memorandum of Discussion than had earlier been ordered     We have filed nothing in response to this, simply because, at the moment, it’s our  judgment that nothing was said by the plaintiff in this paper that couldn’t have been anticipated  or that wasn’t obvious on its face  He objects to our withholding what we did  I think he has  inscribed any reasons to his objection that weren’t plain and open on their face, Mr Chairman,  and at this time neither the Department of Justice--our counsel in this matter--nor we, have seen  fit to file any form of reply  We earlier asked the court that, if the court is disposed to more  narrowly mandate [the scope for withholding in] our production to the plaintiff, we would like  the opportunity at that time to oppose such or take an appeal from that order  I think that’s all I  have to say, Mr Chairman      I have no change of position of the appeal merit with respect to the  Record of Policy Actions, as earlier indicated  And what has now been filed doesn’t affect that  appeal  The filing I’ve just described, Governor, relates solely to the Memorandum of  Discussion     All right  My position isn’t changed in terms of any basis for appeal  at this time, for the reason that the court’s order hasn’t been altered since it was issued  If the  court, pursuant to a memorandum of this nature, issues an order mandating further and more     4/20/76 - 51 -           broad disclosure of the document--the Memorandum of Discussion--I feel I would then be in  better position to urge an appeal on the merits of such and order  At this time, my position  remains as earlier stated--that we don’t have a viable basis for appeal because our order is only  that we produce segregable facts, which is part of the statute, and any appeal would be  challenging the statute per se       He avoided--Governor may I very briefly [quote him], his argument  is very short  “Nor does plaintiff understand the exemption claimed in the second  category”--which is the category to which you refer--“where defendant states that disclosure of  certain of these arguably segregable facts ‘would impair the deliberative process of the  Committee’”     And that was our conclusion, that if we made disclosure, it would stop the flow of such  information, and the result would be that it would impair the deliberative process  He says  further, “plaintiff’s objection rests on the established legal proposition that exemption 5 of the  Freedom of Information Act protects from disclosure only documents reflecting opinions,  recommendations, and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental  decisions and policies are formulated  Exemption 5 does not protect purely factual material  contained in deliberative memoranda and segregable from its content”     He then says in conclusion, “it is clear that neither statements descriptive of procedure, nor  facts whose release would impair deliberative process is within exemption 5 since neither  category would include statements constituting recommendations or opinions”     I think he’s wrong in his interpretation, both of the statute and of the case--the Sears  case--from which our thesis is drawn, Governor  We’ll await the court’s determination of the  correctness, or not, of his assertion  I think we can sustain what we’ve done in this regard     We have noted our appeal  We have 40 days within which to file our  brief  That brief is now under preparation  Plaintiff’s counsel will then have 40 days thereafter  to file a reply to it  It’s in that process now     Certainly not on that appeal point  As I discussed briefly with others  here on the staff, and if I may make the comment, any other action taken, I’d have to give some  thought of a judgment of possible impact, but with respect to the point of appeal as to which you  now have raised the question, I see no virtual impact on that     4/20/76 - 52 -             Yes, the District Court for the District of Columbia     We do     Depending on the nature and the appeal of the court’s decision, yes     The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia     Well, in terms of status, Dave, a Government in the Sunshine bill has  cleared both sub- and parent Government Operations Committees and sub- and parent Judiciary  Committees and has been given to the Rules Committee for the issuance of a rule as to date and  nature of debate on the floor  In the form that we anticipate the Rules Committee will receive  that bill, which I anticipate will be the Government Operations [Committee] version, absent the  amendments urged by the Judiciary Committee, we will have a bill that still contains the onerous  provisions with respect to the definition of meeting and the transcript requirements to which we  raise strong objection     As to whether the Federal Open Market Committee would be automatically included, at  the present time, in the list of agencies that has been filed with the Senate version of that bill,  [section] 55, [the list] does not include by name the Federal Open Market Committee  It does  include the Federal Reserve Board  There is an area of interpretation, as I suggested to the  Board, [in which], by combining the definitions of agency and member as contained in the bill  from either the Senate or the House side, the Committee might be excluded from the definition  of [agency] in the Sunshine bill     Now, I haven’t openly discussed this, and I certainly wisely have not announced abroad  that possibility  I think it’s a reasonable anticipation--it’s personal to me, it is mine--in which  other members of the staff concur     Both bills require that, [to be an] agency, the members, the collegiate members, [must] be  appointed to such position by the President  You know, we have the fact that the Committee is a  statutory body [that is] not per se appointed by the President  I think committee members in the  House and Senate would be very much surprised, perhaps, if this Committee were to announce  that [the definition] doesn’t cover us     I think it’s a reasonable anticipation, but failing that and failing an exclusion for this  Committee, the Committee would be subject to the Sunshine bill as it finally comes out, and I  believe it will come out not much different than it presently is--open meetings except for the 10  exempt areas  A good number of this Committee’s functions and discussions would be closed  and could be closed subject, then, to the requirement of a verbatim transcript, which would have  to be reviewed by this Committee, voted on with an explanation given for every deletion and a  statutory citation for exemption  And those are only part of the procedural requirements that  would be imposed on the Committee     Well, I’d certainly say, in terms of preparing that transcript, that is,  the tape for publication, you are subjecting the Committee to what the Chairman has quite  accurately described has been the burden of the staff and the Chairman with respect to the  Memorandum of Discussion  The segregable facts operation  The plaintiff’s filing of April 5  [required] Art and myself and some of the Chairman’s time to go back to these and separate out  the three categories of exemption that he charged were fallacious  And that took about three  more hours to find citations  I think you’re running into exactly that under this bill, and at the  present time it requires the vote of the Committee for deletion  So we would have to look to the  Committee’s action of reviewing the tapes and voting for deletion  Yes?     I was told by phone yesterday that, unbeknownst to us, the Rules  Committee began consideration of this bill     Yes     I didn’t get confirmation of this--just before the recess, and they  stopped because of the recess with the understanding that the Rules Committee would return to  consideration of this immediately following recess     I was told it started the day before recess  Now this is from a staff  member who said he learned of this yesterday afternoon     I’m trying to run that down for certain, Mr Chairman     Well, we’re pushing that too  Assuming the accuracy of the report I  received, immediately following recess, the Rules Committee would begin consideration  No  estimate of how long it would be before the committee, except that I was told they’d hope to  have a two-day session at maximum on this bill before reporting it out to the House  When the  floor will get the bill I don’t know     Really, I think it depends in part on what success we--used in a very  [unintelligible] sense--someone has in delaying this bill in the Rules Committee  If it can be  shown that there are sufficient conflicts between the House and Senate version, or that provisions  of the House bill that I think will be before that committee are seriously deficient in terms of due  process of law, conflict with existing law, then it’s possible that the Rules Committee will not  vote the bill out but will send it back to committee, which I am told will result in a very long  delay    If that isn’t successful, then we anticipate [that it will be] on the floor sometime in May   Now, if your question is in terms of that time relationship, could this Committee defer, then I  would have to, in turn, defer to the Committee for its judgment in that respect     I think a similar consideration is--and I would raise this with the Chairman and the  Committee at an appropriate time--the consideration to be given to the appeal process on the  Memorandum of Discussion and the timing of that  For if the District Court issues a stronger  mandate for disclosure; and this Committee directs an appeal to be taken from that order; and the  Committee has had dispositive action of its Memorandum of Discussion; so that on appeal, the  Court of Appeal [asks, if it is] true that the Committee has totally done away with the  Memorandum of Discussion, then is this not a moot appeal?  I think the Committee will want to  give due consideration to timing subject to those thoughts too     Well, as you know, this suit was directed to two Memoranda  The  ruling of the court is a statement of law interpreting the FOIA [the Freedom of Information Act]   It is applicable to existing Memoranda of Discussion if specific demand were made under that  court order  Interpreting that order and under the FOIA, we would have to go through the same  process with those Memoranda that we’ve done with these two     It well could     That is correct  The appropriate provisional reference is promptly  available, and I think Governor Holland speaks in terms of the Committee’s ability, through the  Secretary, to produce, perhaps on the afternoon of a meeting, the votes of actions, the date of the  next meeting, etc  Whereas, with respect to the Record of Policy Actions and the wrap-around  language, the time necessary for articulated preparation is necessarily longer  And thus you’ve  got maybe 10 to 15 days at minimum, longer if necessary, for that     In my judgment, with respect, Mr Chairman, to the materials now  presented in the Public Affairs office downstairs, you would not be acting in conformance with  the law     No sir  Nor, I hope, have I said that     If prior to the close of today’s meeting it was agreed by vote of this  Committee that the next meeting of the Committee would be May 18--so voted--Judge Waddy  would say, “Was it agreed and did the Committee direct that the next meeting would be May 18?   Yes”  That fact is to be disclosed on Wednesday [the day after today’s meeting]  So we’re  distinguishing, Governor, the list of actions taken [on one hand] from minutes of actions in  which you have a descriptive or a narrative text that has to be read and approved [on the other  hand]  The latter [is released] only when it is approved  The other--individual actions taken that  can be identified in a list of actions--that’s what’s promptly made available  Am I correct or not?     Mr Chairman, may I be permitted to address one of the issues raised  by Mr Roos?  In terms of the litigation, Mr Chairman, I believe it would be in the Committee’s  best interest, if your other considerations can tolerate it, if the Chairman were to perhaps position  this as being before the Committee as a matter of principle, thus permitting the Committee’s  counsel, with your direction and permission, to make known to the Department of Justice the  adoption of this intended action as a matter of considered principle     I think in the Committee’s interest I should discuss with the Department [of Justice] any  objection they might have to an immediate action that does away with the Memorandum [of  Discussion], particularly in the light of the appeal, Mr Chairman  I don’t bring this up as a last- minute matter, but further discussion with the Department could have bearing on what the  Committee might want to do in terms in timing  If the Chairman and the Committee can tolerate  that deferment, I think it would be in the Committee’s interest to allow me to do so     And may I suggest Mr Chairman, without explanation, would you  care to ask for a show of hands on this?     All right then, with the understanding that it would be published  tomorrow     Mr Chairman, in the present wording of the bill, we hope to be able,  by liberal interpretation of that language--if it isn’t changed from present wording of both Senate  and House version of the Sunshine bill, President MacLaury--to assert that the Sunshine  legislation is not applicable to the FOMC     Yes, sir  At this time, it has not been discussed by anyone  There  had been many allusions, I think perhaps loosely used, Mr MacLaury, to applicability to the  FOMC  Some in defense of our position, that it should not be covered  We haven’t asserted  applicability to the FOMC  Our position has always been [that of] the Board’s trouble with this  bill  Others have converted that to use of the term FOMC     Assume for a moment, though, that it is held to be applicable, either by an amendment in  the language, if that occurs, or by court decision, and thus this Committee is subjected to the  provisions of the Sunshine bill as finally passed  If it in any form parallels its present language,  [then] meetings the Committee would be subject to the transcript requirements of verbatim     5/18/76 - 3 -         transcript  The requirement [would be] that the portion that is not exempt under one of the ten  exemptions now in the bill would be made immediately available to the public  The balance, if it  fits any of the exemptions, can be deleted and withheld by the Committee, but the verbatim  transcript would be required      May I add, Mr Chairman, too, in reference to Art’s point that a  certain portion need not be published in the two year [period]  we question the certitude with  which that could be asserted  We anticipate lawsuits being filed [against] many agencies  [arguing that] a certain closed meeting was improperly closed and that the transcript should not  have been withheld  And thus, they will ask that the court examine and make public even  withheld portions of the transcript  I think this is a reasonable anticipation       But the term “openly” is the further point  In five years, they would  be made available       That’s correct, Mr Chairman  You recall that was one of the factors  you mentioned in arriving at times of our [unintelligible] interval  You would include those      Just today     Yes, sir, I think you’ve, in substance, covered both of these points  and subsequent questions       Yes, Mr Chairman  As an administrative matter you might wish to  note that, on comments [to the press]--      Mr Chairman, I checked with the courthouse this morning  This civil  action number is 76-1142  The case has been assigned to Judge Barrington Parker, who is the  United States District Court Judge for the District of Columbia     The complaint, of course, asks that a three-judge court be appointed for the purpose of  determining a constitutional issue [raised] by the complaint  Mr Reuss has challenged the  provisions of the Federal Reserve Act, section 12A, which is the provision containing the  constitution of the Committee  He asserts that this is in violation of the  [US] Constitution and  the provision there in article II , section 2, clause 2, which is the so-called appointments clause,  [which] provides basically that officers of the United States be appointed by the President with  the advice and consent of the Senate     Mr Reuss charges that the members designated as defendants--and as the Chairman said,  each Federal Reserve Bank President has been thus designated, or his alternate serving on the  Committee at this time--the five members and their alternates as well as each Reserve Bank--are  in every respect, insofar as they operate on this Committee, officers of the United States because     6/22/76 - 2 -           of the import of their function and the impact of the actions of this Committee, and thus they  should be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate     He therefore, asks in his [unintelligible] that the members of the Committee be enjoined  from functioning as members of the Committee and, secondly, that any action that is directed at  the Reserve Bank of New York, namely the Desk, insofar as that action [was] participated in by  any of the Reserve Bank Presidents, be enjoined  And he asks that the portion of section 12A of  the Federal Reserve Act designating appointment be declared unconstitutional, and for such  other and further relief as the court deems appropriate     One final point, if I may, Mr Chairman  There are several issues that we are going to have  to explore very carefully  Among them, preliminarily, will be the standing of this plaintiff to  bring this lawsuit  I think there is a significant question as to his standing to bring this suit  He  bases his alleged standing on one of two pieces  One, that he is a member of Congress and as a  member of Congress, as assigned by statute, has certain responsibilities  He is prevented from  carrying out these responsibilities insofar as they relate to oversight of monetary policy  formulation, credit regulation, the issuance of currency, etc--that he is being deprived of this  right as a member of Congress  He assigns identification in the complaint to himself as  chairman, of course, of [his congressional] committee, but he doesn’t particularly assert that role  in the complaint     In the alternative, he identifies himself as an individual who is the owner of government  obligations, having a value in excess of $20,000, and that the action [of the FOMC], insofar as  it’s participated in by the Presidents named as defendants, jeopardizes that ownership, and he  thus asks that their further action be enjoined  Mr Chairman, without taking the time to give you  the basis for the question of standing, I think it is an issue that we will hopefully [unintelligible]  explore     Quite apart from that are the constitutional issues that have been raised, among them a  consideration of whether or not the Board of Governors as such is head of a department within  the meaning of article II  Namely, if the Board is head of a department, its function in  approving, as required by law, the appointment of the [Reserve Bank] Presidents designated to  [serve on] this Committee may well meet [the requirements of] article II  This is an issue that we  will be exploring with the Department of Justice  I contacted them last night, Mr Chairman, and  we gave them copies of the complaint this morning     I was served this morning by the United States Marshall, with copies for each of the  Presidents named as defendants  I raised no question of the service process  There could have  been a technical question as to whether or not they can effect service on corporate Reserve Banks  in the city  But certainly he, the Marshall, would have come into the [Board Room] without  permission and served each defendant  So I accepted service on the part of the defendants, Mr  Chairman, but it does not preclude us from raising technical points later     At this point, the Department [of Justice] is taking no position  All of the issues I’ve  mentioned will be explored thoroughly  I believe the complaint gives the Committee members  20 days within which to respond  This has a technical meaning  Under the law, officers of the  United States or officials of the United States government have 60 days within which to respond     6/22/76 - 3 -           to a complaint filed in federal district court  Having been assigned 20 days on the complaint, it’s  clear that the plaintiff’s position is that the defendants named are not officials or officers of the  United States, even though the complaint says they should be so determined     The petition for a three-judge court is, in the first instance, before Judge Parker  As a  technical matter, it’s possible that we will attempt, after further consultation with the Department  [of Justice] and the advice of this Committee, to file a motion to dismiss this complaint for lack  of standing  [If it] were to be filed timely, [it would] perhaps disenable the Federal District  Court Judge from certifying the case to the chief judge at the Court of Appeals  It is the chief  judge who assigns two District Court Judges, including Judge Parker, [who, along with] a Court  of Appeals judge, constitute the three-judge constitutional court that is called to decide these  issues  Mr Chairman, I think that’s all the information I have  I’ll be glad to respond to any  questions you may have       At this point, Mr Chairman, I would interpret this lawsuit against the  individuals named as in reality constituting a suit against a portion of the FOMC, and with your  approval, I think it appropriate that I represent these individuals, if that’s satisfactory, together  with counsel from the Justice Department  And we have asked [the Justice Department] for the  assignment of a specific individual who has worked on a number of constitutional law questions  under article II  They hope to provide a specialist in this area to be of assistance      May I say, Mr Chairman, that President Volcker’s general counsel is  also associate general counsel of this Committee, and because of that reason, I spoke at length on  the phone with him last night to apprise him of the lawsuit and its basic character     I’d be glad to briefly comment, Mr Chairman, if I may  Buckley v  Valeo is a suit that was decided in January of this year, and of course most recently has been  cited as precedent for upsetting the [1974 Federal Election Commission act]  That statute was  brought into question by the plaintiffs, [among whom] were congressional members and so- called political appointees, who had brought suit [in Buckley v Valeo in January 1975] to have  the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended in 1974, declared invalid for a number  of reasons   Pertinent to [the Reuss] lawsuit is the portion of the [Buckley v Valeo] complaint  [concerning] the members of the [Federal Election Commission], who were then eight in number  and two of whom were appointed by the President of the United States, two by the speaker of the  House, and two by the president pro tem of the Senate, in each case with the advice and consent  of both houses [of Congress]  The question raised was whether or not the appointees of the  House and Senate constituted so-called [unintelligible] officers of the United States within the  meaning of article II, section 2 [of the US Constitution], the same article that is brought into  question by [the Reuss] lawsuit     The Court of Appeals and then the Supreme Court ruled that [the appointment process]  portion of the [Federal Election Commission] act was unconstitutional [because] the functions  and the duties of the election commission members were so substantive and of such far-reaching  authority that [those performing them] had to be designated as officers of the United States  And  the failure of the statute to provide for appointment by the President with the advice and consent  [of the Senate] was a substantial failure to comply with the provisions of the Constitution  It was  thus overturned  It is that case that they cite in parallel here, saying that the functions performed  by this Committee are of such substantive nature that members performing those functions  should be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate  That’s the  parallel for the case, President MacLaury     SPEAKER(?)  Recognizing the wisdom of our not commenting at this stage of the  situation--obviously this is another act in the long-term effort of this man and his associates to  challenge the way [the Federal Reserve System] functions  It is conceivable, I would assume,  that as this evolves, this maneuver by Mr Reuss could be made, in the minds of his colleagues in  the Congress and the nation generally, to work against him  This is another frantic--so,  somewhere along the line it’s possible that we would be encouraged, I assume, to react in the  public area to terms of this case  I mean, I think the man looks ridiculous in what he is doing     That’s perfectly valid  The matter is now in court, and I think, with  good reason, at this time the pendency in court makes it wise to make no comment   SPEAKER(?)  I agree with you     In my judgment, there is none, President Mayo The complaint does  not ask for  a temporary restraining order  The case has been assigned as of this morning to  Judge Parker  There is nothing in the request that asks it be taken this morning before that court  or that he certify as a matter of emergency the appeal to the Court of Appeals for a three-judge  court  I would think that today’s actions by the Committee are clear of any impact from this suit       I’ll answer that very briefly  I can’t answer it, President Balles  On  the second question, the merits, the constitutionality, a lot would depend upon the composition of  the court, the three-judge court  If the chief judge at the Court of Appeals, Judge Bazelon,  assigns this to himself, together with Judge Parker and perhaps Judge Bryant, whom we’ve had  in the earlier case, I’d say a decision in our favor is at question  There are judges in the Federal  District Court here whom I would view with pleasure [if we were] to appear before [them] to  argue this question on its merits--the constitutionality of this statute--because [those judges]  would quickly pierce the allegation of unconstitutionality as it relates to this Committee, but I     6/22/76 - 6 -           think favorably to the Committee  So a great deal will depend on the composition of the three- judge court on the constitutional issue     On the earlier issue of standing, as to whether or not he can better perfect [his standing],  we had a case in 1963 in which I represented this Committee  It was the Bryant case, in  President MacLaury’s District, in Montana, and the same basic issue of the constitutionality of  the appointment process, although not exactly parallel, was then raised     In that case, the plaintiff owned a Federal Reserve note, and he challenged the actions of  this Committee that impacted the value of that note  We filed a motion to dismiss there  He  asked for a three-judge court  The Federal District Judge, seeing that the Committee had  substantially disproved the likelihood of his recovery or the substantiality of his allegations,  granted our motion to dismiss and denied his right of recourse to a three-judge court  It is on that  thesis that I would like to believe that Mr Reuss’s assertion of his status as a member of  Congress on one hand, or his ownership of government securities on the other, [doesn’t]  sufficiently distinguish him from a total class of individuals as to warrant his standing to bring  suit  Hopefully he couldn’t improve [his standing], either        If I may, Mr Chairman, I think the basic right of the Banks to act in  behalf of the corporation is contained in the Federal Reserve Act, among enumerated powers of  the Federal Reserve Banks       Right  To my knowledge, there is no provision in law for  indemnification  And some months ago, we instituted a form of indemnification that would  assure indemnification for actions properly taken  As to the right of the Banks to defend  individually the actions of their officers, I’d suggest that, in these cases, where it’s alleged in a  federal district court suit that their actions are those of officers of the United States, [those cases  are] properly postured for defense either by this Committee as a body or by representation by the  Department of Justice  Does that satisfy your question?     Well, by analogy, President Mayo, the substantive quality of that  action, as it might be alleged in parallel with this suit certainly could be brought into question  I  think any number of such actions might parallel and be brought into issue by a plaintiff  Which     6/22/76 - 7 -           is why I think that it’s critical that [we take] a very clear, careful approach to our response to this  complaint     Yes  I should comment, President Guffey, Mr Crews was formerly  in the legal division of the Board  He’s a very careful and astute lawyer  At the present time, to  the best of my knowledge, he is on the staff of Mr Reuss  He visited me yesterday to advise me  of the filing of the suit     Yes     As I say, my conversation last night was with the assistant attorney  general and then with the chief for the general litigation section [at the Justice Department], the  latter gentlemen being, I think, a very high-quality lawyer  But the trouble is, of course, that  Denis Lender himself won’t actually pen the brief work  I don’t know yet to whom it will be  assigned  I’d like to believe that we can closet immediately with the Justice Department and  begin the course of thinking with respect to the makeup, composition, and functions of this  Committee so as to enable them to write the very, very [best] brief       I’d be both pleased and privileged to have such assistance  I would  say, Mr Chairman--     I would ask the Committee’s authority to employ such counsel      I understand     I understand, Mr Chairman     I think the Department has first to answer the question, and I haven’t  yet explored it with them  Can the Department under title 5 represent individually named Bank  Presidents where, at least at the outset, you don’t have them constituting an agency of the United  States?     Now, once I get over that hurdle, the second question you’d impose, perhaps, may be  raised  I don’t know of another instance in which the [Justice] Department has been positioned  in representation of an agency against a member of Congress, or against the Committee itself,  and so forth  I do know that, on occasion when a committee of the Congress officially made  demands on this agency with respect to examination reports, and where the question of leakage  of information from this Board became an issue, a representative of the criminal division of the  Justice Department appeared before a committee of Congress and in effect represented the  position of the Chairman and the Board in calling in the FBI     So there have been instances in which they’ve apparently taken the position that was  [unintelligible] to the thrust of the Committee  That’s not quite where you’re headed, but it may  give us a sense of their willingness to do so     I do not  It’s always possible that the named defendants could be  asked [unintelligible] to share in any liability for loss of value in the so-called ownership of  government securities by the plaintiff  But that is such a nebulous allegation that I think there is  no possibility of personal liability of the named defendants  I agree with that--     In this lawsuit     If I may comment--     You could bring such a complaint  I would question even the  possibility of recovery, Mr Chairman, for the reason that prior to this suit, actions taken by the  Presidents as members of this Committee were pursuant to lawful authority  And if the court  should determine that, pursuant to Mr Reuss’s complaint, the provision of law is  unconstitutional, there can be no direct attribution in that finding to the members’ actions      A little bit of both, Mr Chairman  He alleges as a ground for  standing that he is a member of Congress and is thus bringing this suit  He enumerates the fact  that he’s also chairman of the committee  The letter transmitting advice of this suit, addressed to  you, to which we responded, was signed by him as chairman of the committee  It’s a little bit  difficult to sort out the position in which he purports to hold himself--     Well, except that I think that nothing in his complaint--if I may, he  describes himself on page 2 of the complaint as, “plaintiff is a member of the United States  House of Representatives, Chairman of the Committee on Banking, Currency, and Housing,  which pursuant to rule 101D of the Rules of the House has jurisdiction over legislative matters  relating to [unintelligible]”  And he describes, of course, the rules’ description of the function of  that committee  [The text continues,] “The plaintiff is also Chairman of the Subcommittee on  International Economics and the Joint Economic Committee, established” etc  And “The  plaintiff is the owner of certain marketable bonds whose aggregate costs,” etc “$20,000”     This is his description of himself as plaintiff  It mixes his position as a member of the  Congress, as a private citizen with ownership of government securities, and as chairman of two  [congressional] committees      Now, I should say that, to the best of my knowledge, Mr Crews,  plaintiff’s counsel, is an employee of that staff  I stand subject to correction  I’ll try to ascertain  that today  He may be outside counsel  The last I knew he was on the--   SPEAKER(?)  He is on the Hill  He is not listed as a member of the committee’s staff   Although I think what he said earlier, Tom, is probably that he is a member of Reuss’s personal     6/22/76 - 11 -           staff I think we also should say that removing [unintelligible] as committee chairman--it appears  that the final judgment on that rests with the Democratic caucus  The House Banking Committee  as such would not remove the committee chairman, only the Democratic caucus could take such  a position     I shall, Mr Chairman  It could be asserted that the complaint in its  deepest meaning is asserting the authority of the [US] President and supporting that authority     May I make one further comment, too, Mr Chairman, a matter that  we have touched upon before the Committee and as to which you counseled that it be treated  with the utmost confidence  That relates to the Government in the Sunshine legislation     If the language of the bill as now proposed with respect to the definition of agency were to  be enacted into law, we have [stated] the possibility that this Committee could take the position  that the law is not applicable to the Committee because the members of the Committee are not  appointed to such a position by the President  Now, if that’s the issue, I will want very carefully  and gingerly to approach our defense in this case with respect to whether or not the members of  this Committee are officers of the United States and should be appointed by the President, etc  I  am merely advising in advance that I want to walk a very careful line, Mr Chairman      Mr Chairman, I apologize, I should advise that I’ve arranged at five  o’clock this evening for a conference call to the counsel of each of the Reserve Banks merely to  apprise them of the content of this complaint and its general makeup     In my judgment, Governor, I would argue that on the basis of the  complaint itself, there’s no necessary application to previous actions of the Committee, and it  could be all futuristic in terms of its applicability, depending on what the Court of Appeals  finally rules  I think it would not have any impact on past actions  Although as the Chairman     6/22/76 - 12 -           has mentioned, we can’t preclude citizen John, on the basis of the decision of the Court of  Appeals, from filing suit, [unintelligible] past injury     May I comment on that, Mr Chairman?     If I may, President Mayo, at the time the Committee was considering  its move with respect to the Memorandum [of Discussion] and the questions put to me then--did  I see any adverse impact--I gave the opinion that I saw none  In the interim I have been  presented with no fact or occurrence or development that changes that opinion  So, as I said  then, I think the Committee’s action was not in any sense adverse to, nor did it impede the  pursuit of, that lawsuit, which is on appeal to the Court of Appeals from the portion of the  District Court’s order that dealt with the action record of the Committee  We did not take an  appeal to pursue the ruling of the court with respect to the Memorandum of Discussion  If now  the question is, does the possibility of reconsidering the Memorandum of Discussion action  constitute an impediment to the pursuit of our cause of action, I think not  I think wholly     7/19-20/76 - 4 -   consistent, though, is the action the Committee has taken, and I’m perfectly satisfied to remain  right where that is   MR MAYO  Thank you, Tom  In view of that, I see no reason why we should change our  mind     Governor, I see nothing in the opinion of the lower court that  mandates this Committee to keep a Memorandum of Discussion  Relating to the two  Memoranda demanded, the court order would reflect upon those and those only  Later, someone  could bring a suit; if they did, the answer could be given that we no longer keep a Memorandum  of Discussion  We move to dismiss     I think definitely the answer would be yes      You wouldn’t     The lower court’s order with respect to the Memorandum would  declare, and we haven’t pursued the appeal in that respect, that the Memorandum of Discussion  should be made available   MRBROIDA  [To release] segregable facts     Segregable facts  With respect to the two Memoranda that were  under discussion, the court’s order did not mandate disclosure by this Committee of facts and  related [discussion] that were not “reasonably segregable facts”; only the latter were ordered to  be made available  If we reinstituted keeping the Memorandum of Discussion, it would require  that, after each meeting, as promptly as possible, staff would go through that Memorandum and     7/19-20/76 - 5 -   segregate reasonably segregable facts and have them, I think, set apart in a publicly available  record if someone wanted to come in and ask for them     Absent, Mr Chairman, the possibility that a court of law could be  asked to look at that particular statute to see if it contravenes the existing mandate of law in  another statute, such as the Freedom of Information Act, these [unintelligible]     You could indeed  In fact, [given] that [the new law] postdated such  an existing statute, even reference in the new law to the congressional knowledge of the  existence of that [earlier statute] would help  It could be avoided  I’m merely saying that the  possibility existed     The last word I had from Mr Horton’s chief of staff, who’s handling  this matter, was that they were quite pleased both with the number and the mix of signatures they  had gotten  They had gotten from us a suggestion that they visit both sides of the aisle in  assembling these signatures, and they proceeded on that basis, and he said he was quite pleased  with the number  I don’t know the exact number, Mr Chairman     I will say, Mr Chairman, that the Horton staff exhibited a good deal  of pleasure in the Bella Abzug[unintelligible] colleague that she to some [unintelligible] had  peaked a little bit in advance  She anticipated that the bill would be on the floor of the House  before they recessed, and they missed that  Her letter was distributed, and he feels that the  impact of that letter has been severely diminished by that fact  And he’s pleased with the  calendaring of his letter     7/19-20/76 - 9 -     No     Yes, Mr Chairman  I think I can be rather brief  You may recall that  the lawsuit originally called for filing our response within 20 days of June 22, either with a  motion to dismiss or other answer  In the interim, we have, with stipulation of counsel for Mr  Reuss, obtained an extension until the 30th of July  The court approved that extension of time,  so our pleading, whatever its nature, is due on or before July 30  And that, again, is in the  Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, before Judge Parker     At the same time, plaintiff’s counsel filed an amended complaint, which procedurally  doesn’t enlarge or extend our time for answer, nor as we’ve read this complaint--and copies were  given to [counsel at each Reserve Bank]--doesn’t really change the name of the game in terms of  what we would be defending  What the plaintiff’s counsel has attempted to do in amending the  complaint is to be more specific and to shore up, as we read it, the grounds on which he bases his  claim that he is entitled to bring this lawsuit  The legal title of such a claim is called “standing”   And as we’re preparing our defense, of course, we intend to directly challenge, by motion to  dismiss, the standing of the plaintiff to bring the lawsuit     The two bases for standing as originally filed were that, [first,] as a member of Congress,  he had been deprived of certain legislative rights of voting and action by the five Reserve Bank  Presidents who are members of the FOMC and their participation in the FOMC meetings  And  that secondly, as a citizen holding a government [financial] obligation having $10,000 in  value--he said 20 but he only needed 10 for jurisdictional basis--he had been deprived because,  by the action of these same five individuals, the value of that security had been adversely  impacted     He has amended his complaint to further substantiate the basis of this claim, or has  attempted to  I think he’s done himself as much harm as good  One of the add-ons that he put in  was that it deprives him of the right to negotiate with the Senate in their voting on a presidential  appointee, which he claims to be a prerogative of a member of the House of Representatives     I don’t understand it either, Mr Chairman     It would appear so  That’s my reason for saying I don’t think he’s  helped himself  But he seems--     7/19-20/76 - 12 -     I have other chores than to encourage him, Mr Chairman     I don’t think he needs too much, as we may find out     The supplement also substituted Tom Timlen of the New York Bank  as a named defendant in place of Dick Debs  That and the substituted cause of action claim are  the only two changes he made in his amended complaint  Other than that it’s identical to the  original complaint     No, sir, he doesn’t  In my judgment he makes the allegation and  assumes that the five voting Presidents constitute the action “impulse” of the Committee, and  that by their vote alone, actions of the Committee are to be reflected  Namely, that what they  voted, according to his allegation, [constitutes what] the Committee did, and his injury followed     Now, without picking that apart, he doesn’t go further to substantiate or identify his  alleged injury with the five individuals named, or with the five Presidents and their alternates in  the complaint  It’s for that reason, of course, that we take the position that his thesis has to be  read as a complaint against [the entire] FOMC     And that is the essence of his complaint, that the actions of the Federal Open Market  Committee [are so important]--he claims [they are] the most imperative and important actions  short of [dropping] the A-bomb that can be taken by any governmental unit--it follows that  individual members who participate in this Committee action should be appointed by the  President of the United States  Because of the import of their work and their function  But I  think he fails to substantiate his allegation, Mr Chairman     As I’ve told you, he alludes to the function that these five Presidents  [perform] on the FOMC, and he thereafter describes the action of the FOMC  He places them on  that Committee, alleges that they were not constitutionally appointed to the Committee and that,  in their participation with other members of the Committee, they formulate and cause the result  of this unconstitutional action  And he asks the court to prevent them from doing so in the  future, and he asks that the Banks be enjoined from carrying out the directive in [whose  formulation] they participate  That’s as far as he goes, Mr Chairman, as I’ve read the complaint   SPEAKER(?)  How, Tom, does he suggest that five [Bank Presidents] can outvote seven  [Governors]?  I’ve never quite understood this     7/19-20/76 - 13 -     To my reading he makes no effort to suggest that five can outvote  seven  Perhaps he’ll argue that as he develops [an argument]--either in his motion of summary  judgment or his reply brief--that all it takes is two members of the Board component joining with  five Presidents if they so wish, and you’d have a majority vote  And that this could be the result  and that’s exactly what it is, a “could-ism”  And that may well be what his [argument] would be     It would  He hasn’t identified what he holds  As a matter of fact, in  his amended complaint, he withdrew and removed the so-called allegation with respect to the  $10,000--satisfying the $10,000 requirement  It’s contained later in the paragraph relating to the  impact of Reserve Banks in carrying out the directive of the Committee     President Volcker, if our motion on standing fails and the matter goes  to trial, he has made known his intention to produce expert witnesses who will--starting with the  security purchase--trace its value over a period of months  [The experts] purportedly will testify  that its value has now diminished and it’s directly the result, according to the experts, of the  action taken by the FOMC     Now hopefully it won’t get to that point  We hope that as a matter of law on which we all  agree, an individual who is the owner of securities of the nature he describes does not have  sufficient status in law to bring such a lawsuit  He doesn’t have sufficient standing  He can’t  separately identify injury to himself sufficient to enable or warrant a court undertaking a case or  controversy here in the lawsuit     7/19-20/76 - 14 -     Bryant v FOMC     It did  He was holding a Federal Reserve note, a piece of currency,  but he was making the same kind of noise with respect to its invalidity and demanding that he be  given gold in place of it, and the court dismissed that on the same thesis that he hasn’t  established a standing to bring the lawsuit  Yes?     Yes, the answer is yes  We have picked at both of his so-called bases  for standing, [the other being] his membership in the House of Representatives and the role that  he asserts he’s entitled to play     Now there are multiple [court] decisions, probably 11 or so, that bear on this issue  And  we have cases such as [that of] Senator Kennedy, who brought such a lawsuit and was  successful, the court holding that he did have standing  But in each of those cases, we believe  we can point specifically to the particular right that was involved as it related to an individual  vote, either on statute or a proposed statute or on a confirmation of a Presidential  appointee--some individual right that he had been deprived of  We think much more nebulous  and vague are the allegations of right, generally as a member of Congress, such as his  participation in negotiations with the Senate on a confirmation of a Presidential appointee   Hopefully, that would be the downfall of the standing position     Mr Chairman, from the outset of your conference conversation with the Presidents, we  have been in almost daily touch with counsel at the New York Reserve Bank, whom we find to  be representative of Reserve Bank counsel  We had a meeting a week ago Friday with such  counsel and the Department of Justice  Subsequently, we exchanged initial drafts, pleadings,  that we received from the New York Bank  We’ve also received communication from the  Atlanta Bank and a communication from Minneapolis  We are working closely with these  gentlemen  We’re grateful for their help     We have another meeting scheduled Wednesday with Mr Guy and Jim [unintelligible]  coming down from New York  And Ned Guy is acting at my request to immediately  communicate with the other Bank counsel exactly what our status is  Hopefully, within the next  three or four days we will complete what I hope will be an agreed position in final draft that we  can circulate to all counsel for their comments and views  Our time grows somewhat short now   I think we’re on pretty good schedule     At this time, the decision hasn’t been made, and I’ll defer to a  meeting with all counsel  I can give you my own judgment, and that is that we are better served  at the outset to combine a challenge to the standing of the plaintiff to bring the lawsuit and to  place before the District Court, on the merits, our challenge to the invalidity of the constitutional  issue raised in the complaint     Hopefully, we will move to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be  granted on the merits and hope to show the court, with whatever rationale we finally adopt, that  [even] accepting everything he says to be true, there is no constitutional law issue involved  That  the appointive process of the Presidents comports fully with article II, section 2 of the  Constitution, and hopefully we’ll be able to clearly [relate] both the provisions and the court  decisional law that support this position     And perhaps we will secondarily add an article that says, even if that isn’t true, in the  alternative, [we have] the history of the so-called constitutional provision enabling Congress to  itself delegate since the First National Bank Act  We had a history of functional performance by  the First National Bank, the Second National Bank, down through the National Banks  themselves, to this FOMC--a function that may sufficiently partake of current FOMC type of  activity to support an allegation that this does not involve in any respect a challenge to executive  appointment power  That it’s congressional passage and that it’s totally consistent that Congress  itself has by statute, by section 12A of the Federal Reserve Act, given to the FOMC the authority  that historic [unintelligible] started with the First National Bank     Now this is an argument that has been developed in a rather lengthy paper by the Federal  Reserve Bank of New York  We haven’t [yet] agreed that it would be a supportive argument  At  this time, [our] briefs take the sole position that looking directly at article II, section 2, the  composition, the functioning, the appointed process, and the process of the FOMC comports and  is consistent with that clause  And that is a result we hope to establish to the court’s satisfaction   The plaintiff has not raised a valid claim upon which relief can be granted and we ask for a  dismissal     Mr Chairman, if we proceed in the manner I’ve described, namely,  that [we file] a motion to dismiss based on standing and in the alternative on the merits issue, a  court can dismiss for failure of the plaintiff to have standing to be before the court  Finished     And may I say, that’s one of the reasons I am urging that we give  very serious consideration to including in our motion to dismiss the merits issue, namely, to give  the court a sense or flavor that, “If I don’t dismiss on the challenge to standing and it goes to the  merits, it looks as though there’s ‘color of right’ in the defendants  They might win”  On the  other hand, [with] that same feeling that the court might receive from seeing our statement on the  merits, it can say, “I can dismiss with clear conscience because I believe they would win  And  from what they’ve shown me, they would  So I’m not depriving the plaintiff here of anything      7/19-20/76 - 16 -   I’ll dismiss on the standing issue, won’t take up the merits, and I can do so with [good]  conscience because I think the plaintiff would have lost on the merits”     Yes, sir     No     Yes sir, and he will  When we file on or before the 30th of July,  whatever our response of pleading is, he has a stated number of days thereafter to file a reply  pleading     It depends on the nature of that [reply]  I would suspect that we do   He will file a motion, I would suspect for summary judgment  And accompanying that with--     I’m sorry, Mr Chairman, a motion for summary judgment is  somewhat more broad than a motion to dismiss  It more directly encompasses an approach as to  some of the merits of the issue  On the basis of his complaint, and whatever further  documentation he [attaches to] this new pleading, called a motion for summary  judgment--perhaps affidavits, perhaps an affidavit of an economist supporting the allegations of  the original complaint--he would ask the court as a matter of law to declare that his cause of  action is valid and that no judicial issue of fact exists--he would ask the court to decide this as a  matter that he’s entitled to judgment  And that is exactly what the motion for summary judgment  would do     If it’s granted by the District Court, then a judgment is rendered with costs for the plaintiff   On the other hand, if that motion is denied, he still has a complaint before the court, and with our  motion to dismiss being denied and their motion for summary judgment being denied, we would  then be obliged to file a total answer to the complaint as originally filed, with answers to each  allegation We would deny the allegation of paragraph 6 and answer on the contrary, A, B, C;  deny the allegation of [paragraph] 7  The only thing we would probably admit is that it’s called  the Federal Open Market Committee, and I think that admission could be safely made     Mr Chairman, once that’s done, “the issues are joined” is the saying that is used, and the  court would then set a given date for trial of those issues, and the complaint would go to trial     Trial means that there will be oral testimony, yes     7/19-20/76 - 17 -     A little bit of both, I suspect  The plaintiff has said that he would  bring in economists and finance and market people to establish the validity of some of his  complaint as to loss of value and so forth  [The response we make] would await our  understanding and our knowledge as to what his principal case and chief [unintelligible] would  be     I describe this, Mr Chairman, only in response to your inquiry as to what would happen  I  would like to believe that this case will never get to that point  I believe that with well-written  briefs and memoranda of law and support of our motion, this case will go off on pleadings on the  motions and on oral argument  We will ask for oral argument, and the court will set a date upon  which the motions that I’ve been discussing would be heard orally, and at that time the plaintiff’s  counsel and your counsel would be given an opportunity, usually 15 to 20 minutes, to argue  orally the points made in our written pleas     That was the gist of my answer, yes, Dave   SPEAKER(?)  How would outside counsel be brought in later once the position has been  established?  You shift [unintelligible] away the ground leeway [unintelligible]      All right, fine  I think that in the Buckley v Valeo case, which is the  principal case cited by the plaintiff as the basis for his suit, the substance of law that the Supreme  Court adopted was that found in the Supreme Court briefs, not as extracted or drawn from  whatever pleadings that were made in the District Court or even in the Court of Appeals     I think Archibald Cox and those who participated at the Supreme Court level in writing the  briefs probably had the greatest impact on the Court  As a result of the action at the District  Court level, we [may] start our appeal process through a three- judge court or a single-judge  Court of Appeals and perhaps later a nine-judge Court of Appeals reconsideration, and then to  the Supreme Court  I think that at any one of those four stages [unintelligible] the opportunity  [exists] to bring in a constitutional law expert if that is what is then necessary     It’s quite possible that the case could have turned off on a procedural motion that doesn’t  have the smack of constitutional law  And to overweigh it now--with the thrust and import of  outside counsel giving the apparent feeling that we think that enough substance is raised in that  complaint on the constitutional law issue that we brought in Archibald Cox to write [that] small  portion of the memorandum--I think would be a mistake  He gives it too much color of  substance and validity at this stage  Later I think far more [unintelligible]     7/19-20/76 - 18 -     He’s on the staff of the Banking Committee, John  He’s operating as  best I can tell at the cost of the plaintiff, although his salary to the best of my knowledge  continues as a member of that staff  When I say costs, certain fees that had to be paid were to the  best of my knowledge paid by Mr Reuss  But also, to the best of my knowledge, Mr Crews  continues as a member of the staff drawing a salary  At some point it may come out that the time  he utilized in preparation of the plaintiff’s case was time that should have gone to the staff  committee  I haven’t raised the inquiry, nor have I asked anyone to do so     I think maybe John had a different question     I think it might as a matter of total--     Better brought by them than us     If standard operating procedure obtains, that will be the case,  President Balles  The counsel is one Vincent Turlep  On Friday, he argued the much publicized     7/19-20/76 - 19 -   case involving an Army sergeant that the Army, as you know, has been trying to dismiss from  the service because of his status in the Army community  That came to oral argument Friday  before Judge Gessell  Mr Turlep argued against the plaintiff’s position and won in a ruling from  the bench  And I heard from another lawyer that he had done an excellent job     We’ve had two lengthy meetings with him, and at the last meeting, Ned Guy and Jim  [Oltman] were present  I think he acquits himself very well  He has a penchant for listening  He  identifies issues that he doesn’t understand, and I think he drew heavily on Jim and Ned and on  us a bit for some descriptive analysis of what he didn’t understand  He’s asked some very  pointed questions, and he’s very much interested in this lawsuit  Those are about the only factors  or characteristics I can give you  He’s a young man     Been with the Department I think for four years and has handled  some very important cases for the Department     How much help?  Not a great deal, only because he has 40 other  cases assigned to him, at least that used to be the way it was when I was there  He’s got one  secretary and two other attorneys in the room with him  It’s sort of an impacted working  condition  And he tries to scramble for help  I know a week ago Friday night, when I wanted to  get a draft of some material over to him, I went over at 8 pm and he was still there working   Had a girl [to help] him, but he said he brought her in from one of the other agencies, a friend of  his wife’s  So--     We made it very clear to him that if at any point in time he has any  need of secretarial or [copying help] or any material like that, call me day or night and we’ll get  it done  And the reverse is true, too     It could come on July 30  If the court said, “I want to hear this  motion right now,” that won’t be the case  After we file our motion, as I indicated, he has time,  say 10 days, within which to file his reply  The court would then set a calendar date for oral  argument  [Although] the court could say “I won’t hear oral argument on this, and you’ll hear  from me when I’ve reached a decision,” that’s not likely to be the case  And depending on the  summer calendar of this particular judge, once he gets a portion of the summer cases out of the  way, he may say, “I don’t want to hear argument until September,” when the fall term begins  It  could be between now and the first of September     7/19-20/76 - 20 -     I’ve made some inquiry  I have run across a group of lawyers that  work with him on a judicial conference committee  They’ve indicated that he has a penchant for  inquiry with respect to issues he doesn’t understand  No one opined on his level of receptivity to  complicated issues  I have some concern [unintelligible] on some of the statement of issues that  are raised by this article II, section 2; we have to be very careful how we word our pleading     Mr Chairman, in all honesty, I know nothing adverse in terms of his approach to issues of  law or his tolerance of counsel and presentation of views in the pleading  So hopefully, we have  a judicial mind who will approach this in a very judicial manner  Hopefully     Mr Chairman I heard that that was the earlier explanation given, and  it had no [unintelligible], and there’s no reason why there couldn’t be a vote on these long-range  figures  At the same time, there are modes of announcing a dissenting position other than the  vote--the point the Governor made  I see no need for a vote for accommodating Governor  Wallich’s point     Yes, sir  I’ll briefly report, Mr Chairman, on the two pieces of  litigation that are pending in our federal courts  [The first is] the Merrill versus the FOMC  [case], which the Committee will recall involves the suit, [based] on the Freedom of Information  Act, calling for--and I’ll use general terms--immediate public access to the Committee’s Record  of Policy Actions, its policy statements, and interpretations  The court’s order required  publication immediately in the Federal Register of policy actions and the immediate availability  to the plaintiff of the Memoranda of Discussion of January and February 1975     Now, as the committee has been informed, certain aspects of this order were appealed  immediately, particularly as it related to the [Record of] Policy Actions availability upon  adoption  With respect to the Memorandum of Discussion, you will recall that, pursuant to the  court’s order, the Committee gave to the plaintiff reasonably segregable facts  We extracted  those facts from the two Memoranda requested [and] furnished them to the plaintiff  Further  pursuant to the court’s order we furnished to the court the complete Memorandum of Discussion,  in which we had interlined the material given to the plaintiff and the materials withheld, telling  the court that there were certain facts that we have not given to the plaintiff but that we felt could  not be reasonably segregated and given to the plaintiff without destroying what we believed to be  the defensible withholding of certain policy determinations and discussions which under the law  we felt were exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act     [After] that document [was] submitted to the court, we heard no more until, on October 5,  Judge Waddy issued an order saying, upon his review of the Memoranda as submitted to him, he  determined that the entire Memorandum of each date, January and February, should be made  available in its respective entirety to the plaintiff, and he said that such should be effected within  10 days of his order  That order was signed and dated on the 5th of October  We learned of that  order on the evening of the 14th of October, the night before our appeal time would expire and  before the effective date of the order     I’ll just comment briefly that the postmark on the envelope containing that order showed  marks of a mailing in Washington on the 6th of October; a mailing from Frederick, Maryland, on  the 7th of October; someplace in Gaithersburg on the 8th; and then delivery to the Department of  Justice on the 12th, with notice to us on the 14th     Because of the time sequence, and the fact that our time had expired, and my inability to  contact the Committee, I directed that a notice of appeal be filed that evening in the Court of  Appeals and that an emergency motion for stay of the effectiveness of the lower court’s order be  filed with Judge Waddy  A letter to that effect was transmitted to the Department [of Justice]      10/19/76 - 2 -   The notice of appeal was filed on Friday, and we have pending before Judge Waddy a stay of his  order  At this time, that is the status of this matter     I will go to the Court of Appeals today or tomorrow to try to work out a Court of Appeals  stay of the effectiveness, and I will advise the Committee of the first action we have with respect  to that stay  At this time, I believe it’s in status quo  The notice of appeal has been filed, and it  will then go to the Court of Appeals  There is no further word with respect to the portion of the  court’s order we appealed      We had oral argument three weeks ago on this matter  The court was a good court  A  three-judge Court of Appeals court  I think they had read the pleadings  We had a very  responsive panel  A good chief judge of the panel, Judge Leventhal, asked some very  penetrating questions of both counsel, I thought  And the court ordered the matter submitted for  decision  We have filed one supplemental memorandum with the court as requested, and that  matter now is before the court for decision     A few words on the Reuss suit, designated Reuss v Balles et al,  against the Presidents   The last information I gave you was a matter of pleading into position, namely, that we had filed  various pleadings, the latest of which I think you had knowledge  We had filed an opposition to  certain of the plaintiff’s pleadings  You recall that we filed a motion to dismiss this suit on  jurisdictional grounds, particularly the lack of standing of Mr Reuss to bring the suit  In  response, Mr Reuss, through his counsel, filed a rather lengthy reply to our motion to dismiss   He filed opposition to everything we had filed and further filed a motion to interplead as a  defendant the Federal Open Market Committee as a body     So there is now pending a motion to interplead the Federal Open Market Committee as a  body--the [members who are] Presidents, [who] were in the original suit, [plus] the Board [of  Governors] members--[the court has] now been asked [that the Governors] be joined as  defendants  And this, the pleadings [make] clear, is for the plaintiff’s intent that the court have  jurisdiction over the Committee to enjoin any decision involving the Presidents should that be  attempted  It’s a ploy on his part  We have filed an opposition  And we have filed appropriate  responsive pleadings, including a reply to the plaintiff’s pleadings     As of Friday he has filed a further motion for oral arguments on all pleadings and asked  that argument be had particularly on his motion to join the FOMC [to the suit as a body]  I  advised the Committee at the last meeting that we were going to seek a protective order against a  request for admissions--the plaintiff had filed a very lengthy request for admissions  We did file  for a protective order, and some two and a half weeks ago, the District Court granted our motion  for protective order and ruled that we did not have to reply to these requests for admissions  At  this point, that’s about where that matter stands  It’s a matter of pleadings, and we are due to file  more responsive pleadings this Friday  Mr Chairman, I believe that is a summary of both  matters     [End of executive session]     Mr Chairman, I think perhaps the reference is to such as executive  committee minutes, audit committee minutes, established committees of the Reserve Bank board,  as to which each keeps separate minutes     That would be my recommendation     Yes, Mr Chairman, with the permission of you, Mr Chairman, and  the Presidents, who are so closely involved in this  Subject to the action of your Banks [in  accordance with] the Chairman’s advice that would be contained in the letter that would be  transmitted, I would like, even as you’re returning to the Banks today, to be on the telephone in  the conference call with the secretariats of your respective boards and the first vice presidents of  your Banks, exclusive of John [Williams]--if it’s appropriate, I’ll get from you a designation,  John, of an individual to whom I might speak at your Bank in this conference call  The purpose  of [my call]--after the Chairman’s letter is mailed to Mr Reuss--[will be to read aloud] the letter  and to give an outline indication of what I perceive to be the intention of the phraseology  contained in the Chairman’s letter     And I intend, with your foreknowledge, to make a request to the people to whom I’ll be  speaking that the minutes for the periods designated be transmitted in their whole form to me  here at the Board [and that they be marked] using a method that will capture the categories the  Chairman will reference in his letter  Namely that we bracket--and I’ll describe methods to the  people to whom I’m talking--the categories one, two, and three that we are going to remove as  sensitive  That a different designation be placed on those items in each of your minutes that  don’t meet this first general removal category but [that] in your judgment [meet] the second  category [of] individual personnel matters and matters relating to security measures of the Banks,     11/16/76 - 18 -           [which] will receive a separate designation  And then thirdly, the group that the Chairman last  addressed--namely, highly sensitive matters that don’t appear, in the judgment of your Banks, to  fall in either of the two categories mentioned in the letter [but] which you feel, for stated reasons,  should be kept out of the transmittal     By a separate marking of each [of these categories], I’ll be able to see and coordinate the  precise identical measurement of those withdrawals and deletions  Then I’ll return to your  Banks a simulated copy that will be identical--hopefully, we’ve coordinated it, then, throughout  the System  And a separate method of placing in a separate file this third category [not yet  covered in the agreement with Mr Reuss]     In total, what I intend to achieve, Mr Chairman, is a uniform method of removal and  deletion--a uniform method of closeting that which we will not disclose to Mr Reuss pursuant to  the Chairman’s letter and hopefully to do it as quickly and in a short a period of time as possible   Initially it will require, as has now been done in my conversation with respect to Reserve  Banks--I’m of the impression that most of the minutes had been combed for all five years,  through 1975  I’m grateful that we can remove two of these years from consideration and that  our efforts then will bend toward the three years mentioned in the letter  I’ll undertake this effort  of coordination by telephone conference today and then I’ll be in contact with your Banks as this  process goes on     It would be my recommendation, once we’ve coordinated the  undertaking, that, unless it was a question of information that you could readily give, namely, did  you mail, what was included, and so forth, that you refer the question back to me here at the  Board  I’m saying that only as a matter of coordinated policy because as it’s now proposed,  subject to the affirmation of your Banks, we would use this office and certainly the Chairman’s  signature in transmitting this material to Mr Reuss  Then I think it would be appropriate that     11/16/76 - 19 -           any inquiry be directed to us  I would say, Mr Chairman, that, responding to a question earlier  raised, I would intend to recommend exclusion from the transmittal of separately incorporated  minutes, even though referred to at the initial transmission, that they’re not subject--     Correct, sir  Yes     I would intend, Governor--my recommendation [would be] negative     That would be my--at this point, President Mayo, I would recommend  that we exclude from transmittals anything but the main minutes of your board of directors, even  though reference may be made to executive committee minutes, audit committee minutes     Mr Chairman, may I urge then, that to the extent executive  committee minutes would be included, that the same right and function of withdrawal and  exclusion from those be followed?     Before closing, may I touch on a matter that Mr Volcker has  remarked, about the attachments again?  It’s quite possible that board of directors minutes will  contain a reference to that board’s recent action in recommending a discount rate for the Board  and the Board’s response thereto, attached as Exhibit A  Mr Chairman, it’s quite possible that’s  the very type of attachment you would want to exhibit to Mr Reuss, consistent with the position  you’ve taken all along with respect to the role that the Bank directors play in this action of  monetary policy  So that at the very outset, we may be including specific attachments as we  review these minutes  I didn’t want--      In a way, you’ve done that when you’ve included the executive  committee minutes, Mr Chairman      All right, sir     Mr Chairman, Governor, I have to say that, depending on what the  Committee’s sense of need and circumstance were for deferring the date--I’m speaking now of  the short-run figures--if the Committee felt that, [in contrast to a] Court of Appeals decision  mandating immediate publication of the policy record itself--say, immediate in two days--the  Committee felt that a longer period of the holding of figures would be highly desirable, I would  then be put through the task of finding within the law one of the exemptions that permit  withholding  In the absence of such a finding, they would have to be published at the same time  the court ordered the directive itself to be published     That would be my judgment     12/20-21/76 - 5 -           Mr Chairman, any opinion I would give you--of course, premised on  the stated assumption for the moment that a Court of Appeals will accept this, [but] a Court of  Appeals may well affirm a lower court judgment that the policy record and the directive are  subject to prompt and immediate disclosure  Now that’s on appeal at the present time  If that is  sustained [by] the Court of Appeals, and under the recommendation now made that the figures of  which you speak are incorporated as part of the directive, they too would be required to be  published promptly, unless at that time the Committee is able to determine through advice of  counsel that an exemption or an exception exists  I don’t know at this moment that I can put my  finger on it     Mr Chairman, in the light of the question now being raised, I’d  consider that a most responsible thought and recommendation--that the action be deferred  pending a reading of the court’s decision on appeal     To my knowledge, that is not correct     But the court’s decision does contemplate that all interpretations of  that directive would be promptly made available  I believe that the figures themselves could be  termed to be interpretations of that policy     I believe the answer to be no, Governor  I’m not aware of any  impact, adverse or pro, that the action now contemplated would have on the appeal as it stands   The Committee should be aware that, should the Court of Appeals affirm the lower court, [then,]  by this action that is now before the Committee, you are broadening perhaps the total package of  materials that would have to be made promptly available     If anything, Governor, I would judge a position might be made more  strong  If these figures [are] in the directive, we can argue adverse impact [if] they were  demanded and be required to be made available [in] whatever form [unintelligible] sought them   I think perhaps it would strengthen the Committee’s position of defense against their publication     Yes, Mr Chairman, thank you  This memorandum--item 10 on the  agenda--is for the Committee’s notation and for the record of the Committee  The  recommendation is that paragraph 2 of the Authorization [for Domestic Open Market  Operations] be left in place even in light of the fact that a statutory authorization enabling the  Reserve Banks to purchase government obligations directly from the Treasury expired as of  November 1  That’s section 14(b) of the [Federal Reserve] Act, which at the present moment  has a de facto suspension, and [this memorandum] would bring this to the Committee’s attention     The memorandum recommends that the Committee note the de facto suspension of that  statutory authorization  The staff’s expectation is that, early in the next session of the Congress,  there will be new legislation enacted that will extend the authority of the Committee to authorize  direct purchases  Therefore, I recommend that paragraph 2 remain as it is  The Committee has  noted for its record its awareness of the de facto suspension, with assurance from [me] that if,  within a relatively short period, there is no congressional action, I will bring forth a  recommendation that paragraph 2 be deleted accordingly  Mr Chairman, that’s all I had to  recommend     Yes, Mr Chairman  The issues to which I think attention should  initially be addressed, Mr Chairman, relate to the definition of “agency” as it’s set forth in the  statute [and] the question, Does the law apply to the Federal Open Market Committee?     In essence, the requirement of the law is that every agency as defined in title 5 of the  United States Code, the Administrative Procedure Act, must, after a stated date--March 12 of the  next year--conduct, with certain stated exemptions, all of its meetings in open session  The  exemptions, I think, are to be considered only after a body has determined whether it meets the  statutory definition of agency  Now, as the Committee knows, Mr Chairman, [the FOMC] has  for purposes of other statutes assumed historically the status of an agency  Thus, under the  Administrative Procedure Act, the Federal Open Market Committee is an agency, and we have  thus taken that position  Under the Freedom of Information Act, the FOMC is an agency  So the  question would arise, Would it not thus be the same under the [Government in the] Sunshine  Act?     Well, if I may, the term “agency” means any agency, as defined in the statute that I’ve  identified, headed by a collegial body composed of two or more individual members, a majority  of whom are appointed to such position by the President with the advice and consent of the  Senate, and any subdivision thereof authorized to act on behalf of the agency  On the basis of a  thorough study of this statute--of the legislative history, including the committee actions [and]  committee reports from both the House and the Senate and [from] the conference committee that     1/17-18/77 - 11 -           reported out this bill before its enactment into law, we have given a definitional judgment that  the statute does not apply to the FOMC for the very simple reason that the definition of agency  requires that the collegial members to whom reference is made be appointed to such position [by  the President]     Now as the Committee is aware, this Committee is composed of the Board members and  five Presidents of Reserve Banks  The members of the Board are appointed to the Board by the  President with confirmation of the Senate  They are ex officio members of the FOMC  By that I  mean they are members by statutory grant, not by direct appointment of the President  They are  appointed to the Board and then statute makes members of the Board members of the FOMC   The issue of ex officio status was directly addressed by the sponsors of this bill, particularly Ms  Abzug, who was asked this question with respect to the National Security Council, the [Joint]  Chiefs of Staff, and one or two other agencies  And after going through the same definition I’ve  now discussed, she reached the decision, and stated as reported in the legislative history, that  such members were not the collegial--appointed to such position--members called for in the  statute, and thus such a group would not be an agency within the meaning of the statute     The question arises, Well, what about the phrase “or subdivision of an agency, authorized  to act on behalf of the agency?”  I think, immediately and clearly, the Federal Open Market  Committee is not a subdivision or subsidiary of the Board  Obviously, the Committee is  composed of its membership with its statutory functions directly in the language of section 12(a)  of the statute  It is not a derivative of the [Board] by statute, although its membership is partly  composed of members of the Board  That issue was discussed in the legislative history, and Ms  Abzug, again, who was the sponsor of the bill, made clear that the fact she referred to what is a  happenstance of law, that membership is identically composed, does not fit the meaning of this  term  And that therefore, such happenstance does not constitute a mandate of coverage by the  statute     Mr Chairman, the alternative, of course, is to assume this Committee had the question put  to it [unintelligible] assume the status of a covered agency  I would raise [unintelligible]  question as, not only to the desirability of such assumption, but of the ability of an administrative  agency, as this Committee is for other purposes, and of the statute to assume coverage of a  statute  One of the reasons I say this is that there are provisions in this bill that affect venue,  jurisdiction, the right of courts of review, the methodology of review, the impact of timing on the  agency to respond to suit, and even the right to bring suit on the part of a party  I don’t know of  the authority in a federal agency who has [unintelligible] question under an interpretation of the  law to say as a matter of decisional act, let’s apply the law to us with all of its benefits and with  all of its adverse consequence     For instance, normally, if this agency were sued without stint of [the] Sunshine [Act]--just  a suit brought, for instance, for declaratory judgment--I think a court of law might properly ask,  how much time would the agency have to respond?  The answer would be 60 days  It’s an  agency of the federal government, and under title 28 of the code, it has 60 days to respond  How  many days did you take here?  We took 28 because of this law  Therefore, you, by pulling the  law over your shoulders, you’ve deprived your agency of roughly 32 days’ time to answer       1/17-18/77 - 12 -           Who is your counsel?  Well, the Department of Justice is our counsel  Did the Department  concur that they were deprived of 32 days’ time?  No, they objected and said that we had 60  days  But since we assumed the status of an agency covered by this act, we were deprived of  those 30 days  I raise this as an example of a jurisdictional “pullover”  I question the right of an  agency, be it this Committee or any other government agency, to deprive courts of other  jurisdiction it might have, including appeal and other derivative procedural rights that are either  granted or forbidden by the statute     I bring this to your attention only in the decisional basis  It is my belief that there is good,  strong, statutory language reference, as well as the legislative history, to support the position that  this agency, as an agency, is not covered by Sunshine  I’ve given you an example of the trouble  I would have with a voluntary assumption of that status  There are a number of practical  reasons, that I won’t at this time take the Committee’s time to discuss, that I think argue strongly  not to legally take the position that the statute covers this agency  Now I say the latter for the  simple reason that, I must advise, there is legislative history that, [it] can be argued, supports the  legal position that this Committee is covered by [the] Sunshine [Act]     When I say that, I mean there are exchanges on the floor of the House and on the floor of  the Senate in the nature of colloquy  They are not contained in committee reports officially  reported on the statute  They are colloquy exchanges in which one member of the House asks a  series of questions, for instance of the sponsor of the bill, and in asking the question [will make]  reference specifically [to] the FOMC  And Ms Abzug, in replying, used the term “the FOMC,”  saying the FOMC would have no trouble, it could close all of those meetings  I am sure that  these exemptions would cover the FOMC  So I bring to your attention my judgment that these  discussions mark an assumed coverage of the FOMC status  [The colloquy exchanges] then  answered other questions that [were] relevant to the inquiry then being made  In fairness, that’s  the reference I have to the fact that the legislative history does bear some suggestion of coverage,  if you start with the assumed position that I have identified  On balance, I believe that the better  position is that it is not covered and that there are good, salutary, functional reasons for  following that position  And Mr Chairman, these roughly are my comments on the background,  and I’ll go any length further that you wish     May I address that, Mr Chairman?  It’s a very good and realistic  possibility that, at the time the Board of Governors issues its proposed regulations under  Sunshine, which will be forthcoming within a very short period now to meet the March 1  deadline, that publication of those regulations and the absence of similar regulations on the part  of this Committee could well draw an inquiry, then a demand, then a lawsuit, either to compel  the issuance of regulations, as if this Committee were covered, or a suit to declare that the  Committee is covered  Yes  And at a point in time the Chairman may perhaps wish to discuss a  possible publication by this Committee of a document paralleling a regulation that would offset  such a desire on the part of someone who would otherwise bring suit  Yes     It could  Certainly, Mr Chairman  Yes?     There has to be a publication within a framework of 30 days for  comment, then a review of the comments and a simultaneous oversight review by the  Administrative Conference of the United States under the terms of the statute  [Conforming],  then, to a 30-day statutory comment period, a 10- to 15-day period for the staff to review those  comments, review by the Administrative Conference--you’re into a two-month period  That  means, then, if the regulations must be in effect by March 12, [then] at or about mid-January to  the 20th of January is about the terminal date for getting them into the public arena      At present, that is correct  The draft that I’ve drawn to date is much  more modest then you might otherwise assume     Addressing the question as I understand it, Governor, What would be  the difference between being covered totally and technically under the law, and not being  covered but adopting a position as though we were covered?  Is that correct?  The difference  between these two positions?     All right, sir     Addressing specifically the issue of the minutes, if we are covered by  the statute, the makeup of the minutes in some respects wouldn’t be as full as they presently are  in our Record of Policy Actions  In other [respects], the law requires, for instance, that you  identify every document that is before the Committee by name and title  Not so with respect to  the minutes we now use  Once identified and in the record of the minutes, they are subject, of  course, to FOI [Freedom of Information Act] demand for production of those documents  That’s  one distinction, or difficulty     Secondly, we believe that more-timely issuance of our Record of Policy Actions--30  days--might be accomplished than [for] the minutes under the statute  Under the statute, we  probably could withhold publication of those minutes for much longer than 30 days--four  months, five months--because of their still-sensitive nature  So, as it is presently, the minutes are  so written as to not make specific disclosure of the name of the document, and we have no  problem issuing in 30 days     There are other procedural impositions of the statute, Governor, that would facilitate  lawsuits demanding certain documentation and opening of previously closed minutes that we     1/17-18/77 - 16 -           would not [be] subject to were we not covered by the statute  There is item after item that I  could take you through, were we covered, that make more difficult, more burdensome, [our]  operation under the statute than if we were not under the statute but, in our own way, almost  fully comply with the spirit of that statute  Does that respond to your question?     As I understand your inquiry, we can have up until the eve of March  12 to issue whatever form of statement we intended to issue with respect to our proposed  practices, that’s correct  Thus, we could await the Board [of Governors] action in publishing a  finally adopted set of regulations in final form, which might, say, come out the week before  March 12, to issue our FOMC statement at the same time     Under the circumstances, I should say we started with this and we’re  now about this [business]  That’s about all I can say, Mr Chairman  More directly, the Board  has legal--     I trust that the document that is finally before the Board, subject to  some continuing amendments to make more simple and less obtrusive the provisions of that  regulation, will soon be considered by the Board  The regulations, I think I can say, President  Eastburn, pretty well follow the exact mandated statute  What we’ve done is to put into  regulatory form the substantive and procedural requirements of the statute as they apply  particularly to the Board and its mode of meeting operation, providing for open meetings, closed  meetings, and the parallel requirements of the preparation of transcripts of minutes, depending  on the type of meeting that’s closed; and otherwise providing for the procedural identified step  of the advance requirement for notice of the meeting, the votes, and so forth  I hope that they  closely adhere to the statute and that they don’t go beyond that, thus following the mandate the  Chairman has given in the adoption of them     At this time the regulations clearly contemplate that matters dealing  with consumer affairs, by their nature, will be open to the public  Otherwise, the Board’s  regulations announce its intent to close such meetings as are allowed in the other 9, really 10,  total 10 exemptions of the statute  It is contemplated that, on the whole, more meetings of the  Board will be closed than will be open, although there are specific matters that, subject to  approval or adoption by the Board, will be open to the public, the OSCA [Federal Reserve  Board’s Office of Saver and Community Affairs]-type meetings, being an example of them     I could, Mr Chairman--taking the specifics, for instance, of a  personnel action, within a Reserve Bank, that is normally presented to [the] Board [of  Governors] for confirmation or approval  It is hoped that, by definition of the exemption for  personnel matters, which is found in the statute, such discussions by the Board could be closed     The issue of a Reserve Bank budget  There is no straight exemption for an agency’s  budget, or for a Reserve Bank budget, as would be the case here--[no provision] for closing such  a meeting  However, depending on the nature of the item in the budget being discussed, for  instance, if it involved or contemplated the acquisition of a building site, and so forth--items  such as that, we believe, could [be covered] under one of the exemptions, such as section 9(b),     1/17-18/77 - 18 -           [because] premature disclosure could place the agency at an operating disadvantage  We will  look for such closure possibilities     Well, Mr Chairman, I believe that Governor Jackson’s point was that  if that particular budget examination were done by a committee of the Board, that if the Board  were required to have an open session, so would the committee  I believe that was the point he  was making     It’s possible  If it were, for instance, a one-man committee associated  with staff of the agency, rather than three members of the Board, I believe that it escapes the  definitional impact of the statute and would not be subject to the Sunshine Act     Mr Chairman, the matter presently to the best of my understanding is  delegated to the Bank Activities Committee for initial determination and a recommendation to  this Board     Final determination by the subcommittee within a certain dollar limit   If it came within that dollar limit, the decision could be made on delegated authority by the  committee, [and] the committee would first have to ask, “Must this be open to the public?”  It’s  the matter of the purchase of equipment  If there were nothing in that consideration, Mr  Chairman, the disclosure of which at that time would jeopardize the ability of the committee to  direct and achieve a purchase within a given dollar amount, and it wouldn’t adversely affect the  competitive thrust of such proposal, it would have to be open to the public     1/17-18/77 - 19 -             Two possible exemptions from open meeting, Mr Chairman  Very  briefly, one under exemption 2, relating solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an  agency  We would have to urge that a discussion of that matter, insofar as it relates to the Banks,  would come within this exemption because we’re a unified system, and that, this being a Bank  personnel matter, [it] is also an agency personnel matter, namely of the [Federal Reserve] Board     If that were to fail, I would next turn to section 9(b) that says, you may keep a meeting  closed if, in the case of an agency, disclosure would be likely to significantly frustrate  implementation of a proposed agency action  If, by open discussion of this issue of salaries,  namely, the level at which we are going to establish them, we [brought] into play competitive  forces [acting on] what we perceive to be the market level, [and] that made it necessary for us to  raise those salaries or otherwise adversely affected our action, [then] it’s possible we could close  the meeting; otherwise, it would have to be open     I have no reason to believe, Governor Gardner, that in almost every  case, such items could be [unintelligible] closed meetings  There is a requirement in the statute  that goes beyond the conduct of the meeting itself, namely, either [a] transcript is prepared or,  [if] the meeting is closed pursuant to one of four specific exemptions, you have minutes instead  of a transcript  Any meeting that is closed pursuant to sections 7, 8, 9(a), or 10, you may have  minutes  If those minutes or the transcript are later found to contain nonsensitive items, that is,  conversations, references, or inclusions that were not subject to closure, that portion of the  transcript or the minutes must be made promptly available to the public  Now that contains  caution for the [Federal Reserve] Board and for the FOMC, should they come under the statute   The result would be, you could close the meeting, but immediately you must review the  transcript to determine whether portions must be made available to the public     That’s correct     1/17-18/77 - 20 -             The nature of our closing exemptions would make minutes the name  of the game     Yes, you would     Under the present format of the Board’s operation, Governor, that is  correct  It’s possible, and this would be up to the Board and the Chairman, it’s possible that  consent calendar items can be [exempt] because [of] their nature, largely a circularization  function as much as what was formerly known as a consent calendar  That [function] could thus  remove those from any form of Board agenda     That’s correct  If they were the only items, and the Board adopted  that method of circulating to the Board members for reading and for initial approval, the  discussions in Congress indicated that this is perfectly appropriate     To the extent that those budgets can constitute documents before this  Board     Then they are exposed     Yes sir     Mr Chairman, the members of the Committee have, I believe,  received [in] advance [of] the meeting [the] memorandum of law setting forth, as the Chairman  has indicated, the conclusion that I have reached on researching this issue  And accompanying  that memorandum was a proposed statement of policy that I have recommended, and with the  concurrence of the Chairman, the language has been adopted for the Committee’s study  [unintelligible] the position that I recommend  May I take just a few brief moments and restate,  in summary form, what I believe is a sustainable position with reference to the outcome of the  study?       2/15/77 - 2 -           The issue, of course, is whether the legislative history of the statute can reasonably be read  to exclude the FOMC from its coverage  As you have read in the memorandum page position  guide, certainly by definition of the term “agency,” which is contained in the statute, there are  three basic tests that an agency must meet as to whether it’s covered  One is whether it’s an  agency as [defined] in that statute  The Committee is such an agency  Second, whether that  agency membership is composed of [unintelligible] Committee meets that requirement test  And  the third is whether two or more of the members of such collegial bodies have been appointed to  such position by the President of the United States with the advice and consent of the Senate  If  that final test is met, the agency is covered  And of course it is on that last, third criterion that I  have taken the position that the FOMC is not covered     [Unintelligible] the [Federal Reserve] Board members, of course, are appointed to the  Board by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, but they are ex officio  members of the Committee--by statute, members of the Board are designated as members of the  FOMC  And, of course, at any given time, the five [Reserve Bank] Presidents serving [as voting  members of the FOMC] are not appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the  Senate  So the [FOMC] does not meet the so-called agency test within the meaning of the  statute  Nor, in my judgment, is the FOMC in any sense to be considered to be the subdivision  of the agency [that is, the Federal Reserve Board], which is also a component part of that  definition     On examination, there is no function performed by this Committee that can be said to be  the result of, or the direct follow-up of, the delegation of authority under the Board committee   Its principle functions are defined by statute and by some regulations issued pursuant to that  statute  The Committee is a functioning agency for other purposes and within the meaning [of]  the law  The Committee knows it is an agency within the meaning of the Administrative  Procedure Act--which is [unintelligible] USC  The Committee is an agency and has taken that  position with respect to the Freedom of Information Act  But for purposes of the Sunshine Act, I  am perfectly well satisfied that the start [unintelligible] the composition of the Committee as  explained by statute, viewed in the light of the definition of agency within the Sunshine Act,  reasonably postures the Committee [as] not being covered by that act     I cite in my memorandum, Mr Chairman and members of the Committee, statutory  reference to the historical points, as this bill was going through the Congress, that support this  position, one such being the extract, contained in the memorandum, of an exchange by Ms  Abzug, sponsor [of the] bill in the House  When asked by a member of the Congress as to the  actability of the term “agency,” she very clearly stated that the test of agency status is the  definition itself  And she gave an example of an ex officio status of an agency that would not be  covered by the act for the simple reason that the members were not appointed to such position by  the President  Although she admitted that they were appointed to another position by the  President, it was the body of which the question raised the statute’s actability that was the test  that’s forming that same rationale that we shall have     I must admit, there is contrary legislative history in the form of the debates on the floor of  the House  But I point out that, on careful study, I adjudge those quoted portions of the debates  to have assumed the status of coverage for the FOMC and then to have discussed other collateral     2/15/77 - 3 -           issues such as who is a member--assuming that the agency is covered--such as the right to close  a meeting and withhold a transcript  In that exchange it was assumed that the FOMC was  mentioned in these two or three phases  The sentence carried was something like  the FOMC, it  can close its meetings  So it was a stated assumption without itemized evaluation of the  language and statutes     Overall, I adjudge the legislative history to [be] balanced in favor of the position that is  contained in the memorandum and as reflected in the statement policy--the recommendation for  adoption of that statement  I submit that it has been very carefully prepared to adhere as closely  as possible to the language of the statute without exaggerated statement of the Committee’s  position  That, upon examination of its own operating procedures, the Committee has  determined that its present procedures, if continued to be followed--even though it demurs from  the position of legal technical coverage by statutes--in fact [demonstrates] compliance [with] the  spirit of the Sunshine Act     And more particularly, the Committee under its present practice releases its Record of  Policy Actions roughly a month following each of the respective meetings, and as now written  [because of] the Committee’s action of several months ago, [the Record] is a very full text when  compared with coverage [required] by the Sunshine Act  Under the technical terms of that act,  the Committee could hold major portions, if not all, of certain transcripts for months, even a  year, or whatever period that the Committee determined [was required] under the particular  exemption  As now written, there is basically nothing that is withheld per se [from] the Record  of Policy Actions, which is released about a month after the meeting     So in that sense, and as the Chairman has advised each of the members of Congress with  whom [he spoke], we feel that there is full deliverance in the spirit of the Sunshine Act, and that  we can go forward in that spirit, and that we are not in any sense cutting short the rights of the  public with respect to the Sunshine Act  Mr Chairman, I think those are the points I wanted to  cover     Mr Roos, as you well know, it’s difficult to respond to what will  trigger Mr Reuss into further action  The Reuss suit is now on appeal, and I should advise the  Committee that, at this time, the burden is on Mr Reuss’s counsel to file his brief in support of  his appeal  As of last night he had not filed the brief, so I don’t know particularly the points he     2/15/77 - 4 -           would make  It is possible, if he knew of this content, he could [use] the thesis of this position   against us  I have thought this out  I have discussed it with my colleagues  None of us,  including myself, is [of] the view that it [unintelligible] would weaken [our position in] the  Reuss suit  I am not aware, really, of any rationale  It is possible he could attempt to interpret  the Sunshine Act--     I am sorry, Bob, I didn’t hear the last part--excuse me     I have an opinion on that President Black  To the contrary, I believe  that our position is far better secured by the issuance of a statement of policy of the nature I have  recommended--similar to the action by the [Federal Reserve] Board several years ago, when we  issued a statement of policy with respect to the System’s position on labor management     In this case I have had calls from a number of public interest groups, I have had calls from  the Hill, from the editors of the two newspapers, stating an assumption that the recently  published Board regulations under Sunshine as they were released here some two weeks ago  were seeming to cover the FOMC  “Do they cover it?”  And my response has been that the  matter of coverage of the Sunshine Act has yet to be determined by the Committee, and shortly  we would announce the position      I am concerned that if we don’t publish a statement of policy in which we forthrightly set  out the Committee’s position and explain at the same time equal exposure as if covered, we will  either have law suits compelling the publication of regulations or constant demand when they hit  at us--“where are [the] regulations?”  This will at least serve that purpose, so the public will  know there will not be regulations covering the FOMC     Well, Governor, your point is well taken  Sitting now at the [15th] of  the month, if we were to issue today a proposed regulation covering the Committee [under the     2/15/77 - 5 -           Sunshine Act] and allowed 30 days [for comment], as required by law, we are then at March 14,  two days subsequent to the release date  Better late than never would be the attitude we [would]  have to exhibit  If the Committee adopts the statement of policy, [and] we are sued, and a court  were to require us then to [be covered] under Sunshine, and then we issued [our] regulations  [regarding our operations under the Sunshine Act], we’d be even that much more late, so the  matter of a few days I think probably wouldn’t be at all decisive     I should say, Mr Chairman, and Governor Gardner’s question [unintelligible], I believe I  mentioned in a previous Committee meeting that I have great difficulty in lightly recommending  that this Committee adopt the position of coverage when there is a clear appearance of  noncoverage  [My difficulty is] that I don’t know the administrative capability, under law, of an  agency taking [upon] itself the [decision regarding its] coverage [under] a statute where it  implies--and as a matter of fact, expressly involves--cutting the time in which the agency has to  answer a suit under the law  [The Act] gives jurisdiction [to] many courts of law that otherwise  would not have jurisdiction over this Committee [regarding] an ordinary lawsuit  It renders  certain of the rights of this Committee negative by law, and I don’t believe that the Committee  has the right as a matter of law to adopt these positions, thus covering up [unintelligible]  So it  would take an act of Congress or a declaration by a court of law, in my judgment, to cover us  under this law     Mr Chairman, may I add to a point that I wanted to make?  As a  result of one of the visits the Chairman made to the Hill, a member of the Senator’s staff, at the  Senator’s suggestion, referred the sole issue of law to the congressional library’s law division,  and without reference from us but from the Senator’s office  And a memorandum of law was  delivered from the congressional law library stating that its study of the statutes as applied to the  FOMC led to the very firmly stated conclusion that the FOMC was not covered by the Sunshine  Act for the very reason that we had argued  And we had not contacted [them], and [it was] an  independent legal memorandum, stated in one paragraph     May I respond to that?  President Eastburn, [subject to] judicial  [determination] or a declaration one way or the other, the Joint Chiefs of Staff [have a statutory]     2/15/77 - 6 -           position on the National Security Council, the Loan Guarantee Board probably would be an  example, the [unintelligible] President’s advisors, apparently do not come under [the Sunshine  law] for the same reason that they are ex officio members of the bodies that I mentioned  It is  estimated that there may be as many as 10 agencies that are similarly situated     Yes, Mr Chairman, I do  And very briefly, Mr Chairman, the  memorandum deals with the provision in the Committee’s regulations with respect to the  availability of information which at present [is] exempt from release under the Freedom of  Information Act--memoranda and materials to the Committee that are authorized by statutes to  be withheld from the public  At the present time, we have no specific statutory exemption that is  apt, nor have we had challenge nor direct [unintelligible] applicability of the provision     But in 1975 the Supreme Court of the United States had reason to address the issue of the  applicability and coverage of the so-called third statute exemption in the suit involving the FAA  administrator against Robertson  In that case, a challenge was made to the breadth of  discretionary coverage of the statutory provisions  The Supreme Court determined that any time  a statute gives an agency discretion to withhold certain information, even though the standards  for withholding are extremely broad and discretion in the administrator is broad, that exemption  applies       2/15/77 - 7 -           This concerned a number of public action groups that addressed the issues to Congress   And [at] the time the Sunshine Act [was] before the Congress for consideration, these groups got  language before the Congress that would closely limit and narrow the interpretation of  exemption 3 of Sunshine as pronounced by the Supreme Court  As a result, and as contained in  the memorandum that is before the Committee, by law, as in the law of the Sunshine Act, that  exemption is now far more closely and tightly limited in its use  With the three circumstances  set forth in the memorandum, namely, that you have to have a specific statute authorizing  specifically withholding in a nondiscretionary manner--or if discretion is granted by the  Congress, with the standards, the benchmarks, the factors that [show] the agency follows that  exemption and the guidelines [unintelligible] so that a member of the public can look at that  exemption and the guidelines and know precisely what the agency may withhold     It locks our discretion, that’s the name of the game  This statute, the Sunshine Act, has  amended the [Freedom of Information Act], making mandatory the adoption of those standards  by each agency  For that reason I presented it in an amended form to the Committee for  adoption  I don’t know and can’t anticipate when the Committee will have to apply it   Hopefully it won’t be soon  But on adoption, Mr Chairman, the Committee will now act and  report [unintelligible]     Mr Chairman, I stated earlier the possibility that the Court of  Appeals may render a judgment to confirm an interpretation of law requiring immediate release  of a directive policy action  Assuming the directive were included in that record, we are taking  the position that the most immediate time frame within which that Record of Policy Actions can  be formulated, finalized, adopted by the members of the Committee, and then be ready for final  action would be the period of time we are now operating in, namely, roughly a 30-day period, no  matter what were the immediacy the Court should render  So it’s within that time frame that I  express the view that I see no adverse impact, even should the Court of Appeals render the  judgment of which I speak      Thank you, Mr Chairman  This constitutes a statement of current  status of these suits, the first of which, the Committee will recall, is Merrill v FOMC  That suit  against the Committee was brought in May 1975 by a public interest group, and the Federal  District Court issued an order involving two mandates  One, with respect to the Committee’s  Record of Policy Actions, that it be released to the public under the Freedom of Information Act  promptly upon its adoption by the Committee  And second, that with respect to the demanded  Memoranda of Discussion of the January and February 1975 meetings, that such be searched for  reasonably segregable facts and that they be turned over to the plaintiff     As of the last meeting, the plaintiff’s and the Committee’s counsel had signed a stipulation  that would have dismissed from the District Court its jurisdiction [with regard] to [the] issue of  the Memoranda of Discussion--the plaintiff evidencing their satisfaction with that  The court has  to approve that; the court has not yet done so  We’ve sought some [unintelligible] status  determination; we have received no information, we don’t know what the court is doing with  that  It could sign, and that portion of the suit [would be] dismissed     The Court of Appeals item has been argued before the Court of Appeals  We are hoping  that a decision will soon be rendered by that court  That is on the Record of Policy Actions and  the promptness with which the Committee must release it  At this time, no action from the Court  of Appeals     With respect to the Reuss suit, Mr Chairman, as the Committee knows, that’s a suit  brought by Mr Reuss against all [Reserve Bank] Presidents, particularly those serving on the  Committee [as voting members] at a given time, alleging that their service on the Committee, not  being subject to Presidential appointment [and] confirmation by the Senate, is unconstitutional   That matter was briefed and argued before a District Court, and a decision was rendered by the  District Court in favor of the defendants, representing the Committee     The matter was immediately noticed for appeal by plaintiff Reuss  He filed his brief; we in  turn were to file our reply brief as of yesterday  We are still resolving some issues of law with  the Department [of Justice]; the Department has obtained two or three days’ continuance for our  filing  So hopefully, not later than Wednesday, Mr Chairman, we will file the reply brief on the     4/19/77 - 2 -           part of the defendants  We’re thoroughly satisfied here with our version of that brief, and  hopefully the Department will coincide with our judgment in that regard     Finally, a note of current status on the minutes of the [Reserve Banks’] board of directors  meetings for the years 1972, 1974, and 1975 that were requested by Mr Reuss through our  Chairman  Those materials were submitted in December to Mr Reuss, and to this date, neither I  nor my associates here at the Board have heard anything with respect to the [Reuss] committee’s  actions or [its] staff’s review of that material    I should say that one of our Banks, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has received  an inquiry from a member of that staff, indicating knowledge of copies in the minutes of that  Bank’s submission to Mr Reuss  The request was reasonably innocuous; it doesn’t forecast, I  think, any problems per se  The inquiry--staff to staff--was made last Friday or Thursday, to the  best of my knowledge, Mr Chairman  It could be handled as a matter--the material which was  inquired of, the physical material, was such as to almost be obtained under a Freedom of  Information request  But he did ask questions about the so-called employees emergency loan  fund, wondering what was the nature of that and did other Banks have it, etcetera     I, too, Mr, Chairman; that is the significance of it  May I suggest,  Mr Chairman, that--pursuant to a direction, I believe, earlier given within this Committee--if  other inquiries or questions are put to the Reserve Banks by members of the House staff, may I  urge, Mr Chairman, subject to your affirmation, that they be referred, at least conversationally,  to the [Federal Reserve] Board here and to members familiar with those minutes so that we can  have a single source of judgment      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have nothing further to report      Mr Chairman, if I may, that direction is given  That is the  understanding I had with Mr Guy yesterday afternoon  He will send both to myself, not the  supplement     I do, and in my judgment you are not [subject to Sunshine Act  limitations at that session], Mr Chairman  And with your permission, if, in the course of that  discussion, it appears to be otherwise, I will hasten to remind you       Yes, I think that, too, can be a matter to await a decision  I agree  with President Mayo that, at this time--or, may I suggest, Mr Chairman, the [discussion], first,  as to whether or not you will continue this operation, is appropriate; and then, whatever sense of  the Committee [is] in terms of the alternative, to follow that     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Chairman has put his finger on a  very critical point, namely that I believe there is at stake here a policy question that will be  discussed by you as members of the Committee  The legal issue can be framed very simply   The memorandum sets forth the occurrence that has brought the matter to the table today,  namely, a request under the Freedom of Information Act by an editor of the New York Times     8/16/77 - 56 -           seeking access to the Committee’s 1972 Memoranda of Discussion  The request was initially  denied, pursuant to the rules of the Committee, by the Secretary during the appeal period     An appeal was filed by Mr Herbers  That appeal was answered by Mr Coldwell as the  alternate for this purpose under the Committee’s rules  His letter, as indicated in the attachment  to the memorandum, came very close to a denial, and in a sense, of course, it was a denial, but  [it] was couched in such words as to offer to Mr Herbers the possibility that, having been  advised of the Chairman’s direction, this matter [would] be brought before the Committee  The  Committee would give further consideration, looking for some possible altering of action to that  reflected in the denial letter  That’s the purpose of its being here today     The issue is access under FOIA to the Memorandum of Discussion  The alternatives  presented in [my] memorandum are quite straightforward  They are four in number, the fourth  having an extension to it that I think bears some note  The first of these, as presented in the  memo, indicates access to the world at large  It would constitute the Committee’s action in  releasing the ’72 Memoranda of Discussion in a published form so that all media, all public,  have simultaneous access, subject to deletions that would be made for sensitive foreign entries   This would, of course, offer the benefit that it wouldn’t appear that we were favoring one arm or  one single element of the media such as the New York Times     The second alternative would be to give reading, or physical, access to the New York Times  for whatever purpose they have in mind but not make a public release  The point I made  earlier--this would be subject to the criticism that we have apparently favored one element of the  media over another  But it also has the benefit that there wouldn’t be wide publication of the  fact that we had released the Memorandum [of Discussion] earlier than our standard five years   You know, the Committee has administered a rule of a five-year lag before release [of] the  Memorandum     The third alternative is probably the most generous--to use the term--of the alternatives,  namely, the Committee could decide to release the 1972 Memoranda as well as all others now  being held  That would be up through 1975 in collected form, and, as the Committee knows,  there are three further Memoranda--the first three months of 1976--that have yet to be put in final  release form, or a form as the other memos, but [that] could be done; all of those could be  released prematurely of the five-year period, if the Committee [so] decided  This has the  advantage, from a regulatory point of view, that it would obviate repeated demands for one year  or another of the Memoranda  It has the disadvantage, of course, that, subject to the  Committee’s judgment, the closer you get to 1975 and ’76, you are perhaps releasing entries,  deliberations, and discussions of the Committee of a highly sensitive nature, causing the problem  that gave rise to the five-year lag in the first place  My mentioning the five-year lag and the  problems connected with it are not to be read as an argument for or against the five-year lag  I’m  merely making factual observations that I think are of service to the Committee in its  consideration of the matter     With respect to alternative four, I note that there is an extension of that, and it’s an  extension of thought  If the Committee were, under alternative four, to decline to give any more  than Governor Coldwell’s letter now gives, namely, a denial of access at this time, and affirm  that action, we could assume perhaps that Mr Herbers would--his principal, the New York Times,     8/16/77 - 57 -           would--litigate the matter, as [it] has a right to do under the Freedom of Information Act  At this  time we have no evidence that such would take place  There is a suggestion, as a matter of fact,  from conversations with Mr Herbers, that they have no intention of suing, but the world being  what it is, it’s possible that an affirmation of denial by the Committee might trigger a contrary  view     If litigation were instituted under the Freedom of Information Act, the Committee has 30  days within which to respond to any complaint filed--to reply or otherwise plead  In that period,  it is suggested in [my] memorandum that the Committee could have the issue involved again  brought to its attention  If the Committee, to avoid further litigation, wished to alter its position  then taken, there would be time, I believe, to proffer the Memoranda in question to the  requesting party with a simultaneous suggestion that the lawsuit be dismissed and the entire  matter compromised  This is, as I say, an extension of the denial  We could anticipate this  might take place     Mr Chairman, those are the alternatives  You will note, I believe, [that] my memorandum  doesn’t come down on a legal recommendation, simply because I believe it is a policy  consideration  I’ve pointed out the pros and cons of each in the memorandum, and I’d be glad to  respond  I should say that Mr Siciliano, from the Legal Division, whose name appears on the  memorandum, works with the Freedom of Information Act and is present with your proper  permission for purposes of this discussion  I think that’s all I have at this time, Mr Chairman     May I say from a perfectly legal point of view, it is in their court   They could move into court, reading that letter, if they wished, as a denial  I think it was  couched so they would defer action, I think, awaiting further word from this Committee     Well, if I may, Mr Chairman, I’d suggest [that] the language of the  second denial, or the appeal denial, would constitute a ground for them, reasonably anticipating  some further word perhaps from the Committee  It’s quite possible it would die if another word  was never said  But I think the language of that letter suggests that this Committee would be  deliberating it further     May I say, Mr Chairman, that the consequence of an adverse position  by the Department doesn’t impact on the Committee’s legal status to proceed exactly as the letter  indicates  It merely means that the Department would not appear as our counsel should a suit be  brought, at least if they kept their position as now stated  The Committee would have its own  representation by counsel, and we would go forth with the defense if that suit was brought here     Oh yes      Governor, I’d have to defer perhaps to Mr Altmann  I’m not sure  when this was     It was, I believe, in the early ’70s, but I’m not sure of the exact date     I can find that out     Under the present schedule     The December of ’72 are less than five [years old], but the difference  between now--yes, about 4-1/2     Then it will  As of this date, it’s short of five, the December     That’s correct     The Chairman is correct  It’s been done on a collected basis  The  entire year’s Memoranda have been gathered together--[with] the procedural aspect taking about  a month--[the entire year is] thus [released in] January of the succeeding year following the five- year period     By calendar date, that’s correct     8/16/77 - 62 -             May I raise the procedural issue of the need for a formal vote?  I  think that a lack of a vote, or rather a consensus, might avoid an entry of an action vote on this  matter, etcetera  Mr Chairman, I’ll defer to you on that     And under that amendment, Governor, as the Chairman has indicated,  there would be a provision, we hope, that precludes a suit under FOIA or demand--     8/16/77 - 64 -             May I suggest, Mr Chairman, that between the two positions is the  possibility that Joe Coyne might be directed, subject to the Committee’s judgment, to informally  be in touch with them and visit with Mr Herbers to indicate that a discussion by the Committee  indicated a consensus to affirm the action announced in the Governor’s letter, and that perhaps  some future discussion would bring about a different result, but that was the general consensus  now  It might then reveal what the attitude of the New York Times is, which would impel some  further action by the Committee, and might put it at rest  It’s an interim suggestion, Mr  Chairman     I believe that the Department’s position could be fairly interpreted as  saying that, Mr Chairman     Well, Steve can confirm this or not  I think in the discussion that  took place, the Department took the position that it was likely that we would not succeed before  a court of law, and it was [for] that reason they indicated they would not defend the position   Am I correct--     It also, Mr Chairman, in due respect, has one decision on this matter  out of District, and that’s Judge Waddy, who, by his last order, required that the entire  Memorandum be turned over to a Plaintiff, it being implicit in that order that he couldn’t find  that we’re in [a] defensible position, by saying that we couldn’t reasonably segregate that  His  order is read that way, we compromised that, reached a settlement, and never had to follow that  order  His last issue said, “Turn over the entire Memorandum, I will not go along with your  segregation of facts,” which ended up looking like Swiss cheese as we gave it to the plaintiff     That was what--      Yes, that was ’75     The Merrill suit     No, sir, it is not  There is a specific provision in the Freedom of  Information Act, Governor, that exempts Congress from that act, the provisions of the Freedom  of Information Act, so that neither the law nor exemptions apply to any of the requests from  Congress     Mr Chairman, may I be presumptuous to suggest one further  alternative, and I think you would want me to mention [it]  Governor Coldwell’s letter  mentioned the fact that, under the law, the seeking party is entitled to have reasonable segregable  facts but that it was the judgment of the writer, Governor Coldwell, that if such were undertaken  and were done, he would be given such a useless wheel-spinning document that it wouldn’t serve  his purpose     Mr Chairman, there is an administrative burden involved in this; the staff, though, could  accomplish this in a reasonable period of time  Is it possible that you and the Committee would  want to advise the New York Times that we are willing to undertake a segregation of facts and  present to you segregated facts, in the possibility the Times would say, forget the whole thing,  we don’t want segregated facts; which would be short of being confronted and a denial  [The  Times] is entitled to that by law  We might re-offer this as a reasonable next step and have  [them] be the part who say no, forget it, let’s call it quits, we’re finished     But we reached, really, if I may Governor, the judgment that that  letter reaches the decision, and thus we’ve decided not to do this     8/16/77 - 73 -             We had a plaintiff in the Merrill suit who was told the same thing and  didn’t believe us and pushed us for it and finally accepted it in settlement  So it’s possible that,  but for the purpose of the Times, who want to do an article, presumably our description was  correct  I bring that up, Mr Chairman, only as a--     [--]FOMC involved a demand by the plaintiff, which he initiated in  the federal District Court in the District of Columbia, for January and February 1975, the  Memoranda of Discussion of the Committee together with the Record of Policy Actions for  those two meetings, including the domestic directive and the ranges voted on by the Committee  at those two meetings  The lower court held, in a series of opinions in 1976, that the  Memorandum of Discussion had to be given to the plaintiff in what we then described as  reasonable segregation of factual portions, but that the deliberative process as reflected in that  Memorandum of Discussion could be withheld     And the court ordered that we give reasonably segregable facts to the plaintiff and  otherwise submit the entire Memoranda to the court for its review  Subsequently the court ruled  in October of 1976 that the entire Memoranda of both meetings had to be disclosed and given to  the plaintiff  Subsequent to that order, as the Committee was advised and under the Committee’s  direction, we negotiated a settlement with the plaintiff whereby--less than ordered by the court--  but [to] the satisfaction of the plaintiff, the facts from the Memoranda were accepted by the  plaintiff in settlement of that issue  Thus, it was separated from the court of litigation     Secondly, the court had ordered that the Record of Policy Actions be made promptly  available to the public upon its adoption by the Committee  In essence, that, too, was separated  on appeal for the reason that, under the Committee’s reduction in time sequence, the Record of  Policy Actions is now available to the public, after its adoption by this Committee, immediately  following the next meeting, roughly 30 to 35 days  Well, since this constituted essential  compliance with the mandate of the court, namely, a prompt disclosure to the public after its  adoption, and the Record of Policy Actions isn’t adopted virtually until the next meeting, the  parties agreed that we were in compliance     That left one issue on appeal, and it was that issue that was the subject of the litigation in  the decision that was issued on November 10 in the Court of Appeals, namely, the timing, under  the Freedom of Information Act, of the Committee’s release of the directive and, as it now  includes, the ranges adopted by the Committee  Basically, the Freedom of Information Act,  which is applicable to the Federal Open Market Committee, requires that policy statements and  interpretations of policy adopted by an agency must be made promptly available to the public   And that availability takes either the form of publication in the Federal Register, the official  government publication, or in lieu of that publication, availability to the public in copying form   That is what the court required be made available, in either of those two forms, with respect to  the two items I mentioned--the directive and the targets within that directive    Mr Chairman, members of the Committee, I won’t take time, unless specific questions are  asked, to [explain] what the court’s rationale was  The Committee may recall that, essentially,     11/15/77 - 2 -         we thrust three points on our appeal to the Court of Appeals  The most essential point was that  premature disclosure of the directive materials could constitute an adverse reaction on markets to  the undue advantage of those participating in the market who are sophisticated enough to handle  that  Secondly, it was predecisional in nature, and that, under exemption 5 of the Freedom of  Information Act, predecisional actions by an agency or, in this case, a committee, were not  required to be disclosed     As those of you who have had an opportunity to look at the opinion realize, the Court of  Appeals cast aside both of these arguments by a unanimous court, Judge McGowan writing that  opinion  The court held that, in its judgment, such actions by this Committee were not  predecisional but were in essence the decision of this Committee; that at each meeting the  Committee adopts and finally acts upon its directive to the Account Manager, and this is a final  action, and that the ranges encompassed therein also constitute final action of this Committee  and that nothing more is to be done except the discretionary action, within the range and  directive, by the Account Manager  Thus, the action of the Committee taken today, for example,  is a final action that must be made available, on its adoption, which of course would mean today     Mr Chairman, let me very quickly touch upon some possible alternative procedures that  the Committee may wish at some time to contemplate as a result of this decision  With respect  to the court’s order and opinion, under the rules of the Court of Appeals, the court enters its  judgment and opinion, and then, within 21 days of that entry--which is November 10--within 21  days of November 10, the court issues its mandate, which in effect is an entry by the clerk of the  final effect of the court’s order  So thus, by calendar count, on December 1, this Committee  must be in compliance with the full mandate of that opinion, unless, in the meantime, some stay  or continuance of that time order is effective  So thus, by December 1 coming, the actions of the  Committee taken today with respect to its domestic directive and the ranges must be made  available to the public     Now, between now and December 1, the Committee can authorize that there be filed on its  behalf a request for a rehearing by the Court of Appeals; a request for a reconsideration of the  issues on appeal by the entire court, which is known as an “en banc” review by the Court of  Appeals; or thirdly that we request of the Solicitor General of the United States under title 5 of  the United States Code a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court     Very quickly commenting on each, the request for a rehearing must be filed within 14 days  of the court’s mandate entry  Now that petition would ask the same three judges who  unanimously held against the Committee to review the case and re-decide this matter on the  basis of resubmitted arguments of merit on behalf of the Committee  Commenting on that, may I  say that a reading of that opinion doesn’t suggest to me openly that there will be much merit in  such petition  I think the opinion evidences a rather broad ranging--not without deliberation--but  a disregard of the merits of our argument with respect to the three points that I mentioned were  in our brief  So that [the success of] such a petition I think is in doubt     Secondly, if you ask the entire court--this Court of Appeals has nine judges, three of whom  decided this case  There are two other judges on the Court of Appeals who--on review, I believe  their decisions indicate that they are of the same liberal bent with respect to the Freedom of  Information Act as are the three judges who decided this case  That, I believe, would give you     11/15/77 - 3 -         five of the nine [deciding], I believe, as this court [already has], so I think that the likelihood that  [the entire court] would reverse the Court of Appeals [three-judge] decision is small     Thirdly, the petition for writ of the Supreme Court  The Solicitor General is given the  authority to make the ultimate decision of whether an agency may seek certiorari of the Supreme  Court  We would file a letter with the Solicitor General requesting that such a petition be filed   Within a 15-day period, a brief--very substantial, and, I think, very tightly worded--must be filed  in support of this petition  Once that petition is filed with the Supreme Court, asking that the  Court accept on certiorari a review of this case, that automatically is accompanied by a petition  to the Court of Appeals that the previous 21-day mandate that I mentioned, which becomes  effective December 1, be extended for a maximum, under the rules, of 30 days  So that the filing  of a petition accompanied by this petition for extension could affect, until January 1, the  Committee’s time within which to respond to the court’s opinion     I’m now just setting out the maximum time calendar, Mr Chairman, that can be  accomplished  Again, if a writ of petition for certiorari is sought, we have, first, the Solicitor  General’s initial determination; if that’s successful, will the Supreme Court accept the writ of  petition for certiorari; and if that is given, then the third hurdle to pass is the Supreme Court’s  actual decision on certiorari on review of this case  Mr Chairman, those are the procedural steps  that are available to the Committee  I think, before the Committee begins with any comments it  has on this matter, you might in your discretion, which should be done, ask for a no-objection  from the Committee with respect to our pursuing all matters of procedural appeal that seem to be  in the best interest of the Committee     Alternatively, and a matter that the Chairman may wish to comment on, the last paragraph  in the opinion--those who have read it will note that the Court of Appeals said,    We believe we have correctly interpreted the Freedom of Information Act, that those provisions requiring  prompt public disclosure are applicable to the documents in question here, and that no exemption exists that  would save them from that public disclosure requirement  This being so, there is no legal court pursuit that the  Committee can make  We urge that the Committee might wish to turn to Congress and seek legislative relief,  namely, a statute to be enacted by the Congress, if it so chose, that would relieve from the mandate of the  Freedom of Information Act material such as this  Either in the form of an absolute mandate of freedom from  this demand or a reasonable delay authorized by statute, pursuant to which the Committee could perhaps for 30  days--the same time as now under practice by the Committee--delay its public delivery of the directive and its  contents  If this were authorized by statute, then, under exemption 3 of the Freedom of Information Act, the  Committee could delay its public access of this material     Mr Chairman, I believe I’ve covered the points that the Committee would want to hear  about, and I’ll be glad to respond to any questions     Yes sir     11/15/77 - 4 -           There is almost a certainty of a three-day delay for transmission   Totally, I think, outside time, five days is the most you can expect in the way of delay, possibly  four, Mr Chairman, from the time it leaves this building forward     I would say that, on Art’s point, that that might make it available--I  think it’s still a three-day interim from the time of the Committee’s action forward     Yes sir     Yes sir, I will  The December 1 date?     All right  If the Committee, as I urge, perhaps might express a no- objection--if, on behalf of the Committee, there were filed a request for a stay of mandate with  the suggestion that we would be seeking a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court, the Court of  Appeals can act upon that and grant a maximum 30-day extension of the December 1 effective  date, which would take it to January 1 if the Court of Appeals granted our stay request     I believe it is Mr Chairman  I would recommend that   SPEAKER(?)  Is this discretionary on the court’s part?     Yes it is     I believe that over a period of time it will be found that a request of  the Court of Appeals for this 30-day extension--and under the rules, the court has within its  discretion a granting of a shorter or, under exigent circumstances, a longer period, but 30 is cited  in the statute--is usually accompanied by a suggestion that the party seeking the extension  intends to file a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court     I don’t know of any instance in which the court would view a petition for extension and  later [find] that the suggestion of petition was merely a fraud or a [unintelligible] to get this 30- day action time  So, Mr Chairman, my point is that I think the Committee should seriously  consider the legitimacy of seeking from the Solicitor General a merit judgment that we will seek  petition for certiorari and at the same time ask that there be requested the 30-day extension of the  time within which we must act on this mandate     I spoke to the Department of Justice yesterday and asked [if] they were aware of any  instance in which an agency asked for the 30-day extension on the stated premise that, as in this  case, the court in its opinion suggested congressional relief [and] the agency needed this much  time to address this matter to an appropriate congressional source  He said he was aware of no  such time or action with respect to a petition for 30-day extension, that it usually accompanied  almost automatically the petition for certiorari     President Morris, I have feedback only at the staff level  The head of  the appellate section [of the Justice Department]--who, I believe, has a leg up on the attitude of  the Solicitor General because they work together daily in these matters--is not too affirmative  with respect to his judgment of success in getting the Solicitor General to seek the petition for  certiorari  I must say, though, that on the appeal from the District Court, his attitude was  somewhat the same  It took two visits to the [Justice] Department and a discussion on each  occasion to satisfy the appellate section that there was merit in our anticipation of consequence  should this be prematurely disclosed  So I can’t be too affirmative in my anticipation, but the  question, and my response now given, I think bears on President Roos’s inquiry and the  Chairman’s comment     May I say that, should we move ahead and maybe release pursuant to the court order, and  [should] it not have any market reaction whatsoever, it does [make] a little bit difficult, then, the  premising of our original points of appeal on a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court  It makes  that argument much more difficult     The Court of Appeals rule provides that a petition for an extension  may be filed very quickly  Under the rule for a stay of mandate--if I may, Governor, “a stay of  the mandate pending application to the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari may be granted  upon motion, a reasonable notice of which is given to all parties  A stay shall not exceed 30  days unless”--and then this is the provision to which I referred--“the period is extended for cause  shown,” and, by practice, that has been proven to be one of necessitous circumstances or very  deep concern     No sir, you don’t     If I may, some of the terms of this rule that I was reading for  Governor Coldwell are applicable to your question, Governor  If I may, “If during the period of  stay”--and this is the 30-day stay provided in the rule--“if during the period of stay there is filed  in the clerk of the Court of Appeals a notice from the clerk of the Supreme Court that the party  who has obtained the stay has filed a petition for writ in that court, stay shall continue until final  disposition by the Supreme Court”  And as a matter of practical judgment, that could be one to  two years’ time  “Upon the finding of a copy of an order of the Supreme Court denying the  petition for writ of certiorari, the mandate,”--that is, the effective date--“shall issue  immediately”  And then it has provision for a bond to be posted, so that a finding of a request  for the 30-day extension accompanied by a petition for certiorari would certainly achieve, I  believe, the 30-day extension to January 1  Beyond that time, it would take favorable action by  the Supreme Court granting a writ to further delay the effective impact date of this     In that time period  If it hadn’t [decided whether to grant], we would  then take steps to extend the stay pending decision of the Supreme Court     To the best of my knowledge, that’s correct     Well, we would know  Assuming my earlier statement, Governor,  that the two petitions are filed simultaneously--namely, the petition for writ and the 30 day--we  would have known the Solicitor General’s attitude  It presumes that the SG would let us know  within that time frame whether or not he will support a petition for certiorari  If he [says] no,  then I think that practically [negates] any findings in a petition for a 30-day extension     Governor, I think the likelihood is not too great, for this reason, very  quickly stated  The Department of Justice under the current Administration issued, in the fall of  last year, guidelines to accompany the Freedom of Information Act  And the civil division of  that department now has promulgated its own suggested guidelines, pursuant to the Attorney  General’s directive, really [advancing] a very liberal attitude about the provisions of this act, all  to the end that, as much disclosure affirmatively and promptly made as is possible is the rule of  the day     That being true, I think the Courts of Appeals and the Supreme Court are thus similarly  interpreting the Freedom of Information Act  I think this opinion sets aside any imperative  argument that we put on the nature of the document and treats, for instance, the directive as  another piece of paper under the Freedom of Information Act and just deals with the statute  parallel to earlier decisions of other Courts of Appeals  And I believe the Supreme Court would  look at it in exactly the same view  So I honestly believe that the likelihood of  overturning--unless we had an extremely strong brief and for some reason we’re able to retrench  our position-- not too great     To the best of my knowledge     11/15/77 - 10 -           The court gave, I think, a creditable review of the historical import  [of] the Freedom of Information Act, President Eastburn, [and] found that the Committee’s  position--that the exemption 5 language covered the document in question here--to be without  merit  It cast aside our position that the legislative history indicated a congressional intent to  protect [an agency that has] this type of information flow that might imperil, as we had argued,  imperil the market, etcetera  The court disagreed with this and stated, “we note that the  Committee releases this information at and immediately following its next meeting”  Using that  as a premise for saying [in effect], “so we can’t see anything quite as sensitive as the Committee  urged”  In sum, I think the Court of Appeals opinion is to be read as purporting to have  examined the legislative history, the wording of the statute, and the decisional basis, and rejected  the Committee’s position of the right of exemption under number 5     That issue wasn’t in any sense either expressly or implicitly  addressed in this opinion  My judgment is, the implicit change as suggested by President Mayo,  that is, that the Committee’s use of language to reflect its actions taken--somewhat changing the  previous format of that language--would not contravene any sense or direction of the court  I’m  now alluding to President Mayo’s last statement of position, to which I think the Chairman  agreed--     President Baughman, the language in the Court of Appeals, I think,  should be read much like in a parental circumstance, where mother says, “Ask your father”  It  doesn’t necessarily mean that mother anticipates father’s going to give any different answer or  relief, but it’s a way of mother being finished with the problem  The Court of Appeals, when it  suggests you address it to the Congress, is mindful of the fact that there’s nothing in its rule that  states specifically “and you may come to us and ask for all the timing you need to seek this of  Congress”     The court is aware that its time frame addresses itself only to the certiorari petition of the  Supreme Court  I don’t know, and I haven’t had an opportunity to examine the possibility, that  the court wouldn’t consider a petition for extended time premised solely on the congressional  approach  I will make inquiry in that regard  The rules don’t contemplate it, nor was I able to  find a previous instance in which the Court of Appeals granted extensions or continued  extensions beyond the 30 days premised solely on the attempt to address the Congress     No sir  Nor is their opinion to be read as a statement on their part that  they know that they were absolutely right and that we won’t pursue a petition to the Supreme  Court, as I think we should     I believe that the court’s opinion contemplates that to constitute a  substantive action of the Committee, amending its earlier directive, and must require it to be  published     No  I interpret the court’s move to immediately require publication  of actions of the Committee, particularly, and it addressed itself to the directive and the targets   As I earlier noted, I believe that the balance of the policy record--constituting, as it does,  adoption within 30 days--is not contemplated within this immediate--     Yes, Mr Chairman  For the Committee’s recollection, the Merrill  case, of course, involves a demand that is made under the Freedom of Information Act for  certain of the Committee’s documents derived from two meetings of the Committee in ’76  And  the lower court decision, from which an appeal has been taken--the issue on appeal relating  primarily and almost solely to the requirement [that] the Committee issue and make public  promptly after its adoption the directive of the Committee, including the short-range targets   That was the issue on the appeal, and as you recall, Mr Chairman, the mandate [of the] Court of  Appeals, under its rule, was to be effective December 1  That is, the Committee is required to  follow the order of that court     We filed with the Department of Justice on December 9 a very thoroughly researched  request for the Solicitor General to take to the Supreme Court, a request for review by that body  of the Court of Appeals decision  We had preceded [that] with the request that the Department  [of Justice] obtain for the Committee an extension of this December 1 mandate, and they  requested of the Court of Appeals an extension until January 1 [for] the Committee to comply  with the mandate issued by the Court of Appeals pending the preparation of the Solicitor’s  position   As of noon today, in my conversations with our counsel in the [Justice] Department, the  department’s Civil Division position--[what] it will recommend to the Solicitor General--has not  yet been forwarded to the Solicitor General  At the appellate level [of the department], the  attorney to whom I spoke has recommended a position to the Assistant Attorney General in that  division [the Civil Division]  He describes [that position] as, while not being as strongly  supportive of certiorari as he felt our document was, in no sense was it negative, as he said        The attorney in the Civil Division prepared an intraoffice  memorandum analyzing the case for and against the certiorari petition, Mr Chairman He was  not at liberty to tell me exactly what his recommendation was, but he merely came close to     12/19-20/77 - 2 -         saying it wasn’t as strongly supportive as the Committee’s letter, but he felt it didn’t have a  negative cast to it  He has advised [us] of his receipt of the Treasury Department’s letters  supportive of our position, copies of which have been distributed to the [FOMC] members  So  there has gone forth to the Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Division our letter on behalf  of the Committee, the Treasury Department positions, and a memorandum position from the  attorney staff level [of] the [Justice] Department  There will now go, from the Assistant  Attorney General to the Solicitor General, the total recommended position of the Civil Division,  a copy of which, hopefully, we will obtain when it goes forward  As yet, to my knowledge, it  hasn’t gone forward     Meanwhile, the Committee has until January 1, as best we know, within which to comply   Hopefully, as we get near the first of January, that date will be extended, as is necessary and if it  can be obtained  Or it will automatically be extended--if the Solicitor General files on the  Committee’s behalf a petition for writ of certiorari, under the rules, that will automatically stay  any requirement of this Committee to comply with the Court of Appeals orders until the  Supreme Court has either accepted and ruled upon our position or denies it  And I will, of  course, promptly advise the Committee on receipt of either of those dates     May I quickly touch on the fact that, with respect to the suit of Reuss v Balles et al, which  you recall involves allegations by Mr Reuss that the selection method for the [Bank] President  members of the FOMC is unconstitutional because it does not derive from a selection by the  [US] President with the advice and consent of the Senate  We won that case on motion in the  District Court, the court holding Mr Reuss didn’t have standing to bring the suit  Mr Reuss  appealed that issue and that decision, and it was argued [earlier] this month, December 8, before  a three-member panel of the Court of Appeals here in the District of Columbia     The argument, I think, went fairly well  Our counsel from the Department of Justice was  well prepared and, I think, a pretty sharp man  He knew his case, he was able to respond to  questions put to him by the court  One of the three members of the court was absent, Judge  Tamm, but a recording of our arguments will be presented to him so he will have heard all  arguments before he begins to deliberate on the decision  We have no idea when to expect an  action by the Court of Appeals  Mr Chairman, I think that brings my information current on  both cases  If I can answer any questions, I will be pleased to do so     It’s hard to tell, Mr Eastburn  From the notification of acceptance,  we follow certain established procedural time limits for filing of briefs, answering briefs, oral  arguments, dates, and so forth  As much as six months could be involved, even on the  established calendar     Governor, if it is rejected as of that date, it is up to the Court of  Appeals to issue a date of mandate effectiveness  But I think it would follow promptly upon the  actions of the Supreme Court in the denying of writ, but we would get a date definite, and I  would advise the Committee as promptly as possible     With respect to the mandate per se, no, we would not  Presumably  our petition having been denied by the Supreme Court--that they will not accept the case on  appeal--and a sufficient extension having been obtained to enable us to pursue that, we are pretty  well bound by whatever mandate the Court of Appeals issues  It is possible--an outside  possibility, Mr Baughman--that the Court of Appeals could be addressed on the single issue of  taking to the Congress a petition for congressional relief as suggested in the opinion If that were  the sole reason, [the Justice] Department questions whether the court would grant an extension  solely for that, but it’s a reasonable possibility, and I think we would try it to gain further  administrative time under that matter      I stated, President Guffey, as a minimum, my judgment, about six  months would be involved  The Supreme Court could respond to our writ promptly within a  month  The scheduling of that, the briefing, would be automatic, but scheduling for the oral  argument could be months, and so forth  As you know, the Court recesses and then takes up  again at a later date  It’s difficult to know how long we would be with respect to that calendar       Correct  If he does so, pending the Court’s answer of affirmative or  not, a status is still in effect, and that is automatic once the petition has been filed  Correct     Under the statute, Mr Chairman, I believe a maximum of 10 days for  the initial answer to such a request  The statute calls and contemplates for a period--but that’s a  maximum period, 10 days  That 10 days contemplates the necessary search of information and  compilation of the data     With respect to the subject of your inquiry, someone asking for identification of the votes,  knows as a matter of judgment that 10 days isn’t required  But the agency could, if it wished,  rely on that, subject to a push of this petitioned party to the court, if you will, [who would claim]  that “10 days wasn’t necessary, and I have filed suit now to get an earlier response”       I believe that would be fairly read as a denial of the request for the  information sought     Under the Freedom of Information Act, the party petitioning has a  right then to seek an appeal of that action; and that would be, under the Committee’s appellate  procedure, to a designated officer of the Committee, who would review the action below, namely  a denial of a timely response, and there’s a period of time within which that decision must come  forth  Once that’s delivered, if it affirms the lower action--the initial reaction--and it is still  negative, then the party seeking the information could file--     You’re just about there--     I think, were I counsel for the party that had been seeking the original  information, I would revert to a lawsuit to get the court to straighten out what we consider to be  some rather delaying response on the part of the Committee     That, as a matter of fact, for logic, yes, it is, Mr Chairman       I’d say the first time     It’s the same incident     Well, I would ask you to articulate exactly the document you are  talking about       Well, I don’t know how  If I may, Mr Chairman--the requirements  in the demands in the Freedom of Information Act, Mr Mayo, relate to records of an agency   That’s the broad concept of that statute  And to the extent that an agency is in possession of  what I will refer to as intra-agency information, recommendations, materials that are not adopted  records of the agency, the agency is protected from disclosure of such  I consider what you’ve  been describing as the latter type of information  The Committee [possesses], of course, bundles  of information that it has not itself determined to be matters that it has adopted for use of the  Committee  It can reject or accept that which it chooses  And until it has done so, I would  defend that it is not a record of the agency that must be subject to disclosure requirement by the  FOIA     12/19-20/77 - 22 -           Governor, I read the court’s decision as taking the Committee  procedure and format as it was found and as described in pleadings that reached the Court of  Appeals  I see nothing in that opinion that prohibits this Committee from exercising its own  discretion in the format that it adopts  The allusion that I believe you refer to--evasions or  subterfuge--were intended to calculate a judgment on the basis of practice as found by the Court     12/19-20/77 - 23 -         of Appeals of what we might be doing to go around that position rather than preventing the  Committee from adopting a reasonable position it reaches      In my judgment we are not     The Committee’s explanation, Governor, I counsel only, should not  confront any mandate of the Court of Appeals  You have already read, the court has said actions  taken by the Committee as reflected in adoption by the Committee should be promptly  published  It does not say that you may not change the mode of your arrival or the actions that  you will take, but once done, and once adopted, you must publish  And I think no other  conclusion is intended from that Court of Appeals decision       I believe so, if I may     With respect to the discount rate action itself, that is the issue of--I’m  not concerned, Mr Chairman, that there would be any problem of legality of action taken with  respect to the rate itself  I have no trouble Mr Chairman, firmly  But my judgment would be     12/19-20/77 - 80 -         that there is no problem with respect to the action itself  I could go further into detail with  respect to the reason behind it and the legality of the action, but I see no need to     There are, but my response, Mr Chairman, was with particular  reference to the discount rate  There are other problems--     I will     I will be--     My judgment is that, under the present extension on which we are  operating to the Court of Appeals, this directive and the Committee’s action are not subject to an  immediate publication mandate for the court  We are under a pause effected by the request for  extension of time  And so this month’s directive, I think, operates as did the previous directive   We are not under that mandate     Yes, Mr Chairman  I believe there have been distributed to the   members of the Committee, Mr Chairman, some information sheets that were transmitted to the  Solicitor General on this matter  Very briefly, the Solicitor General has until February 8 as a  terminal date to make his decision as to whether to seek certiorari in the Supreme Court in this  Merrill decision  At this point in time, we are scheduled--we being the Committee’s staff and  lawyers from the Board--to appear before the Deputy Solicitor General, Mr Easterbook, tomorrow  morning at 10 o’clock to be given the opportunity to vocalize views, exhortations, positions that  had been transmitted in the form of a written letter to the Civil Division’s Assistant Attorney  General  That was forwarded several months ago now  By dates in latter December, as you will  note, both the Chairman of the Economic Advisers as well as the Treasury Department have  affirmatively supported the Committee’s position in urging the Solicitor General to seek certiorari  on the issue enjoined  At this time, there has been a negative recommendation forwarded by the  Civil Division, which is the first body within the Department to make a recommendation to the  Solicitor General  In several conversations with that office, Mr Chairman, the feeling at the  present time is that there is not a strong affirmative case to be urged before the Supreme Court, but  they state that quite honestly it’s still an open question  I think tomorrow [after giving] our  position, within perhaps 5 to 8 days we will have a decision out of the Solicitor General  If  tomorrow’s meeting does not favorably impress the Deputy Solicitor, we will then be given an  opportunity, I believe, to address the Solicitor General personally on this point         1/17/78             24    May I add, Mr Chairman, as the Committee is also advised by materials   in front of it, that action has been undertaken from the Board here to urge legislative relief of a  nature suggested by the Court of Appeals in its opinion--namely, that there be an amendment to the  Federal Reserve Act that would direct the withholding of the Committee’s directive for a period  until the next succeeding meeting  That’s because under the Freedom of Information Act  exemption number three requires that there be such a statutory mandate in order to enable the  Committee to rely on that as a [reason for] withholding its directive  Such a letter was addressed to  Mr Proxmire, with supporting views and positions in a letter signed by the Chairman to Mr  Proxmire       Just to the effect, Mr Chairman and Mr Volcker, that I agree with the   analysis that Mr Volcker has given us as to the placement of priorities or emphasis on the     1/17/78             39  alternatives  I recommended, as reflected in attachment D, the amendment to both the functional  aspects and the outstanding authorization only in the judgment that such an authorization would  then make specific the authority with respect to the alternative actions, either when SOMA is  involved or if the New York Bank is acting as principal in these transactions  I think it’s more  inclusive and perhaps from my point of view as a procedural matter is preferable  Technically, I  think either alternative 3 or 4 would functionally serve Mr Volcker’s stated purposes and the  purpose with respect to the Internal Revenue Service        No, I've checked it recently, Mr Chairman  You've stated it correctly  that the matter of stay is still within the discretion of the court
