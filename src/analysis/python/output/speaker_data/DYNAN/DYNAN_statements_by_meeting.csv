8441,2009-01-27," Exhibit 3 covers the housing sector  As can be seen in the top left  panel, our forecast calls for single-family housing starts to bottom out in the first half  of this year and to move up gradually thereafter  One factor behind the projected  improvement in housing demand is the interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate conforming  mortgages, shown in the top right panel  This rate fell sharply following the  November 25 announcement of the Federal Reserve’s MBS purchase program, and  we expect it to remain low over the next two years   That said, our projected pickup in housing activity is quite modest, as mortgage  credit remains more difficult and more expensive to obtain than might be implied by  the conforming mortgage rate alone  As summarized in the middle left panel, the  disappearance of nonprime mortgages from private sources makes it much more  difficult to obtain mortgages for households lacking solid credit histories, unable to  make significant down payments, or in need of low introductory interest rates  Part of  the gap has been filled by an increase in originations associated with Federal Housing  Administration programs, but such originations remain far below the level of private  nonprime originations at their peak  In addition, lending is now more restrictive than  in the past to those seeking to finance an amount above the conforming limit                 January 27–28, 2009 87 of 267  Housing demand is likely also being damped by an expectation that house prices  have not reached their trough We project that house prices will decline significantly  further before flattening out at the end of 2010  As shown in the middle right panel,  this decline pushes one measure of the overvaluation of housing that we monitor well  into negative territory Prices typically overcorrect at the end of housing cycles, but  this correction is amplified by the extent of the earlier overvaluation and by the  excess supply of unsold new and existing homes that we foresee over the forecast  period   The bottom left panel shows one implication of the bust in house prices—a rise in  the share of prime and subprime mortgages with low current equity  As shown on  lines 1 and 2, the recent declines in house prices have led to considerable increases in  the shares of mortgages with equity below 20 percent  Moreover, as indicated on  lines 3 and 4, the share with negative equity has also increased rapidly  These low  levels of home equity, along with greater job losses, have pushed foreclosures—  shown in the bottom right panel—to very high levels  In 2008, lenders initiated more  than twice as many foreclosures as in 2006  Notwithstanding the government  foreclosure mitigation efforts embedded in our forecast, we expect prime foreclosures  (the red portions of the bars) to remain high this year before diminishing somewhat in  2010 Subprime foreclosures (the blue portions) are projected to show a more  pronounced decline largely because the stock of outstanding subprime loans is  shrinking in response to the cessation of new loans and the termination, through  default or refinancing, of existing loans   Exhibit 4 features our outlook for consumer spending  Real disposable personal  income (the blue bars in the top left panel) fell in the second half of last year, but real  consumer spending (in red) declined even more sharply  Disposable income is  projected to step up early this year as a result of the sizable personal tax cuts and  increases in transfer spending built into our forecast  Despite the support from fiscal  measures, consumer spending is projected to increase only weakly this year and  moderately next year The saving rate (the black line in the panel at the right) is  projected to move up sharply in early 2009 as the tax cuts are only gradually spent   We expect saving to remain elevated over the next two years, in part because of the  sharp drop in household wealth relative to income (the red line) and because of  households’ greater uncertainty about their income prospects  We think that spending  will be damped in coming quarters as well by difficult borrowing conditions  The  middle left panel shows two important sources of the credit available to finance  consumer spending  The blue portions of the bars correspond to housing equity  tapped through home equity loans and cash-out refinancings; surveys suggest that  households traditionally put perhaps one-fifth of such funds toward consumer  purchases As can be seen, mortgage equity withdrawal declined sharply last year   Consumer credit (the red portions of the bars) also fell off over the year, turning  negative by the fourth quarter   The declines in household borrowing reflect, to some extent, reduced demand for  loans, as the weaker economy has led households to defer spending  However, as                 January 27–28, 2009 88 of 267  illustrated in the middle right panel, a reduction in supply is clearly playing a role as  well, with banks continuing to tighten standards on consumer loans  Developments in  the consumer ABS market are contributing to the tighter credit conditions for  households The market has seen very little issuance since October, and spreads have  been very high  The commercial banks that make most credit card loans have access  to alternative sources of funding, such as deposits and various new forms of support  from the government  In contrast, the finance companies affiliated with auto  manufacturers, which traditionally have been an important source of auto loans have  not (for the most part) had access to these alternative sources  The bottom right panel  shows the dollar volume of new loans per vehicle sold—one metric of the extent to  which the finance companies support sales  This indicator had been fluctuating  around $5,000 per vehicle, but dropped to less than $3,500 in November  That said,  loan originations should pick up this year, with the expected implementation of the  TALF, and GMAC, now a bank holding company, having announced that it will  resume lending to some consumers with weaker credit records   The next two exhibits focus on business investment and finance  The top left  panel of exhibit 5 depicts a key underpinning of our investment forecast—the  accelerator mechanism  Business fixed investment as a share of output (shown in  red) tends to track the lagged growth rate of output (in black)  The sharp deceleration  that we have seen in output is expected to exert a significant drag on investment this  year and next Indeed, as shown by the red bars in the panel to the right, we estimate  that business spending on equipment and software fell nearly 10 percent last year, and  we project it to decline by an even larger amount this year before making a moderate  recovery in 2010 Investment in nonresidential structures held up better in 2008, but  we expect a sharp decline this year and a further decline in 2010, due in part to the  lags in planning and implementing new structures projects   Spending in the business sector is also held down by credit market conditions   Firms are finding credit expensive and more difficult to obtain because investors are  demanding extremely high returns for holding risky assets  In the stock market, the  dramatic decline in equity values over the past year has pushed the trend earnings-to­ price ratio (the red line in the middle left panel) well above the range seen over the  past quarter century The gap between this ratio and the real Treasury perpetuity  yield (shaded in turquoise in the left panel and plotted as a line on the right) is a rough  measure of the equity risk premium  At more than 10 percentage points, the gap is  extraordinarily high by historical standards  Spreads on corporate bonds are also  extremely elevated, keeping yields relatively high despite substantial declines in long­ term risk-free rates  As can be seen in the bottom left panel, yields on 10-year BBB- rated bonds have fallen since the December FOMC meeting but remain at the high  end of their range since 2002 That said, issuance of nonfinancial investment-grade  bonds, shown in the inset box, moved up in the fourth quarter and has held up in at a  solid pace in January Yields on speculative-grade bonds, shown in the bottom right  panel, also remain unusually high, and speculative-grade issuance, though up  somewhat in January, is still fairly weak                January 27–28, 2009 89 of 267  C&I loans from commercial banks represent another important source of funding  for businesses As shown in the top left panel of exhibit 6, C&I lending fell off  sharply at the end of last year, and we expect it to remain weak this year  We believe  that the downswing partly reflected reduced demand for loans as businesses trimmed  plans to invest and, after relying heavily on bank lines while credit markets were  disrupted in the fall, turned back to other sources of funds, such as corporate bonds   However, the supply of credit has also been reduced  As shown in the top right panel,  most of the senior loan officers we just surveyed reported having tightened standards  on C&I loans further and having increased the spreads of loan rates over their cost of  funds   The next four panels turn to some of the factors that have exacerbated the credit  problems in the commercial real estate sector  As can be seen in the middle left  panel, rents (the red line) have decelerated sharply over the past two years, and  vacancy rates (the black line) are on the rise  Prices for commercial properties,  shown on the right, turned down sharply in late 2007 after soaring over the preceding  three years  Our forecast calls for a significant further price decline  These weaker  conditions have contributed to rising delinquencies among commercial real estate  loans, as seen in the bottom left panel The delinquency rate on such loans held by  commercial banks (the turquoise line) climbed further in the third quarter  As shown  in red, the delinquency rate on loans in commercial-mortgage-backed securities (or  CMBS) has been rising as well The box to the right summarizes key implications of  the shutdown in the CMBS market  Although the market traditionally has provided  very little construction financing, the inability to issue should add to the pressures on  banks’ balance sheets and thereby indirectly damp structures spending  In particular,  if it remains closed, the CMBS market will not be able to help refinance the large  amount of bank construction loans expected to come due this year, as it would in  normal times  In addition, a smaller amount of loans currently within CMBS will  come due this year and will need new financing from alternative sources such as  banks Dan will pick up the discussion from here    Brian can correct me if I am wrong, but I believe it is more the latter—   offering fewer credit cards    We have asked separately about what they are doing to credit lines  In   fact, more than half are saying that they are reducing credit lines as well    You have to remember that rents are also rising in this calculation  But   just in terms of the price component, we have seen a decline of about 15 percent so far, and we   are going to see another 15 percent    That is right    That is consistent with our view, yes    Yes    We do not have a model—or we have not really found a robust model—   for overvaluation of commercial property, so it has been more difficult to analyze formally  But   more generally, the reason we think that there will be such a large overcorrection on the   residential side is that, with our forecast for the huge numbers of foreclosures, we think we are   going to see a lot of supply dumped on the market and that it will perhaps lead sellers to   aggressively cut prices So far that has not happened in the commercial area, although we   certainly think it is a risk  We agree with President Yellen’s view that, depending on what   happens in the CMBS market, it could be something that would happen  But your reading is   correct—we are not foreseeing a massive overcorrection on the commercial side at this point    For sure    Actually, at this point, the rise in delinquency rates is—    Thank you  "
