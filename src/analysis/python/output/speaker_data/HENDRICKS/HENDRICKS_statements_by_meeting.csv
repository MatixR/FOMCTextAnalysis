3276,1987-02-10," We also believe it would be appropriate to adopt the same ranges for 1987 that were set in July, so we would favor alternative II "
3301,1987-03-31," Thank you, Mr Chairman The economic situation in the Fourth District is broadly consistent with what the staff has forecasted Most sectors of our economy, believe it or not, are expanding begrudgingly and fitfully Metal producers, of course, continue to suffer from excessive worldwide supply Housing, on the other hand, seems to be holding its own and, in fact, is moving forward at a rapid pace Some others have commented on housing starts in the Midwest and we are no different The directors and others with whom we speak admit to feeling that the worst is now behind them in terms of the foreign trade front You can twist their arms a little and they will admit it Domestic producers say that it is easier to compete now against imports but that competition is still very intense; yet they seem to feel as though they are back in the ball game Our staff feels that we still are a long way from being secure about the economic fundamentals governing the current account The improvement could take longer and may require a lower dollar than we think today Our people don't see as much strength, perhaps, in exports as is indicated by the Greenbook forecast One interesting thing our staff did was to take a look at capacity in the various sectors, and there are spotty areas where capacity utilization is  -26-    3/31/87  beginning to approach the highs reached back in 1978 and 1980 Several of the industries are at their long-term 20-year average Somebody mentioned some pressure on prices in textiles; they're showing up to and beyond their 1978-to-1980 highs So just as a general comment, there may be some spotty places in the economy where capacity [constraints] are beginning to show up As I said at the outset of my comments, the staff's outlook in the Greenbook is very consistent with the conditions we see in the Fourth District  Although the business statistics have improved in the last couple of months, they don't seem to be impressive enough to suggest a significant step-up in the pace of expansion We're concerned about some price developments that we see on the horizon and the pressure on the dollar in foreign exchange markets With respect to the prominence of the exchange rate in the directive we would favor not changing it And, of course, the alternative that we support is the ""B"" path "
3335,1987-05-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman The mood in the Fourth District has improved Some have said it has gone from lackluster to hopeful to reasonably satisfied Much of the improvement seems to be due to the improving trade situation According to our information, employment, orders, and output are expanding and labor costs of manufacturing continue to remain rather moderate In a relative sense, I guess, we have not heard so much optimism around our board of directors table in quite some time People in the metals industry tell us capacity is being used up here and abroad and that price increases are achievable in certain product lines We are also told that the worst of the over-building in commercial construction may be behind us With respect to agriculture, our lenders are anticipating a better year now than six months ago Those who follow oil indicate that some oil company executives are even beginning to talk about the possibility of some drilling late in the year This better mood is encouraging to us because it is consistent with what we feel the outlook is for the economy--generally moderate growth And, we are pretty much in line with the Greenbook projections  It seems to me that the best course is closer to ""C"" than to ""B"", unless the expansion weakens or the current turnup in prices subsides Financial markets seem to have marked up inflation expectations We don't see a pickup in prices working into the cost structure yet, but when it does occur, we feel it would be more difficult to deal with Markets have snugged a little, with the funds rate up to the 6-1/2 percent area or slightly above We believe that a borrowing level consistent with that outcome is appropriate It would reduce the risk that inflation expectations would generate future price pressures and would provide some insurance against rising import prices becoming the basis for domestic price increases We would prefer to set the borrowing level at $600 million and hold on the discount rate "
3358,1987-07-07," I would leave it the same for all the reasons that have been stated and perhaps one that has not quite been stated And that is that [given the precedent] of not doing it at midyear in the past, as I understand it, I think we might confuse the market unduly and unnecessarily and perhaps send mixed signals that could be counterproductive  Our projections follow very closely those of the Greenbook and as we try to lay that against our forecast, we come up with the suggestion that interest rates can't stay where they are And the alternative that best seems to fit our projection is really alternative III So we would suggest that we make that move, whether we stick with it exactly the way it is put here, 7-1/2 percent or something in between there Alternative II would be all right with us But alternative III is the one that we would favor over the other two alternatives "
3386,1987-08-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman Our views of economic conditions closely parallel the staff's forecast in the Greenbook As some others have suggested, there are a couple of areas where we differ a bit One is in the growth of income, and the other is in consumption On balance, it appears to us that the economy is picking up strength Employment, output, and exports are expanding, as we see it, and we have noticed a jump in prices Comments by our directors and others support this view Even the hardest hit sectors --commercial construction, agriculture, and metals--are said, particularly by our directors, to be enjoying a period of stability and possible turnaround So it's not surprising, I guess, that we would suggest that our forecast shows more strength, on balance, than is indicated in the Greenbook  We see a further acceleration in prices this year and next, and believe that the risk is on the upside Therefore, I believe it's reasonable, at this point, to increase the pressure on bank reserves by moving toward the ""C"" path I'm not particularly picking the C alternative, but favor a $600 million borrowing objective "
3413,1987-09-22," I like the comments made by Ed Boehne We are experiencing a bullish feeling with respect to business in our District I'm really not sure how much significance, if any, should be placed on this observation but, at a recent meeting of our directors we did notice for the first time, perhaps, some concern about risk on longer-term loans, and some adjustments in their basic lending policies, at the margin  With respect to our outlook, it's quite similar to the staff's Greenbook forecast, but we still continue to see the consumer in a stronger spending pattern than indicated by the staff We also see housing as less of a drag on the economy We don't believe exports are going to be quite as strong as projected in the Greenbook Despite the sectoral differences in the projections, we come out at about the same place, with real GNP growing at about the same pace as the forecast in the Greenbook We would see that, however, being accompanied by some pretty strong wage and price pressures  With respect to your question, I don't know how much I can add on that, but recent changes in the rates do appear to us to be related to the rate of interest [needed] to attract foreign savings We believe that some of the earlier increases that we saw might have been tied more closely to inflation  Our preference would be to line up fairly closely with Si Keehn's suggestion on the decision We would go with $600 million, but would lean on the side of further tightening  -38-    9/22/87 "
4485,1991-10-01," Well, I'm pleased to be here with you again Several of you commented that you'd rather see Lee at this chair than me and I agree with that; I certainly would Nevertheless, in our District we are cautiously optimistic about prospects for further gains in output as inventory cutbacks near an end Our District contacts tell us that they're reasonably satisfied that retail stocks are at about the desired levels Manufacturers, especially of motor vehicles, steel, and major appliances, have for the most part cleared their inventories We also see scattered signs of a comeback in capital goods out there Several industry sources believe that their business is either near a trough or in the early stages of recovery This is especially the case with producers of industrial equipment, industrial controls, heavy duty trucks, small electric motors, electrical equipment, and ball bearings But I would hasten to add that the recovery in our District is not yet broad-based or very strong Our directors do not yet see much of a recovery but their attitudes may be based more on year-to-year comparisons or on their memories of pre-recession operating rates, when they expected to be at 85 percent or more [of capacity] Still, we feel that the latest purchasing agents reports confirm that manufacturing has been in an expanding phase in recent months; and that should continue, albeit less rapidly than many would want That concludes my remarks  We still have some concern over the continued weak behavior of M2, so ideally what we'd like is a directive between ""A"" and ""B"" with an early reduction of 25 basis points in the funds rate as reports perhaps unfold in the next week or two "
4507,1991-10-30," Mr Chairman, this is Bill Hendricks from Cleveland Our view hasn't changed since the last meeting The outlook here is flat and we're rather concerned about M2 And we prefer another move by the Desk We would prefer to do that soon in view of the numbers we are seeing and then have a further discussion next week on what additional moves might be made "
4527,1991-11-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman The District's economy reflects the sluggishness that we see in the data at the national level Employment growth has stalled Weakness in auto sales has led to some cutbacks in production schedules And this weakness in demand for autos has led to a more sluggish recovery in the tire industry as well On the other hand, the steel industry--and Si reported on this--is one of the brighter spots in our District Steel producers report that this will be the best quarter of the year, supported especially by a pickup in auto and steel warehouse business Producers of flat-rolled steel are operating at 85 to 90 percent of capacity But prices are weak, profits are down, and the mood certainly is not buoyant We also were pleasantly surprised recently with the outlook for inflation that was developed by a panel of economists from firms around the Fourth District Their projection, which had been running at about 3-1/2 to 4 percent, has been revised downward to 3 percent  In brief, we see the growth of the economy stalling in recent months but we have no reason to believe that the recovery will not be sustained And we are hopeful about the outlook for inflation That concludes my report  Thank you, Mr Chairman Our support for the recent reduction in the fed funds rate was based on the need to encourage a stronger growth rate of M2, not because of a perceived threat to the economy in the District or the nation We're concerned over the persistent weakness in M2 since last spring and its longer- term trend over the past four years A stronger growth rate in M2, within its target range, would likely add to the credibility of that target and would provide the base for a realignment of intermediate- and long-term rates Normally, we would be inclined to wait a bit longer to judge the impact of this recent reduction in the funds rate to the 5 percent level Work in Cleveland suggests that if we want a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter 1992 growth rate of 3 percent in M2, we need a funds rate lower than 5 percent Projections of M2 growth have fallen short for some time now, and we would prefer to push on the funds rate until we get M2 safely to a level we are comfortable with We're getting close now to next year and, although we haven't come to a finalization on our view yet, our guess is that we will want something around 3 percent We would not mind going into next year a little heavy on M2 growth, but we don't believe the 1/2 point reduction in alternative A is needed at this point; our preference is for the position half-way in between We believe another 25 basis point reduction of the funds rate with symmetric language is appropriate at this time And we believe we should push ahead as rapidly as we can to get the M2 growth we want "
4548,1991-12-02," Mr Chairman, this is Bill Hendricks in Cleveland We don't see much change in the past 30 days What we see    12/2/91  is an economy moving sideways A couple of our directors reported to us One of them reported some layoffs in the apparel industry; and one who talked about construction indicated that it was flat but not hurting in the Fourth District Overall, we find that people are marking down slightly their expectations for the first quarter "
4568,1991-12-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman We concur with the Board staff's view that growth of the economy has stalled, although we are not quite as bearish about retail sales in the fourth quarter as is indicated in the staff's estimates Perhaps, like Gary Stern in Minneapolis, we view the outlook from the vantage point of a District that has outperformed the nation since last spring, although there are signals of softening in our area, too Ohio unemployment rose slightly in November for the third consecutive month and the unemployment rate held steady at about 56 percent, which is low relative to the nation Retail sales and manufacturing production also have been stronger than the national averages, at least through September And construction contracts for both non-residential and residential homes have continued to grow faster than for the nation through October Our concern, as Si Keehn also has indicated, is that scheduled cutbacks in auto production extending into the first quarter of '92 may be working through the auto supply industries in our District Steel operations are under downward pressure Our steel contacts note that delivery lead times have been shrinking in recent weeks; customers are no longer on a quota; and order books for flat rolled steel now have openings for late January delivery Capital goods production is still mixed but apparently on a slowly rising trend I would conclude by mentioning that, despite a pervasive mood of pessimism, even among business executives we see no widespread cutbacks of capital spending plans Indeed, some producers plan increases in 1992 and they have not changed their plans, while a few  -16-    12/17/91  others are scaling down spending increases in view of the lower-than- expected sales and profits in recent months  Yes, Mr Chairman We come out just a bit different from your recommendation, perhaps a little closer to Tom Melzer We acknowledge the potential for a no-growth economy this quarter and next But we don't believe further action by the Fed can do a whole lot to counter the near-term weakness in output Neither do we believe that the Fed can or should do much to offset the structural imbalances in the economy that have been talked about around the table here today real estate, the decline in defense expenditures, debt overloads, and so forth Apparently, M2 growth has revived recently and might now be on an acceptable path that is close to the midpoint of the target range We've cautioned against a policy oriented around a reaction to real-time economic data History has shown, it seems to us, that such a policy process can mislead  -33-    12/17/91  policymakers into thinking they can fine-tune these economic activities Moreover, it seems to us that such a policy process also leads policymakers to lose sight of the key long-term objective of maintaining price stability So, our policy prescription, while not a whole lot different from your recommendation, is that the FOMC hold a steady course at least for now until we see the cumulative results of our several actions to cut interest rates over the past year "
4603,1992-02-04," Thank you, Mr Chairman At a January 24 meeting of the Fourth District round table, economists agreed that the economy will be flat again this quarter but will improve throughout the remainder of 1992 Similar to the staff forecast, the group of economists expects 6 percent growth in nominal GDP over the next four quarters, and that's about evenly divided between output and prices They pointed out that structural changes in the economy, such as corrections in overcapacity in retail and banking and long-term adjustments in the automobile and computer industries, are restraining the recovery With respect to our projections, they are very close to those included in the Greenbook  Currently, activity in the District is mixed and has perhaps lost a little ground in terms of the momentum it enjoyed in recent months Nonfarm payroll employment fell in January after three successive monthly increases Our unemployment rate rose 1 point to 66 percent but is still, of course, below the national average Construction contracts, retail sales, and manufacturing production all outperformed the nation through late 1991 Auto production remains weaker than expected, although the auto economists who participated in the round table still believe that production this year will be at least 10 percent higher than last year [They base that assessment] on the strength of sales and inventories that they feel are a little better than they originally had expected Auto suppliers note that orders softened late last year, but Goodyear has just announced a recall of 300 workers because of good demand for replacement tires Steel operating rates at nearly 80 percent of capacity are expected to ease a little this quarter in the view of those economists because of the recent let-up in orders The signals from capital goods producers are also mixed Those sensitive to auto and truck production note easing in orders, but the industrial machinery and equipment producers report that orders are either flat or, in the case of machine tools, rising The capital spending outlook for 1992 is also mixed More durable goods producers plan either the same or higher levels of spending than those who plan cutbacks, but petroleum producers, retailers, and real estate developers will cut spending Although the commercial real estate markets in the Fourth District are not as soft as in some other areas of the country, developers of shopping centers and office buildings are concerned about too much capacity Inadequate financing and cash flow have put several projects on hold in Ohio, New York, and California  It appears to us that we are perhaps at the threshold of an expanding economy Of course, we thought that was the case last summer We are encouraged by the absence of price pressures and by  -15-    2/4-5/92  the modest 2 percent increase in the price deflator again last quarter And we expect continued moderate inflation in the months ahead That concludes my report  Thank you, Mr Chairman We continue to advocate a policy to achieve price stability, and the recent slowdown in inflation suggests that we're on track To continue a gradual approach to that objective we would expect some downward shift in the M2 band in 1992 But we really don't know how long it will take or how big it will be Ideally, in the year ahead we would prefer an M2 target range of 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent because that range corresponds more or less to our desired M2 growth by year-end, if conditions warrant The ranges are wide enough to accommodate some makeup from last year's shortfall As a practical matter, we could live with the ranges expressed in alternative II We'd inch down the ranges and remind markets of our [intent] to achieve price stability over a reasonable period of time Recognizing our recent progress in reducing the M2 growth trend, lowering the target range to center on a 4 percent midpoint would in our opinion enhance the credibility of our commitment to our long-term objective of reducing inflation  With respect to the tunnel approach, we were prepared to comment on it As a matter of fact, we prepared an ""Ohio Plan"" handout But as I listened to the discussion, I found that all the questions were answered and all the comments were made, so our plan wouldn't add much to the discussion But we are interested in seeing a different approach at least kept on the table  Thank you, Mr Chairman Since the vote and during the recess, I've been thinking about the presentational difficulties that you might have and that, from your view, unanimity on the 1992 targets is the desirable thing We're willing to support the present targets, and I would therefore request that my vote be changed  We've had several years of moderate growth and our view is that the inflation trend appears to be a decline to 3  -56-    2/4-5/92  percent and that it may be getting down even beyond that We see the basic thrust of policy as being consistent with that outlook that is, 3 percent inflation in '92 and 2 percent, perhaps, in '93 Therefore, we feel that the FOMC does have some room for further easing if the policy action that was adopted in December does not stimulate growth in money and credit M2 seems to have been particularly erratic over the past month or so, making it difficult to judge just what sort of growth track we're really on For the year we'd like growth in M2 of 3-1/2 percent or so and we would not like to see any significant shortfall from that path this quarter Consequently, we would like to see further easing in policy should the incoming data suggest that M2 is weakening from current levels Our position for now, however, is in line with the Greenbook projection and your suggestion, Mr Chairman We would support alternative B with asymmetry toward ease "
