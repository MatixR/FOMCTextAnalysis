3  I will be referring to the revised version of table 1, which is  included in the package labeled “Material for the FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy  Alternatives”  The revised table presents the same range of options regarding the  target federal funds rate as the version discussed in the Bluebook, but we have  proposed some changes to the statement language for alternatives B and C  New  language introduced in the draft distributed on Monday is shown in blue, with  language reintroduced from the March 18 statement shown in black and underlined   An additional adjustment made since Monday is shown in purple  [Laughter]  We  have about used up the color palette in Word  I will discuss these changes as I go  along          Your policy decision at this meeting would seem to depend on three judgments    Where do you think you are; where do you want to be; and what path do you want to  follow to get there?  The staff’s assessment of where you are—at least in terms of the  stance of monetary policy—is summarized in the r* chart that was included in the  Bluebook  That chart showed that the current real federal funds rate is about 50 basis  points above the Greenbook-consistent measure of r*, suggesting that the rapid easing  of policy this year has left the real funds rate fairly close to the level required to bring  the economy back to its potential over the medium term  The low level of the                                                     3 The materials used by Mr English are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   April 29–30, 2008 94 of 266    equilibrium funds rate reflects the staff’s judgment that the housing correction and  financial market stresses—with their associated effects on consumer and business   confidence—have been sufficient to shift the economy into a recession regime in  which spending by both households and businesses is likely to be weak  As for where  you want to be, the Greenbook projection assumes that the real funds rate is moved  down to its equilibrium level—that is, the federal funds rate is trimmed 50 basis  points further—and then remains unchanged over the rest of the projection period   Finally, as for the path you want to follow to get there, the staff projection assumes  that you move the federal funds rate to the staff’s estimate of the rate’s equilibrium  level relatively quickly by trimming the fed funds target 25 basis points at this  meeting and another 25 basis points at the June meeting  However, there is no  overshoot below the equilibrium level in order to provide insurance against a further  unexpected slide in spending         If you agree with the staff that about 50 basis points of additional easing is needed   to bring the real federal funds rate into alignment with its equilibrium level and you  are at least moderately confident of that assessment, then you might be inclined to  ease policy by 50 basis points at this meeting and issue a statement suggesting fairly  balanced risks to the outlook, as in alternative A  A relatively large adjustment to  policy at this meeting would be particularly attractive if the Committee wanted a  somewhat faster recovery in output or was concerned about downside risks to growth  and wished to move the funds rate back to its equilibrium value quickly in order to  help head them off  Members might also select a larger rate cut if they were willing  to live with somewhat higher inflation over time, as in the optimal control simulation  in the Bluebook with an inflation goal of 2 percent       The rationale language proposed for alternative A sticks fairly closely to the   language used in March, making modest adjustments that are intended to avoid  leaving the impression that the weakness in economic activity or the concerns about  inflation had worsened appreciably over the intermeeting period  The assessment-of- risk language would continue to indicate that the easier stance of policy should  “foster moderate growth over time and    mitigate the risks to economic activity,”  but it would move toward balance by dropping the explicit reference to downside  risks  As in March, it would end by promising timely action to “promote sustainable  economic growth and price stability”       Investors would be surprised by the adoption of alternative A  Market   participants generally expect a 25 basis point rate cut at this meeting and put very low  odds on a 50 basis point cut  However, the effect of the relatively large easing would  be damped somewhat by the shift to a more balanced risk assessment  The result  would likely be lower short- and intermediate-term interest rates, a rise in equity  prices, and a softening of the dollar        If the Committee viewed the target federal funds rate as probably close to the   level that would appropriately balance the risks to its dual objectives but saw  considerable uncertainty regarding that level, then it might be inclined to reduce the   April 29–30, 2008 95 of 266    funds rate another 25 basis points at this meeting and suggest a more gradual pace of  policy easing, or even a pause, after this meeting, as in alternative B  Policy has been  eased very rapidly, and it is difficult at this point to assess the extent to which that  easing has been transmitted to households and firms and so to spending  That  assessment is complicated by the ongoing turbulence in financial markets as well as  the usual difficulty in extracting signals from noisy data on economic activity   Against this backdrop, the Committee may be inclined to take a relatively small  policy step at this meeting and then move to a more incremental policy approach  under which policy will be guided by incoming information on economic and  financial developments  Moreover, with some measures of long-term inflation  expectations having moved higher in recent months, members may be concerned that  a larger policy move at this meeting would encourage the view that the Committee is  more willing to tolerate inflation than had been thought  By taking a smaller policy  step at this meeting and suggesting reduced odds of additional near-term policy  action, the Committee could limit the extent to which investors extrapolate the recent  large policy moves and so build into asset prices more easing than is warranted  Such  a brake on expectations may be seen as particularly useful since the incoming data on  employment and economic activity are likely to be pretty soft in the near term, and  the data releases could well spur expectations of further rate cuts even though the  Committee anticipated the weakness when setting policy  Communication on this  point will presumably be enhanced by the release of the “Summary of Economic  Projections” in three weeks, which should clarify the Committee’s views on the  appropriate path for policy and the expected trajectory for economic growth over  coming quarters         In the Bluebook, the rationale portion of the statement associated with alternative   B was identical to that under alternative A  However, in the revised version of  table 1, the first sentence on inflation has been changed to acknowledge the recent  improvement in readings on core inflation but point to the continued run-up in energy  and other commodity prices  Rather than simply noting the Committee’s judgment  that a further easing move is appropriate, as in alternative A, the assessment-of-risk  paragraph begins by stating that “[t]he substantial easing of monetary policy to date,  combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote  moderate growth over time and to mitigate risks to economic activity”  The explicit,  time-dependent pause that was suggested in the Bluebook formulation for this  alternative has been replaced by wording that is intended to suggest that policy will  be more data-dependent, with the final sentence now reading, “The Committee will  continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to  promote sustainable economic growth and price stability”  The addition of the phrase  on monitoring developments coupled with the deletion of the indication in the March  statement that the Committee will act “in a timely manner” will likely be read by  investors as suggesting a slowing in the pace of easing and possibly a pause after this  meeting if the economy develops as the Committee anticipates       Investors appear to expect that the Committee will trim the federal funds rate   25 basis points at this meeting and then leave the federal funds target at 2 percent for   April 29–30, 2008 96 of 266    some time  The 25 basis point policy easing and the associated statement under  alternative B would seem to be about in line with these expectations, implying little  response in financial markets            If the Committee thinks that the substantial easing of policy already put in place,   along with the coming fiscal stimulus, is likely to foster outcomes that appropriately  balance its inflation and growth objectives, then it may want to stay its hand at this  meeting and issue a statement suggesting that policy is likely to change gradually  going forward and could even be on hold for a time, as in alternative C  The  Committee may expect the ongoing weakness in spending to be relatively mild and  brief  The real federal funds rate is already very low, and the incoming data may not  be seen as sufficiently weak to confirm the staff’s view that the economy has shifted  to a recessionary footing and therefore that spending is likely to come in weaker than  one would otherwise expect  With financial markets most recently improving, on  balance, and investors apparently less concerned about tail events, the Committee  may see smaller downside risks to the outlook for growth  At the same time,  members may think that the inflation outlook remains worrisome  Prices of oil and  some other commodities touched new highs over the intermeeting period, and  members may anticipate that firms will be able to pass a larger share of the increase  in these costs through to their customers than the staff anticipates  Longer-term  inflation expectations may have increased in recent months, and the Committee might  be concerned that failing to push back, at least modestly, against that rise could allow  for a more significant increase in expectations that could be very costly to reverse   Moreover, some members may worry that additional policy easing could trigger  declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and increases in commodity  prices that would give a further boost to inflationary pressures  Taken together, these  arguments might suggest that, if a further easing step were taken at this meeting, it  might have to be reversed fairly soon—an outcome that some members may wish to  avoid       The discussion of economic activity in the statement under alternative C is   identical to that under the other two alternatives  The inflation paragraph is similar to  that under alternative A, but it does not list the reasons for the anticipated moderation  in inflation  The exclusion of this list is intended to suggest less confidence in the  judgment that inflation will moderate as expected  Some members may also be  uncomfortable repeating the reference to “a projected leveling-out of energy and  other commodity prices” when those prices have surprised to the upside yet again   The assessment-of-risk portion of the statement starts by pointing to downside risks,  but then proceeds as in alternative B  The reference to downside risks might counter  to some degree the suggestion of a possible pause in the easing process, but the lack  of policy action combined with this statement language would presumably limit  expectations for easing at coming meetings        Market participants put only about one-quarter odds on unchanged policy at this   meeting, and so the combination of unchanged policy and a statement suggesting that  the Committee could remain on hold for a time would surprise investors, even with   April 29–30, 2008 97 of 266    the retention of downside risks to growth  Short- and intermediate-term rates would  rise, stock prices would likely fall, and the dollar could rally  Effects on longer-term  rates, and also on inflation compensation, would depend on whether investors  interpreted the statement as indicating that the Committee desired a lower level of  inflation than had been thought  The unexpectedly firm policy decision could boost  pressures in short-term funding markets, either immediately, as a result of higher  funding costs for leveraged firms and a weaker outlook for the real economy, or over  time, in the event that economic data came in weaker than anticipated and the FOMC  was seen as less likely to ease policy in response  That concludes my prepared  remarks             I’m afraid I’m not sure     I suppose it’s possible, but I guess I would expect that, if monetary   policy came out tighter than people had expected, it would lead to at least a modest marking-  down of the outlook for the economy     I think it’s hard to know how people would read the news  But as was   emphasized earlier, a weaker dollar supports exports and supports the outlook for the real   economy       In recent days the stories we have been hearing from market   participants and observers are that they think there may well be something—maybe not signaling   strongly that we’re done but talking about slowing down or possibly a pause  So I think this   really is pretty close to what is built in   3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the exhibits that  are labeled “FOMC Briefing on Possible Effects of Very High Reserve Balances on  Bank Balance Sheets” As shown in the top left panel of your first exhibit, Federal  Reserve actions in response to the financial crisis have led to a substantial increase in  reserve balances held by depository institutions  And, as shown by the dashed lines,  the rise in reserve balances is projected to continue through the end of this year, under  either the baseline scenario considered in the Bluebook—the blue line—which  reflects already planned purchases of Treasury, agency, and mortgage-backed  securities, or the alternative scenario—the red line—which includes additional  purchases of $450 billion of Treasury securities later this year  I should note that the  projections shown here have been updated from those presented in the memorandum                         June 23–24, 2009 12 of 261  sent to the Committee on June 12, 2009, and are consistent with the balance sheet  projections included in the June Bluebook     All else equal, the projected rise in reserve balances implies an increase in the  assets of depository institutions To the extent that depository institutions or their  creditors and counterparties are concerned about the resulting decline in the ratio of  capital to assets, depository institutions may choose to reduce their lending or sell  securities in order to limit the increase in their assets  Such concerns could be driven  in part by the regulatory leverage ratio As shown to the right, unlike the risk-based  capital ratios, the leverage ratio is based on average total assets, including reserve  balances Thus, an increase in a bank’s reserve holdings, all else equal, reduces its  leverage ratio Under the US banking agencies’ Prompt Corrective Action rules for  insured commercial banks, banks must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of at least  50 percent to be “well-capitalized” While individual banks can reduce their reserve  holdings, in most cases such efforts simply shift reserves to other institutions, leaving  the aggregate reserve holdings of the banking sector unchanged   To examine the possible effects of the anticipated increase in reserve balances, we  projected the leverage ratios of commercial banks at the end of the first quarter of  next year As noted in the middle left panel, in doing so, we assumed that aggregate  reserve balances would expand in line with the baseline or alternative Bluebook  scenarios and that balances held by each institution would rise in proportion to the  projected increase in aggregate balances  We assumed that the levels of other bank  assets remain unchanged  In our projections, tier 1 capital declines over the next few  quarters—reflecting write-downs, loan losses, and other factors—with the decline  assumed to be about half as large as that projected in the SCAP results for the  nineteen largest banking organizations in the more adverse scenario   The resulting projections under the baseline scenario for reserve balances are  summarized in the middle right panel  Even with the significant decline in tier 1  capital and the substantial growth in reserve balances expected by the first quarter of  next year, shown in the first two rows, the aggregate leverage ratio, the bottom row, is  projected to remain well above regulatory norms   Nonetheless, as shown by the dashed blue line in the bottom left panel, under  these assumptions, the aggregate leverage ratio does fall below the range seen over  the past 10 years However, this calculation does not take account of the likelihood  that some portion of the capital raised in response to the SCAP will be downstreamed  by bank holding companies to their subsidiary banks  If all such capital were  downstreamed, the result would be an aggregate leverage ratio at the high end of the  recent range—shown by the dotted blue line  (In these projections, we assume that  repayments of government capital are made with resources at the bank holding  company level and so do not affect the capital ratios of subsidiary banks)  The red  dashed and dotted lines on the graph show the effect on the aggregate leverage ratio  of a larger increase in reserve balances, consistent with the alternative scenario for the                                    June 23–24, 2009 13 of 261  Federal Reserve’s balance sheet  These projections are somewhat lower than the  baseline projections, but they suggest a generally similar conclusion   As noted in the bottom right, we also prepared projections of the leverage ratios  of consolidated bank holding companies, and obtained broadly similar results, even  taking account of the recent repayments of government capital  Our projections of  leverage ratios for individual commercial banks (not shown) suggest that they could  fall to low levels relative to regulatory norms for some banks  Most notably, the  projected leverage ratio for Bank of America is only 501 percent in our baseline  projection in the absence of a capital infusion from its parent holding company   However, as noted earlier, individual depository institutions can take steps to reduce  unwanted accumulations of reserves   Now please turn to the top panel of your next exhibit  To learn more about how  banking organizations view current reserve levels and how they might respond to  further increases in reserve balances, we consulted with senior Federal Reserve  supervisory staff at some of the largest banking institutions and with staff at the Open  Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  These consultations  indicated that banking organizations have not expressed material concerns to System  staff about their own level of reserve balances or the overall level of reserves in the  system  Indeed, some banks have intentionally maintained high levels of reserve  balances as a liquidity buffer, while others have profited at times by exploiting the  spread between the rate paid on excess reserves and the cost of borrowing in the  federal funds market  Banks generally thought that they could reduce their reserve  balances if they chose to by lending in funding markets, purchasing securities, or  reducing interest rates on deposits  It is important to note, however, that banking  organizations have not discussed with System staff the possible effects of the increase  in Systemwide reserves that will accompany continued large-scale asset purchases   As the supply of reserve balances rises, some depository institutions may find it more  difficult than they had anticipated to reduce the size of their balance sheets   As summarized in the bottom left panel, this analysis suggests that depository  institutions should not be significantly adversely affected by the anticipated levels of  reserve balances As a result, no policy response appears necessary at this time   However, considerable uncertainty remains Reserve balances could rise further than  currently projected if economic conditions called for additional asset purchases or  Federal Reserve lending And banks’ losses could prove larger than we assumed—  perhaps running closer to the level projected in the SCAP  Finally, with financial  markets still fragile and pressures on institutions’ liquidity still a concern, banking  organizations may want larger-than-usual buffers of capital relative to regulatory  norms  Given these uncertainties, the staff will continue to monitor the effect of  Federal Reserve operations on the size of depository institutions’ balance sheets and  their willingness to provide credit                                June 23–24, 2009 14 of 261  If policymakers became concerned that increases in reserve balances were having   adverse effects on banks’ intermediation activities, several policy options, shown to   the right, could be considered    First, the Federal Reserve could drain reserves by several means, including  outright sales of securities, reverse repurchase agreements, or—if it received authority  from the Congress—by issuing Federal Reserve bills  Those options will be  discussed in the presentation by Jim Clouse and Spence Hilton   Second, supervisors could, on a temporary basis, exclude all or part of reserve   balances from the calculation of the leverage ratio for all banking institutions    Providing temporary leverage ratio relief in this way could ease banks’ regulatory-  capital-related balance sheet pressures  However, a change in the calculation of the   leverage ratio would be difficult to negotiate with the other US federal banking   agencies And if relief were granted for reserve balances, even on a temporary basis,   due at least in part to the risk-free nature of reserve balances, regulators might have to   consider comparable relief for other risk-free assets to preserve consistency and   reduce distortions In making such changes, the simplicity and comprehensiveness of   the leverage ratio would be lost      Third, to avoid the difficulties that could be associated with a blanket change in   the calculation of the leverage ratio, supervisors could, on a temporary basis, exclude   all or part of reserve balances from the calculation of the leverage ratio on a targeted   basis for selected banking institutions with particularly large inflows of reserve   balances    Finally, supervisors could issue guidance indicating that temporary decreases in   the leverage ratio resulting from accumulations of reserve balances should not   significantly adversely affect supervisory assessments of banks’ capital adequacy,   given the low risk posed by reserve holdings and the recognition by supervisors that   the increase in reserve balances is the temporary result of monetary policy actions    Such guidance, perhaps in the form of an interagency statement, could acknowledge   the impact of increased reserve balances on leverage ratios, explain the reason for the   elevated levels of reserves, and note the very low risk associated with reserve   balances Thank you That concludes my prepared remarks    2  Thank you very much  I’ll be referring to the handout “FOMC   Briefing on the Implications of Higher Reserve Balances”  As shown in the top left   panel of your first exhibit, the aggregate stock of reserve balances has increased from    2 The materials used by Mr English are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                       September 22–23, 2009 21 of 212  about $20 billion prior to the onset of the financial crisis to about $850 billion  recently, and it is projected to peak at about $12 trillion during the first half of next  year before gradually trending lower This very high level of reserves raises two  potential concerns, noted to the right  First, high levels of reserve balances could, by  increasing banks’ assets, put downward pressure on their regulatory leverage ratios,  leading them to pull back further from lending or cut purchases of securities, with  adverse consequences for the economy  Second, and conversely, as the economy  improves and banks become more comfortable with their capital and liquidity  positions, they could try to take steps to reduce their reserve balances  Because the  banking system as a whole cannot reduce reserve balances all that much, banks’  efforts to do so could put downward pressure on some interest rates and boost bank  lending The result could be an increase in monetary stimulus at a time when the  economy may already be expanding briskly and inflation could be at or above its  desired level   As noted in the middle left panel, the first of these concerns was the subject of a  staff memorandum and briefing at your June meeting  The staff’s assessment at that  time was that banks appeared to have sufficient capital to absorb the projected  increase in reserve balances without putting undue pressure on their leverage ratios  Since that time, the staff has marked down substantially the anticipated increase in  reserve balances, reflecting unexpectedly large paydowns of Federal Reserve lending  programs, a smaller assumed size of the TALF program, and the more gradual pace of  MBS purchases now projected This revision reinforces the results presented by the  staff in June But, I should note that we do not know how large a capital buffer  individual banking organizations want to maintain over regulatory norms, so it’s  possible that elevated levels of reserves could yet constrain some banks’ activities     As noted to the right, to obtain further information on the second concern, staff  consulted four banking organizations over the intermeeting period, including two  large US commercial banks, one key processing bank, and one large US branch of  a foreign banking organization These four institutions currently account for  35 percent of aggregate reserve balances and 17 percent of total bank credit  Of  course, this is a small sample, and the institutions are not typical of the broader  banking universe These firms were chosen because they represent a range of  institution types and because their reserve balances are very high, suggesting that  their plans could shed considerable light on the demand for reserve balances going  forward The consultations covered three broad areas of balance sheet management   The reasons for the firms’ current high reserve balances, their possible responses to  further increases in reserve balances, and their intentions regarding an eventual return  to lower levels of balances   The most notable reasons the banking organizations provided for their own  elevated balances are listed in the bottom left panel  All of the institutions pointed to  substantial inflows of funds last fall, following the failure of Lehman Brothers and the  strains in the money market mutual fund sector  Three institutions also indicated that  risk-adjusted returns on alternative assets were not attractive, and that loan demand                          September 22–23, 2009 22 of 212  has been weak In addition, the large commercial banks noted a desire to hold high  balances as a liquidity buffer against the possibility that conditions in funding markets  might deteriorate again     As noted to the right, we next asked how the institutions might respond to a  further inflow of reserve balances to their institutions  The large commercial banks  indicated that their balances could rise somewhat further before they would take  actions to reduce them  By contrast, the processing bank and the foreign branch both  reported that they would take steps to offset any addition to their reserve balances  The institutions generally reported that the actions they would take to offset an  increase in reserves would include running off some managed liabilities and  purchasing safe short- and intermediate-term securities  The banking organizations  pointed specifically to Treasury and agency obligations and other sovereign and  sovereign-guaranteed securities, such as FDIC-guaranteed bank bonds  None of the  banks suggested that they would increase their lending to reduce reserve balances in  this situation     The top left panel of your next exhibit summarizes the four banking  organizations’ plans for reducing their reserve balances over time  Each firm  expected that these reductions would leave the desired level of balances well above  pre-crisis levels, reflecting, particularly for the processing bank and the foreign  branch, the impact of the payment of interest on reserves, and for the two large  commercial banks, a general increase in concern about access to liquidity during  periods of stress   The four institutions suggested very different timing for their anticipated  reductions in reserve balances The processing bank noted that it had already begun  trimming its balances, and it planned to complete its adjustment by the end of the  year One of the two large commercial banks planned to make its adjustment next  year and the other in 2011 The foreign branch suggested that there likely could be  no significant reduction in its reserve holdings until the Federal Reserve began cutting  the aggregate supply of reserves It explained that its balances were primarily  determined by volatile flows of short-term funds from its customers, and it had little  ability to influence such flows without disrupting existing customer relationships     When they felt the time had come to begin reducing their reserve holdings, the  banking organizations planned to make adjustments to both the asset and liability  sides of their balance sheets, as listed to the right  On the liability side, they planned  to pay down their borrowings in wholesale funding markets and allow some large  time deposits to run off  On the asset side, they would increase lending in interbank  and other wholesale markets and increase purchases of safe short- and intermediate- term securities  Only one of the institutions said that it might ease its credit terms to  boost lending, and none reported an intention to ease credit standards       As noted in the middle left panel, there is some tension between our projected  increases in reserve balances and the banks’ stated expectation that their demand for              September 22–23, 2009 23 of 212  such holdings will fall over coming years  Individual banks are likely to take actions  to reduce their reserves, but, as I noted earlier, they cannot, in aggregate, reduce the  stock of reserve balances all that much  Thus, the main result of the banks’ efforts is  likely to be changes in the returns on various assets and liabilities that leave the  banking sector content to hold the existing stock of reserve balances  In particular,  rates on shorter-term funding instruments are likely to fall relative to the rate paid on  reserve balances, while yields on securities that are viewed as relatively close  substitutes for reserves—particularly short- and intermediate-term Treasury and  agency securities—should decline somewhat from their already low levels  These  changes will then be arbitraged into the yields on other assets as well  By contrast,  the consultations suggest that banks are unlikely to ease their lending standards  significantly in order to boost loan growth  Nonetheless, as the economy recovers,  the demand for loans from creditworthy firms and households will presumably pick  up, and risk spreads may well narrow as the outlook improves  The result is likely to  be a recovery and expansion in loans at banks that largely stems from factors other  than reductions in desired reserves holdings     As noted to the right, these potential effects of very high reserve balances are the  expected consequences of quantitative easing  However, the size of such effects on  interest rates and the aggregate economy is quite uncertain  Evidence from the  Japanese experience suggests that they may be fairly small  Rates on interbank  deposits and short-term securities are already quite low—indeed, bill rates are below  the rate paid on reserve balances—and so are not likely to fall all that much further,  given that we are at present operating so close to the zero bound  Moreover, these  effects may emerge only gradually as institutions decide on a bank-by-bank basis to  reduce their reserves demand  In addition, some banks’ actions may be constrained  by capital concerns  For these reasons, in the staff forecast the effects of elevated  reserve balances are implicitly assumed to be quite small (though I should note that in  the staff forecast the direct effects of the Federal Reserve’s purchases of Treasury,  agency, and agency mortgage-backed securities on long-term yields are estimated to  be large)   To provide some background for the Committee regarding the possible  macroeconomic impact of elevated reserve balances going forward, my colleagues in  Research and Statistics and I constructed an alternative scenario using the FRB/US  model We started by assuming that the effects of elevated reserve balances on short-  and intermediate-term interest rates are quite large—much larger than we believe is  likely to be the case—and occur at the start of 2010  In particular, we assume a  decline of 50 basis points relative to the baseline in interest rates at maturities of one  to five years, accompanied by a downtick in longer-term interest rates, a modest  decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, and a small rise in stock prices   Importantly, however, we assume that banks make no changes to their lending  standards and terms  The lower interest rates boost household spending on durables,  business spending on equipment and software, and housing investment through  mortgage rates (primarily on ARMs), while the lower value of the dollar raises net  exports Adding up the pieces, as shown in the bottom left panel, the effect is to                            September 22–23, 2009 24 of 212  increase GDP growth by about 03 percentage point in 2010 and 04 percentage point  in 2011, cut the unemployment rate by 03 percentage point by the end of 2011, and  raise inflation just a bit  While these effects, which we believe are likely a significant  overstatement, are not negligible, they do not greatly change the general contour of  the staff forecast   Of course, it is possible that this assessment of the effects of very high reserve  balances is wrong—we’re in a new world—and that the result will be a larger dose of  monetary stimulus next year, as noted in the bottom right panel  For example, banks  may prove far more willing to ease credit standards and terms than suggested by our  consultations  However, some FOMC participants may see additional stimulus as  potentially beneficial  In the staff forecast, the economic recovery is gradual,  unemployment remains high through 2011, and inflation remains low  Thus, some  additional stimulus might be helpful in fostering economic conditions that are more  consistent with your dual objectives  On the other hand, very high reserve balances  could undercut confidence in the Federal Reserve’s ability to maintain price stability,  contributing to higher expected and actual inflation  If very high reserve balances  provide undesired stimulus or appear to be significantly boosting inflation  expectations, then the Committee could choose to tighten policy sooner or more  rapidly than it would have otherwise  Jim Clouse will now update you on the work  being done to prepare the tools that might be employed in doing so      Bring them up to 25 basis points?     In the last Senior Loan Officer Survey, we asked them when they would move   back to more normal standards     Yes     Yes     It would push down those base rates  That’s right     Though I’m not sure that you’d get a lot of action there, at least on the business   side, because one base rate is the prime—I don’t think it’s going to be cut much  The other is three-  month LIBOR—it’s already pretty low  But I agree conceptually    I think that’s the first peak     Yes     There are, but I think they’re things we’re already monitoring carefully  They   would be things like the short end of the yield curve How is it behaving?  If somehow the high level of   reserves and reduced demand for reserves is causing some sort of arbitrage into short- and   intermediate-term safe assets, you’d expect to see that at the short end of the Treasury yield curve     At least over the intermeeting period, it’s across the whole yield curve  So I   don’t think it matches up with this sort of story, which I’d expect at least would be concentrated at the   short end, because those are more substitutable   You’d also want to look at how banks are behaving  If this story is really going to have legs for   the economy, at some point, despite what they told us, banks are going to have to ease some standards and   terms on their lending So, clearly, we’re spending considerable time thinking about the bank lending data   and the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey and how we integrate these things into our modeling     Over the intermeeting period, as we discussed in the Greenbook, the survey of   terms of business lending came in for the most recent quarter and showed another considerable widening   of spreads on business loans  We can look at some information we have on prices in the syndicated loan   market and also, as you say, at the quantities  Our weekly bank credit data may be informative about   whether banks are beginning to move    Let me try talking about banks for a second  I think what we learned from the   banks on the whole was consistent with what we thought before, which is that they’re very tight, and we   think that they will only gradually ease  In the staff forecast, that’s basically what we built in—gradually   over the forecast horizon, banks loosen up, they get more comfortable taking on risk, they build up some   capital, they get more comfortable with their liquidity positions, and they start lending in a more   accommodative way  I think, broadly at least, that’s consistent with what the banks were saying  They’re   not going to be going out any time soon and lending aggressively, and, basically, we didn’t expect to hear   that    The baseline takes account of it    It might well push up short-term rates, as banks were less likely to run off   deposits and manage liabilities because they saw better lending opportunities  In terms of the simulation   that we did, one of the knobs we didn’t turn was an easing in credit  If you turn that knob, you’d get a   bigger effect on output and unemployment—still not huge, but a larger effect for sure  So I think that, if   the banks had been telling us, yes, we’re likely to ease our lending standards and terms early next year,   then our exercise would have showed a bigger effect on output and probably a smaller effect on rates    I don’t know the answer  I’d have to check  I think the whole industry is   concentrated, so if you took the top 25 banks, you’d probably have a huge majority of the reserves, but I   just don’t know for sure    I need a little help on what your concern is                    September 22–23, 2009 41 of 212    Well, I think the decline in the stock of reserves has to do with the fact that   securities that we’re bulking up on now will mature, the mortgages will prepay, and so those assets will   run off over time, and currency will grow over time    I agree As I think I said in my briefing, a couple of the banks pointed exactly   to this As the economy recovers, demand for loans will pick up even if they don’t do any easing at all    They will have more creditworthy customers coming to them, and they plan to   meet that demand     Well, the banks talked about short- and intermediate-term maturities out   to two or three years     Well, it could be a piece  I think it doesn’t rule it out, but, as I say, I   would have expected a change in the shape of the yield curve  What we got was pretty much a   uniform shift     Agency MBS for sure  I’m not sure about straight agency debt     Well, I think there’s an early peak because of the SFP, and then the   later peak because of the condition of our purchases   6  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the package   that was distributed during the coffee break, which is labeled “Material for FOMC   Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives”  The package includes draft statements   and directives for alternatives A, B, and C  As usual, the Committee may want to   consider combining the elements of the alternative statements in other ways               6 The materials used by Mr English are appended to this transcript (appendix 6)   Despite last week’s volatility in asset markets, financial conditions generally   remain supportive of growth  Corporate bond spreads fell further over the   intermeeting period, and bond issuance has been substantial  Though they declined   notably last week, equity prices remain close to their levels in mid-December    Mortgage rates and spreads remain low for conforming loans  The most recent Senior   Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicated that banks have stopped tightening lending   standards for most types of loans and that the fractions tightening terms continued to   wane  Nonetheless, bank lending standards and terms remain tight, and access to   credit for smaller businesses and for households without strong credit histories   remains strained  Given the pressures on banks from anticipated loan losses and from   potential government actions, bank lending policies are likely to ease fairly slowly   As Brian Madigan reported earlier, your economic projections continue to show a   gradual recovery this year that gains momentum next year and in 2012  However,   almost all of you see the unemployment rate remaining well above its long-run level   for some time, and some of you expect unemployment to remain elevated for more   than five or six years  Most of you project that inflation will remain subdued—  around or below its longer-term “mandate consistent” level—over the next few years   With unemployment predicted to decline slowly and inflation projected to be at or   below its mandate-consistent level for some time, the Committee might be   dissatisfied with the outlook and so decide to provide additional policy stimulus as in   alternative A on page 2 of the package  Members might also see further stimulus as   appropriate in order to guard against downside risks to the outlook—for example, the   possibility that the end of the large-scale asset purchases causes an unexpectedly large   run-up in mortgage rates, damping housing investment and slowing the recovery    While the Committee’s projections suggest that the risks to the outlook for economic   growth are roughly balanced, members may see downside surprises as considerably   more costly than upside surprises because output is well below potential, inflation is   low, and the federal funds rate is already at its effective minimum                                                      January 26–27, 2010 169 of 260    Under alternative A, the Committee would provide additional stimulus by   boosting its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities to $15 trillion from the   currently planned amount of $125 trillion  In order to accommodate the increase in   purchases without putting undue strain on the MBS market, the Committee would   extend the time frame for these transactions to the end of the third quarter  The   Committee would leave its planned purchases of agency debt securities at $175   billion and bring those purchases to a close at the end of the first quarter  The target   range for the federal funds rate would remain unchanged at 0 to ¼ percent, and the   statement would continue to say that economic conditions are likely to warrant   exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period            Market participants do not appear to be expecting any changes in the Federal   Reserve’s large-scale asset purchases, so they would be surprised by a statement   along the lines of alternative A  Staff estimates suggest that a $250 billion increase in   MBS purchases might lower longer-term rates by 10 to 25 basis points and, through   that channel, reduce the unemployment rate two years from now by 01 or   02 percentage point relative to the rate that would otherwise prevail  In addition,   short- and medium-term interest rates would presumably decline as investors pushed   back their expected timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate  Equity prices   would likely rise and the foreign exchange value of the dollar decline  Inflation   compensation could increase if the statement undermined investors’ confidence in the   viability of the Federal Reserve’s exit strategy or led them to mark up their beliefs   regarding the Committee’s long-run inflation objective   If the Committee feels that the possible costs of additional stimulus outweigh the   potential benefits, then it may be inclined to leave policy unchanged and adopt the   statement provided in alternative B on page 3  Despite the progress that has been   achieved thus far in developing reserve-management tools, members might remain   concerned that a further increase in the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet   could complicate the eventual exit from policy accommodation  Moreover, even if   the Committee is confident that it can tighten policy when necessary, market   participants may not share that confidence, and so a further increase in asset   purchases could cause inflation expectations to become unmoored, potentially   contributing to higher-than-desired actual inflation   With incoming economic data providing clear evidence that the economy is   expanding, the statement under alternative B would note that economic activity has   continued to strengthen and reiterate that the deterioration in labor markets is abating    It would indicate that business spending now appears to be picking up and that   businesses have brought inventory stocks into better alignment with sales  In view of   the mixed changes in financial conditions over the intermeeting period, the statement   would say that financial market conditions remain supportive of growth but would   note that bank lending continues to contract  The inflation paragraph could start by   acknowledging the increase in energy prices in recent months but go on to say that,   with substantial resource slack and stable longer-term inflation expectations, inflation   is likely to be subdued for some time  However, with oil prices having declined   January 26–27, 2010 170 of 260    notably over the past couple of weeks, the Committee may want to delete the first   sentence as well as the word “however” at the start of the next sentence and simply   summarize the inflation outlook as in the draft statement  As in December, the third   paragraph of the statement would indicate that the Committee continues to anticipate   that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal   funds rate for an extended period; it also would leave unchanged the amounts and   timing of large-scale asset purchases               Market participants generally appear to expect that today’s statement will be   broadly similar to the December statement, more or less along the lines contemplated   here  As a result, the adoption of alternative B is not likely to prompt any significant   market reaction   In yesterday’s discussion of strategies for removing policy accommodation, some   participants suggested that active management of the Federal Reserve’s securities   holdings could prove a useful policy tool for influencing financial market conditions    Others indicated a desire to use asset sales to reduce the overall size of the Federal   Reserve’s balance sheet in preparation for raising the federal funds rate  If the   Committee wanted to signal that it might choose to adjust its holdings of securities in   response to changes in financial conditions or the economic outlook over coming   quarters, or if it wanted to suggest that it was inclined to use asset sales before long to   start to bring down the size of the balance sheet, then it might want to implement the   variant of alternative B indicated by the brackets in the final sentence of the third   paragraph  In this variant, the sentence would indicate that the Committee will   evaluate its holdings, rather than its purchases, of securities in light of the economic   outlook and financial conditions  However, members may feel that the adoption of   this language at today’s meeting could be premature since large-scale asset purchases   are scheduled to continue until the end of the first quarter and there remains   considerable uncertainty regarding how markets will adjust as these purchases are   wound down   The Desk’s survey of market participants’ expectations for the sequencing of   steps when the Federal Reserve begins to tighten policy indicates that markets do not   expect the Federal Reserve to sell any securities during the first two quarters of this   year  Indeed, about a third of those surveyed do not anticipate any asset sales by the   Federal Reserve over the next several years  The remainder generally expect only   modest amounts of such sales, with sales starting well after policy rates are increased    Thus, a statement like this variant of alternative B, coming at this meeting while the   LSAPs are still continuing, could well cause a substantial shift in investors’   expectations about the anticipated trajectory of the Federal Reserve’s securities   holdings  As a result, yields on agency MBS, agency debt, and Treasury securities   could increase significantly, and the levels of actual and implied volatility in these   markets would also tend to move up   If the Committee anticipates that the economic recovery will be sustained and is   concerned about the possible effects of the very large Federal Reserve balance sheet   January 26–27, 2010 171 of 260    on inflation expectations or on its ability to execute a smooth, effective, and timely   exit from the current degree of policy accommodation, it might want to begin laying   the groundwork for tighter policy by adopting alternative C, on page 4  In providing   the rationale for this step, the first paragraph of the statement would express greater   confidence about the outlook than in alternative B, noting that economic activity is   increasing at a solid rate and that the labor market is stabilizing  The sentence listing   the factors that are restraining household spending would be dropped, and the final   sentence of the paragraph would indicate that the Committee believes a sustainable   economic recovery is now under way  The second paragraph would note that   inflation has been somewhat elevated as a result of higher energy prices and would   condition the Committee’s expectation that inflation will remain at levels consistent   with price stability on appropriate monetary policy adjustments rather than on the   substantial resource slack cited as an important factor under alternative B  Although   the Committee would retain for now its target range of 0 to ¼ percent for the federal   funds rate, it would indicate an expectation that economic conditions are likely to   warrant low levels of the federal funds rate for some time, rather than exceptionally   low levels for an extended period  With the LSAPs nearing completion, alternative C   does not contemplate any reductions in the total amounts of securities to be   purchased, but the final sentence of the third paragraph would indicate that the   Committee will be evaluating the size and composition of its securities holdings,   which would provide it with the flexibility to engage in asset sales relatively soon if   such sales were seen as appropriate  This wording might also be seen as helpful if the   Committee wanted to signal that it was disinclined toward any securities purchases   beyond those already planned         A statement along the lines of alternative C would come as a considerable   surprise to market participants  The adjustment to the forward guidance would be   read as suggesting that the Committee was preparing to begin firming its policy   stance relatively soon and that the adjustment could be more rapid than had been   anticipated  As a result, market participants would likely mark up fairly sharply their   expected path for the federal funds rate, which would boost short- and intermediate-  term interest rates significantly  And with the reference to possible adjustments to the   size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities evidently putting   asset sales on the table, term premiums would move higher as well, boosting longer-  term yields, perhaps substantially  Reflecting the change in interest rates and   resulting revisions to the outlook, stock prices would likely drop, and the foreign   exchange value of the dollar could increase   Under all three alternatives, the final paragraph of the statement would provide an   update on plans to wind down the liquidity and lending programs the Federal Reserve   put in place to address the financial crisis  The paragraph would note that, as   previously announced, the Federal Reserve will be closing the asset-backed   commercial paper money market mutual fund liquidity facility, the commercial paper   funding facility, the primary dealer credit facility, and the term securities lending   facility on February 1  The statement would also note that the temporary liquidity   swap arrangements with foreign central banks will expire on the same day  The   January 26–27, 2010 172 of 260    statement will provide more detail than in December regarding the term auction   facility, indicating that the February 8 auction will be for $50 billion of twenty-eight-  day credit, that the March 8 auction is expected to be for $25 billion of twenty-eight-  day credit, and that the Federal Reserve will consider whether to conduct further   auctions beyond that date  Alternatively, your discussion yesterday suggested that   there might be support for a firmer statement on the TAF—perhaps “The Federal   Reserve is in the process of winding down its term auction facility  $50 billion in   twenty-eight-day credit will be offered on February 8, and $25 billion in twenty-  eight-day credit will be offered at the final auction on March 8”  The statement   would then reiterate the current schedule for winding down the term asset-backed   securities loan facility  The paragraph would conclude by indicating that the Federal   Reserve is prepared to modify these plans if necessary to support financial stability   and economic growth         As Brian Sack noted yesterday, the staff recommends adding a sentence to the   directives for alternatives B and C, shown on page 8 in the package, indicating that   “The Committee directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions as necessary to   facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS purchases that are to be   conducted through the end of the first quarter as directed above” Dollar roll   transactions have proven helpful to the Desk in settling MBS purchases, and   including the recommended sentence in the directives for the next several meetings   would allow the Desk to conduct such transactions as needed to assist in the   settlement of agency MBS purchases executed through the end of March  That   completes my remarks  We would be happy to take your questions     I think it was intended to pick up the thought that the headline inflation   numbers had been a little higher because of higher energy prices  In December we said “expects   that inflation will remain subdued”  So we are taking out the “remain” thought and saying that   inflation is likely to be subdued, in some sense making it a little more forward looking   January 26–27, 2010 173 of 260      Why don’t I just read the sentence?  “The Federal Reserve is in the   process of winding down its term auction facility  Fifty billion dollars in twenty-eight-day credit   will be offered on February 8, and $25 billion in twenty-eight-day credit will be offered at the   final auction on March 8”   7  Thank you, Mr Chairman I’ll be referring to the package   labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives” that was distributed    The wording of the alternatives hasn’t changed since the publication of the Bluebook               7 The materials used by Mr English are appended to this transcript (appendix 7)   Even taking into account the recent market concerns regarding the situation in   Greece, financial markets appear to have become more upbeat about economic   prospects over the intermeeting period, with stock prices higher on balance and   financing conditions easing, particularly for larger firms  Moreover, markets seem to   have taken the end of the LSAPs in stride  Still, the staff anticipates a gradual   recovery, with the unemployment rate at 8¼ percent late next year  And with   considerable resource slack expected to prevail and inflation expectations steady, the   staff sees core inflation edging below 1 percent this year and holding at that rate next   year   As Brian noted yesterday, your projections are broadly similar to the staff’s view    The central tendency of your forecasts is for unemployment of roughly 8 to   8½ percent at the end of next year and PCE inflation next year between 1 and   2 percent  Because your projections for unemployment and inflation over the longer   run suggest that most of you see an unemployment rate of 5 to 5¼ percent and an   inflation rate of 1¾ to 2 percent as consistent with your dual mandate, you may find   the current outlook unsatisfactory and, all else equal, want to foster financial   conditions that are more supportive of economic growth  However, discussion at   recent meetings suggests that the Committee sees the costs of additional large-scale   asset purchases as likely to outweigh the benefits except, perhaps, if the economy   were to weaken notably  As a result, alternative A, on page 2, would provide   additional monetary stimulus not by resuming asset purchases but by sharpening the   conditionality in the extended period language to suggest that an increase in the   federal funds rate is likely to come later than markets now expect   The description of the economic backdrop in paragraphs 1 and 2 would generally   be similar to that in the March statement  The first paragraph would note that the   labor market is showing signs of improving and that household spending has picked   up recently but is likely to remain constrained by high unemployment, modest income   growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit  It would also mention that housing   starts have edged up but remain at a depressed level  The second paragraph would   indicate that recent data suggest inflation has been trending down in response to   substantial resource slack and would note that the Committee anticipates that inflation   is likely to be “quite subdued” for some time, rather than just “subdued,” suggesting   that inflation may run below the level that some policymakers would prefer                                                      April 27–28, 2010 137 of 206                   The statement would indicate that, to promote a more robust economic recovery,   “the Committee anticipates maintaining the target range for the federal funds rate at   0 to ¼ percent for an extended period—until economic conditions, such as   appreciably higher rates of resource utilization, increasing inflation pressures, or   rising inflation expectations, warrant a less accommodative monetary policy”  As   noted earlier, this formulation is intended to signal that monetary policy will remain   unusually accommodative for longer than market participants currently appear to   expect                  To reinforce that signal, the Committee might want to announce, as in paragraph   4, that it will continue on a more permanent basis the current practice of rolling over   the proceeds of maturing Treasury securities even as it does not reinvest maturing   agency debt and payments on mortgage-backed securities  Alternatively, the   Committee may be content to continue the current practice for now, but without   noting that decision in the statement  The Committee’s intention could instead be   reported in the minutes, as it was in the minutes of the January and March meetings    By not including a decision in the statement released after this meeting, the   Committee might feel that it retains greater flexibility regarding a future decision   either to continue rolling over maturing Treasuries or to redeem them   If the Committee did include paragraph 4 in the statement, then it would probably   be desirable to move the final sentence of paragraph 3—that is, “The Committee will   continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will   employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price   stability”—to the end of paragraph 4, thereby suggesting that the Committee could   alter its plans for redeeming securities if conditions warranted   The final paragraph of the statement under all three alternatives would continue   the Committee’s recent practice of noting the winding down of the special liquidity   facilities that were put in place to support markets during the crisis and would   indicate that the TALF is still expected to close down on the previously specified   schedule   Market participants reportedly expect only minor changes in the wording of the   statement at this meeting  As a result, a statement along the lines of alternative A,   suggesting a longer period of accommodative policy than currently anticipated, would   come as a surprise  Short- and intermediate-term interest rates would fall, stock   prices would rise, and the dollar would depreciate  The Desk’s Survey of Primary   Dealers indicates that about a third of market participants expect the Federal Reserve   to begin redeeming at least some Treasury securities fairly soon, and so a statement   ruling out such redemptions, at least for the time being, could increase the expected   size of the SOMA portfolio somewhat, putting some further downward pressure on   longer-term rates   If the Committee has become more confident that the economic recovery is   becoming self-sustaining and it sees a good chance that a higher target level of the   April 27–28, 2010 138 of 206                   federal funds rate will be appropriate later this year or early next year as markets   currently anticipate, then it may want to make only minor changes to the statement   language regarding economic conditions and forward guidance, as in alternative B   (page 3)  Under this approach, the first paragraph of the statement would be a little   more upbeat about economic conditions, noting that labor markets are beginning to   improve, growth in household spending has picked up recently, and housing starts   have edged up  In paragraph 2, the Committee would repeat the view that “with   substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term   inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time”  In   paragraph 3, the Committee would indicate that it is retaining the existing 0 to   ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate and would reiterate that it sees   economic conditions as “likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal   funds rate for an extended period”  This forward guidance may seem appropriate in   light of the optimal control exercises shown in the Bluebook, which suggest that the   federal funds rate should remain at the effective lower bound through 2012                The draft statement for alternative B offers two possible versions of paragraph 4   regarding the reinvestment of the proceeds of SOMA securities  The first would   formalize current arrangements as in alternative A by indicating that the Committee   will maintain its approach of not reinvesting the proceeds of maturing agency debt   and payments on mortgage-backed securities, and that it is continuing to roll over   maturing Treasury securities  Such an approach would be attractive if members saw   the economic outlook as not yet calling for a reduction in policy accommodation    Policymakers might also be concerned that the macroeconomic effects of redeeming   Treasuries could lead the Committee to make smaller sales of agency-related   securities in the future, implying slower progress in ridding the Federal Reserve   balance sheet of such securities   Alternatively, the Committee could adopt the second version of paragraph 4,   which would announce that the Committee would begin redeeming maturing   Treasury securities and that it would continue not to reinvest the proceeds of maturing   agency debt and payments on mortgage-backed securities  As Brian Madigan noted   yesterday, the start date for redemptions might be pushed back from the May 3 date   shown in the draft statement in order to allow for consultation with the Treasury and   for the Treasury and market participants to plan for the change  Members might find   Treasury redemptions appealing if they judged that the improving economic outlook   meant that redeeming maturing Treasuries would not pose significant macroeconomic   risks, and they saw significant benefits from beginning to reduce the size of the   balance sheet and the supply of reserve balances somewhat more rapidly   Of course, the Committee also could continue its interim practice of rolling over   maturing Treasury securities, with that approach again noted in the minutes rather   than in the statement  As the Chairman suggested, taking this step would allow the   staff to provide additional information regarding possible redemption strategies at the   June meeting   April 27–28, 2010 139 of 206                   As in the case of alternative A, if the Committee included one of the two options   for paragraph 4 in the statement, then it would probably choose to move the final   sentence of paragraph 3 to the end of paragraph 4                        With investors expecting only modest changes in the statement language at this   meeting, a statement along the lines of alternative B—if it did not include an   announcement that the Committee would stop rolling over maturing Treasuries—  would probably result in little change in interest rates, equity prices, or the foreign   exchange value of the dollar   The size of the market reaction to a statement that included an announcement that   the Federal Reserve will no longer roll over maturing Treasury securities is difficult   to judge  As Brian described yesterday, staff estimates suggest that the direct effect   on longer-term yields of a decision to redeem maturing Treasury securities likely   would be fairly modest—on the order of 10 to 15 basis points  However, such a   decision would come as a surprise to market participants  Investors might read the   Committee’s decision as suggesting higher odds of future asset sales or a more rapid   start to the process of increasing the federal funds target rate  In either case, the effect   of the statement language on long-term yields would be magnified, perhaps   significantly   If policymakers are confident that the economic recovery will continue and see   substantial upside risks to the medium-term inflation outlook—or significant risks   that financial imbalances could emerge—in the absence of prompt monetary policy   adjustments, then they might choose to issue a statement such as that proposed in   alternative C, page 4  In paragraph 1, the statement would note various positive   economic developments, delete the reference to factors constraining household   spending, and indicate that economic recovery is under way  Paragraph 2 would   recognize that energy prices have risen on balance in recent months, but then state   that inflation has remained subdued  It would go on to say that “The Committee will   adjust the stance of monetary policy as necessary over time to ensure that longer-term   inflation expectations remain well anchored and that inflation outcomes are consistent   with price stability”     In paragraph 3, the Committee would indicate that its fed funds target range   would remain unchanged for now but would modify its conditional expectation for   exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate such that it would last only “for   some time” rather than “for an extended period”  This change in wording would   signal that the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate target is likely to be   sooner than investors currently anticipate     In paragraph 4, alternative C would state that the Committee will “stop   reinvesting the proceeds of maturing Treasury securities,” and also that “the   Committee anticipates that it will soon begin gradual sales of agency debt and   mortgage-backed securities”     April 27–28, 2010 140 of 206                   Market participants do not expect a statement along the lines of alternative C    Investors would likely bring forward significantly the time at which they anticipate   the funds rate target to begin to rise and possibly steepen their expected path of   tightening  The message they took from the shift from “extended period” to “some   time” would be reinforced by the Committee’s decision to redeem maturing Treasury   securities and its indication that sales of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed   securities would likely begin soon  Interest rates would rise notably across the yield   curve, stock prices would fall sharply, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar   could increase             The draft directives for the three alternatives, shown on pages 6-8, include   sentences pointing to the possible plans regarding redemptions  Since sales are not   contemplated immediately under alternative C, they are not noted in the directive   language  Thank you, Mr Chairman   4  Thank you, Nellie  I will be referring to the package labeled   “Material for Briefing on FOMC Participants’ Economic Projections”  Exhibit 1   depicts the broad contours of your current projections for 2010 through 2012 and over   the longer run  Almost all of you continue to project a gradual economic recovery,   with GDP growth (the top panel) picking up a bit, the unemployment rate (the second   panel) slowly trending lower, and inflation (the third and fourth panels) remaining   subdued over the next few years   Exhibit 2 reports the central tendencies and ranges of your projections for   calendar years 2010 through 2012 and over the longer run; the corresponding   information about your April projections is indicated in italics, and the current and   previous staff projections are included as memo items  On balance, your forecasts for   this meeting generally suggest a slightly weaker path for the real economy and a bit   less inflation than you projected at the time of the April meeting  In your forecast   narratives, a number of you noted that these changes were the result of incoming data   and the expected effects on the US economy of the European fiscal crisis  As shown   in the top panel, the central tendency of your growth projections for this year is   slightly lower than in April; most of you now anticipate that real GDP will increase                                                     4 The materials used by Mr English are appended to this transcript

near those rates in   2012  The downward revisions to your growth forecasts for this year are similar to   those in the staff forecast, but the Tealbook projection for growth for next year has   been revised down more substantially than the central tendency of your projections,   from 44 percent in April to 37 percent in the current round  Both the central   tendency and the range of your estimates of the longer-run sustainable rate of GDP   growth, the right-hand column, are the same as in April               Your unemployment rate projections are summarized in the second panel  The   central tendency for the average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year   is 9¼ to 9½ percent, little changed from April  But, consistent with your expectations   of only a gradual economic recovery, all but one of you anticipate that the   unemployment rate will remain above 8 percent at the end of next year  Moreover,   most of you project that the unemployment rate will be about 7 to 7½ percent even in   late 2012—well above the unchanged 5 to 5¼ percent central tendency of your   estimates of the unemployment rate that would prevail over the longer run in the   absence of further shocks, which is shown in the right-hand column  It appears that   most of you, like the staff, continue to anticipate that the long-run performance of the   labor market will not be significantly undermined by the substantial economic   downturn and the slow recovery   You generally project that inflation will remain subdued, and the dispersion of   your inflation projections has narrowed somewhat since April, particularly for this   year and next  The central tendencies of your projections for core PCE inflation for   2010 and 2011, shown in the fourth panel, have shifted down a bit and now run ¾ to   1 percent this year and about 1 to 1¼ percent next year before rising to 1 to   1½ percent in 2012  The central tendencies for headline inflation, shown in the third   panel, follow a broadly similar path  Most of you project that headline inflation will   stay at or below the 1¾ to 2 percent central tendency for the “mandate-consistent”   inflation rate, shown in the right-hand column, throughout the projection period   Your views on the outlook for inflation continue to differ somewhat from the   staff’s In each of the three years, the Tealbook forecasts for total and core inflation   are generally at or below the lower limits of the central tendencies of your   projections  This difference in views helps explain why a sizable majority of you   anticipate that it will be appropriate to begin increasing the federal funds rate earlier   than is assumed in the Tealbook   As shown in exhibit 3, three-quarters or more of you continue to be more   uncertain than usual about your projections for growth and PCE inflation, the solid   bars in the two left-hand panels  As shown in the top right panel, about half of you   now judge that the risks to output growth are tilted to the downside, a significant   change from your assessments in April  Most of you continue to view the risks to the   inflation outlook, the bottom right panel, as balanced, though there has been a small   June 22–23, 2010 69 of 213             shift toward downside risks here as well  That concludes our prepared remarks    We’d be happy to take your questions      3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the package   labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives”  This   package includes the three draft policy statements that were distributed yesterday   evening as well as revised draft directives  Changes since the last time these   documents were distributed are shown in blue   The incoming data over the intermeeting period were on the weak side of   expectations, as most of you noted during the economic go-round  If the information   you’ve received in the past seven weeks led you to mark down your forecasts for   output, employment, and inflation, you might be inclined to provide additional   monetary accommodation to boost economic growth, to limit the extent to which   inflation moves further below levels that would be consistent with your dual mandate   over the longer term, and to trim the downside risks to growth and inflation    Alternatively, if you judge that the data suggested only a temporary “soft patch” for   the economy, you might be more concerned about the longer-term risks that an   extended period of exceptionally accommodative monetary policy could pose for   macroeconomic and financial stability and so might be inclined to begin reducing the   degree of accommodation relatively soon   Last week, you received three staff memos discussing possible methods for   providing additional policy accommodation  These included a memo on cutting the   target federal funds rate and the rate paid on reserves, a memo on using firmer   forward guidance to reduce investors’ expectations for the future federal funds rate,   and a memo on the potential effects of reinvesting repayments of principal on agency   mortgage-backed securities rather than allowing those securities to run off  As   background for today’s discussion, I want to highlight three results from those   memos   First, the staff judged that reducing the target range for the federal funds rate to   0 to ⅛ percentage point and cutting the interest rate on reserves to 10 basis points   would likely leave the federal funds rate trading in a range between 5 and 10 basis                                                     3 The materials used by Mr English are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   August 10, 2010 85 of 160             points and would not cause major problems for market functioning  The effects of   larger cuts were uncertain and might adversely affect the functioning of money   markets   Second, changes in forward guidance can move longer-term yields, to the extent   that they alter investors’ expectations for the future path of short-term rates  But,   with investors pricing in considerable odds that the federal funds rate will remain   within its current target range through 2011, the Committee might have to provide the   market with a signal about its policy intentions quite far into the future to have a   meaningful effect on financial conditions   Third, with the actual and anticipated rate of mortgage prepayments having   picked up, the Federal Reserve’s holdings of MBS are running off faster than had   been anticipated  As a result, the portfolio balance effect generated by the large-scale   asset purchases is unwinding, putting upward pressure on longer-term rates    Reinvesting the repayments of principal on SOMA holdings of MBS would counter   this effect and avoid a passive tightening in the stance of monetary policy  The staff   estimated that adoption of a reinvestment strategy could result in a 10-year Treasury   yield that was as much as 20 basis points lower than would be the case if the current   strategy were retained  However, as the memo noted, this estimate is quite uncertain   and may be overstated, in part because it is based on market reactions to FOMC   announcements of asset purchases that were made when financial market functioning   was impaired   Of course, the same approaches could be used to reduce policy accommodation if   the Committee thought that were appropriate  For example, the Committee could   signal an earlier increase in the funds rate than investors currently expect or decide to   stop reinvesting principal from maturing Treasury securities   With that summary of the staff memos in hand, let me turn to the three policy   alternatives that were distributed yesterday  Alternative A, page 2, employs all three   approaches to providing stimulus  As noted in the first part of paragraph 3, the   Committee would reduce the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to 1/8 percent   and support this change by cutting the interest rate paid on reserve balances to   10 basis points  This change in the target range would be reinforced by strengthened   forward guidance  In particular, the end of paragraph 3 would drop the “extended   period” language that has been used for some time, and instead indicate that the   Committee “anticipates maintaining this range for the federal funds rate until resource   utilization and underlying inflation have moved appreciably closer to levels consistent   with its longer-term objectives”  This language would likely be interpreted by market   participants as pointing to a longer period of very low short-term rates, which   presumably would be reflected in some decline in intermediate- and longer-term   interest rates beyond that attributable to the change in the target federal funds rate   alone   In addition, as noted in paragraph 4, the Committee would reinvest principal   payments on agency debt and agency MBS, rather than simply allowing the securities   August 10, 2010 86 of 160             to run off  As written, alternative A would call for reinvestment to be in longer-term   Treasury securities, but it also offers an alternative under which the reinvestment   would be in agency MBS  While offsetting MBS paydowns with MBS purchases has   the benefit of being easy to communicate as a fairly straightforward adjustment to   current policy, Federal Reserve holdings of MBS are already large, and further   purchases might strain market functioning  Buying Treasuries would not run such   risks, because Federal Reserve holdings are currently a smaller share of total Treasury   debt and the Treasury market is larger and more liquid than the MBS market    Moreover, the Committee might feel that purchases of Treasuries were preferable,   because they would be consistent with the long-run objective of returning to a   Treasury-only portfolio  For the same reason, the Committee might be more willing   to hold Treasury securities to maturity, reducing the risk of having to realize losses on   sales  You may have noticed that we moved the words “longer-term” relative to   where they were in the Tealbook  We did so to be consistent with wording in past   statements and so to avoid potentially causing confusion among market participants    We have also inserted a footnote into the statement alerting the public that there will   be a technical note from the Desk that will provide operational details on how it will   carry out these transactions  Brian Sack can provide more information on that later    The final sentence of the paragraph notes that the Committee would continue to roll   over maturing Treasury securities   As a rationale for these policy steps, paragraph 1 of alternative A would note that   “information received over recent months has increasingly suggested that the   recovery in economic activity and the labor market is proceeding at an unsatisfactory   pace”  It would note that household spending is increasing only gradually, equipment   and software spending is rising less rapidly than earlier in the year, and that the   contribution of inventory investment to growth is likely to wane  The statement   would reiterate that nonresidential investment is weak, employers are reluctant to add   to payrolls, and that housing starts are at a depressed level  On the financial side, it   would note that conditions have become somewhat less supportive of economic   growth in recent months and that bank lending has continued to contract  The first   paragraph would conclude by stating that the Committee still anticipates a gradual   return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability but that the   near-term outlook for economic activity has weakened  The inflation paragraph   would indicate that “inflation is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that the   Committee considers most consistent with its mandate to promote maximum   employment and stable prices”    The Desk’s dealer survey suggested that market participants placed some odds on   policy moves along the lines of alternative A by the end of this year  They put the   highest probability on reinvestment of the proceeds of agency debt and MBS and on   firmer forward guidance and a lower probability on a reduction in the rate paid on   reserve balances  While, at the time of the survey, none of these actions were   expected at today’s meeting, expectations have shifted since that time as a result of   market commentary and the weaker-than-expected employment report, and some   dealers now anticipate that the Committee will announce a shift to reinvestment of   MBS proceeds at this meeting, with the reinvestment expected to be into Treasury   August 10, 2010 87 of 160             securities  Nonetheless, market participants would be quite surprised by the   combination of actions in alternative A  The result would likely be a material   reduction in intermediate- and longer-term interest rates, although the effect on   longer-term rates could be damped if the scope of the policy response led to an   increase in longer-term inflation expectations  Equity prices would probably rise and   the foreign exchange value of the dollar decline  However, the very weak tone of the   first paragraph of alternative A could lead investors to mark down their outlook for   economic activity, and so for profits, limiting the effect on equity prices     The language in the first paragraph of alternative B, page 3, is somewhat less   downbeat than in alternative A but still notes that the pace of the recovery in output   and employment has slowed in recent months  It notes that household spending is   increasing gradually and equipment and software spending is rising  After reiterating   the language from the June statement regarding nonresidential structures, housing   starts, and bank lending, the first paragraph concludes by noting that the recovery is   likely to be “more modest in the near term than had been anticipated”   The inflation paragraph would drop the references to recent declines in energy   and other commodity prices, but otherwise stick fairly close to the language   employed in June, noting that measures of underlying inflation have trended lower   and that inflation is likely to be subdued for some time  The Committee might want   to end the paragraph by stating explicitly that levels of inflation are likely to be lower   than are desirable over the longer run   The target range for the federal funds rate and the forward guidance in paragraph   3 are unchanged from the June statement  The Committee again would note that it   anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of   the federal funds rate for an extended period  This language seems to have guided   expectations in a helpful way of late, and you may not be inclined to change it now    Paragraph 4 indicates that to help support the economic recovery in a context of   price stability, the Committee will maintain the Federal Reserve’s holdings of   securities at their current level by reinvesting principal payments on agency debt and   agency MBS in longer-term Treasury securities  Again, there is alternative wording   that suggests reinvestment in MBS  Maturing Treasury securities would continue to   be rolled over   You might see the decision to reinvest repayments on agency debt and MBS in   alternative B as appropriate if you now anticipate that unemployment and inflation   will move toward values consistent with your dual mandate even more gradually than   seemed likely at the time of your June meeting, and you see that very gradual   progress as not acceptable  Taking action at this meeting would seem particularly   appropriate if you saw weakening business and consumer confidence as posing   significant downside risks to that outlook  Even if you believe that the current   deterioration in economic performance is likely to be limited in duration, you may   think that the weaker outlook and the associated risks are large enough to warrant   some policy response   August 10, 2010 88 of 160             This alternative would come as much less of a surprise to market participants than   alternative A  Indeed, judging from market commentary, some investors likely   expect an outcome along the lines of alternative B, while the timing of the policy   move would be somewhat surprising for other investors  Intermediate- and longer-  term rates would likely decline to some extent, equity prices would probably rise, and   the dollar depreciate   Finally, if you remain convinced that a sustainable economic recovery is under   way and are especially concerned about the potential adverse effects of continued   extraordinary monetary policy stimulus, you might believe that the Committee should   begin moving soon to a less accommodative posture and accordingly modify its   language now, as in alternative C, page 4  Under this alternative, the Committee   would revise its forward guidance for the federal funds rate to suggest an earlier-than-  anticipated increase in short-term interest rates  In particular, the statement would   indicate that the Committee now anticipates that economic conditions would warrant   a “low,” rather than “exceptionally low,” target range for the federal funds rate for   “some time” rather than for “an extended period” In the first line of the paragraph,   the statement would also change “will maintain” to “decided to maintain” to indicate   that the Committee’s decision to retain the current low target funds rate range applied   only to this meeting  In addition, under alternative C the Committee would begin to   run off its holdings of Treasury securities as they mature in order to reduce the size of   the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet    An announcement along the lines of alternative C would be a great surprise to   market participants  Interest rates would likely rise significantly across the yield   curve, although lower long-term inflation expectations might damp the rise in longer-  term rates  Equity prices would likely decline, and the dollar probably would   appreciate   Draft directives for the three alternatives are presented on pages 5 through 7  We   have made changes to the language of the draft directives to square them up with the   wording in the draft statements, and we have included alternative wording for   reinvestment in MBS should the Committee make that choice  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Yes, it does  What we’ve assumed is shown on the very back page of   the memo in terms of estimates of mortgage-backed securities holdings, and the maximum   August 10, 2010 95 of 160             difference is about $400 billion  As we get prepayments on these instruments and reinvest them,   the stock of MBS stays constant instead of declining, as it’s currently projected to do  We do   that until, under the assumptions in the memo, early 2012, and then let them run off  In fact, we   would be selling them at that point  So the maximum difference is about $400 billion  I think   there is a question as to what the market participants expect from this, and we would be   announcing an intention to start doing this  We’re not telling them how long we’re going to do   it, so they would assume we’re going to do it for a while, but they may not have in their mind   exactly this trajectory     We calculate it by looking at the different portfolios and the effects of   those portfolios on longer-term rates  I think it’s correct to say that it’s broadly similar to   $400 billion of purchases followed by sales  It’s not going to be identical unless you bought   them following exactly this trajectory and sold them following exactly this trajectory    Right     That might already be built in     I just wanted to point out one thing  In the structure of the minutes,   until you get to the policy paragraph, everything is in terms of the participants  So there isn’t a   separate discussion of participants versus members at that point     It’s all in terms of participants, and then in the policy round, it’s in   terms of members     Right    4 Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the package   labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives” that was   distributed during the break  The package includes the four draft policy statements   and the associated draft directives  You will note that we made some changes to   alternative B relative to the version that was distributed in the Tealbook; those   changes are shown in blue   The conventional approach to these policy briefings has for some time been to   take the alternatives in order—A, B, C  But, given that the alternatives we provided   in the Tealbook were fairly complicated, starting with alternative A1 seemed like   jumping in at the deep end, both for me and for all of you, so I thought I’d start   instead with alternative B, before moving to the A alternatives and then to alternative   C                                                     4 The materials used by Mr English are appended to this transcript (appendix 4)   September 21, 2010 77 of 151             The Committee might choose alternative B, page 4, if it thinks that additional   policy accommodation is not called for at this meeting but wants to emphasize that it   will act as needed to achieve its objectives  Such a stance might be warranted if the   Committee perceives both resource utilization and inflation to be falling short of their   mandate-consistent levels by unsatisfactory margins, but still sees economic growth   as likely to gain speed relatively soon and inflation as likely to stabilize near current   levels before gradually moving higher  Indeed, market participants appear to have   taken some reassurance from the economic news in the last few weeks, and the   Committee may have done so as well  Members may also see the outlook as   particularly uncertain and so choose to wait for additional information before   deciding whether further policy action is needed  That said, the Committee may want   to indicate that its patience with regard to the pace of recovery and the level of   inflation is limited, and if further progress does not become more evident reasonably   soon, the Committee will take action   The statement under alternative B would note the deceleration in equipment and   software spending, as well as the reduced rate of contraction in bank lending  The   inflation paragraph would emphasize that current levels of underlying inflation are   below those the Committee judges to be most consistent, over the longer run, with its   dual mandate, but would also note the expectation that inflation will, after some time,   return to levels the Committee considers consistent with its mandate  With no change   in policy at this meeting, the third paragraph would repeat the “extended period”   language, which appears to have clearly communicated the conditional nature of the   Committee’s policy outlook, and would note the retention of the reinvestment policy   adopted in August  The final paragraph would continue to indicate that the   Committee will monitor the economic outlook and financial developments, but would   go on to say that it “is prepared to provide additional accommodation as needed to   support the economic recovery and to return inflation, over time, to levels consistent   with its mandate,” thereby conveying the sense that the Committee could act if the   recovery remains weak and inflation stays low   The Desk’s survey of primary dealers suggests that market participants do not   expect significant changes in the statement or additional asset purchases at this   meeting, although they put about 40 percent probability on an announcement of   additional asset purchases by year-end  A statement along the lines of alternative B   would likely cause market participants to price in higher odds of additional asset   purchases, perhaps as soon as the November meeting  As a consequence, longer-term   interest rates would likely fall some, stock prices would move up, and the foreign   exchange value of the dollar would probably decline   However, if members were inclined to take action now in response to the   weakness of the recovery and the lower-than-desired level of underlying inflation, the   Committee could choose to provide additional policy accommodation at this meeting,   as in alternative A2, page 3  Such a decision could reflect three judgments first, that   the economic situation is not likely to improve sufficiently without further policy   action; second, that additional purchases of longer-term Treasury securities will help   September 21, 2010 78 of 151             support the recovery; and third, that the possible costs of additional purchases do not   outweigh the benefits   Regarding the first judgment, the Committee, like the staff, may see some   strengthening in the pace of the recovery next year, but still think that economic   growth will not be sufficient to work down the current very high margin of resource   slack particularly soon  And the Committee might be even more downbeat about the   outlook  As Dave noted, the staff forecast has been marked down considerably since   the spring, with the projected start of a sustained decline in the unemployment rate   pushed back a few quarters, to the middle of 2011  In addition, some members may   be worried that the headwinds that have slowed the recovery will exert greater   restraint over the next several quarters than is assumed in the staff forecast    Moreover, some members might read the decline in TIPS-based inflation   compensation since spring as a signal that longer-term inflation expectations are at   risk of coming unmoored in a downward direction and see further disinflation as a   potentially significant impediment to the economic recovery   With regard to the judgment on the benefits of additional securities purchases, in   the Tealbook we estimated that the purchase of $500 billion of longer-term Treasury   securities over the next six months would trim long-term interest rates by about 15 to   20 basis points, though some of that effect already appears to be priced into markets    The result would be roughly an additional ¼ percentage point on the growth rate of   real GDP in 2011 and 2012 and an unemployment rate that would be a couple of   tenths of a percentage point lower at the end of 2012  Inflation would be about a   tenth higher in 2012  I should note that our estimates of the effects of purchases have   been marked down somewhat since the August meeting to be consistent with the   middle of the range of estimated effects of large-scale asset purchases reported in the   paper by Gagnon, Raskin, Remache, and Sack  Of course, these estimates continue to   be subject to very considerable uncertainty   The third judgment relates to the possible costs of additional securities purchases    A key concern that the Committee has expressed in this regard is that increases in the   size of the balance sheet could undermine the public’s confidence in the FOMC’s   ability to exit smoothly from the current very accommodative policy stance when it is   appropriate to do so  If that confidence were significantly undermined, inflation   expectations could move higher, and actual inflation could follow suit  To address   this concern, the Federal Reserve has developed the term deposit facility and the   ability to conduct large-scale triparty reverse repurchase agreements with an   expanded set of counterparties in order to allow policy accommodation to be   withdrawn even with a very large balance sheet  I should also note that longer-term   inflation expectations have not moved higher, on balance, since the announcement of   the LSAPs in late 2008 and early 2009, although a number of factors may have   contributed to that development  Finally, some of you might find a modest increase   in inflation expectations and inflation in current circumstances to be a benefit, not a   cost, of the purchases   September 21, 2010 79 of 151             The statement under alternative A2 would indicate that the incoming data have   confirmed that the pace of the recovery has slowed  Spending on equipment and   software would simply be described as having “slowed,” and no mention would be   made of the reduced rate of decline in bank lending  The inflation paragraph would   note that underlying inflation has been trending lower, indicate that it is below levels   most consistent with the dual mandate, and go on to say that, “In the current   environment, disinflation is an impediment to economic recovery”  Given concerns   about a possible decline in expected inflation, the statement would not indicate a   Committee anticipation that inflation will move back up to acceptable levels over   time  The statement would indicate that the federal funds rate target was unchanged   and retain the “extended period” language  It would go on to say that “To help foster   a stronger pace of economic recovery and to move underlying inflation closer, over   time, to rates consistent with its mandate, the Committee will increase its total   holdings of securities to approximately $25 trillion by purchasing an additional   $500 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over the next six months”  The   statement would also note that the reinvestment policy adopted in August would be   retained  It could end by stating that “The Committee will continue to monitor the   economic outlook and financial developments and will act as needed to support a   stronger economic recovery and foster price stability”  The reference to “stronger   economic recovery” rather than just “economic recovery,” as in the August statement,   would suggest a somewhat greater willingness on the part of the Committee to take   policy action   If the Committee wanted to indicate an intention to adjust the size of the SOMA   portfolio more regularly and in smaller increments going forward, it could instead end   the statement with the indication that “the Committee will determine, each time it   meets, whether an adjustment – either upward or downward – to its holdings of   securities is needed to foster maximum employment and price stability”  As   discussed in a box in the Tealbook, such an approach has potential benefits and costs    On the benefit side, smaller and more frequent adjustments to the size of the SOMA   portfolio should allow a closer match between the actual stance of policy and the   stance called for by the economic outlook  Such an approach might also allow   investors to better understand the Committee’s reaction function and so price into   markets the effects of anticipated future policy decisions, which could help to   stabilize the economy  And a gradual approach to purchases might allow the   Committee to shift to gradual sales without generating an outsized market reaction    However, some of you may be concerned that, while relatively rare announcements of   large purchases could give a substantial boost to consumer and business confidence,   helping to support the economy, such announcement effects might be less likely to   accompany smaller and more regular purchases  In addition, this approach could   pose significant communications challenges  Without more information, perhaps   from speeches or the minutes, the Committee’s reaction function would likely remain   unclear to investors for some time, limiting the benefits from improved anticipation   of future policy actions   A decision to purchase additional securities at this meeting would come as a   considerable surprise to market participants; interest rates would likely fall, stock   September 21, 2010 80 of 151             prices rise, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar decline  However, if the   unexpected decision to provide additional policy accommodation at this meeting led   investors to conclude that the Committee was more concerned about the economic   outlook than had been thought, the effect on stock prices could be muted   If the Committee wanted to take an even clearer stand against low and declining   underlying inflation, it could do so by providing explicit information regarding its   intended level of inflation, as in alternative A1, page 2  This alternative starts out like   alternative A2, but in the inflation paragraph it states that “Underlying inflation is   now running below the level of 2 percent or a bit less, as measured by the price index   for personal consumption expenditures, that the Committee judges most consistent,   over the longer run, with its mandate to promote maximum employment and price   stability”  This range is consistent with the responses to the June Summary of   Economic Projections, which showed a central tendency of long-run projections for   PCE inflation of 17 to 20 percent  As in alternative A2, the inflation paragraph   would end by indicating that “In the current environment, disinflation is an   impediment to economic recovery”  In this alternative, the policy paragraphs are   combined, with the discussion of additional purchases coming immediately after the   inflation paragraph, thereby giving greater emphasis to the role of asset purchases in   supporting the desired level of inflation  Alternative A1 ends with the simpler of the   two final paragraphs offered for alternative A2   As discussed in the Tealbook, providing greater clarity about the Committee’s   desired level of inflation could, if credible, help anchor inflation expectations more   firmly  In the current circumstances, such an effect would help to guard against   further disinflation  However, a more explicit focus on the inflation outlook has some   potential disadvantages  The Committee would presumably have to explain   deviations of inflation from the announced range, and at times its policy decisions   could be constrained if investors’ views of the inflation outlook did not match its   own  Moreover, an increased focus on inflation in Committee communications could   lead some to question the Committee’s commitment to the “maximum employment”   leg of its dual mandate  The Committee could counteract such concerns by providing   more specificity regarding the level of the unemployment rate that it regards as   sustainable in the longer run, but it might be hesitant to do so, because the sustainable   unemployment rate depends on factors over which the Committee has no control  In   any event, the Committee would need to be clear with the public, as well as with the   Congress and the Administration, that being more explicit about its intentions for   inflation did not mean that it would be attaching greater weight to its price stability   objective relative to its goal for maximum employment   The market reaction to alternative A1 would likely be similar to that for   alternative A2  However, the explicit indication of the Committee’s intended level of   inflation could give a small boost to expected inflation while reducing uncertainty   about inflation over the long run, with potentially offsetting effects on longer-term   nominal interest rates   September 21, 2010 81 of 151             Finally, if the Committee feels that the economic recovery is continuing and will   pick up pace over time, and it sees the current trajectory for the economy as the best   that can be expected in current circumstances, then it might be inclined to leave   policy unchanged at this meeting and signal that it will likely be appropriate to begin   removing policy accommodation before long, as in alternative C, page 5  Members   may believe that much of the current unemployment reflects unavoidable lags in the   reallocation of labor across sectors and regions and so cannot be effectively addressed   by additional monetary stimulus  They may also believe that, with the Committee’s   intentions with regard to inflation fairly well understood by market participants,   providing additional information in the statement would not be particularly helpful in   current circumstances   Some members may also be concerned that keeping policy rates at very low levels   for a long time and providing additional stimulus through large-scale asset purchases   could lead some investors to take on additional risk to obtain higher yields and that   the investors may not understand those risks as well as they should  The result could   be mounting imbalances in financial markets that could lead to future financial crises   The statement for alternative C would revise the forward guidance for the federal   funds rate to suggest an earlier-than-anticipated increase in short-term interest rates    In particular, the statement would indicate that the Committee now anticipates that   economic conditions would warrant a “low,” rather than “exceptionally low,” target   range for the federal funds rate for “some time,” rather than for “an extended period”    In the first line of the paragraph, the statement would also change “will maintain” to   “decided to maintain” to indicate that the Committee’s decision to retain the current   low target funds rate range applied only to this meeting  In addition, under alternative   C the Committee would continue its policy of reinvesting principal payments from   securities held in the SOMA only “for the time being,” which would likely be read by   investors as suggesting that this policy could be reversed soon   An announcement along the lines of alternative C would come as a great surprise   to market participants  Interest rates would likely rise significantly across the yield   curve, although lower long-term inflation expectations might damp the rise in longer-  term nominal rates  Equity prices would likely decline substantially, and the dollar   probably would appreciate   Draft directives for the four alternatives are presented on pages 7 through 10 of   your handout  Thank you, Mr Chairman      My sense would be that just changing the paragraph will get people’s   attention, for sure  They will notice, and they will assume that the thought is that further easing   is going to be more likely  You suggested 60 percent  I think it could be higher—I was guessing   two-thirds  I think last night as I was messing around with stuff in preparation for my briefing,   some number like that came up—probably less than 80 percent but more than 60 percent, I   would guess     One thing we discussed is whether the “trended lower” phrase gave a   sense that maybe there was an ongoing process, that is, that it gave a greater sense of the risk of   getting to deflation, and “have come down over time” maybe has a little of that flavor  I guess   the question is what the Committee thinks  I could live with either     I think that’s right  What Brian just described is consistent with the   work that’s been done here  The big question is the extent to which reserve additions could be   drained more or less one for one, and I think the answer is something less than one for one    Some of those reserves would end up being held by institutions that are not participating in the   term deposit program, and there would be some process whereby they could get those reserves to   institutions that are participating, but probably there’d be some leakage  Our sense is that, at an   appropriate rate, we could drain very considerable reserves through the Term Deposit Facility     So the disagreement was certainly less this time than last time     I’m sorry  [Laughter]   3  Thank you, Mr Chairman I’ll be referring to the package   labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives”  The   package includes the four draft policy statements and the associated draft directives    You will note that we made some modest changes to alternatives A and B relative to   the versions that were distributed in the Tealbook; those changes, which were   distributed to the Committee on Monday, are shown in blue                  In putting together the alternatives that were included in the Tealbook, the staff   read the Committee’s discussion at the October 15 videoconference as indicating no   consensus for a significant change at this time in the description of the Committee’s   objectives, such as the adoption of an explicit numerical inflation goal or   establishment of a price level target  Accordingly, alternatives A and B retain a   qualitative description of the Committee’s objectives, while aiming to provide   somewhat greater clarity about those objectives, as well as the link between them and   the Committee’s policy decision   Turning first to alternative B, page 3, the Committee may think that it is   appropriate to provide additional policy accommodation at this meeting in order to   strengthen the recovery and move inflation back toward levels that it sees as   consistent with its dual mandate  Such a decision could reflect three judgments First,   that the economic situation is not likely to improve sufficiently without further policy   action; second, that additional purchases of longer-term Treasury securities will help   support the recovery; and third, that the benefits of additional purchases outweigh the   possible costs   The first paragraph of alternative B summarizes current economic conditions    The incoming economic data have been about in line with expectations, as a number   of you noted yesterday, so this paragraph is not greatly changed from September   The second paragraph starts by pointing to the Committee’s statutory mandate to   promote maximum employment and stable prices, and then goes on to note that   unemployment is elevated and inflation somewhat low relative to levels consistent   with the Committee’s dual mandate  The statement then observes that progress   toward the Committee’s objectives has been unacceptably slow   Against this backdrop, the third paragraph indicates that the Committee will   maintain its current reinvestment strategy and will increase the size of the SOMA                                                     3 The materials used by Mr English are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   November 2–3, 2010 109 of 238             portfolio by $600 billion by purchasing additional longer-term Treasury securities at a   rate of about $75 billion a month through the middle of next year  The fourth   paragraph reiterates the “extended period” language that the Committee has used for   some time                        The final paragraph retains some of the tilt that was in the September statement,   but also suggests a more incremental approach to future asset-purchase decisions by   stating that the Committee will regularly review the pace of its securities purchases   and the overall size of the asset-purchase program in light of incoming information   and will adjust the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price   stability    A statement along the lines of alternative B would be roughly in line with market   expectations, as Brian described them in his briefing yesterday, and so would   probably have little impact on asset prices beyond those that have already occurred    However, I would note that market expectations appear to be more diffuse than usual,   so some market reaction, either positive or negative, is certainly possible   If members were inclined to take more aggressive action at today’s meeting, the   Committee could announce the purchase of another $1 trillion of longer-term   Treasury securities, as in alternative A, page 2  Such an approach might seem   attractive if policymakers were not confident that the headwinds holding back the   recovery would ease as quickly as assumed in the staff forecast  Alternatively,   members may be concerned that the current low level of inflation heightens the risk   that adverse shocks could lead to deflation and a protracted period of extremely poor   economic performance  And some members may simply see the economy as likely to   fall short of the Committee’s dual objectives for too long to be acceptable, even with   the purchase of an additional $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities   Other than the description of the size and length of the purchase program, the first   three paragraphs of the statement under alternative A are identical to those under   alternative B       The fourth paragraph changes the forward guidance about the federal funds rate to   be more explicit about the likely duration of the current period of very low interest   rates, indicating that the target range for the federal funds rate will be maintained at   least until mid-2012, so long as  The unemployment rate remains elevated; the   Committee continues to anticipate that, with such a policy stance, inflation in the   intermediate term will not exceed levels consistent with its mandate; and longer-term   inflation expectations remain well anchored   The final paragraph of alternative A is similar to that in the September statement,   indicating that the Committee will monitor the outlook and is prepared to provide   additional accommodation as needed   November 2–3, 2010 110 of 238             A decision to announce a purchase of $1 trillion of additional Treasury securities   at this meeting and to provide more explicit forward guidance regarding the federal   funds rate would come as a surprise to market participants  Combined with the   language at the end of the statement, these announcements could lead investors to   mark down their expected policy path and would likely lead them to anticipate   additional securities purchases before the program comes to an end  As a result,   interest rates would presumably fall, stock prices rise, and the foreign exchange value   of the dollar decline                   Alternatively, the Committee may have read the incoming data over the   intermeeting period as generally mixed, and so members may remain uncertain about   whether additional policy accommodation is appropriate at this time and want to   leave policy on hold and await additional information on economic developments   before making a decision on the need for further securities purchases  If so, the   Committee might want to issue a statement very similar to that issued in September,   as in alternative C, page 4  Such a decision would seem particularly attractive if the   Committee was not confident that the possible benefits of additional policy   accommodation outweighed the risks that additional securities purchases could entail    For example, some members may be worried that a further increase in the size of the   Federal Reserve’s balance sheet could undermine public confidence in the   Committee’s ability to exit smoothly from the current very accommodative policy   stance, and so contribute to an undesirable increase in inflation expectations and   actual inflation   A decision to take no additional policy easing steps at this meeting would come as   a considerable surprise to market participants, and much of the improvement in   financial conditions that has occurred over the past couple of months would likely be   unwound, with longer-term interest rates rising, stock prices falling, and the foreign   exchange value of the dollar increasing   Finally, if the Committee feels that the economic recovery is continuing and sees   a gradual recovery as the best trajectory that can be expected in current   circumstances, then it might be inclined to leave policy unchanged at this meeting and   signal that it will likely be appropriate to begin removing policy accommodation   before long, as in alternative D, page 5  Members may believe that much of the   current elevated level of unemployment reflects unavoidable lags in the reallocation   of labor across sectors and regions and so cannot be effectively addressed by   additional monetary stimulus  Some members may also be concerned that keeping   policy rates at very low levels for a long time and providing additional stimulus   through asset purchases could lead to the development of macroeconomic or financial   imbalances that could prove costly in the future     The statement for alternative D revises the forward guidance for the federal funds   rate to suggest an earlier increase in short-term interest rates and implies that the   reinvestment policy could be reversed soon    November 2–3, 2010 111 of 238             An announcement along the lines of alternative D would come as a great surprise   to market participants  Interest rates would rise significantly across the yield curve,   equity prices would decline, and the dollar would appreciate                          Draft directives for the four alternatives are presented on pages 7 through 10 of   your handout  Brian Sack will continue our briefing     We did some work, if you remember—a little more than a year ago, I   think—where we talked to the banks that were holding large stocks of reserves and asked them   about their demand for reserves and what they intended to do as their demand for reserves   declined  At that time, the staff’s feeling was that the large stock of reserves didn’t seem to be   having the sorts of effects that you would expect to see from a pure QE approach, in the sense   that the money stock wasn’t growing rapidly and bank credit wasn’t growing rapidly  At least   some of the banks were telling us that, when it came time to reduce their demand for reserves,   they were going to move first into holdings of short- and intermediate-term securities and only   later into increasing their lending  We said at that time that we’d want to focus on looking at the   bank credit numbers to see if, in some sense, that seemed to be getting some traction, that is, if   you seemed to be seeing a pickup in growth in bank credit, a pickup in growth in loans  Today   loan growth is still negative—it has slowed some—and it does not appear that there is the sort of   transmission mechanism that I associate with QE operating through bank balance sheets; it just   doesn’t seem to be there at this stage     That’s right     Those are short-term     One piece of thinking that we’ve done over the intermeeting period was   related to work that you may remember from a year or so ago  We were interested in the extent   to which the increase in reserves could potentially put pressure on banks’ leverage ratios,   because it’s making their balance sheets larger  We had concluded a little more than a year ago   that that effect wasn’t that important because banks had enough capital that it didn’t seem to be   eating into that cushion very much  That same calculation today holds true even more, in the   November 2–3, 2010 129 of 238             sense that bank balance sheets have shrunk, bank capital has gone up, so there’s even less of an   effect     We were trying to convey that the Committee wants inflation to move   back to the mandate-consistent level  We are not aiming to put inflation above the mandate-  consistent level  That’s a possible policy approach, as we know, but this would say that’s not   what we are trying to do—what we’re aiming to do is just move it back, in some sense smoothly,   to the mandate-consistent level  Therefore, the Committee would begin to think about tightening   policy if its projections of inflation over the intermediate term were above that     There’s noise here, but this would be a forecast     Well, it connotes that not all of your views are the same       That was the intent, yes   November 2–3, 2010 131 of 238             2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the package   labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives”  The   package includes the four draft policy statements and the associated draft directives    The changes to the statements that were distributed over the weekend have been   incorporated into this package; so the language marked in red now denotes changes   relative to the November statement            We have provided you with three alternative statements, A through C, that are   similar in structure to the statement issued in November but that vary with regard to   the size of the intended increase in the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings—  $600 billion, as in November, under alternative B, $800 billion under alternative A,   and $400 billion under alternative C  The staff estimates that the $200 billion   increment employed between these alternatives would likely have macroeconomic   effects broadly similar to those associated with a 25 basis point change in the federal   funds rate target if the target rate were not at its effective lower bound  The final   statement, alternative D, is quite different; in that case, the Committee would   immediately cease adding to its securities holdings and would begin laying the   groundwork for an exit from the current extraordinary degree of policy   accommodation   Turning first to alternative B, on page 3, the Committee may think that it is   appropriate to continue with the asset purchase program announced in November in   order to strengthen the recovery and move inflation back toward levels that it sees as   consistent with its dual mandate  Such a decision might reflect, in part, a desire to   show a steady hand on policy and to await more information on economic and   financial developments before making an adjustment  In addition, choice of this   alternative would presumably continue to reflect three judgments  First, despite the   somewhat better economic data and the proposed fiscal agreement, that the economic   recovery is not likely to be sufficiently strong to bring down unemployment at a   satisfactory rate; second, that additional purchases of longer-term Treasury securities   will help support the recovery and move the unemployment and inflation rates toward   the Committee’s objectives; and third, that the costs of additional purchases are not   sufficient to outweigh those benefits   Under this alternative, the changes from the November statement are relatively   minor  In the first paragraph, they reflect the somewhat stronger growth now seen for   the second half of this year, the ongoing weakness in the housing sector, and the   continued downtrend in inflation  In the third paragraph, the changes that we   distributed Sunday were intended to make clear that the policy decision at this   meeting was a routine update and restatement of the policy adopted in November    Other than that, the statement is virtually unchanged; it retains the language about   “disappointingly slow” progress toward the Committee’s objectives, how “the                                                     2 The materials used by Mr English are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   December 14, 2010 77 of 127             Committee will regularly review” the asset purchase program, and the anticipation   that “exceptionally low” funds rates will be appropriate for an “extended period”                  Market participants generally expect today’s statement to update the Committee’s   views on the economic outlook and to make no change to the asset purchase program   announced in November  Thus, a statement along the lines of alternative B would   probably have little effect on asset prices   The Committee may be concerned, however, that the run-up in longer-term   interest rates over the intermeeting period could damp household and business   spending significantly, and that the proposed fiscal agreement is likely to have only a   modest and temporary effect on economic activity  If so, members might be inclined   to increase the size of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings by a total of   $800 billion—$200 billion more than announced in November, as in alternative A,   page 2  Even if members think that the economic outlook improved noticeably over   the period, they may still anticipate that unemployment will decline only very   gradually  Moreover, they may be concerned that underlying inflation has continued   to trend downward, heightening the risk that adverse shocks could lead to deflation   and a protracted period of extremely poor economic performance   The description of the economy under alternative A would be quite similar to that   under alternative B  But the second paragraph would note that measures of   underlying inflation are “low,” not just “somewhat low,” and that progress towards   the Committee’s objectives “remains disappointingly slow”  The third paragraph   would note the larger increase in the size of the SOMA portfolio intended under this   alternative  And the fourth paragraph would provide more explicit forward guidance   about the federal funds rate, indicating that the Committee anticipates economic   conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at   least through mid-2012  Given the rise in market-based measures of the expected   path for the federal funds rate and the apparent increase in uncertainty about future   short-term interest rates, the firmer guidance included in alternative A could be seen   as an effort to better align the markets’ policy expectations with those of the   Committee  Of course, this change in the forward guidance could be combined with   one of the other alternatives as well   A decision at this meeting to increase further the intended size of the Federal   Reserve’s securities holdings would come as a surprise to market participants    Combined with the strengthened forward guidance in paragraph 4, this announcement   would promote a downward shift in the expected path of the federal funds rate and a   reduction in longer-term interest rates  Stock prices would likely rise, and the foreign   exchange value of the dollar would likely decline  These effects could be sizable, as   market participants would likely read this decision as indicating a greater willingness   on the part of the Committee to use asset purchases to provide stimulus than had been   anticipated   December 14, 2010 78 of 127             The Committee may have read the incoming data over the intermeeting period, as   well as the proposed fiscal agreement, as suggesting a significantly stronger outlook   for economic growth and employment and a reduced risk of further declines in   inflation  If so, members may want to reduce the intended size of the SOMA   portfolio, as in alternative C, page 4  Indeed, if, in November, members had thought   that the decision to add $600 billion was a close call, then even a modest   improvement in the outlook could lead the Committee to mark down its assessment of   the optimal size of the program at this meeting  Moreover, a slower pace of   purchases could be seen as attractive because it would give the Committee a longer   period during which it could adjust the size of the program in response to incoming   information on economic and financial conditions before the purchase program is   completed                  A decision to slow the pace and reduce the intended size of the Committee’s   securities purchases at this meeting would come as a surprise to market participants    The result would likely be a further increase in longer-term interest rates, lower stock   prices, and an increase in the foreign exchange value of the dollar  These movements   could well be sizable, given the sensitivity that the market has shown over the   intermeeting period to prospects for asset purchases   Finally, the Committee may feel that, with the economic recovery continuing, and   perhaps even strengthening, further monetary stimulus is likely to have costs that   outweigh its benefits  In that case, members might immediately stop adding to the   Federal Reserve’s securities portfolio and signal a less accommodative policy path in   the future, as in alternative D, page 5  That approach could seem particularly   appropriate if members judged that much of the current elevated level of   unemployment reflects unavoidable inertia in the reallocation of labor across sectors   and regions, and so cannot be effectively addressed by additional monetary stimulus    In addition, some members may also be concerned that continued extraordinary   policy accommodation likely will lead to the development of costly macroeconomic   or financial imbalances   The first paragraph of the statement for alternative D notes that the recovery is   proceeding and that the Committee expects a gradual return to higher levels of   resource utilization in a context of price stability  The second paragraph states that   the Committee decided to discontinue the asset purchase program announced in   November and suggests that the reinvestment policy could be changed soon as well    Paragraph three revises the forward guidance for the federal funds rate to indicate an   earlier increase in short-term interest rates, and the final paragraph uses more neutral   language to describe the Committee’s possible actions going forward   An announcement along the lines of alternative D would come as a very   substantial surprise to market participants  Interest rates would rise significantly   across the yield curve, equity prices would fall sharply, and the dollar would   appreciate   December 14, 2010 79 of 127             Draft directives for the four alternatives are presented on pages 7 through 10 of   your handout  Thank you, Mr Chairman  That concludes my prepared remarks        I’m not sure they’d see it as a sequence of steps, but I think they would   see it as certainly opening the door to additional increases later on     It doesn’t change the size of our balance sheet  It changes the   composition of our liabilities   6  I will be referring to the package labeled “Material for FOMC  Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives” that was distributed earlier  The package  includes the four draft policy statements and the associated draft directives that were  distributed to the Committee yesterday                                                     6 The materials used by Mr English are appended to this transcript (appendix 6)    January 25–26, 2011 152 of 282              As in December, the staff has provided three alternative statements, A through C,  that are similar in structure, but which vary with regard to the size of the intended  increase in Federal Reserve securities holdings—an unchanged level of $600 billion  under alternative B, $800 billion under alternative A, and $400 billion under  alternative C  In contrast, under alternative D the Committee would announce the  end of the purchase program and would make other changes to the statement to  suggest that exit from the current extraordinary degree of policy accommodation  could begin fairly soon   Turning first to alternative B, on page 3, Committee members may feel that the  recent improvement in the data suggests somewhat better near-term prospects for  economic growth, but does not fundamentally change the medium-term outlook for  the economy  As Joyce noted yesterday, your latest economic projections show a  central tendency for the unemployment rate at the end of 2013 that is not far below  the central tendency that you reported in November, when the asset purchase program  was adopted  Similarly, your outlooks for inflation are only very slightly different  than they were in November  With little change in the medium-term outlook for  unemployment and inflation, the Committee may think that it is appropriate to  continue the asset purchase program as announced in November in order to support  the recovery and help move inflation back toward levels that it sees as consistent with  its dual mandate  Even if members were uncertain about the effectiveness of asset  purchases as a monetary policy tool, they may judge that unexpectedly discontinuing  or reducing the program could cause confusion about the Committee’s intentions and  weigh on household and business confidence, making such a step undesirable at this  time   Under this alternative, the changes from the December statement would be  relatively minor  The first paragraph would reflect the somewhat stronger growth in  household spending of late and acknowledge the rise in energy and other commodity  prices over recent months  The changes early in the third paragraph are intended to  make clear that the policy decision at this meeting is simply to continue the purchase  program initiated in November  As noted in the Tealbook, given the quantity of the  Desk’s cumulative purchases since the November meeting, a pace of purchases of  about $80 billion per month is now required to reach a total of $600 billion by the end  of June, rather than the rate of “about $75 billion” reported in the December  statement  Alternative B offers two possibilities here—dropping the reference to the  pace of purchases entirely or changing the words to reflect the $80 billion figure   Regarding the final sentence in the paragraph, in the Tealbook we suggested a new  version that emphasized the regular review of, and the willingness of the Committee  to make adjustments to, the asset purchase program  However, some members were  concerned that markets could mistakenly read such a change in the statement as a  signal that the Committee was quite likely to reduce the size of the asset purchase  program  In your handout, we included both versions of the sentence as options—the  first version is unchanged from the December statement, and the second version is the  one that was offered in the Tealbook   January 25–26, 2011 153 of 282              Market participants generally expect today’s statement to update the Committee’s  views on the economic outlook and to make no change to the asset purchase program   Thus, a statement along the lines of alternative B would probably have little effect on  asset prices  The version of the final sentence of paragraph 3 that emphasizes the  regular review of the asset purchase program could put some upward pressure on  rates and might also lead investors to be somewhat more sensitive to incoming  economic information, leading to a modest increase in the volatility of asset prices   If members see the outlook for unemployment and inflation as unacceptably  weak, they may be inclined to expand the asset purchase program by another  $200 billion and to provide more explicit forward guidance regarding the likely  duration of the period of exceptionally low federal funds rates, as in alternative A,  page 2  The central tendency of your SEP submissions still shows the unemployment  rate three years hence significantly above the longer-run level you see as consistent  with your dual mandate, while a majority of you anticipate that inflation in 2013 will  be below your long-run objective  Thus, you may believe that you could improve on  these economic outcomes by providing additional accommodation—a conclusion that  is consistent with the optimal control simulations in the Tealbook   The description of the economy under alternative A would be quite similar to that  under alternative B but would suggest a bit less confidence about the outlook for  economic growth  The second paragraph of the statement would note that measures  of underlying inflation are “low,” not just “somewhat low,” that progress toward the  Committee’s objectives remains disappointingly slow, and that “there are still  significant downside risks to the economic outlook”  The fourth paragraph would  provide more explicit forward guidance about the expected path for the federal funds  rate by specifying that exceptionally low levels were likely “at least through mid- 2012”   A decision at this meeting to increase further the intended size of the Federal  Reserve’s securities holdings and to strengthen the forward guidance would come as a  surprise to market participants  Longer-term real interest rates would decline, stock  prices would rise, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely move  lower   Alternatively, the Committee may see the improvement in the economic outlook  over the intermeeting period as having reduced the benefits of additional asset  purchases relative to their likely costs and so may choose to trim the intended size of  the purchase program to $400 billion, as in alternative C, page 4  Members may have  read the incoming data over the intermeeting period as suggesting a stronger outlook  for both economic growth and employment and a reduced risk of deflation, along  with an associated reduction in the odds of a protracted period of economic weakness   Indeed, as Joyce noted yesterday, many more of you now see balanced risks to your  economic growth and inflation outlooks than was the case in November  Members  may also be concerned about the possible effects of a larger balance sheet on Federal  Reserve earnings and remittances to the Treasury that Brian outlined yesterday  You  may also feel that a very large balance sheet could complicate the withdrawal of   January 25–26, 2011 154 of 282              monetary accommodation when that becomes appropriate and so could lead to a  greater-than-desirable increase in inflation that would be costly to reverse   The statement under alternative C would provide an assessment of the outlook  similar to that under alternative B but would drop the reference to factors constraining  household spending and would note that “business investment is rising”  The second  paragraph would end by stating that “there are some indications that the economic  recovery is strengthening”  The final paragraph of the statement offers the option of  providing an explicit numerical inflation objective, which might be seen as helpful if  the Committee were worried that inflation expectations could come unmoored   However, the Committee may want to undertake additional preparatory work before  taking such a significant step   A decision to slow the pace and reduce the intended size of the Committee’s  securities purchases at this meeting would surprise market participants  The result  would presumably be an increase in longer-term interest rates, lower stock prices, and  a rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar     Finally, the Committee may feel that, with the economic recovery continuing, and  probably gathering strength, further expansion of the Federal Reserve’s securities  holdings is not necessary to achieve the Committee’s objectives  In that case,  members might choose to stop adding to the Federal Reserve’s securities portfolio  immediately and signal a less accommodative policy path in the future, as in  alternative D, page 5  That approach could seem particularly appropriate if members  judged that much of the current elevated level of unemployment reflects a rise in  structural unemployment that cannot be effectively addressed by additional monetary  stimulus, as you discussed yesterday afternoon  In addition, some members may also  be concerned that continued extraordinary policy accommodation could lead to the  development of costly macroeconomic or financial imbalances   An announcement along the lines of alternative D would come as a very  substantial surprise to market participants  Interest rates would rise significantly  across the yield curve, equity prices would fall sharply, and the dollar would  appreciate     Draft directives for the four alternatives are presented on pages 6 through 9 of  your handout  Thank you, Mr Chairman  That completes my prepared remarks     That’s right   2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the package  labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives”  The  package includes the three revised draft statements that we distributed yesterday,  along with associated draft directives   Turning first to alternative B on page 3, Committee members may think that the  medium-term outlook for real activity and inflation remains broadly in line with their  expectations at the time of the January meeting, and, accordingly, that no change in  the course for monetary policy is called for  Even after the declines in the  unemployment rate over the past few months, policymakers may see unemployment  as too high and likely to remain so for some time, and they may anticipate that higher  energy and other commodity prices will boost headline inflation only temporarily, as  long as longer-term inflation expectations remain anchored  Indeed, because higher  commodity prices can also be expected to reduce real income and damp consumer  spending, policymakers may think it appropriate to leave policy unchanged in the  face of such a shock  With measures of underlying inflation still low, you may be  inclined to continue with the current purchase program at this meeting and wait for  additional information on output, inflation, and inflation expectations before deciding  on your next step  Moreover, Committee members may be concerned that  unexpectedly discontinuing or reducing the purchase program could cause confusion  about the Committee’s intentions and thereby weigh on household and business  confidence, particularly given the elevated uncertainty caused by the recent events in  the Middle East, North Africa, and Japan   As for the statement language, the first paragraph would be updated to suggest  somewhat greater confidence in the recovery and to acknowledge the run-up in  commodity and oil prices  Paragraph 2 would no longer suggest that progress toward  the Committee’s objectives has been “disappointingly slow”  Instead, it would note  the temporary boost to headline inflation from energy and other commodity prices,  and say that the Committee expects limited pass-through to underlying inflation  The  language added yesterday emphasizes that you will “pay close attention to the  evolution of overall inflation and inflation expectations”  Finally, in paragraph 3, the  bracketed words could reintroduce the pace of asset purchases as an addition to their  cumulative total  However, doing so would likely lead market participants to believe  that the Committee was signaling the likelihood of some change in its plans—perhaps  an intention to adjust that monthly total before long—that you might not intend   March 15, 2011 90 of 165              A statement along the lines of alternative B is generally in line with market  expectations and would probably have little effect on asset prices    Alternative C, page 4, might be appropriate if the Committee saw the rapid  decline in the unemployment rate over the past three months, the rise in headline  inflation, and the uptick in some measures of inflation expectations as suggesting that  the upside risks to real activity and inflation had increased significantly  The  intended size of the asset purchase program would be cut to $450 billion and the  statement language adjusted to signal an early move toward exit  Almost two years  into the economic recovery, you may be worried that the higher prices for oil and  other commodities could, in a context of very accommodative monetary policy and  large federal deficits, lead to an increase in longer-term inflation expectations that  would be very costly to address later on  If so, you might judge that a reduction in  accommodation at this meeting could lead to improved medium-term macroeconomic  outcomes  Some of you may also find a reduction in policy accommodation attractive  because of concerns about signs of potential asset price misalignments or increased  leverage in some parts of the financial system that could contribute to financial  instability down the road   The statement under alternative C would provide a somewhat more upbeat  assessment of current conditions and the outlook than under alternative B, noting that  the recovery “is strengthening” and that conditions in the labor market “are  improving”  The inflation discussion in paragraphs 1 and 2 is the same as in  alternative B  Paragraph 3 scales back the size of the asset purchase program, and the  statement would also indicate that reinvestments of principal would continue only  “for the time being” and that the Committee anticipates “low levels” of the federal  funds rate for “some time,” rather than “exceptionally low” levels for an “extended  period”   Alternative C would surprise market participants and would likely lead to an  increase in longer-term interest rates, lower stock prices, and a rise in the foreign  exchange value of the dollar   Alternative A, page 2, would also be a surprise to the markets, but in the opposite  direction  Alternative A might be seen as appropriate if policymakers have read  incoming data as suggesting that the recovery has not been as strong as was  anticipated at the January meeting or if they see greater downside risks to the outlook  for economic growth arising, for example, from the possible effects of higher energy  and other commodity prices on household spending or from uncertainty about the  likely outcome of the recent events in the Middle East, North Africa, and Japan  In  this environment, members may think that a move toward easier policy is  significantly more likely than one toward tighter policy over coming months, and that  emphasizing that the door is open to additional policy accommodation could reassure  households and businesses and so support the recovery, even if no policy change were  ultimately required   March 15, 2011 91 of 165              The language of alternative A would suggest that the Committee had not  upgraded its view of the economy, noting only that the recovery is continuing and  that employment remains at low levels  Paragraph 2 would end by noting that  “downside risks to the economic outlook remain significant”  Paragraph 3 would  confirm that the Committee “will” purchase the full $600 billion of longer-term  Treasury securities, and that it is “prepared to expand and extend the purchase  program” if needed to achieve its objectives  The fourth paragraph would provide  more-explicit forward guidance about the expected path for the federal funds rate by  specifying that exceptionally low levels were likely “at least through mid-2012”   Finally, I wanted to briefly return to the issue of tapering the Federal Reserve’s  purchases of Treasury securities that Brian raised earlier  Tapering would involve  gradually reducing the pace of purchases over coming months and, if the Committee  still intended to reach $600 billion of purchases, extending them into the third quarter   As Brian noted in his Desk report, the depth and liquidity of the Treasury market  suggests that significant tapering is unlikely to be necessary to avoid an adverse  market reaction, and that most market participants do not appear to be expecting  tapering  Nonetheless, you may find some amount of tapering attractive as a form of  insurance against an adverse market reaction to the end of purchases   There are several other issues that the Committee might want to consider  regarding the possible desirability of tapering  If it were to taper, the Committee  would have more time before the end of the program to make adjustments—either up  or down—to the overall volume of purchases if that became appropriate  However,  some policymakers may be worried that tapering could increase public uncertainty  about the Committee’s intentions regarding the size of the program and so could  prove counterproductive  The Committee also might be concerned that an extension  of the period over which purchases are completed could, if macroeconomic  conditions changed sufficiently rapidly, lead to an undesirable delay in the  Committee’s move toward exit   Draft directives for the three alternatives are presented on pages 6 through 8 of  your handout  Thank you, Mr Chairman  That completes my prepared remarks     I’m sorry  What was the decision on “unemployment” versus the   “unemployment rate” in the second sentence of paragraph 2?     If I could just point out one thing there  I think the intent when that   sentence was originally written, which I think was following the October videoconference, was   to point to the long-run projections in the SEP, which is why we picked up the unemployment   rate     So that would change if we made it “unemployment” rather than   “unemployment rate”     Another issue that you might want to think about is feasibility  The   discussion today was such that we would not have been able to get a statement out at 115 pm    So for one-day meetings, if we are going to have a press conference at 215 pm and get a   statement out at 115 pm, we are going to be beginning at 7 am or we are going to be   beginning the evening before  I think there is a question of, how quickly can the Committee get   its business done?  And if we seriously are going to have press conferences after one-day   meetings, I am just not sure there is time to do it   March 15, 2011 136 of 165                Well, there is an annoying complication  Sometimes we push meetings   back because there are meetings in Basel, for example, and people are traveling back, and so we   have meetings on Wednesday—I think we have one coming up next year     It’s a one-day meeting on Wednesday  Push the blackout back to   Friday?   PARTICIPANTS  No, no, no  Just leave it at Thursday     I think on the term deposits, the question is simply that there’s a lot of   uncertainty about the level of reserves that people will provide to us at a given price  I mean, at a   high enough price, we are pretty confident we could drain a lot of reserves, but we don’t know   what that supply curve looks like   I think another issue that would suggest that having a little more time would be helpful is   that some institutions have not participated thus far in our TDF operations but have suggested   that, if this gets serious, they would want to sign up and begin participating  We would want   some time to get the new entrants integrated into the TDF program so that there would be more   capacity as they came in     But that said, I think the basic point is right—when the market   perceives that the Committee is starting in the direction of tightening, they’ll react to that, and   you’ll see some effect in markets  How large or small that is will depend, I think, a great deal on   how that is communicated  what the statement says and, potentially, speeches, press   conferences, whatever it is around that  But it will be a moment when communication will be   very important     I guess it is not obvious to me that there would be a big difference   between the two  Either way, if the Committee was clear that it was concerned about inflation,   that it was taking steps to tighten policy to address those concerns, I would have thought the   communication would be clear, I’m assuming, and the market would react appropriately     The steps would come in more rapid succession, I agree, and I think   you could do that under either option   April 26–27, 2011 26 of 244                We were saying that the $600 billion purchase program was roughly   like a 75 basis point reduction     All of these are approximations     Well, our intention here was to follow what was done in the past when   there were changes in the discount rate and we were aligning the discount rate with changes in   the fed funds target  We had the FOMC statement and then, at the very bottom of the press   release, there were a couple of sentences saying that the Board of Governors had moved the   discount rate  So we were not aiming to do anything new here—just what we thought was the   standard procedure   5  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the package  labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives” that was  distributed earlier  The package includes the three draft statements, including the  changes that we distributed on Monday, along with associated draft directives   Turning first to alternative B on page 3, notwithstanding the softer-than-expected  tone of the indicators for the first quarter, Committee members may see the outlook  for real activity and inflation going forward as about in line with their expectations at  the time of the March meeting, and so believe that no change in the near-term course  for monetary policy is called for  Policymakers may anticipate that higher energy and  other commodity prices will boost headline inflation only temporarily because they  see commodity prices leveling out and longer-term inflation expectations remaining  stable  Moreover, because higher commodity prices reduce real incomes and damp  consumer spending, policymakers may feel that the monetary policy implications of  the resulting higher inflation are countered by weaker output and employment,  suggesting that no adjustment to the trajectory for policy is necessary   More broadly, policymakers may see unemployment as too high and likely to  remain so for some time, as suggested by your SEP submissions  And, as discussed  yesterday, a number of potential measures of underlying inflation have moved up  from their lows, but remain around 1 percent  Indeed, most of you project PCE  inflation in 2012 to be below your estimate of its mandate-consistent level in the  longer run, and only three of you see it coming in higher  You may also judge that  longer-term inflation expectations are not that different, on balance, than at the time  of the March meeting  The Michigan survey median 5-to-10-year inflation  expectations measure reversed its March rise and is in the middle of its range over the  past several years  The Board staff’s forward measure of inflation compensation  from nominal and indexed Treasury yields has fallen back in recent days and is now  up less than 10 basis points, on net, since March and remains within the range seen  since the crisis  Against this backdrop, you may believe it is appropriate to complete  the current asset purchase program at the end of June and wait for additional  information on output, inflation, and inflation expectations before deciding on your  next step   As for the statement language, the first paragraph would be updated to suggest  somewhat less confidence in the strength of the recovery and would acknowledge that  overall inflation has picked up in recent months  Depending on your assessment of  the market- and survey-based measures of inflation expectations, you might want to  soften a bit the statement that “longer-term measures of inflation expectations have  remained stable” by adding the word “generally” that is shown in brackets  With  Monday’s changes, paragraph 2 has been updated to clarify that higher commodity  prices have increased headline inflation, but the Committee continues to anticipate  that inflation will fall back to mandate-consistent levels over time  Finally, in  paragraph 3, the statement would indicate that the Committee “will complete” the  $600 billion of intended purchases announced in November  It would go on to note                                                     5 The materials used by Mr English are appended to this transcript (appendix 5)   April 26–27, 2011 173 of 244              that “the Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities  holdings in light of incoming information and is prepared to adjust those holdings as  needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability”   A statement along the lines of alternative B would be about in line with market  expectations and would probably have little effect on asset prices  However, if the  reference to longer-term inflation expectations being only “generally” stable were  included, market participants would likely expect a somewhat more rapid shift to  removing policy accommodation, particularly since the conditioning assumptions in  the “extended period” language in paragraph 4 include “stable inflation expectations”   The result would likely be some upward pressure on interest rates and perhaps the  foreign exchange value of the dollar, and a modest decline in stock prices   Alternative C, page 4, might be appropriate if the Committee were more  concerned that the recent rise in inflation may not prove transitory, believed that the  economy was on a solid growth trajectory, and perhaps also saw output as closer to  potential than the staff projects  The intended size of the asset purchase program  would be cut to $450 billion and the statement language adjusted to signal that  redemptions and an increase in the federal funds rate target could come sooner than  markets currently anticipate  You may be worried that the higher prices for oil and  other commodities could, in a context of accommodative monetary policy and large  federal deficits, lead to an increase in longer-term inflation expectations that would be  very costly to reverse later on  If so, you might judge that bringing the purchase  program to a rapid close and signaling that you intend to move toward exit relatively  expeditiously could lead to improved medium-term macroeconomic outcomes  Some  of you may also find a reduction in policy accommodation attractive because of  concerns about signs of potential asset price misalignments or increased leverage in  some parts of the financial system that could contribute to financial instability   The statement under alternative C would provide a somewhat more upbeat  assessment of current conditions and the outlook than that under alternative B, noting  that the recovery “is on a firm footing” and that conditions in the labor market “are  improving”  The inflation discussion in paragraph 1 is the same as in alternative B,  but paragraph 2 puts greater emphasis on the importance of the stability of longer- term inflation expectations in ensuring that the recent rise in overall inflation is  temporary  Paragraph 3 scales back the size of the asset purchase program, and the  statement would also indicate that reinvestments of principal would continue only  “for now” and that the Committee anticipates “exceptionally low levels” of the  federal funds rate for “some time,” rather than for an “extended period”   Alternative C would surprise market participants and would likely lead to an  increase in longer-term interest rates, lower stock prices, and a rise in the foreign  exchange value of the dollar   Alternative A, page 2, might be seen as appropriate if policymakers see the  weaker pace of the recovery of late as likely to persist, or if they see greater downside  risks to the outlook for economic growth, arising, for example, from the possible   April 26–27, 2011 174 of 244              effects of higher energy and other commodity prices on household spending  In this  environment, members may think that a move toward easier policy is more likely than  one toward tighter policy over coming months, and that emphasizing that the door is  open to additional policy accommodation could reassure households and businesses  and so support the recovery, even if no policy change were ultimately required   The statement for alternative A would note that the recovery is proceeding at a  moderate pace, but more slowly than had been anticipated at the time of the March  meeting  It would also note that higher energy costs may be weighing on household  spending  Paragraphs 1 and 2 would suggest somewhat less concern about inflation  expectations and the inflation outlook than in alternative B  Paragraph 2 would also  note increasing downside risks to the outlook for economic growth  Paragraph 3  would confirm that the Committee “will complete” its purchases of $600 billion of  longer-term Treasury securities and that it is “prepared to expand and extend the  purchase program” if needed to achieve its objectives  The fourth paragraph would  provide more-explicit forward guidance about the expected path for the federal funds  rate by specifying that exceptionally low levels were likely “at least through mid- 2012”   Market participants would be surprised by the adoption of alternative A  Interest  rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely fall, and stock prices  would probably increase   Draft directives for the three alternatives are presented on pages 6 through 8 of  your handout  Thank you, Mr Chairman  That completes my prepared remarks     Do you want “continues to” to go back in there so that the sentence is   staying the same?     That is what I was suggesting   6  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the package  labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives” that was  distributed earlier  The package contains the three draft statements included in the  Tealbook, with two minor deletions that are shown in black strikeout text, as well as  the associated draft directives   These alternatives incorporate some significant changes in language relative to the  April statement  In particular, consistent with the draft statement language distributed  to the Committee over the intermeeting period, the discussion of inflation focuses on  the actual and anticipated behavior of overall inflation and doesn’t reference concepts  such as “underlying” inflation that may not have a clear interpretation  Moreover, the  second paragraph of the statement is now more explicit about the Committee’s  expectations for unemployment and inflation going forward, and how those  expectations compare with mandate-consistent values  However, in light of the  concerns that a number of you had about providing numerical values for mandate- consistent inflation and unemployment rates, the alternatives do not cite the long-run  values of these variables from the SEP   Turning first to alternative B, on page 3, despite the disappointing data received  over the intermeeting period, Committee members may not see the medium-term  outlook for real activity and inflation as having changed by enough to warrant an  adjustment in the stance of monetary policy today  Policymakers may believe that the  weaker-than-expected pace of economic growth reflects in part factors that are likely  to prove temporary, including the effects of higher commodity prices on consumption  spending and the impact of supply chain disruptions related to the Japanese  earthquake  Similarly, the Committee may judge that the rise in inflation this year  has reflected importantly the effects of the run-up in commodity and import prices  and the impact of supply chain disruptions on auto inventories, and that these effects  are likely to wane over coming months     Looking further ahead, policymakers may see unemployment as too high and  likely to remain so for some time  Indeed, your SEP submissions show the  unemployment rate remaining at about 8 percent at the end of 2012, well above your  longer-run projections of 52 to 56 percent  And, despite the worries about the  inflation outlook that were expressed yesterday, most of you continue to project PCE  inflation in 2012 to fall short of your assessment of its mandate-consistent level   Concerns that you might have had earlier in the year regarding a possible unmooring  of inflation expectations may have been eased by the stability of survey measures of  longer-term inflation expectations and the declines in forward measures of inflation                                                     6 The materials used by Mr English are appended to this transcript (appendix 6)   June 21–22, 2011 164 of 282              compensation over the intermeeting period  All that said, you may judge that the  potential costs of a further increase in the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet  or a hardening of the forward guidance provided in the statement could outweigh the  possible benefits  As a result, you may believe it’s appropriate to maintain the current  accommodative stance of policy and wait for additional information on output,  inflation, and inflation expectations before deciding on your next step   As for the statement language, the first paragraph for alternative B would be  updated to acknowledge that the recovery has been slower than the Committee had  expected at the time of the April meeting and to note that there is some evidence of a  loss of momentum in the labor market  The statement would indicate that temporary  factors have both slowed the recovery and boosted overall inflation  The second  paragraph would note that you expect the unemployment rate to decline toward levels  consistent with the dual mandate and anticipate that inflation will subside to levels at  or below mandate-consistent levels  The third paragraph would indicate that the  Committee will keep the target for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent  This  paragraph also retains the “extended period” language, though—in keeping with the  change in the discussion of inflation earlier in the statement—it now points to “low  rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run”  as the basis for the policy rate expectations  The statement would then indicate that  the Committee will complete its purchases of $600 billion of longer-term Treasury  securities and will retain the existing reinvestment policy  It would go on to state that  “the Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities  holdings in light of incoming information and is prepared to adjust those holdings as  appropriate”   The relatively substantial changes in the wording of the statement might cause  some initial volatility as market participants assessed the new language  Taken as a  whole, however, the statement would seem to be about in line with market  expectations and would likely have little lasting effect on asset prices  Moreover, the  Chairman will be able to clarify the statement if necessary at his press conference this  afternoon   Alternative A, page 2, would be appropriate if policymakers see the weaker pace  of the recovery of late as likely to persist, perhaps because you interpret the sequence  of downward revisions to the outlook since the start of the year as signaling  significantly less underlying momentum in the economic recovery  Moreover, with  the housing market still depressed, the likelihood of increased fiscal consolidation,  and the unresolved problems in peripheral Europe, members may see significant  downside risks to the economic outlook  Alternative A would seem particularly  appropriate if policymakers were relatively confident that the recent increase in  inflation will prove temporary, perhaps because, in addition to stable inflation  expectations, substantial resource slack was seen as keeping inflation in check over  coming quarters  Against this backdrop, the Committee may think that a move  toward easier policy is more likely than one toward tighter policy over coming  months and so decide to indicate in the statement its willingness to provide additional  policy accommodation if needed   June 21–22, 2011 165 of 282              Compared with the statement under alternative B, the statement for alternative A  would indicate a bit more concern about the strength of the recovery and somewhat  less concern about the recent rise in inflation  Paragraph 2 would note increased  downside risks to the outlook for economic growth and would drop the sentence  stating that the Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of  inflation and inflation expectations  As under alternative B, paragraph 3 would report  that the Committee is maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate  and will complete its purchase of $600 billion of longer-term securities  However,  the statement would provide more-explicit forward guidance about the expected path  for the federal funds rate by specifying that exceptionally low levels were likely “at  least through the end of 2012” and would supply similar forward guidance about the  size of the balance sheet by noting that economic conditions were expected to warrant  the maintenance of the existing reinvestment policy “at least through mid-2012”  The  end of paragraph 3 would indicate that the Committee was prepared to expand its  securities holdings if needed     Market participants would be surprised by the adoption of alternative A  Interest  rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely fall, and stock prices  would probably increase    Alternative C, page 4, might be appropriate if the Committee were concerned that  the recent rise in inflation might not prove transitory, and if it were relatively  confident that the pace of the recovery would pick up in the second half of the year   Policymakers may be worried that the recent rise in inflation has extended beyond the  food and energy categories, and they may feel that failing to respond to the increase  in inflation could, in a context of very accommodative monetary policy and large  federal deficits, lead to an increase in longer-term inflation expectations that would be  very costly to reverse later on  Such concerns would seem more pressing if  policymakers viewed output as closer to potential than in the staff projection or were  skeptical of the extent to which resource slack was likely to restrain inflation  In  addition, some members may find a move to reduce policy accommodation  appropriate because of concerns about signs of potential asset price misalignments or  increased leverage in some parts of the financial system that could contribute to  financial instability     The statement under alternative C would start out as in alternative B, but the first  paragraph would indicate that firms are facing cost pressures  The second paragraph  would note that upside risks to inflation have increased somewhat before indicating  that the Committee will be paying close attention to inflation and inflation  expectations  Paragraph 3 would state that the target for the federal funds rate will  remain at 0 to ¼ percent but would weaken the forward guidance by changing  “extended period” to “some time”  While the statement would indicate that the  Committee’s $600 billion purchase program will be completed at the end of the  month, it would also say that the Committee will begin a gradual reduction in the  current extraordinary degree of policy accommodation in July by discontinuing  reinvestments of principal   June 21–22, 2011 166 of 282              Alternative C would surprise market participants and would likely lead to a  sizable increase in longer-term interest rates, declines in stock prices, and a rise in the  foreign exchange value of the dollar   Draft directives for the three alternatives are presented on pages 6 through 8 of  your handout  Thank you, Mr Chairman  That completes my prepared remarks     I think that the optimal policy run that we do in the Tealbook Book B is   coming out in a different place  If you look at the civilian unemployment rate to the left, at the   end of 2012, it’s down around 7 percent, which is pretty low, and inflation, as you say, is up   closer to 2 percent     I think that’s right       That’s right   June 21–22, 2011 167 of 282                I think the end of paragraph 1 is somewhat different as well  To my   ear, the end of paragraph 1 in C expresses a little more concern about inflation by saying,   “Inflation has picked up in recent months, as firms are facing cost pressures from increased   commodity prices and import prices have risen,” as opposed to the end of alternative B that says   June 21–22, 2011 168 of 282              “Inflation has picked up in recent months, mainly reflecting higher prices for some commodities   and imported goods, as well as the recent supply chain disruptions”  I think by parsing it that   way, it sounds a little bit more like it’s due to temporary factors, at least to my ear     Yes     One thing that could happen if policy were being implemented in more   or less the usual way is if people wanted reserves, they’d push up the federal funds rate, and the   Desk, in responding to the higher federal funds rate, would be adding reserves, and so potentially   the supply of reserves would be elastic  Now, how elastic it would be in that situation I’m not   sure, but the Desk would be aiming to keep the fed funds rate at the target level, and a high   demand for reserves would lead them to add reserves     That’s exactly the point  People would want to accumulate the   reserves, so the demand for reserves would be higher     Excess reserves are about $16 trillion, I believe, and they were at the   time of the last meeting as well   August 1, 2011 18 of 53                Well, as Brian noted earlier, our operations determine the amount of   reserves  So once we completed our purchase program at the end of June, reserves were   whatever they were, and since then reserves have moved around, but they have not increased     Thank you Mr Chairman  With the debt ceiling impasse behind  us, or at least we certainly hope so, the potential policy responses described in the  memo that Brian and I sent you are not as urgently in play  Of course, last night’s  deal could break down, and future debt ceiling battles could always raise similar  issues  Thus, it still seems worthwhile to have a discussion of what sorts of steps  would be appropriate in such cases  To get things started, I’ll briefly summarize the  possible actions that Brian and I noted in our memo   August 1, 2011 19 of 53              I should emphasize at the outset that our memo focused on issues related to short- term market functioning  Some of you noted that your policy decisions should be  made in the context of our nation’s longer-term fiscal challenges as well as the  Committee’s dual mandate, and expressed concern about the possible signaling  effects of actions taken under the pressure of events  It’s clear that the Federal  Reserve does not want to get entangled in fiscal policy decisions  That said, a default  triggered by a lack of congressional action to raise the debt limit would create  substantial market strains that could have significant consequences for the economy   In such circumstances, the Committee might well want to take steps to improve  financial conditions and so help support economic activity  In doing so, it would  want to minimize the impression that the Federal Reserve was effectively financing  government spending, with potentially adverse consequences for its inflation  objective   In our memo, we divided the possible actions that the Federal Reserve could take  into four groups, and I’ll follow the same approach here  The first group included  five policies that fall within the current authorization of the Desk and the authority of  the Reserve Banks  For those five, we suggested that Federal Reserve operations  should treat defaulted Treasury securities in the same manner as nondefaulted  securities, but with defaulted securities valued at their own market prices  This basic  approach seems appropriate so long as the default reflects a political impasse and not  any underlying inability of the United States to meet its obligations, so that all  payments on defaulted securities would presumably be made after a short delay and  the securities remained very low risk   In the memo, we suggested that this treatment of defaulted securities be followed  in outright purchases, rollovers, securities lending, repos, and discount window  lending  And on the whole, this approach appeared acceptable to the Committee   The Federal Reserve statement that was drafted late last week for possible use over  the weekend was intended to convey that view to the public   The second group of actions we discussed in our memo involved actions to  address strains in money markets  We suggested potential responses to two different  possible situations  Action 6 involved conducting reverse repurchase operations in  response to a squeeze on the supply of Treasury bills that led to negative bill rates,  negative repo rates, and impaired market functioning; and action 7 involved  conducting repurchase operations in response to disruptions to the Treasury repo  market that drove repo rates up meaningfully while the federal funds rate was  relatively little affected  The situation came close to that envisioned for action 6 for a  time, with repo rates around zero, but over the past week, as Brian described in his  briefing, the second scenario emerged; the repo rate rose to about 20 basis points on  Friday and was even higher this morning  With the funds rate up only a few basis  points over the same period, a natural question is whether the repo rate has  idiosyncratically diverged from the overall constellation of money market rates or  whether it is a symptom of broad dislocations in money markets that could interfere  with the transmission of the Committee’s intended monetary policy stance  There  were signs of those wider dislocations late last week, with rates on Treasury bills and   August 1, 2011 20 of 53              agency discount notes up significantly and contacts reporting that conditions in the  commercial paper market had also deteriorated notably  Moreover, the repo market is  about $2 trillion in size, vastly larger than the federal funds market, and a significant  increase in the rate on such transactions could have a substantial effect on broader  financial conditions  If the Committee thought that conditions in the repo market  were likely to remain strained or even deteriorate further, implying a tightening in  financial conditions that would have adverse consequences for the overall economy, it  could take action 7—for example, by directing the Desk to engage in repo operations  sufficient to maintain the overnight Treasury general collateral repo rate in the same  0 to 25 basis point range as the federal funds rate   The third type of policy that we noted in our memo was the possible provision of  liquidity to nondepository institutions if pressures related to the debt ceiling persisted  and deepened  In particular, action 8 involved providing support to money market  mutual funds facing extraordinary outflows because of concerns on the part of money  fund investors that some money funds might “break the buck”  As Brian noted, there  were substantial outflows from Treasury-only money funds last week, and efforts by  money funds to bolster their liquidity contributed to the pressures in money markets   Members may feel, however, that it is critical that money funds manage their liquidity  without extraordinary assistance even in difficult circumstances, and that designing a  facility to provide liquidity to money funds, as suggested in the memo, without  generating substantial moral hazard would be very difficult   The Committee might nonetheless be concerned that pressures on money funds  could lead them to slash their holdings of Treasury bills, pushing yields on near-dated  bills to very high levels, impairing trading in the bill market, and potentially risking a  Treasury bill auction failing  To help combat disorderly conditions in the bill market  and foster money market rates consistent with the Committee’s target range for the  federal funds rate, the Committee might wish to instruct the Desk to purchase  Treasury bills in that case  Such an approach could be seen as ensuring that the  monetary transmission mechanism is not disrupted and thereby supporting the Federal  Reserve’s dual objectives  Moreover, it might involve less risk of moral hazard than  attempting to establish a broad-based facility to provide liquidity to money funds   In the fourth group of actions, Brian and I suggested that the Committee could, if  it chose, engage in either outright purchases or CUSIP swaps of defaulted Treasury  securities  Such operations could be warranted if the Committee determined that  there was a need to increase its support of market functioning by removing defaulted  securities from the market  However, such an approach could insert the Federal  Reserve into a very strained political situation and could raise questions about its  independence from debt management issues faced by the Treasury  The Committee  could direct the Desk to purchase a specified amount of defaulted issues in the open  market, as in action 9  Such purchases would not be undertaken to influence longer- term interest rates, as with LSAP purchases, but rather to address the strains in the  trading of defaulted securities resulting, for example, from operational problems at  the clearing banks, the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, or the primary dealers   Of course, unless they were offset by other actions, such purchases would increase   August 1, 2011 21 of 53              the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the supply of reserve balances   One way to avoid that effect, if the Committee desired to do so, would be for the  Desk to instead engage in CUSIP swaps—action 10 in our memo  In a CUSIP swap,  the Desk would buy a defaulted Treasury security and sell a nondefaulted Treasury  security at nearly the same time, thereby removing a defaulted security from the  market without increasing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet   I thought I’d end by restating the questions that we distributed on Friday  First,  do you have any further questions or concerns about actions 1 to 5 in our memo,  which fall within the current authorization of the Desk and the authority of the  Reserve Banks?   Second, what is your view on the advisability of action 6 (“RRPs to Address  Negative Treasury Bill and Repo Rates”) or action 7 (“RPs to Address Pressures in  the Treasury Repo Market”)?  I would add with respect to action 7, which may be  more relevant, at what stage would you see such action as appropriate?   Third, with regard to action 8 (“Support for Money Market Funds”), do you have  views on the appropriate response to extraordinary liquidity pressures on money  market mutual funds, were they to occur?  Here I’d be interested in your reaction also  to the possibility of Treasury bill purchases by the Desk in those circumstances   And finally, actions 9 and 10 (“Purchase Operations to Remove Defaulted  Treasury Securities from the Market” and “Outright CUSIP Swaps to Remove  Defaulted Treasury Securities from the Market,” respectively) are designed to support  market functioning  How would you balance that goal against concerns about the  appropriate role of the Federal Reserve in issues related to the fiscal authorities?   Thank you  Brian, do you have anything to add before we take questions?     Okay  We’d be happy to take your questions     It’s basically flat through 2013     So the mean would move down   3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the handout  labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives,” which was  distributed earlier  That packet contains the revised draft statements that we  distributed yesterday as well as the associated draft directives   Yesterday’s revisions to the draft statements were intended to accomplish five  objectives  First, a new sentence in paragraphs A1 and B1 recognizes the  deterioration in financial conditions over the intermeeting period and especially in  recent days  Second, additional words in paragraphs A2 and B2 clarify that the pace  of the recovery is expected to be slower than was anticipated at the time of the June  meeting, not slower than during the first half of the year  Third, the change at the end  of the final paragraphs of alternatives A and B suggests that the main risk to the  Committee’s dual objectives is the weak recovery  Fourth, writing “although only in  part” in the sentence about temporary factors in paragraph B1 is intended to discount  somewhat the importance of such factors in explaining the slow pace of growth this  year  Finally, some small changes were made to paragraph 1 in all three alternatives  in response to recent information about the labor market and energy prices   Turning first to alternative B, on page 4, the Committee may view the information  received over the intermeeting period as pointing to a notably weaker economic  outlook than was expected at the time of the June meeting, but also to less moderation  in inflation  Members may see temporary factors as accounting for part of the  disappointing economic growth and higher inflation during the first half of this year,  and so continue to expect that economic activity will gradually strengthen while  inflation returns to a subdued pace  Although the Committee might now see the  recovery as likely to be more gradual than anticipated at the time of the June meeting,  members may judge the level of uncertainty about the economic outlook to be  unusually high—and so choose to leave the stance of policy unchanged at this  meeting, as in alternative B                                                     3 The materials used by Mr English are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   August 9, 2011 89 of 162              Even if they see the incoming data on output and employment as disappointing  and increased downside risks resulting from the recent financial developments,  members may believe that maintaining the current stance of policy is appropriate  given the costs and risks associated with additional policy action  For example, they  could be concerned that more-aggressive use of forward guidance or adjustments to  the balance sheet could undermine public confidence in the Committee’s ability or  will to tighten policy sufficiently if needed, thereby boosting expected and actual  inflation  Thus, policymakers may believe that it is prudent to wait for additional  information bearing on the medium-term outlook before deciding on the appropriate  course for policy   As for the statement language, the first paragraph for alternative B would be  updated to acknowledge that economic growth has been slower this year than the  Committee had expected at the time of the June meeting, that overall conditions in the  labor market have remained weak, and that financial conditions have become more  restrictive  The statement would indicate that the slow pace of recovery and the rise  in inflation this year appear to reflect, although only in part, temporary factors, and it  would note that inflation has moderated recently as prices of energy and some  commodities have declined from their earlier peaks  The second paragraph would be  revised to note that the Committee now expects a somewhat slower recovery and only  a gradual decline in the unemployment rate  The third paragraph would indicate that  the Committee will keep the target for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent  This  paragraph also retains the “extended period” language; as the Chairman noted, you  might choose to substitute the firmer “extended period” language from alternative A  here  The statement also reiterates that the Committee will maintain its existing  reinvestment policy, and it would end by stating that “the Committee will carefully  assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information” and that it will either  “act as needed” or “employ its policy tools as appropriate” to “promote a stronger  pace of economic recovery in a context of price stability”  An explicit reference to  using “policy tools” would likely be read by investors as signaling a greater  willingness to implement additional policy accommodation if economic growth does  not pick up   A statement along the lines of alternative B would be about in line with the  expectations captured by the Desk’s survey of primary dealers last week  However,  as Brian noted in his briefing, investors have become more concerned about the  economic outlook in recent days and reportedly have marked up the odds associated  with policy action at this meeting  Thus, the release of a statement like alternative B,  with a relatively downbeat assessment of the economy and no policy action, could  disappoint some market participants  Bond yields could increase and the foreign  exchange value of the dollar rise  Equity prices could decline somewhat   Alternative A, page 2, would be appropriate if policymakers view the weak  economic growth as likely to persist and see inflation falling back to levels consistent  with the dual mandate  The sequence of downward revisions to the outlook since the  start of the year, coupled with the sluggish first half reported in the revised NIPA  data, might lead the Committee to conclude that the reasons for the sharp slowdown   August 9, 2011 90 of 162              in economic growth in the first half extended well beyond identifiable factors that are  likely to prove transitory, and will restrain the pace of recovery going forward  As  David noted in his remarks, even with the somewhat better-than-expected  employment report on Friday, the labor market remains very weak  And while  inflation may not have slowed as rapidly as some of you anticipated, with substantial  economic slack and modest increases in labor costs, you may see inflation as likely to  remain subdued over coming quarters  At the June meeting, many participants felt  that the outlook was unusually uncertain and that additional information was required  before deciding on the next policy step  With the incoming data over the  intermeeting period suggesting an even weaker outlook for economic activity, some  participants may feel that it is now appropriate to provide additional accommodation,  as in alternative A  Moreover, you might feel that the downside risks to the  outlook—including a further deterioration in the housing sector, an unexpectedly  large near-term fiscal tightening, the substantial strains in domestic financial markets,  or a wider and deeper crisis in Europe—have become more palpable over the  intermeeting period and now call for some policy response   Compared with the statement under alternative B, the statement for alternative A  would indicate somewhat more concern about the strength of the recovery and a bit  less confidence that temporary factors account for a significant portion of the  slowdown in economic growth this year  Paragraph 2 would be similar to its  counterpart under alternative B but would note heightened downside risks to the  outlook for economic growth  Regarding monetary policy, alternative A would  include two steps to provide additional accommodation  First, paragraph 3 would  provide more-explicit forward guidance about the expected path for the federal funds  rate by specifying that exceptionally low levels were likely “at least through mid- 2013”  Second, paragraph 4 would announce that the Committee will provide  additional support for economic recovery by selling $400 billion of shorter-maturity  Treasury securities and simultaneously purchasing a similar amount of long-term  securities  This action would put additional downward pressure on longer-term  interest rates by removing duration from the market and so would help foster  financial conditions that would be more supportive of growth  The statement for  alternative A would end by suggesting that the Committee was willing to take  additional action to support the recovery   Although expectations may have moved in recent days, market participants would  probably still be surprised by the adoption of alternative A  Interest rates and the  foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely fall, and stock prices would  probably increase   Alternative C, page 6, might be appropriate if the Committee viewed the  disappointing progress of the recovery so far this year as largely attributable to  temporary factors or to a lower level of potential output  The statement under  alternative C would note that economic growth has been modest of late, but would  attribute more of the slowdown in growth this year to factors that are proving to be  temporary  The statement would also express more concern about inflation, noting  that firms have faced cost pressures from higher prices for commodities and imported   August 9, 2011 91 of 162              goods, and that the risks to the inflation outlook are tilted to the upside  Paragraph 3  would state that the target for the federal funds rate will remain 0 to ¼ percent and  reiterate the “extended period” language  But it would also indicate that the  Committee was maintaining its existing reinvestment policy only “for the time  being,” and so suggest that redemptions could begin relatively soon   The adoption of alternative C would greatly surprise market participants and  would likely have substantial effects in financial markets   Draft directives for the three alternatives are presented on pages 7 through 9 of  your handout  Thank you  That completes my prepared remarks     That’s right, though as you say, equity prices are down a lot, risk   spreads are wider, and I think that on net, we view them as more restrictive in terms of their   implications for economic growth     You could say financial conditions have been volatile as a way of   acknowledging recent developments     I think the intention was to downplay to some degree the importance of   the temporary factors     I agree  The last statement certainly used “in part,” and so “although   only in part” would suggest a downshift in that knob   August 9, 2011 93 of 162                Sorry, that’s alternative A, paragraphs 1 and 2?     But take alternative A, paragraphs 1 and 2?     You can’t take paragraph 3 of alternative A because there has to be the   reinvestment     Paragraph 1 in A less the “financial” sentence     On September 7, the numbers that I have show about $800 billion at the   foreign DIs and about $700 billion at domestic     I think that’s right  Just one other thought  I’m not sure that the story   you were telling depends on it being a foreign banking organization  The same story would be   true for a domestic organization in terms of its decision between holding Treasuries and holding   reserves     On the optics, I agree     Just one other thought  If you literally look at holdings of Treasury   securities and straight agency debt at the foreign banks, they’ve actually been growing over the   past year or so, right through August  I think that’s consistent with what Seth said  Some of   these institutions are being urged by their supervisors to beef up their US dollar liquidity, and   so they may be holding both more reserves and more Treasury securities     I am going to roll that into my briefing  I will be starting off with a   couple of paragraphs on that  But maybe Seth can say a few words on the IOER   4  I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for FOMC  Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives,” which contains the policy alternatives as  well as the associated draft directives  Changes in the language since the Tealbook                                                     4 The materials used by Mr English are appended to this transcript (appendix 4)   September 20–21, 2011 188 of 290              are shown in blue  We have made a couple of minor wording changes in paragraphs  A(5) and B(3) to clarify what is intended   In addition, as several of you suggested yesterday, we have included the option of  reinvesting the principal payments from agency debt and MBS in agency MBS rather  than longer-term Treasury securities in alternatives A and B  To make navigating the  statement a bit easier, we put the material on reinvestment into separate paragraphs— A(6) and B(4)  We would anticipate two effects from such a change in reinvestment  strategy  First, because the MBS would have a shorter expected duration than the  longer-term Treasury securities that were included in the original formulation of the  maturity extension program, reinvesting in MBS would likely reduce the effect of the  program on longer-term Treasury yields by a few basis points  Second, shifting  reinvestments into MBS should put downward pressure on the spread between MBS  yields and Treasury yields  The size of this effect is hard to assess, but we think it  could be on the order of 10 to 20 basis points  As a result, the maturity extension  program with this alternative reinvestment strategy would likely lead to somewhat  smaller declines in Treasury yields, but larger declines in MBS yields, than under the  original reinvestment strategy   With regard to the choice between these reinvestment options, as was suggested  yesterday, some of you may see a benefit to using SOMA reinvestments to support  the mortgage market in light of the substantial ongoing weakness in the housing  sector and the recent widening of the spread between MBS and Treasury yields   Indeed, the August 2010 minutes noted that, while reinvesting in Treasury securities  was seen as preferable given the market conditions at that time, reinvesting in MBS  might become desirable if conditions were to change  Moreover, some of you may  fear that, without this change, the proposed portfolio actions would bring SOMA  holdings of longer-term Treasury securities to very high levels, risking an adverse  effect on market functioning  However, some participants may prefer to continue to  reinvest the principal payments on agency securities in Treasury securities in order to  avoid being seen as allocating credit to a particular sector of the economy  Members  may also want to avoid lengthening the period of time that will likely be required to  return to a Treasury-only portfolio once exit begins   Turning first to alternative B, on page 4, the Committee may view the information  received during the intermeeting period as pointing to an even more gradual pickup in  economic activity over the medium run than was expected at the time of the August  meeting  Moreover, the sharp drop in consumer confidence and business sentiment in  recent months and the increased strains in global financial markets may be seen as  posing substantial downside risks to the now-more-somber economic outlook   Participants may judge that, with the economy operating well below its potential and  energy and commodity prices generally down from earlier peaks, inflation is likely to  subside to levels at or below those judged to be most consistent with the dual  mandate  Accordingly, the Committee might conclude that additional policy stimulus  is appropriate   September 20–21, 2011 189 of 290              Yesterday’s presentations focused on four options for providing additional  accommodation  another round of large-scale asset purchases, an extension of the  average maturity of the SOMA portfolio without an expansion of the balance sheet,  firmer forward guidance, and a cut in the rate of interest paid on reserve balances   Alternative B incorporates the maturity extension program; it also contemplates a  possible reduction in the interest rate paid on reserve balances, but with more staff  work on that issue on order, I assume that you will want to delay a decision until the  November meeting  Participants might view a maturity extension program as  attractive both because it should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates  and make broader financial conditions more supportive of the recovery, and because  it does not have some of the drawbacks that the other options might be seen as  having  For example, a new large-scale asset purchase program would greatly  increase the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the supply of reserve  balances in the near-term, and so may be more likely to raise concerns among the  public regarding possible inflationary consequences  A significant change in the  forward guidance might be viewed as an interesting option, but premature at this  point  Many of you suggested yesterday that you preferred to consider such changes  in the context of a broader discussion of the Committee’s policy framework or  believe that any change in forward guidance that involves explicit numerical values  for the mandate-consistent rates of inflation and unemployment over the longer-term  will require careful and extensive explanation to the public, as well as the  Administration and the Congress   The first paragraph of the statement for alternative B would be updated to reflect  the recent data  The second paragraph would add a reference to “strains in global  financial markets” as a downside risk  The third paragraph, of which there are two  versions, would describe the new maturity extension program  The first version  refers to a total program size of $400 billion to be implemented by the end of next  June, following the general form of the announcement of the second large-scale asset  purchase program last November  The second version of the paragraph refers to a  $45 billion monthly pace of transactions; participants might view this wording as  giving the Committee more flexibility in implementing the program  In both  versions, the Committee would note that it will regularly review the pace of  transactions and the overall size of the program and make adjustments as needed to  best foster maximum employment and price stability  The next paragraph would  indicate how repayments of principal on agency debt and mortgage-backed securities  are to be reinvested—either into longer-term Treasury securities or agency mortgage- backed securities   In the fifth paragraph, the statement would repeat the forward guidance from the  August statement  Although the economic outlook has deteriorated since August,  participants may choose to retain the reference to “exceptionally low levels of the  federal funds rate at least through mid-2013” because they think that changing the  date at each meeting could undermine the usefulness of the approach  That said,  presumably a large enough cumulative change in the outlook would require an  adjustment to the date   September 20–21, 2011 190 of 290              The statement would end by indicating that the Committee will employ its tools  as appropriate  That part of the statement could also reiterate that the Committee  discussed the range of tools available to promote a stronger economic recovery in a  context of price stability  That additional language would likely be read by the public  as suggesting that the Committee might well provide additional accommodation at its  next meeting   A statement along the lines of alternative B would be roughly consistent with the  market expectations captured by the Desk’s survey of primary dealers last week and  would likely have only modest further effects on asset prices—with interest rates  declining a little, stock prices edging higher, and the foreign exchange value of the  dollar depreciating  These effects would probably be somewhat larger if the  bracketed language in the final paragraph was included in the statement  And as  noted earlier, if the statement indicated that agency securities would be reinvested in  MBS, then the effects on Treasury rates would be a bit smaller while those on MBS  yields would be somewhat larger   Alternative A, page 2, would be appropriate if the sequence of downward  revisions to the outlook since the start of the year, coupled with the substantial  downside risks to economic growth and the very high costs of any renewed recession,  have led the Committee to conclude that more substantial steps to provide support to  the recovery were called for  Participants might believe that a new large-scale asset  purchase program would be more likely to spur economic growth than a maturity  extension program, especially if they thought that balance sheet actions operated  importantly through effects on bank reserves  In addition, they may feel that firmer  forward guidance would be helpful by signaling that the Committee will keep rates  lower for longer than the public already anticipated  The primary dealer survey  suggested that market participants see the Committee first moving to raise the funds  rate when the unemployment rate is near 8 percent and the inflation rate is around 2  percent  Thus, by suggesting that the current target range for the federal funds rate  would be retained as long as the unemployment rate is above 7 percent and inflation  is projected to remain below 2½ percent over the medium run, as in alternative A, the  Committee may be able to push back significantly public expectations of the timing  of tightening   The first and third paragraphs of the statement for alternative A would be similar  to the first two paragraphs of alternative B  Paragraph 4 would provide the stronger  forward guidance with numerical thresholds for unemployment and inflation as well  as an indication that the Committee expects to keep the funds rate at its current very  low level until at least mid-2014, a year longer than in the August statement  To  avoid the misperception that the numerical thresholds for policy action are the  Committee’s longer-term objectives, paragraph 2 would provide explicit quantitative  information about those objectives  Paragraph 5 would give the parameters for the  new large-scale asset purchase program under which the Federal Reserve would  acquire $1 trillion in longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the third quarter of  2012  The statement would then indicate the plans for reinvestments and end by   September 20–21, 2011 191 of 290              noting that the Committee was prepared to employ its policy tools as appropriate to  promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability   Market participants would be quite surprised by the combination of actions under  alternative A  Longer-term yields would likely drop sharply, although the decline  might be tempered if the unexpectedly large easing move boosted inflation  expectations  Equity prices would probably rise, and the foreign exchange value of  the dollar fall   Alternative C, page 6, would be appropriate if the Committee believed that  monetary policy actions taken over the past year had already put in place sufficient  support for the economic recovery and anticipated that additional accommodation  was likely to boost inflation rather than spur additional economic growth  In  particular, with core inflation having trended higher since the start of the year, and  headline inflation over the past 12 months well above its levels of a year ago, some  participants may think that the level of potential output has declined sufficiently  relative to its pre-crisis trend that additional accommodation is likely to raise inflation  further and so would risk unanchoring inflation expectations  Participants also may  prefer to wait for more information on the likely rebound from the economic  weakness in the first half of the year before committing to additional actions   The statement under alternative C would be quite close to that issued following  the August meeting  The first paragraph would be updated to reflect the recent data;  the second paragraph would recognize the downside risks to the outlook but  emphasize that the Committee continues to expect growth to pick up  The final  paragraph would repeat the forward guidance from August  However, the final  sentence of the statement would suggest that additional policy easing was not  particularly likely and that the Committee stood ready to tighten policy before mid- 2013   The adoption of alternative C would greatly surprise investors and would likely  have outsized effects in financial markets   The draft directives for the three alternatives are presented on pages 8 through 10  of your handout  Thank you, Mr Chairman  That completes my prepared remarks     To respond to that for a second, if everything played out exactly as the   Committee expected, then that duration would have to be reduced by six weeks at every meeting    Right?       It’s a tradeoff  In which case are you going to be changing things?     I guess what I was looking at in writing that down was things like CPI   inflation  The six-month change was up around 5 percent in the spring, and it’s around   36 percent in the latest numbers  Three-month changes were up around 6 percent in the spring,   and now are around 26  So those measures have come down  The PCE numbers look about the   same     I’ll look to Brian Sack in a second, and he may have a different sense,   but mine is that markets don’t know exactly how big the maturity extension program is going to   be  They don’t know exactly how we would be handling reinvestments and so on  My guess is   they probably expect we would be reinvesting agency securities into longer-term Treasuries as   well, but nonetheless, taken together, the package will look broadly similar to what markets are   expecting  I don’t think there will be a big disappointment  They will, I think, be surprised if the   Committee decides to reinvest into MBS  That’s something that I haven’t been reading a lot   about, and as I said in my remarks, we do think that would probably have some effect in the   MBS–Treasury spread  Brian, do you have thoughts?     As I said in my remarks, I think there are two  One is the Committee   might be seen as allocating credit, and you’ve been nervous about that in the past     And the other is that when it comes time to exit, your portfolio of   agency securities will be larger, and therefore the sales of them will take longer or will have to   be more rapid  There will be some adjustment to be made at the end to unwind this and get back   to a Treasury-only portfolio, which the Committee has been absolutely clear it wants to get to     Likely     That’s what I tried to say in my remarks, yes     As I said in my remarks, the reason to do this would be the sense that   the housing market is in particularly poor shape, and so providing assistance there is likely to be,   at the margin, more useful, but I don’t have any numerical exercises I can point to on that  We   had about 18 hours to think about this  [Laughter]     I agree there isn’t dysfunction in the MBS market, but the MBS–  Treasury spread is pretty wide  It’s gone up about 50 basis points in recent months  We think   that’s because with rates very low, the expected duration is probably longer than usual, so   investors are a little chary of buying the MBS, and there’s a lot of uncertainty about the duration    That spread has widened out, and this would be a way of taking a step to try to unwind some of   that widening   September 20–21, 2011 200 of 290                No  It’s simply risk that we could take out of the market     So it’s duration risk     That seems too strong to me  I think it will contribute to lower   mortgage rates and more refinancing, and that will matter  Who’s doing the refinancing and   exactly which households are benefiting is subject to question     Yes, change “these” to “its” to make it work with the brackets  You   could go back to “these” if you want to use exactly the language in there     It’s going to be “Operation Twist” no matter what you say  [Laughter]     That is what we did in the memo that was distributed to the Committee    We built in assumptions about what Treasury was up to, and looked at our program at the   margin     We’re aiming to do so, but we wanted to do so this past intermeeting   period, too  Yes, we will try our hardest to get the material out in early October so that there will   be plenty of time for people to think about it   6  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the handout  labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives,” which was  distributed earlier  The handout contains the policy alternatives as well as the  associated draft directives  There’s only one change, which is shown in blue in  alternative B, from what you saw in the Tealbook; I’ll come to that in a minute   Including the various toggle switches, the staff provided a total of nine statement  options in the Tealbook this round—I’m told by the Secretariat staff that this is easily  our new all-time record  So staff productivity is high at least  [Laughter]  To help  guide you through the options, I’ve reproduced the summary table that was included  in the Tealbook on the first page of your handout   Turning first to alternative B, on page 7, the Committee may see the somewhat  stronger-than-expected economic data received over the period as having reduced the  odds of a new recession but may continue to view the still-modest underlying pace of  economic growth and the continued downside risks as warranting the accommodation  provided at your previous two meetings  If so, members may wish to adopt a  statement like alternative B, which contains no new policy action and uses language  similar to that of the September statement   The first paragraph of the statement for alternative B would be updated to reflect  the recent economic data  The second paragraph would note the expected “moderate  pace of economic growth over coming quarters” and might indicate “downside risks  to the economic outlook” rather than “significant downside risks to the economic  outlook”  Dropping the word “significant” might seem appropriate if you see the  economy as more likely to be on a sustainable track than was the case in September  and think that the European leadership, on balance, has made progress in addressing  their banking and fiscal strains  The third paragraph would indicate that the  Committee was continuing the maturity extension program (MEP) announced in  September and maintaining the existing reinvestment policies   In the fourth paragraph, the statement offers two options for the forward guidance   On the one hand, the Committee could retain the reference to “exceptionally low  levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013” from the September  statement  On the other hand, some participants might feel that a better way to  communicate the Committee’s expectations would be to indicate that the federal  funds rate was expected to remain exceptionally low “for the next six to seven  quarters”  The latter approach might be seen as desirable because leaving those  words unchanged from one meeting to the next would, all else being equal, maintain a  constant degree of monetary accommodation  However, if the economy evolves  about as expected, the Committee would need over time to reduce incrementally the  number of quarters specified in the statement, while a fixed date such as “mid-2013”  could remain unchanged in that case     The statement would end by indicating that the Committee “is prepared to employ  its tools to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability”                                                     6 The materials used by Mr English are appended to this transcript (appendix 6)   November 1–2, 2011 196 of 282              A statement along the lines of alternative B would be roughly consistent with the  market expectations captured by the Desk’s survey of primary dealers last week and  would likely have only modest effects on asset prices  Market participants would  probably note the deletion of “significant” from the reference to “downside risks”   Alternatively, participants’ assessments of the economic outlook may suggest that  additional policy accommodation would be appropriate to promote outcomes that are  more consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate  Even after the monetary  policy steps taken in August and September, your SEP forecasts for the  unemployment rate at the end of 2013 are generally about ¾ of 1 percentage point  higher than in the June SEP, while your inflation projections for 2013 are little  changed and mostly at or below your estimates of the mandate-consistent inflation  rate  Moreover, as discussed yesterday, many of you see downside risks to economic  growth going forward   Thus, the Committee might want to provide additional monetary policy  accommodation at this meeting  The Tealbook provided two ways of doing so—by  making a change to the forward guidance, as in alternative A1, or by implementing a  new balance sheet program, as in alternative A2  Participants may prefer alternative  A1 if they judge that greater clarity about the Committee’s policy intentions is likely  to provide additional accommodation at relatively low cost and risk  In particular,  policymakers may see a further increase in the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance  sheet as potentially making the timely removal of policy accommodation more  difficult, or as increasing the possibility that the value of the Federal Reserve’s  holdings of securities could fall significantly when interest rates move higher   However, policymakers might prefer alternative A2 if, for example, they were  concerned that providing additional forward guidance about the federal funds rate  path a few years hence might not be seen by investors as credible given the likely  turnover on the Committee over time, and so might not have meaningful economic  benefits   Turning first to alternative A1, on page 3, the first, second, and third paragraphs  of the statement would be similar to those under alternative B, though paragraph 1  would put more emphasis on the reversal of temporary factors in explaining the  somewhat stronger growth in the third quarter  Paragraph 2 would reiterate that there  are “significant” downside risks to the economic outlook     The variants of paragraph 4 would reinforce the forward guidance provided in the  September statement in one of three ways  First, it could simply push back the date  through which the Committee anticipates that economic conditions will warrant  exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2014  Second,  as in 4′, it could indicate that low funds rates are anticipated through the end of 2014  and provide projections of the inflation and unemployment rates at that time to give  investors a sense of what economic conditions were likely to be associated with an  initial move toward tighter policy  Finally, as in 4″, it could provide clearer guidance  about the economic conditions that could lead the Committee to tighten policy by  giving numerical threshold values for the unemployment rate and projected inflation      November 1–2, 2011 197 of 282              On the other hand, participants may prefer to provide additional accommodation  by further increasing the size of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, as in  alternative A2, on page 5  Paragraphs 1, 2, 4, and 5 under alternative A2 are quite  similar to those for alternative A1  However, under A2, the second paragraph would  indicate that the Committee expected only “relatively modest” growth rather than “a  moderate pace of economic growth” over coming quarters as a way to justify taking  an additional balance sheet action   In paragraph 3, the Committee could choose to announce either the purchase of  $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of next September or the  purchase of $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities and $300 billion of  agency MBS by the end of next June  Participants may prefer to purchase only  Treasury securities because they see MBS purchases as risking an undesirable  distortion in the allocation of credit and as delaying the Committee’s return to an all- Treasury portfolio  However, the mixed option might be seen as attractive if the  Committee thought that the ongoing weakness in the housing sector was a critical  contributor to the slow economic recovery and so wanted to purchase additional MBS  as a way of providing support more directly to that sector  In addition, some  participants may be concerned that purchasing another $600 billion of Treasury  securities would potentially have adverse effects on Treasury market functioning   The staff also included in alternative A2 the possibility of a reduction in the  interest rate paid on reserve balances  As was discussed at your last meeting, such a  decision would need to balance the benefits of a modest reduction in money market  rates against the risk that lower rates could lead to disruptions in short-term credit  intermediation that could adversely affect the economy, for example, by accelerating  the decline in the size of the money fund sector  If participants thought that this  policy would be helpful, on balance, the Board could adopt such a reduction, and that  step could be noted in the press release containing the FOMC statement   Market participants would be surprised by the adoption of either alternative A1 or  alternative A2  Longer-term yields would likely decline, equity prices would  probably rise, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar fall    Alternative C, on page 9, would be appropriate if participants believed that the  monetary policy steps taken at the past two meetings risked boosting inflation to  undesirable levels without providing a substantial reduction in unemployment  For  example, some participants may think that the current level of potential output is  significantly below the level in the staff’s baseline scenario and may thus view the  accommodation currently in place as more likely to result in inflationary pressures  than in significant improvements in output and employment  Those members might  note that measures of overall inflation have eased only somewhat since earlier in the  year despite declines in the prices of energy and other commodities, and they may be  concerned that inflation, over the medium term, could persist at levels above those  consistent with the dual mandate unless action is taken fairly soon to reduce monetary  accommodation  They may also conclude that the current stance of monetary policy,   November 1–2, 2011 198 of 282              including the MEP, poses an unacceptably large risk to the stability of inflation  expectations   Much of the statement under alternative C would be close to the draft for  alternative B  However, the first paragraph of alternative C would suggest greater  confidence about the recent improvement in economic growth and less confidence  about the moderation in inflation  The outlook for unemployment in the second  paragraph would be slightly more upbeat, and the reference to downside risks would  be dropped   In paragraph 3, the statement would note that “in light of the recent improvement  in the economic outlook,” the Committee decided to reduce the size of the MEP to  $200 billion of purchases and sales, and that the MEP would be completed by the end  of March 2012  In paragraph 4, the statement would shorten the period during which  the Committee expected economic conditions to warrant an exceptionally low federal  funds rate by about two quarters, by indicating that the period runs either “at least  through 2012” or “at least for the next four quarters”   The adoption of alternative C would greatly surprise investors and would likely  have outsized effects in financial markets   The draft directives for the four alternatives are presented on pages 12 through 16  of your handout  Thank you, Mr Chairman  That completes my prepared remarks     I’m sorry, but I wanted to suggest one possibility because the response   was so divided, which was to use exactly the words from last time rather than changing the   structure of the sentence  It might be that the market would be less likely to notice and think   about the word “significant” if it’s in the context of exactly the same words as used before     Yes, that’s right     No, I think there’s a distinction that you need to make between the   resolution that the Committee will pass and the statement that will be released Wednesday   morning before the opening of business, which is being negotiated   3  I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for FOMC  Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives,” which contains the policy alternatives that  were provided in the Tealbook as well as the associated draft directives     Turning first to Alternative B, on page 4, the Committee may view the recent  economic data as suggesting that the economy has been expanding moderately and  inflation has eased in recent months  The unemployment rate moved down  noticeably last month, although participants, like the staff, may see that decline as  likely overstating the improvement in labor market conditions, and the level of  unemployment remains elevated  Participants may also be concerned that the recent  pickup in growth will not be sustained, given incoming information on income trends,  evidence that business investment is decelerating, and some apparent slowing in  growth abroad  Moreover, a number of you noted downside risks to the economic  outlook, particularly related to the situation in Europe  Given the heightened  uncertainty about the outlook, the Committee may want to wait for additional  information before deciding on its next policy step  Even those members who judge  that additional policy accommodation is warranted may prefer to postpone such a  step, perhaps until January, in hopes that it can then be accompanied by additional  information about the Committee’s goals and its policy framework   The first paragraph of the statement under Alternative B would be updated to  acknowledge that “the economy has been expanding moderately, notwithstanding  some apparent slowing in global growth”  The second paragraph would again note  the expected “moderate pace of economic growth over coming quarters,” and point  specifically to “strains in global financial markets” as continuing to pose significant  downside risks to the economic outlook  The third paragraph would indicate that the  Committee is continuing the maturity extension program (MEP) announced in  September and maintaining its existing reinvestment policies  And the fourth                                                     3 The materials used by Mr English are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)     December 13, 2011 85 of 198              paragraph would again say that the Committee anticipates that economic conditions  are “likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least  through mid-2013” The statement would then indicate that the Committee will  “monitor the economic outlook and financial developments, and is prepared to  employ its tools to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price  stability”   A statement along the lines of Alternative B would appear to be consistent with  responses to the Desk’s latest survey as well as with investor expectations that are  priced into asset markets  Although respondents to the Desk’s survey see a  significant chance that the Committee will alter its forward rate guidance or conduct  additional asset purchases at some point over the next year, as Brian noted they put  low odds on such a change today  As a result, the response in asset markets to  Alternative B would likely be muted   If policymakers view the information received since the November meeting as  pointing to the need for additional policy accommodation at this meeting to support  the US recovery or to address the downside risks to the US economy, they might  choose Alternative A, on page 2  Committee participants may now expect that, in the  absence of further policy action, economic growth would be modest over coming  quarters, with the unemployment rate declining only very gradually toward  acceptable levels  Moreover, some members may see resource slack remaining quite  high, with inflation likely to come in below levels consistent with the dual mandate,  and might view the risks to the outlook for inflation as tilted to the downside  With  the Committee potentially failing to make noticeable progress in meeting both sides  of its dual mandate, and with strains in global financial markets posing significant  downside risks to the outlook, members might prefer a statement like that of  Alternative A, which announces an agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS)  purchase program, extends the period over which the Committee anticipates that it  will keep rates exceptionally low, and provides additional information regarding the  conditionality of that guidance   The statement for Alternative A would indicate that the economy “has been  expanding modestly, while global growth appears to be slowing”  Paragraph 2 would  note that without further policy action, Committee members expected that the pace of  economic growth would remain modest and that unemployment would  consequentially decline only “very” gradually  It would also state that inflation risks  “appear to be tilted to the downside”    Alternative A offers a choice between two alternatives for additional purchases of  MBS  Under the first, stated in paragraph 3, the Committee would announce that it  intends to purchase a further $500 billion of agency MBS by the end of December  2012  Under the second, stated in paragraph 3′, the Committee could adopt a more  incremental, open-ended approach, by announcing that it would buy agency MBS,  initially at a pace of $40 billion per month, and that it would adjust this program as  needed to foster the Committee’s objectives  Whereas a large purchase program of a  discrete nature may be preferable if the Committee wants to be clear that it is   December 13, 2011 86 of 198              undertaking a policy action of significant size, an incremental, open-ended approach  might make it easier for the Committee to adjust the total volume of purchases, either  up or down, in light of changes in the outlook for economic activity and inflation   Members might also favor such an open-ended program if they were not confident of  the size of the purchase program needed to promote their objectives and were  interested in suggesting that they would “do whatever it takes” to ensure sufficient  support for the recovery  Under either alternative, the purchase of additional agency  MBS would imply greater subsequent sales  In an environment with rising interest  rates, losses realized on these sales would reduce remittances to the Treasury,  potentially to near zero for a time  Under both versions of the paragraph, the  Committee would maintain the MEP and its current reinvestment policies   Paragraph 4 under Alternative A extends substantially the period over which the  Committee expects it will keep rates exceptionally low by replacing “at least through  mid-2013,” which has been in the three previous FOMC statements, with “at least  through the end of 2014”  In addition, Alternative A would clarify the conditional  nature of the forward guidance on the federal funds rate by providing the  Committee’s forecasts for unemployment and inflation at the end of 2014  These  forecasts would be conditioned on the Committee’s anticipated path for monetary  policy as described in the statement   Alternative A concludes in the same manner as Alternative B by stating that the  Committee will monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and is  prepared to employ its tools to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of  price stability   Longer-term interest rates would likely move down in response to the adoption of  Alternative A, equity prices would increase, and the foreign exchange value of the  dollar would decline  However, equity prices might fall, and longer-term interest  rates might drop more substantially, if investors interpreted the first two paragraphs  of the statement as pointing to significantly weaker economic activity than they  currently expect   By contrast, Committee members may view the information received since the  November meeting as suggesting not only that the pace of economic activity has  strengthened, but also that the economic recovery is gaining traction  And they may  be concerned that inflation has not moderated as much as expected this year and see  that as evidence that potential output is lower than had been thought  If so, they may  believe that Alternative C, on page 5, under which the Committee would reduce the  size of the MEP and lay the groundwork for a move to tighter policy before long, is  most appropriate       Much of the statement under Alternative C would be close to the draft for  Alternative B  However the first paragraph of Alternative C notes that the pace of  economic activity appears to have “strengthened somewhat,” and emphasizes that  employment has continued to increase  It also describes inflation has having   December 13, 2011 87 of 198              moderated “only somewhat” despite a decline in energy and commodities prices  The  outlook for economic growth in the second paragraph would be slightly more upbeat     In paragraph 3, the statement would indicate that “To support the economic  recovery,” while helping to ensure that inflation “does not exceed” levels that are  consistent with the dual mandate, the Committee decided to reduce the size of the  MEP to $200 billion of purchases and sales and to complete the program by the end  of March 2012  In paragraph 4, the statement would shorten the period during which  the Committee expected economic conditions to warrant an exceptionally low federal  funds rate by about two quarters, by indicating that the period now runs “at least  through 2012”  The statement then concludes by noting that the Committee is  prepared to employ its tools as appropriate to promote its policy objectives   The adoption of Alternative C would greatly surprise investors and would likely  have outsized effects in financial markets, with stock prices falling and interest rates  rising    The draft directives for the three alternatives are presented on pages 8 through  10 of your handout  Thank you, Mr Chairman  That completes my prepared  remarks     That’s what we had in the Tealbook  Our thought was that with the   European situation even more uncertain, and a little more emphasis on strains in global financial   December 13, 2011 88 of 198              markets in paragraph 2, it made sense to note financial developments would be monitored as well   as incoming information on the economy  We wanted to add those words in paragraph 1     With regard to the first question you asked, those optimal control   exercises take account of whatever is in the baseline, so they would take account of the effects of   whatever LSAPs and MEP we have in the baseline  They clearly don’t take account of anything   in Alternative A   December 13, 2011 110 of 198                Okay     Sure  The short answer is that in the staff outlook the shocks that have   hit the economy are more persistent than average  To take account of that greater persistence of   the headwinds that are hitting the economy, policy is easier than you might otherwise expect it to   be  But we can spell that out     Yes     With a deal on the debt limit still not assured, I thought I would  summarize the possible actions that Simon and I noted in our memo that was  distributed Friday  I should emphasize that while the Federal Reserve does not want  to get entangled in fiscal policy decisions, a technical default triggered by a lack of  government action to raise the debt limit—or even the imminent risk of such a  default—could create very substantial market strains that might have significant  consequences for financial stability and our dual mandate  In such circumstances, the  Committee might well want to take steps to address the market strains and so help  support economic activity and keep inflation near its longer-term objective  That  being said, the Committee would presumably want to avoid the impression that the  Federal Reserve was effectively financing government spending     In our memo, we divided the possible actions that the Federal Reserve could take  into three groups  The first group included five actions that fall within the current  authorization of the Desk and the authority of the Board and the Reserve Banks  outright purchases, securities lending, rollovers, repos to keep the federal funds rate  in its target range, and discount window lending  These actions were discussed at the  time of the debt limit scare in August 2011, and at that time Committee participants  generally thought their use would be appropriate, so long as it was clear that Treasury   October 16, 2013 15 of 50    securities with delayed principal or interest payments, while still accepted in our  operations on the usual terms, would be valued at their potentially reduced market  prices  This basic conceptual approach seems appropriate so long as it seems certain  that delayed interest and principal payments will be made in full and in relatively  short order  An interesting question is at what point it would be appropriate to tell the  public of the Federal Reserve’s planned procedures, perhaps along with information  on Reserve Bank and payment system operations; if it were possible, the Committee  might prefer to wait until the Treasury was providing information on its intentions   That said, market participants have expressed considerable interest in how we are  likely to treat securities with delayed payments  It is also worth noting that  operational issues could limit the effectiveness of some of these actions, particularly  securities lending operations     The second group of actions we discussed in our memo addressed two different  possible strains in money markets  Action 6 involved conducting reverse repurchase  operations, under which we would provide unblemished Treasury collateral to the  market; such a step might be appropriate if heavy demand for such Treasury  securities was pushing RP rates below zero  Action 7 involved conducting  repurchase operations—that is, providing funding to dealers—which might be  appropriate if disruptions in the repo market drove repo rates and perhaps other  money market rates up substantially even if the federal funds rate was relatively little  affected  As Simon noted, some market developments over the past week or so point  toward the second scenario    With the federal funds rate little changed over the past week, a natural question is  whether the repo rate has idiosyncratically diverged from the overall constellation of  money market rates, or whether it is a symptom of broader dislocations in money  markets that could interfere with the transmission of the Committee’s intended  monetary policy stance  If the Committee thought that conditions in the repo market  were likely to deteriorate further, and would be associated with a tightening in  broader financial conditions that would have adverse consequences for the overall  economy, it could take action 7—for example, by directing the Desk to engage in  repo operations sufficient to maintain the overnight Treasury general collateral repo  rate in the same 0 to 25 basis point range as the federal funds rate   In the third group of actions, the Committee could, if it chose, engage in either  outright purchases (action 8) or CUSIP swaps (action 9)  Such operations could be  warranted if the Committee determined that there was a need to increase its support of  market functioning by removing securities with delayed payments (or those seen as  likely to have delayed payments) from the market—for example, if operational  problems were impeding market functioning  Outright purchases would increase the  size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the supply of reserve balances   CUSIP swaps would not  However, note that in the case of CUSIP swaps, the Desk  would likely be selling securities with longer average maturities than those of the  securities it would be purchasing—reducing the effects of SOMA holdings on longer- term interest rates  In either case, such actions would insert the Federal Reserve into   October 16, 2013 16 of 50    a very strained political situation and could raise questions about its independence  from Treasury debt management issues    I thought I’d end by reminding you that we circulated suggested questions for  your discussion on Friday  Simon, do you have anything to add before we take  questions?     TAF would be, operationally, perhaps in New York  I’m not sure how   long that would take  Simon, do you have a sense?   October 16, 2013 17 of 50      I don’t have a good answer     Right, we’d have to move up the settlement, though we thought that the   delay was one of the reasons why it helped with the stigma, because it was clear you didn’t need   October 16, 2013 18 of 50    the cash immediately, and it was an auction, so you might not even get it  Those were attractive   features in dealing with stigma  They are potentially unattractive features here      I don’t think so, or at least not necessarily so  We’d be running   operations to purchase securities  We’d go out to purchase particularly CUSIPs  We’d be taking   competitive bids  We’d be doing a certain size of purchase, and the competitive operation would   yield, presumably, market prices and revive those market prices  So I don’t think that there’s   necessarily a problem  If we bought them all, or something like that, then there might be an   issue  But there are limits on how large a fraction of an outstanding issue the Desk will buy    Simon, did you have any other thoughts?     I’m not sure there would be a big distinction there  In the case of bills,   it’s principal and interest  There are strips where you’d be picking up just coupon payments  I   think the two would be viewed broadly similarly  But again, Simon, do you have a different   assessment?     The assistance it’s providing would be by contributing to better market   functioning in the Treasury market, and that would presumably improve Treasury pricing     Not really, no  I think in the discussion in 2011 the Committee   expressed no particular interest in such a program  There are issues that our money fund experts   have raised about whether it even helps to lend to money funds if they have losses, or if you are   buying things out of them  That may just be concentrating the losses on the remaining money   October 16, 2013 21 of 50    fund investors who haven’t yet fled, and thereby giving them an even greater incentive to then   flee the money fund  So there are real questions about whether it helps, and there was a lot of   discomfort, I think, on the Committee with providing assistance to money funds, where we think   they are, in some sense, just a bad idea  If there were problems with money funds, the way that   the Committee could address that is by potentially buying bills or doing RPs to provide some   liquidity and to provide a way for the money funds to sell their holdings rapidly in a market that   might not be very liquid  That would work as well as, or better, perhaps, than a lending program   specifically for money funds     I think that’s right  But our point was, in part, that in our operations, we   would want to, for example, run competitive auctions and make our purchases and not set a price   or try to fix the price of a security with a deferred payment equal to those of similar securities   without a deferred payment, and so on  But the open market operations, presumably because of   the operational problems that some people would be facing, would affect the price of these   securities
