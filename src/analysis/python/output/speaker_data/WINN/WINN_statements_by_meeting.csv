20,1976-03-29,"  Mr Chairman, on that score how much do we really know about the impact  of small changes in rates on economic activity and how much of this [unintelligible]?  "
47,1976-04-20,"  I sense, however, Lyle, a change taking place very quickly in business  attitudes along this line  For example, in steel, they cleaned out inventory from one end of the  system to the other  They are now actually talking allocations by the third quarter in a few lines  and real allocations by the fourth quarter  They are expecting that the first quarter earnings are  not going to be too much of an improvement over the first quarter of last year, but they are  expecting to put super earnings together back to back in the second and third quarter  That’s  going to be the basis for the real plant expansion that has to come if we are going to see growth  over a period of time, and they are really talking about fantastic kinds of numbers   Now, if you get to this allocation problem, the thing that is going to be reflected, of course,  is price changes  And that’s the sort of thing that is bothersome  In the rubber industry, for  example, they are talking about 8 percent tire price increases without the cost-of-living aspect of  [their labor negotiations] that they are fighting very desperately  But [industrial customers] don’t  look for any shortage of tires from manufacturers because they all have private companies that  are outside the big four that will take over if [the unionized workers] strike, so the strike doesn’t  really pose a real problem for them in that sense of the term  The paper industry is talking about  allocation by the fourth quarter of this year    So you really get a dramatic kind of a change in attitude  But figuring what this is going to  do to price--I suspect you are going to get a swing back because everybody will scramble for  inventory with this kind of a shift that’s taking place     The other side of this thing is the feeling that we may be starting to have more trouble in  the [unintelligible] reactions--their feeling is that the comeback is all political, and they are  [now] very quiet  But they feel that they have been “had” in the last economic downturn, and  they are going to be quite aggressive to catch up, and so you see it in the cost of living effort [in  contract negotiations]  But I think in the labor set-up you are going to see an even more dramatic  kind of solution to get economic recovery  If [the unions] become convinced that things are  really good, I think you are going to see a far more aggressive attitude than we have seen in the  last several years     I don’t know what the set-up is  You know, the companies have their own  private companies  You’ve got Kelly and Springfield and all of those  And the automobile  companies have stockpiled some tires in anticipation of a strike, and they feel that these other  manufacturers can pick up the slack, so they don’t feel as exposed as you might think     [Vehicle manufacturers] have put all of their new investment into the  independents  They haven’t put it into their own companies, so you’ve had Kelly and some of  these with big plant expansions  This has been their effort to deal with some of these problems   You’ve got more flexibility there than you think     4/20/76 - 10 -             I think that is correct     Dave’s comment on the country banks showing a little more strength than the  city banks reminded me that I was surprised to discover what rapid strides the credit unions had  made as a source of consumer credit and the relative proportion of increase that has taken place  in their status as a supplier in this area  It’s the most striking change of all the groups     I concur in your recommendations, Mr Chairman  And I am thankful, at  least psychologically as well as economically, that you are required to do this every three months  because I think the scenario that we’ve outlined here on 4(a) and (b) is not likely to be very real  in the light of the changes in the underlying assumptions  I think we may have more problems  down the road to meet this in terms of rates than we realize at the present time  Psychologically I  think it’s bright news as well [unintelligible]      I got a deafening silence  With that I’ll retreat     I think this would be my thinking too     As a random member, nostalgia doesn’t enter my mind in this regard, but--     --but I have in recent years been involved with people who have this  obsession for sunshine phenomena of various sorts  And I would think that in this discussion, we  seem to be intermingling certain factors that I don’t really feel follow each other  If we are doing  this with the hope of convincing those people who are forcing us in this direction that we are  really complying with their wishes, I don’t think that those individuals will ever be convinced  unless we invite them to sit around this table and to be with us 24 hours a day  I don’t think we  would achieve the public relations or the convincing part with these individuals by doing this     It seems to me also that while the Government in the Sunshine bill is in the works, we  don’t know how that legislation will come out  We think that it may pass in its present state  We  also are not sure, if I understood Tom correctly, that it would apply to this group  That isn’t a  certain fact as yet  We still have the litigation pending  We still are not certain what the ultimate  decision of the court or courts, if we appeal it, will be     Unless we’re doing this for the sake of reducing the expenditure of time and the burden on  our staff for the immediate foreseeable future, or unless this has a bearing on the litigation that is  presently pending, I think that we’re being somewhat premature  I think we might be causing  waves, creating with the best of intentions a reaction that is just the opposite from what we  would hope for in the minds of the people that are driving toward this total disclosure     And I think that unless there is an operational [reason], or cost, or politically good reason  to move now, I would think that it would be wiser to wait and see what comes out of the     4/20/76 - 68 -           Congress, what comes out of the courts, and not do something that we may have to undo because  it’s misinterpreted by the very people that we’re trying to pacify by this action     Mr Chairman, would that leave leeway to reverse that if, after further  deliberation, it was decided to be not in our interest?  "
74,1976-05-18,"  Supposing we’d had a phone meeting last Friday, then would that be  included this Friday in your release?       Two observations, Mr Chairman  First, if you look at the oil import figures  and look at what’s happening in the Middle East, plus informed guesses, and they are only  guesses, of the 10 percent increase in oil prices with the summer coming on, you [become]     5/18/76 - 28 -         troubled in the price area on that score  Second, with respect to automobiles and their  importance in the recovery, we get reports of all kinds of 60-month credit terms being given   Sixty-month credit terms  Now, that’s showing up always [in terms of] the other fellow [giving  60 months], of course, but the frequency with which we run into this disturbs me--that it will  alter your cyclical behavior in terms of replacements here down the road      That’s right  That’s the problem     But they all talk about the other fellow giving 60 months, and the frequency  with which we run into this--they who [claim that it is happening], of course, never [give 60  months], it’s the other fellow--but the frequency with which we run into it makes me realize that  this has happened      Well, they say it’s always the finance companies  But I’m suspicious even in  terms of some of our banks of [unintelligible] competitive relationships        Just one more comment  As you look at the capacity expansion efforts, you  want to keep in mind the energy bottlenecks, with gas and some of these other things not being  as expandable as [other] plants in certain of these areas       Mr Chairman, Bruce really made my speech and so I won’t really elaborate  on that except to indicate that I think we really need to think of the longer scenario in terms of  what we do today rather than in just the short run  If we take the lower M1 and M2 targets as     5/18/76 - 46 -         suggested, it seems to me we are in trouble already with what we have built into May in this  period  We would have to be at the top of the range already to achieve our objectives, so it  seems to me that [we] are inconsistent in the way we’re trying to formulate them     I would prefer the 5 to 6 range, thinking that the market’s absorption of the 50 [basis] point  increases has been really quite outstanding  I would hate to see us get above the 5-3/4, but I’d  rather be on record as being in favor of 5 to 6 to face the issues should they develop in this  direction  And I think we have got to give a little wider spread to M1 and M2 than I’d like  purely because of what we’ve built in already in the May figures  And certainly in terms of  estimates, we are already at the top of the range  So I think you would have to have a 5 to 9 M1  range to give any kind of maneuverability     May I ask a question on that  What would that mean to the Desk in view of  what we know about the aggregates already?    "
100,1976-06-22,"  Two things, Mr Chairman  One, there is perhaps more seasonality in retail  inventories than we recognize, and to the extent that they get caught with spring merchandise,  particularly in the nondurable things, they can’t always have price sales to get rid of it in  summertime  So it takes a little time to work some of these things off, and price cutting just  doesn’t always do it     Second is a remark on commodities  I think the tremendous pickup in the volume of  commodity transactions, particularly in copper, lead, and zinc, would lead you to believe that  maybe there’s more than just consumption in that area, but perhaps we have a new international  payments mechanism hedging against gold, which is no longer so attractive to many people, and  also foreign exchange, with its greater fluctuations  And more people are turning to copper, lead,  and zinc as a way of protecting themselves in terms of international transactions, as well as  inflation and other things  I think the tremendous pickup in volume in that area is rather  significant     I have no quarrel with the sense of the discussion, Mr Chairman, and if we  are right, then the behavior is going to be pretty much on target anyway  But I think if we are  wrong, we ought to consider whether we ought to go to a money market target at this stage  because of the difficulty of extricating ourselves if we are wrong on either side  I would be a lot     6/22/76 - 37 -           happier to stay with an aggregate target than I would a money market target, even though I have  no desire to do anything but keep a low visibility and hope things will stay about the same   "
126,1976-07-19,"  Mr Chairman, I’m afraid I’m suffering from data indigestion  The new  orders data, to what extent is that influenced by primary metals?  What’s the weight of primary  metals in there, and to what extent is their price behavior distorting the figures?     What, about 10 percent?     Not about 20, not 18 percent or more?     Our second problem, Mr Chairman, is what’s our productivity assumptions  in the model?  Three percent, is that what you’ve got in there, or--     Now, is that built into the projection?  It’s not in the model, as I understand  it?     As I understand the models, they show rather weird productivity assumptions  for the period ahead     The third data problem I have is with our weekly reporting banks  I wonder  how characteristic that is in terms of the total bank data  The Federal Trade Commission data  would show an upturn in loans, you know, and the total bank data show  a downturn  You start  to examine the weekly reporting in the total and you get some really weird data behavior     I apologize for indigestion on some of these things  One comment, and  Governor Jackson probably is in a better position to comment than I am, but when you look at  the vacancy rate and some increase in rents, I think you can take some encouragement on the  multiple housing prospects, at least for next year  There is an interesting institutional barrier to  that, which is the fact that the savings banks and the insurance companies are very reluctant to go  back into this market, even though there are some other attractive deals     Commercial banks go if the others go in on the construction; there’s money  there     Yeah, I think this is true of savings banks and insurance companies, and yet  the economics are starting to look much more favorable     Yeah, they’ve been burned     The other interesting thing is that while the single-family homes are starting  to price themselves out of the market, the manufactured home, which is the successor to the  trailer and the mobile home, really looks like it might have a bigger potential with the $20  thousand to $30 thousand developments showing up here in this area  And so I think there are  some plus factors showing up here to alter our outlook in some of these areas     It’s the mobile home adaptation     And they got away from the box idea  They’ve got artificial basements to  put in     Yeah, yeah, it’s unbelievable, some of the things they do  And they’re  getting away from the trailer park idea, and they’re putting them on larger lots  And this is  altering--     7/19-20/76 - 36 -     It’s boxed in at the bottom so it looks like there is a basement, and it doesn’t  look like it’s on a block, like those today     Mr Chairman, when are you testifying on this?     I was thinking that, while we adjust to the second quarter, the market is going  to adjust to the latest reporting data that we give out on the aggregates     How do you show no change in policy under those circumstances, because  we are kind of hung either way we move  It’s kind of a lose-lose situation  If you really go back  to the second quarter, it would indicate that we ought to move a little bit  On the other hand, I  expect it would be easier to explain that we kept the percentages right where we had them  This  week’s data plus the June data are the things they’re going to look at     7/19-20/76 - 57 -     I’d stay with it  I think what Chuck Partee--     I think that, since our posture this morning was to indicate no change, I’d  hope that our short-range objectives could be in the same sort of a pattern  Therefore I’ve been  associating myself with B, pretty well as given, and [with] the aggregate approach rather than the  money market approach at this time  "
149,1976-08-17,"  Mr Chairman, the thing that bothers me is when you look at all of the  projections in economic activity, you come out with about the same picture [from each one], and  the unanimity of opinion frightens me  And I can’t say that I disagree with what’s said  But just  as a sort of probing effort, take some of the factors that we’re looking to for support [of  economic activity]  Take consumer demand and you’re struck by the average weekly earnings  flattening out, and you don’t see much kick-out of [unintelligible] settlements in areas of that  type     Take automobile out of retail sales and you get [what is] not the most exciting kind of a  picture  Automobile sales are stimulated by this extension of maturities of consumer credit, and  I don’t see how you can really project that continuing or expanding  When you look at the prices  of services, utilities, taxes, insurance, that area, you really don’t see much opportunity for the  commodity side, the goods side, to come back because it is really a quite sharp increase that has  taken place there       8/17/76 - 5 -     When you look at what the decline in the oil tariff did and the dependence we have on the  one supplier for oil, you get frightened as to what this means in terms of consumption over a  period of time  And you can’t really see too much stimulus coming in from deficits or other  items, and so are we really going to get this upswing in consumer demand that we’re sort of  looking for?     State and local purchases of goods and services have gone up from 7 percent to 14 percent  of GNP over the last year, roughly  And I can’t see much stimulus coming in this area, with the  New York City situation sort of typifying problems in that area  The solution of their medical  problem struck me as being a Band-Aid because [the hospital workers] gave up their cost of  living increase in exchange for what they think is not going [to be] any more layoffs  And I  don’t see how they can have layoffs that can come within that scope  You’ve got the New York  state court decision in October possibly affecting them  It looks like they are playing for time,  for the election, to get another solution for their problem, and so I can’t really see any big  increase in expenditures in the state and local area     In investment demand, you’re struck by the tremendous increase in construction costs   And I don’t know whether we have elasticity of demand in this area or not  But look what  happened in the postal service; they increased prices, but revenue hasn’t really gone up as they  projected     And I wonder if more and more companies aren’t looking at this in a more critical sense   On the capacity side, the steel companies are not really having a boom period, except for  automobile steel, and more and more of them are talking about pushing back their expansion  program  The utility companies had a cool summer, and so they’ve more than handled any  demand coming out of the industrial sector, and their projections now look like they are being  pushed back  Raw materials costs are going up, with some squeeze on working capital in spite  of the huge [amount of] liquidity that corporations have acquired  And with the shift in the  composition of output, with steel going down next year--[even though] the automobile industry  booms--you surely don’t have as much need for steel     And so I’m really wondering if we can expect the support from the investment side that  we’ve factored in  I’m really searching for what’s going to be the push here for carrying us on,  even though I agree with [the assessment that] I’m questioning     No, I’m trying to go to the extreme, Chuck, probing at the forecast     If you take autos out of that, what does it look like?     Related to the automobile industry     That’s right     I just hate to speak again, but this is a technical question, Mr Chairman  To  what extent are our M measures affected by the balances in branches of US banks abroad?   When we measure income velocity in other [unintelligible], we’re not measuring it only against  domestic?     8/17/76 - 18 -       Thank you  "
169,1976-09-21,"  In the housing area, Mr Chairman, I think we would make a mistake not  factoring in the home remodeling and renovation expenditures  In ’73, I understand, single  homes were running around $47 billion and home remodeling was about 18  Apparently they’re  estimating on a single home now 43 or something like that and estimating remodeling would be  30 some odd, which is a very big factor  And I understand that the changes in FHA requirements  on the [unintelligible]  I understand that this reduces the interest cost about 2 percentage points,  and that makes a difference in terms of multifamily dwellings because interest is such a large  cost in their construction, and some people [unintelligible] get 7 to 7-1/2 percent money     Yes, this is going to make a difference to multifamily construction  The  second comment I would make would be [that the] machine tool business has shown the same  lag [unintelligible] in construction as the energy area  This has been very weak  They’re  projecting a 10 percent price increase, with only about a 6 percent increase in cost, which makes  their margins a lot better  Business had dropped off for about two months prior to the trade show  in Chicago last week, and they were expecting that to be a big turn, and it happens to be in that  area     When you look back over history you can almost prove anything you want,  but [what] you’re struck [by] in the last five years, except for ’72, is the first half’s behavior  versus the second  But bear in mind, most of these dates--you go back and look at the estimates,  and we start out the month, estimates are high, and we tail off each time  Is there a feeling that  that’s going to change?     You know, if we go back to the middle of the previous month and look at our  estimates of what’s going to happen in the next month     9/21/76 - 21 -       Well, of M1     In the second half?     Mr Chairman, if I were the publisher of Penthouse magazine or any other  mischievous person, and I know that a gadget was used by the System, and then I learned from  an unhappy Telerate salesman or a dealer that it was withdrawn as a means of furthering the  alleged secrecy of what we’re doing--I think we’re sticking our neck out a mile, if after  something is in place, we pull back on it  I may see it totally wrong, but I think--     Well, that’s correct  I think this is one of those little cute situations that  could be magnified to make us look sort of bad by someone who wants to make us look bad  "
195,1976-10-19,"  Mr Chairman, I hate to be the voice of contrary opinion around here, but our  actions remind me of weather forecasters taking barometric readings in August and September  and predicting November weather  We did a very brief and unscientific phone survey of retail  sales yesterday, and I was amazed to discover about a 20 percent increase for the first weeks in  October  It was a surprise to the merchants as well as to everybody else  This is [relative to]  September figures, and this is [relative to] a year ago, and October a year ago was quite good   There has been a lot of sales effort, but there are also some changes in merchandising factors  underneath  For example, they are able to offer merchandise at $25 with a full markup that three  months ago they were trying to sell at $39  That kind of change is very significant, and men’s  and women’s clothing has been very slow [but] has moved very well in October  I’m not  predicting any boom in any sense the term, but I am concerned with the [data] lag problem that  we face here     These are up to yesterday’s sales in October, the first two weeks of October     The sample may be different     10/19/76 - 17 -     My second [question], Mr Chairman, has to do with the automobile market,  which has been basic here in terms of what’s happening to us consumerwise  I’m personally still  disturbed by the lengthening in the credit terms [that] are being evidenced as more widespread  and the interest rates that are being charged in this area     They’ve never come down very greatly, their interest rates on automobile  paper     Well--     You’re probably right, it’s going to be a hard thing to sell the consumers  when they realize what’s happening, but I think that’s something else again  But I think there’s  something also taking place, and that is that, with concern about fuel consumption and changing  the size of cars, my guess is that instead of the second- and third-car kind of a family approach,  you are going to see much more use of the leasing device as a way of providing transportation,  with people leasing a large station wagon to take their vacation or their children to school, and  not providing the second and third  So the lengthening terms and the basic underlying change  may lead to a change in the automobile market down the road that hasn’t in fact [unintelligible]  replacements     Come down, and this sort of thing providing the same transportation almost     That’s short-term leasing, that is correct  That’s right     I think I can live with the range that we specified here among the group  I  think my preference would be for the 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 short-term range [for the federal funds rate]   I am more nervous about your long-term suggestion, however, Mr Chairman    "
210,1976-11-08,"  My concern, Mr Chairman, is not so much with the philosophy you have  expressed, but you did not mention the problem of our floating base  And this is the problem  that concerns me  That we really get a double reduction as the result of the third-quarter level  versus our targets  And in view of the sophisticated nature of our criticism, I have a feeling that  if we could take as our base our targeted objective for the third quarter rather than our achieved  objective, then a reduction in the range from 7 to 6-1/2 percent would be appropriate     But it seems to me that with our third-quarter base down, we’re getting a double impact,  which strikes me as a problem from which criticism could be more extreme than I would like to  see at this time  Therefore, if the base could be the third-quarter objective rather than the  achievement, 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 I think would be quite appropriate  In view of our base problem, it  seems to me that we are indicating a reduction by sticking to the same range that we have for the  previous quarter     I think I ought to associate myself with that position, Mr Chairman, with Mr  Wallich’s     Mr Chairman, can we address ourselves to some of these other issues, if we  can reasonably in the near term, such as the base problems and some of these other issues that  we’ve mentioned?     I agree on that  "
235,1976-11-16,"  Obviously, this does not include Branch board minutes?     I’d just like to pick up Steve Gardner’s point, which I certainly share  I think  this uncertainty is going to disappear in a way that will be constructive before the trees come into  blossom in Washington in the spring  And again, we have our old cliché, perhaps maybe we are  worried too much about it at this point--we have nothing to fear but fear itself  And, indeed,  when we discover a little more about the philosophy of a new government, we will find that  business confidence will have a resurgence that will make our present projections look very  conservative     I found the Greenbook this time terribly depressing reading  It seems to me  that we have to show some concern in that area, whether you accept it or not  I would be  interested to know whether we have run the projections on the basis of the high end and the low  end of the aggregates to see what difference it made in the outcome, in contrast with the median  figure we used for our monetary estimate, because I feel flying blind is [not] knowing what the  implications would be     Mr Chairman, [unintelligible] I think my feeling would be to associate  myself with alternative A modified to the funds rate of 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 as an indication of concern  over the current outlook  The second is, by changing the rate, hopefully we’ll change some of  what I consider some of the sticky market rates and get the effect both in the short-term area and  in the long-term area, which I think would be conducive at this time     I think my preference would be to take advantage of an easing situation to move the  reserve requirements because I think we’re going to be faced more and more with [Federal  Reserve System] membership problems as [banks] look at their earnings  On the other hand, a  change in the discount rate would have a psychological [unintelligible]  Rather than  complicating the Desk management problems in a series of changes, I would be in favor of the  4-1/4 to 5-1/4 [for the federal funds rate] and a move down [in] the discount rate  "
262,1976-12-20,"  Mr Chairman, I’d like to suggest that maybe we take another look at some of  the implications of our narrowing the funds rate range, particularly what our policy [has] meant  for institutional behavior, savings flows, the profitability at certain institutions  I’d hate for us to  be caught by surprise      Steve, on that one point, to what extent do we get tripped up a little bit with  the aggregate figures, where the large corporations have really gotten lower financing demands?   The smaller corporations are really pretty shabby with their balance sheets, so really, you may  get fooled a little bit here     I really can’t quarrel with the projections, but the unanimity feeling is the  thing that bothers me  And I ask myself, is this cyclical pattern one that you would expect if you  take the scenario at this stage of the cycle, or more typical of that starting out of the trough?     But does the reacceleration come from the same forces as you get from the  start?     The second comment on that is, in the wide swings in the attitude of the  automobile industry, enthusiasm, pessimism, back to enthusiasm  I am afraid [unintelligible]     12/20-21/76 - 52 -         that might mean  They’re enthusiastic now, but there was quite a fall a while back  The third  comment I would make is the obsolescence of statistics, I think rather dramatically shown in our  supplement on savings rates paid by institutions  We’ve really had some major changes in the  past weeks on the part of major institutions cutting back on rates on savings  I think [that] brings  the [Regulation] Q situation to the fore     I’m afraid our differences are a little bit like Shakespeare--much ado about  nothing  But I’d weight it, I think, to come out with just a little more nudge to break the  institutional barriers here--the stickiness of the prime, the reluctance to lower rates in these other  areas  I think just a little more time, a slight inducement, might be helpful for the overall  environment  So I think I’d come out with a 4 to 5 percent range for federal funds and probably  3 to 7 for M1  "
288,1977-01-17,"  I’m sympathetic to Governor Lilly’s view in terms of the turnaround, but just  one word of caution on that score  To what extent are future capital expenditures related, as they  have been in the past, to local and state government activities?  We’ve put the financial position  of these firms in better shape so that they can move ahead  But to what extent is heavy  equipment and construction and all of this related to the big role that local and state government  has played--roads, sewers, hospitals, schools, and the rest of it?  I don’t see that coming back     Just to comment on the situation in Ohio and western Pennsylvania and the  problem with information, we have checked--     --yes, we had contacted the utility companies to get some feel [for] this, and  we knew that one company had real problems with gas supply  The others assured us that it  didn’t make any difference what the weather was, they were going to be able to handle any kind  of need, and at the moment they are all shut down  And a month ago, they told us--and this was  good information, you know, the top of the companies--that they had no problem, and at the  moment, plants across the state are closed  It’s a real serious problem there     Well, that’s because of one company that sold gas they didn’t have, but many  of the companies have got out and drilled their own wells, and we have had all kinds of  scurrying for just this sort of emergency  But we’re shut, there’s no question  Perhaps this is  good in the long run--that we will now, as a nation, face up realistically to some of our energy  problems, because [we] are [in a] very weak [position]  We had brown-outs across the state on  the electric side, and the gas companies are just providing a holding operation  Not operating     I’m a little bit of the devil’s advocate today  I’d like to refresh our memory  as to where we set our target three months ago, when we were faced with a pause  We were  concerned about the outlook, and we were not nearly as positive as we are at the moment; yet we  took a stand for cutting back at that time in view of our concern about inflation and so forth  It  seems to me that we’ve got a much more positive economic environment at the moment but  more legitimate concerns about the inflation problem, and therefore I think we have to make  some sort of a gesture, although I get uneasy as to just exactly where that should be  But I think  we have to persist at this time  And I would follow Dave’s advice to be a little more tolerant of  an overshoot or a miss here in this first period as a way of both maintaining a posture of concern  and target and at the same time adjusting to the realities of the situation     That’s correct     Could I raise a question?  Steve, I got troubled on your Appendix 3 in the  Bluebook in terms of your federal funds rate projection  Now, is the failure of that behavior  [mean] that higher rates at the moment would indicate a less rapid rise in the future due to the  fact that that should be projected out over a couple more years?     Well, of the federal funds rate?     The federal funds rate in the future  See, you’ve got the high rates  currently--raise the rates currently--to get even higher rates at the end of the year     Okay     Yes  I think the alternative C ranges for the Ms, and probably 4-1/4 to 5 on  the rate spread  I’m not sure that’s logically consistent     That it’s logically consistent  I’m not sure of that     1/17-18/77 - 64 -          "
314,1977-02-15,"  Mr Zeisel, in trying to assess the impact of the proposed universal welfare  payments, to what extent have you adjusted the prospects in terms of the ’75 experience, where  the ’75 payments came in a period following some declines in consumer credit outstanding?   This will come [when] consumer credit outstanding has been increasing and perhaps  deteriorating in quality  In other words we may not get the same impact this time as we did in  ’75 because of the difference in credit circumstances     Yes, and utility bills  You don’t have any penalty now, interest rate or  anything else, on utility bills, so they can accumulate without being cut off  No interest  payments, and some of those are climbing  The credit situation is not so good, so you may not  get the multiplier effect that you got before     No, but look at what happened to consumer credit as a result of ’75; it really  spurted, and then combined with these payments--     That’s right  And that may not happen     Mr Chairman, in their uneasiness, did they express any concern over the  stock market behavior?     I’d identify myself with those in support of B  I think I would take the  insurance step of widening the range, not that I advocate using it, but it’s being on record that  it’s there   "
339,1977-03-15,"  Two or three points, Mr Chairman  First, in terms of prices, particularly in  the building materials area, I just call your attention [to the fact] that home modernization repairs  are estimated to exceed new building costs this year     That absorbs building materials and workers  That’s really getting to be a  very sensational--     Yes  The second point I’d make is that the psychological impact of the  second quarter sales are likely to be quite bullish in view of last year’s second quarter sales  But  people don’t always recognize that the downturn occurred in the second quarter last year, and  then they get these sensational figures this year to get a real buildup     That’s correct  Now, [number] three--the interesting price phenomenon has  been the oil-based chemicals, [which] have been weak in price, and this has been a puzzle and  may come back quite strong in view of oil costs, for basic stock     In a quite a different vein, Mr Chairman, I have been spending some time talking to low- income people, and the underlying rage in that area is troublesome  I don’t think it’s purely the  outbreak both here in Washington and in Cleveland recently, but these people are faced with, oh,  a 40 percent increase in their rent, and their energy cost now exceeds their rental cost  Now,  food costs are really [taking a toll], in terms of this group  In addition to that, we have a  phenomenon of a cutback in governmental services to these people as a result of budget restraint       3/15/77 - 13 -           [There is] a great deal of underlying unrest in terms of desegregation school efforts in a  whole host of communities  And I don’t know whether we’re going to have to go to energy  stamps or some effort of this kind, but I am recognizing in history that revolutions occur only  when conditions are improving  The feeling of being left out is stronger than I have seen in a  long period of time  This troubles me  It in no way depreciates the idea of the strength of the  economy, but there is a group being left out, and they are bitter, and this worries me     Mr Chairman, have we got too short of a horizon in our view today?  How  do we face the blip in terms of the tax [rebate] on M1?  And coinciding with an underlying  thrust,  we may not get the decline after we get the blip because the economic situation may  counter the normal sort of a decline in M1 that we’re thinking about?  On the other hand, to just  be ignoring the blip--if it goes up, we lose the rate, and we have to lower them, and it’s a bad  signal  And so what I’m concerned about is [whether] we’re not shutting ourselves off in our  thinking in terms of just the April deadline here, in terms of our forecast    On the other hand, raising the question, I don’t have a very good answer as to what we  ought to do on the longer horizon  But I’m just thinking in terms of the strategic sort of a move  as to where you go on this sort of a thing  It seems to me we’ve got an awful short horizon here  in terms of policy     Now, do we ignore the blip, and then we make the adjustment?  And if you do that, and  you take the rate spread we’ve got, in the last half of the year, an awful big rate rise to  accomplish in a very short period of time  "
365,1977-04-19,"  On that same point, to what extent does a consumer confidence index reflect  pessimism as a result of the elimination of the rebate?     4/19/77 - 5 -             Mr Chairman, I feel quite inadequate in trying to assess the psychological  aspects of many of the current developments, but I feel rather strongly that the economic  underlying factors are quite strong, and we may even see them stronger as the inventory  scramble adds on to some of these other efforts here, as the inflation psychology builds to even a  greater extent  I’d be inclined at this moment to indicate some decline in all of the items, and I  would join with Mr Wallich and Baughman  "
390,1977-05-17,"  Mr Chairman, the scenario that has just been presented, and also it’s in  various [staff] books--it seems to me highly probable  On the other hand, I am puzzled by the  loan demand facet of the future  When you talk with insurance companies, their backlogs are  going down, not up  And this doesn’t look like robust demand  Second, some of the financing     5/17/77 - 2 -           they are doing [arises from] the fact that some people feel that interest rates are a little low, and  they are refinancing their position to take advantage of the interest rate, and that money is not  going to [be] constructive for future expansion  The bank demand, as I see it, is in part the  inventory buildup that is going on currently, and beyond that, we’ve got mortgages and  installment credit, some agricultural demand, but not a heavy push toward expansion     And the thing that troubles me is, are we seeing a little inventory cycle at the moment,  occasioned by the bad winter weather of the first two months?  And the plant and equipment  expansion plans and that sort of thing seem to me heavily related to automobiles  If you take the  utility component out of it, in this sense of the term, and with the feeling that businesses have  developed ways of using existing plant and the machine tools they’re putting in--[they are]  providing fantastic increases in output for the capital investment  And are we really going to get  the pickup in the investment sector that we need in terms of the continuation in output?  I just  raise a questions mark, particularly if you look at the lack of financing plans for this sort of  expansion       Mr Chairman, there is another side of this that I think is sometimes  overlooked  We pay attention to the behavior of the stock market, that is, what it does to  people’s attitudes and their spending plans and so forth  But when we take a look at the financial  assets of the consumer, we forget the changes in market value that have taken place in this real  estate area  And some of the debt-equity ratios really are quite a great deal better for the time  being if you take market values than when you take costs on some of these things  And it affects  the consumer’s willingness to spend because of the fact that the values have gone way up and  [they’re used] to borrow again rather than to sell or something of that kind  So there is another  side of this value change that I think is important, frankly       Mr Chairman, I’d like to associate myself with the description provided by  Chuck in what we should be doing  The demand for credit, particularly for the large commercial  and industrial borrower, is the thing that gives me pause at the moment  I guess if we hadn’t had  our blip in the money supply, we’d have been closer to a cut in the prime than the increase that  occurred  And the uncertainty with respect to future demand gives me pause about the outlook   And in terms of the way we’ve had to revise our numbers, looking back, the blip may not be  quite the blip that we think it is  Yet, at the moment, I would tend to say, steady as you go  If  the numbers come in again adversely, I’d be prepared to move upward, but until we have a little  more confidence, I’d be inclined to hold as Chuck suggested   "
427,1977-06-21,"  Two brief comments, Mr Chairman  First, in terms of our capacity  measures  I’m quite impressed, on the one hand, with what industry has been able to do with  some small retooling in terms of dramatically increasing the capacity of output for their plants   And so part of the new technology is just being factored [in] as the pickup occurs now in  machinery orders and some of these things  So this is one thing to sort of take a look at, that we  are getting tremendous output potential from very small increases in investment, a result of new  technology     On the other hand, the amount of real investment that has to come in our mining, coal, and  other areas is just almost beyond imagination  And some of this is starting  The highly  dramatized labor difficulties in coal haven’t really led to an awful lot of inventory building up   Normally, you would think that would occur rather rapidly  Coal prices are firming, and their  outlook is good  But the transportation investment is very real, it’s resulting in changes in the  location of coal  Instead of Duluth being a mining center, it may be a coaling center     The third comment I’d like to make is, in Ohio the agricultural situation is not nearly as  good as in other parts of the country  The drought this year, and the freeze, which affect the fruit  crops and other things, added a little bit of pessimism into the air   [Report on domestic open market operations]     Mr Chairman, these are mighty small difference we are talking about  I  think [if] our posture could be steady as you go, we probably are in the best position  I think I  would prefer the B, money market directive     No  "
454,1977-07-19,"  Could I piggyback on this for just a minute?  I wonder if we are not seeing a  structural change in the ratio as a result of many of these firms having been burned on the  inventory problems  And while we’ve talked about this for a long time, [a] number of companies  have really increased their computer control of their activities, and some of the major retailers  [are] among them in this category  [Perhaps we are] seeing really drastic changes in what they  consider normal inventory-sales relationships, and following the historical series may be  misleading in terms of what they regard as the adequacy or inadequacy     So have I  But when you look at what some of these major stores have done,  you really get impressed  They are seeing rather dramatic changes--     Yes, well, even the last two years--     My question has been answered     Mr Chairman, I’d like to emphasize the point John Balles made  In our area,  the banks are actively soliciting the transfer of corporate accounts from demand deposits to the  savings account  For example, a company keeping an average $80,000 demand deposit is being  encouraged to shift $79,000 over to a savings account, [leaving] a $1,000 demand balance with  telephone transfers back and forth to meet the need  And that’s a structural change of real  magnitude  They’re being solicited--as they say, the NOW account is available to the  corporation  It may not be available to the individual  But that’s a structural change of some  magnitude, and I think that that’s going to continue here in the period ahead, and so I’d be in  favor--[because of] both the base drift and structural change--of going 4 to 6 for the M1  And  then following the C category for the M2 and M3     I can [associate] myself with that, too  "
483,1977-08-16,"  Was I the recording secretary?  Maybe I missed my role in this setup  I’m  not sure that I’m summarizing our meeting, Dave, but I have been impressed that the press  sometimes influences the thinking of businessmen [more] than their own appraisal of what’s  happened to them  I was interested particularly--when we were sort of probing with the steel  people, and they said, “Well, business is quite good but profits aren’t  But the order rate and the  tonnage and other factors are really quite good”  Now I don’t know how much of this is due to  the fact that the ore people are out on strike and it’s thought that the coal people will be out on  strike, but they have--     Earningswise--      But the volume is surprisingly good     Well, they hope to turn it around, of course  But if you don’t have volume  either, then you’ve really got problems     8/16/77 - 4 -             When you sort of probe--you can’t rent warehouse space, for example, across  the country  And part of this is this inventory increase, but there haven’t been any warehouses  built for the last three years or so  And my guess is that, if sales continue to grow, you’re going  to see a big move in this direction     Second, there are five major buildings downtown in Cleveland that will be going on the  board here in the next six to eight months  There are talks of office construction across this  country in various spots  And apartment [construction] is just on the horizon  But very little  available space  And with some change in rents and other factors, I think you’re going to see a  rather major move in the construction of multifamily homes  [To] pick up on what’s happening  in terms of the housing factor, I can’t see growing from this level, but probably it will hold on  this sort of basis  But I--     Yes  One of them is a state building; Standard Oil; the two banks; and a  private development     Just one  And so this is really a major change in the construction outlook, in  this sense of the term  They are all cautious when they talk to you in one sense of the term, but  you probe about their own business and it is surprisingly good     All of them are well fixed financially  They’ve really protected themselves  against the squeeze, so you’re going to get the expansion without going back into the financial  market  Their positions will take care of it     A question and a comment, Mr Chairman  We’re finishing the third year of  an automobile boom which has characteristically run in the threes  Now I don’t know whether  the change in the financing and the possibility that next year is the last year of the large car may  help sustain that to a fourth year  But if you go back in history, at the end of the three years of  successive increase--I don’t know, Bob, whether you have any feeling on the automobile market,  but their inventories are in pretty good shape     Yes     Yep  [unintelligible] term ’75 to ’77 is the end of the three-year cycle     A comment on the [stock] market, Mr Chairman  You’ve had the first boom in the early  ’70s; it was an individual boom  The second one was an institutional market  I have a feeling  that now you’ve got an insider market--that explains part of this sloppiness and a very great--     8/16/77 - 16 -             My guess is that a very much larger proportion of trading is done by people  that used to be on the floor and have gone upstairs and are trading among themselves  The  market itself is in very much disarray [as an] organization and you’ve got strange--I don’t know  all the answers to this, and the market is concerned about it, but they’re not willing to spend the  money to find out  A large part of the margin credit, I suspect, is insiders tied into the option  setup, and that’s a more explosive thing than I think any of us realize, what’s involved in this  leveraging  But a greater proportion of the trading is done by what I would call the professional  trader rather than the individual or the institution     Peter, do we have any feeling as to what the foreign sellers were doing with  the proceeds of sales of bills?     Mr Chairman, I have been studying the new math here, too, this morning,  and I must confess the relationship between the funds rate and ranges we have been given either  have no meaning or we are in a strange posture  Because should we pick the 0 to 6 as our range  for M1--that’s a median point of 3, which as I understand it would really call for a [6-3/4 to 7-1/4  percent funds rate] range  It’s just that if you got a 4 median, then you’ve got a 6  A 3-1/2 gives  you 6-1/2, and then a 3 median would give you 7 as the midpoint of the range, generally     So if we are going to be consistent at all, maybe we shouldn’t be, but it  seems to me that the relationship between the funds rate we are talking about and the quantities  we are talking about are inconsistent with the first presentation we had here this morning      I understand     8/16/77 - 46 -             I understand     Yes  Well, that’s a probably an accurate one  But I wanted to show what our  consistency would be--the 0 to 6 with a midpoint of 3 would give you a much higher funds rate  direction than we are showing here  My own feeling would be, stay with the B numbers and  quantities, spread the fed funds rate range to 5-1/2 to 6-1/2, with the realization that we would be  outside before we made our moves     I would take advantage of the market acceptance of what we’ve done and be prepared to  move the discount rate by a half [point]  I think we shouldn’t reward our sharp-pencil friends  who are taking advantage of us at the moment, not extensively, but I’m not sure this is the way  we ought to pass out the rewards  And I would like to see that [discount] rate moved first before  we did much to tamper with the funds rate above the 6 area, and see if we get any impact from  the first move  If we’re wrong, I’m prepared to move it down     I think it shows great flexibility in the quantities we get  We’ve been very successful  [with] the upward range, with a relatively [strong] market confidence being shown in it, and I’d  be prepared to push that if necessary with the discount rate moving first  And I’m like Mr  Kimbrel--I would have done it last week rather than this week, but that’s neither here nor there     A half, that’s right  And you’ve still got a differential there of 1/4 point   You don’t really have any market impact, except for a psychological impact showing that we’re  resolved to continue our fighting in this direction  And I’d be prepared to move that first before  I’d move the funds rate above 6, because I do think we need time to see that the impact has  worked its way through  But I’d keep the funds range there if we need it, and if we go out of  control again, I think you know the confidence that we built up can be lost just as quickly  "
509,1977-09-20,"  Mr Chairman, the two big uncertainties that hang over the forecast as far as  I’m concerned are with respect to the energy bill and with respect to the tax bill  The unknowns  in the energy bill have really held up major investments in transportation, mining, a whole series  of activities that really would give a tremendous impact if they could be unleashed  The whole  electric utility company construction [sector] has really kind of ground to a halt here  The bill  seems to be deteriorating as it goes through  I get more questions about this in certain sectors     And then the unknowns in terms of the tax bill really are showing up in investment  decisions, both financial and real, and I don’t have any idea when that’s going to be clarified     But those could be two major impacts to affect our projection  Some concreteness could  be added to this, and I gather you haven’t factored it into your fiscal projections or anything else  in terms of looking ahead     Yes     And I haven’t any idea how that’s going to come out, but there’s really more  discussion of this in terms of the consumer sector, the capital gains area, and a stimulus for  investment; and these are going to be major developments to affect the outlook       9/20/77 - 16 -   The third thing I’d mention is the status of the steel industry  Business is really better than  they talk about, in terms of their physical volume  [But] the profits are terribly poor  They are  facing up to fact that they have a very obsolete plant  And yet funds to provide the investment,  the incentive to provide the investments, and so on--now they are focusing completely on the  import situation, but I really don’t think that’s addressing some of the basic problems they have   The threats of really major shutdowns in Youngstown, Cleveland, and other places are very real   And as you know, there have been substantial cutbacks in employment in this area  So the fact  that the picture looks as good as it does [despite] some of these negative factors, I think is really  an underlying source of strength     Mr Chairman, thank you  To try to resolve the conflicting forces that we are  dealing with, and at the same time as a historian looking at our records, I had trouble getting  away from last month’s actions, with the economy not being that much different in outlook from  what we had  And so I would recommend an M1 range of 0 to 7, indicating some change,  recognizing reality  Keep a 3 to 8 or 8-1/2 on the M2 again, thinking of last month’s actions   And go to 6 to 6-1/2 [federal funds rate] [with a] 6-1/4 median, with the opportunity to use that  in the period if these ranges are not met  "
535,1977-10-17,"  Mr Truman, what element have you factored in with respect to the challenge  of steel dumping?  The possibility of some change being--     The last 30 days has seen a marked upturn in demands for motels, hotels,  office buildings, apartment houses in the insurance industries  Demand really has gone up  A  shortage, which we don’t talk much about, is the fact that the union bottlenecks with respect to  electricians, pipe fitters, plumbers, and that sort of thing  Before anything is started in  Cleveland, they’re reporting now that they’re fully employed  They’ve had a big hiatus, a lot of  people have dropped out of the unions, and you’ve got a big bottleneck here in the labor factor in  terms of construction     To a degree, but it’s always at a price and slow, and they’ve got some  problems--they shifted off in different areas  Our unemployment figures are very deceptive   There’s a big structural problem that’s not going to be cured by pouring money in there  And  then some of the other shortages--I think they’re going to take time to work themselves out     In the ghetto housing area, there’s real problems  We’ve used the mortgage device, I  think, quite foolishly, and we’ve financed people that really shouldn’t be in the private  ownership of homes  And people with incomes of $300 with 5 children haven’t any business  with $30,000 mortgages, in my judgment  I think society is going to have to find a different way  to house them, and there’s problems ahead for us, I think, in that sector of the mortgage market     Mr Chairman, just one comment on the consumer area  In the tire business,   the shift to radial tires led expansion of capacity  It’s also led to a rather high-priced tire  Now  the tire industry today is faced with big demand for tires both for new cars and for replacements   And the replacement demand has shifted rather dramatically toward the old bias tire, and they’re  now on allocation while your radials are evident  You see this, if you look at Sears and Roebuck  advertising and their failure to sell a high-priced radial  You see it with a major tire company in  terms of their sales here in the last two months  Now does this represent a shift in consumer  preference towards lower prices, or [a decision that] a [used] car that only goes 20,000 more  miles doesn’t really need a 50,000-mile tire?  But it’s a strange market      A comment, Mr Chairman  In terms of all the projections, you really  haven’t factored anything in with respect to the so-called tax revision law, or what have you, in  terms of--     One more comment  Several of our major companies in the area have at long  last released their string on capital expenditures after running overtime and a very tight ship and  all other means to avoid making the expenditures  But their demand has been so strong that they  are now planning rather major capital expenditures, and this is a change in the last 10 days     These are a couple of our major firms     Well, they’re electronic equipment and machine tools, this general area, auto  parts business     Yes, these are going to be plant expansions  They’ve done everything with  respect to improving tooling and that sort of thing to increase capacity, and they’re just faced  with market demand that they can’t meet without breaking water     10/17-18/77 - 18 -           Probably several years     Mr Chairman, I think my optimism is in part based on the hope that some of  the psychological malaise may be lifted  It’s a kind of a commentary on our times when last  week a New York Stock Exchange seat sold for $35,000, and a taxi medallion in New York sold  for $52,000  So our out-of-work brokers can’t even buy a cab  But I have a feeling that the  current market malaise is in part psychologically affecting attitudes in a whole range of areas,  and somehow I think that both the Washington scene and the New York scene may be clarified  before the year is out  And with those two lifted, I see greater strength than has been indicated in  some of these numbers  Now, if I’m wrong, they may pull down a greater segment of consumer  expenditures in some of these other areas and factor them into our forecasts     Mr Chairman, I’d like to note to the Committee that this is the period in our  discussion when time is standing still     I’d like to follow Chuck’s comments--     I’d like to join Chuck a little bit in looking backward, in the sense that we are  now making projections on assumed relationships, and yet we really haven’t accepted these  relationships in terms of the overshoot, in terms of any kind of future economic or price behavior  that I saw in terms of our projections that we talked about last night  And I think that raises  some questions for us  In view, however, of the process we’re going through, I’d like to urge us  to take a real thorough look at what’s gone wrong in our activities--that is, a reexamination of  our estimation procedures  I think we ought to take another look at our lagged reserve  procedures, and I don’t attribute a great deal to this, but maybe this is part of our problem here in  terms of control  Take a look again at our federal funds spread that we prescribe  Velocity has  impressed me as a rationalization for what happened, but I don’t find it a very satisfactory device  for estimating the future because I don’t really understand it in the sense of the term  So I think  we need to take a thorough look in this area  And in view of all the emphasis that’s placed on  the quantities, and in view of our overshoot, I think we owe it to ourselves to take a real  thorough look as to what’s happened, and I don’t feel we’ve done that     With the uncertainty with which we have factored in comments about our overshoots with  respect to future activity--whether it’s economic activity or prices, what have you--it seems to  me that we’re really focusing on the real issue as to whether perpetuating this is the right way to  go  But since we’re sort of hung with this at the moment, I would accept your recommendations  on M2 and M3  I would like to see a little recognition of the overshoot in the sense of a small  change in M1, just to indicate that we are cognizant of it  We’re really not changing; we’re  staying with what we were--all the uncertainties, but recognizing the overshoot     Mr Chairman, I am perhaps out of order, but I am concerned about the  behavior of interest rates in the period ahead and the implications of that, and yet I think we have  to react to what’s happened in the aggregates area in the past as well as our concern about what     10/17-18/77 - 63 -         the future projections would be  And I’d like to urge consideration of the use of this discount  rate as a way of buying some time, without basically changing the rate structure, [to get] a better  feel as to what some of these magnitudes would be down the road  Specifically, I would take the  B suggestions; I think I would prefer the [federal funds] rate span of 6-1/4 to 7, with action on  the discount rate first as a way of trying to temper this until we get a better fix with an aggregates  directive  "
561,1977-11-15,"  Mr Chairman, I concur in the feeling--explore the alternatives available to us  here to postpone our decision  But I join with Mark [in] a feeling that conditions have changed   We ought to think through more than just the directive problem, if this requires release, but the  implication  I have a feeling that the public interest in what we do goes far beyond the directive   And to the extent that we make that immediately available, then the whole discussion is going to  be required  And then the political activities involved in our deliberations, I think, will be highly  intensified as a result of this move  And we ought to think through what are the other  implications, not only just the directive aspect of what we release, but what this does to us in  terms of the economic anticipations behind this, and to what extent, then, you get greater and  greater focus on our activities from other groups as a result of this     Mr Chairman I think I am a bit more optimistic than the staff with respect to  the first half of next year  It seems to me the pickup in retail sales, and what we get in the field  in this area with the very tight inventory controls currently in effect, gives rise to a typical kind  of inventory cycle for next year to fill up the early part, together with the projected tax cut being  factored into people’s thinking as a prospect for keeping the consumer in our economy as a  strong factor for the first half of the year And [unintelligible] for the plant and equipment  expenditures to pick up, I think is a sobering cloud, and that probably will have to be dependent  on the last half of the year to have an impact  I think the first half of the year has a stronger  element in it than the projection     Could I piggyback on that question a bit?  Again, looking at this demand for  money and trying to use what evidence we could--using the demand deposit survey data, it looks  like consumers have been very stable in their holdings in this [unintelligible], with the very  violent swings in the financial corporation area  And you sort of scratch your head to see what is  really happening on this     11/15/77 - 33 -           Mr Chairman, I really have nothing to add  I would be in favor of widening  the [M1] range a little bit, 1 to 7--use this as an opportunity to get it expanded a little bit and stay  with the aggregates objective, not a money market  "
587,1977-12-19,"  I guess my comments are in the same direction, Mr Chairman  But it seems  to me that, with the small range, when we’re forced to move it, since we tend to be reluctant to  move until we are sure of the aggregates, that you’re going to get your next adjustment  instantaneously  And if you want to try to smooth that as a set-up, you are going to add more     12/19-20/77 - 19 -         reserves, which adds more to your quantitative movement, and I wonder if we don’t have less  flexibility in terms of really meeting our objectives  I would assume that your next step would  be up just another 1/4 point centered around the midpoint of where you’d reached  And you’d  actually get that instantaneously because the market realized that we’ve really gone beyond our  objectives in order to make the move  And then you’re going to get that, it seems to me, almost  at once unless you intervene  If you intervene again, then your quantity problems start      Well, wouldn’t you get it almost all at once this time?     Mr Chairman, in the energy area, I hope you’ll take another look at our  policy with respect to the export of reactors; that’s about a $9 billion market     But this is big for our domestic employment as well as for the balance of  trade     Oh, more than that      I think they have a much bigger figure than that     And then you’ve got $9 billion in export trade involved       That’s right  That’s all going to Germany and France; it’s going ahead     12/19-20/77 - 42 -           What about a 10 percent increase     Mr Chairman, I associate myself with being somewhat more optimistic than  the staff in terms of the outlook, with a couple of flags, one of which has been mentioned--the  automobile area  The parts people and the accessories people are not as optimistic as the basic  manufacturers in the outlook for automobiles, and I think that’s something we need to watch   The second problem I’d mention is the inflation problem, which may be underestimated by the  staff in terms of what’s happening in costs--steel, coal, and a number of raw materials are  starting to go the other direction  And then the basic Social Security, minimum wage, health  costs  It looks to me like state taxes may be going up, too, rather substantially, because of school  and other problems across the country  And I wonder if the cost-push may not hit us next year   We have been lulled a little bit by our favorable inflation experience this year, [and] this is of  concern, I do believe, as we look ahead       Mr Chairman, I’d associate myself with John’s comments, that I would be  happier if we could lower the range of the aggregates a little bit; but I find your suggestions  acceptable  I’d like to make one point, however, that we’re placing an awful lot of emphasis on  the aggregates numbers  And I must confess, I get nervous when we get a decline during a  period of rapidly expanding loan volume and rapidly expanding business activity  And  somehow, intuition makes me wonder about our numbers even more this time  And yet I have  no way of--     Yes, that’s correct  I mean, when you see this expanding loan volume and  expanding business activity, and here we are getting a negative number, which makes me--     I know, but it still makes me nervous     I know; it happened in reverse  That makes me nervous about those  numbers, too     I don’t know     I hate to interrupt, but would you care to comment just briefly on the legality  problem in the discount rate area?     It has to be corrected, that’s all  "
628,1978-01-17,"  Mr Chairman, I have several comments  First, I’d like to urge us not to get   trapped in the traditional kinds of statistical reporting--particularly in the housing area, which has  been quite crucial to developments to date, with home modernization and repair still representing a  rising and major portion of the total  To the extent that new housing starts may turn down, I think  it is crucial to know what is happening in modernization and repair because it’s really the total  expenditure in [the housing] area that determines what is happening  As you know, the figure is  now $33-35 billion in [the modernization and repair] category and I think we just ought to  incorporate that into our thinking about what’s happening in this area     My second comment is that I haven’t any quarrel with the sort of traditional kind of approach   we have for an analysis but I suspect it won’t happen that way  In the last two weeks, I have noted  perhaps the biggest change in sentiment, if psychology means anything in terms of future behavior  I can’t tell whether it’s the weather, the stock market, the foreign exchange market, newsworthy  developments, inflation, or concern about what’s happening here in Washington, but there’s a very  marked change--with people who didn’t think they would cut back on plans, planning to cut back at  the moment  Now, to the extent that [sentiment] can swing that fast negatively, it can also change     1/17/78             30  the other way   And, unlike Phil’s view, my feeling is that we may not get quite as robust a first  half in spite of the momentum we have  And if psychology changes as a result of the market  outlook or peace in the Middle East or a thousand external events that really aren’t factored into  these [forecasts], you have the basis, I think, for maybe the reverse--for the second half [to be  stronger] as contrasted with what the economic analysis will tell us here  I’m surprised and  puzzled by the very sharp change in sentiment that Mark reflected in part in his comments, but the  feelings are quite sharp and they tend to spread very quickly, as you know       Mr Chairman, in attempting to follow what’s going on, I got lost over the   year-end  Was there any change in the way we calculate these numbers?      Yes, the money supply      I didn’t know whether we lost part of the year-end in January or it came back to   December or what  I wondered what happened there  This was probably my ignorance, Mr  Chairman       Yes, maybe  I am concerned about the disintermediation as an adjustment   factor here ahead, so I think I’d be inclined to go with “B,”--3 to 8 and 5 to 9 percent [for the  aggregates ranges ] and 6-1/2 to 7 percent [for the funds rate] this month, with an aggregates  emphasis    "
654,1978-02-28,"  Mr Chairman, living in an environment in which it has been difficult to get   one’s feet on the ground for the last three months, it=s hard to get a perspective on the economic  scene that is not influenced by the environment  I don=t have any really basic quarrel with the  projection of the staff, but I would like to raise two or three questions  First, with respect to  structural changes in the financial area that impact on [the economy], to what extent has your  automobile outlook factored in the very sharp transition that has taken place [on the] terms of  automobile credit and the normal kinds of rollover?  What is happening as some of these [terms are  extended] and what does this do to debt and so forth?  Second, what is the reality with respect to  real estate financing?  Is it for real estate, or are [people] using this device now because of [more  favorable] terms to finance an expansion of consumer [expenditures] other than in the real estate  area--for automobiles, living expenses, and other things?  And third, on the aggregate analysis on  the impact of consumer credit, it doesn=t look too bad, but I am wondering if this area isn=t one  where we should know more about the individual incidences of these [types of financing] because  this is likely to affect our behavior down the road  In some places, the aggregate debt of the  consumer--if you add real estate plus the consumer debt in certain family situations--really looks  horrendous What does this means for us?      The fourth financial item I=d mention is that, while we project an increase in Regulation Q   ceilings in the future, I would hope that would occur before we reach the active disintermediation  stage  We=re having the horrible development of the so-called “honor bond” in the Midwest  That  troubles me a great deal and I would like to see that stopped by more legitimate kinds of channeling  savings rather than this device  I think this is going to rebound unfavorably on the banks and I am  really concerned about this device       The banks are issuing bearer certificates from $25 up to $10,000 or $20,000 and   [that’s where] the honor bond comes in  [You are on] your honor to report it to the IRS  They are  being sold as a way of avoiding income tax and I think this is a very bad kind of development on  the part of banks       It=s a disintermediation reaction      Banks have gone into it  They call them freedom bonds--freedom from taxes--  or honor bonds  I think it is a very unfortunate development, which is really a reaction to the  disintermediation problem  Some of [the banks] said they are competing--       On the [ones with] longer terms, they are  And they=re advertising that you can   use them as cash  It=s very bad advertising      No, on their longer terms, I don=t think there is a violation  But the rates are   what--7-1/2 percent?  And they sell them up to--      No, but it=s a reaction because of disintermediation       They say [to customers] “We don=t require your social security number”       [Let me mention] three other quick items, Mr Chairman  First, the price   developments are troublesome, at least in our area, with the very rapid rise in utility rates both  [because] of a very cold winter and the rapid increase in rates with changes in fuel sources--adding  that [directly] to the fuel bill  And increases in the telephone rates and other utility rates are  accelerating very rapidly  Second, a positive thing  The machine tool people are reporting quite  expanded interest in their activity  How much of this is the automobile changeover that=s still down  the road for us, I=m not quite [sure], but they=re having a really good year and good interest is being  shown in [terms of] future orders  And finally, school financing in the Midwest is really in serious  trouble and this may be partly a local situation       Because of tax limits and because of the inner city problem, practically all the   major cities in Ohio are faced with school closings due to the finance limitations that have been  placed on them  Local schools are $40 or $50 million in debt and they--       Well, some of them are going to have to close because of dates by which [the   local entities] can get approval for increased taxes  They got in a mess with the local banks on  short-term borrowings, and it=s a very, very messy situation, overlain in part by integration efforts  mandated by the courts  It’s the [total] school picture--school financing and higher education  financing  It is a very serious problem and hopefully the surplus can be diverted in this area       I think part of it is that, Bob      I vote for prudence under the circumstances  And I really haven=t any quarrel   with this [recommendation]  I think we ought to recognize just a little bit that our shifting base  problem is happening to us in all this, however       Mr Chairman, I have no quarrel with alternative B  I=d just like to see   something in the release indicating the coal strike as one of the economic uncertainties that we face  We have only the weather [mentioned] as a cause of our problems  And second, is there any  change in the status of the Merrill suit?       Mr Chairman, how is Governor Gardner?        "
667,1978-03-10,"  We’ve heard a great deal about our relationship with the Treasury We are also   in partnership with the Bundesbank in this  Do we have any indication of their attitudes in terms of  magnitudes, length [of time to repay], and other aspects?       Is there any feeling, Henry, that the $4 billion--or $24 billion or whatever--is  the limit to which they’d be willing to go in this activity?       Well, I share the feeling of reluctance to get too heavily involved although I   think we probably have to respond to put on pressure to get some of these other things in place   "
692,1978-03-21,"  It would be my guess that the wage settlement is really causing unrest in   public service groups, [with] other people feeling that this was endorsed here and they’re entitled to  the same sort of [increase in wages]  Second, I think we shouldn’t underestimate the amount of  time that it’s going to take to rebuild stocks  Inventories are really way down  Summer is a period  of even greater electrical consumption and to the extent they [shift] back to coal, then the problem  of rebuilding is going to take much longer  I think then people may realize that this may follow  through a little longer than one would normally expect  My chief concern, however, is in the fiscal  policy area, and this is where I would quarrel, I think, with the staff estimates  I would focus  primarily on the state and local areas  While in the national income accounts it looks as if we have  a big surplus, when you start to break that down you realize that it’s largely due to the revenue  sharing side; that is bringing in this big surplus  I see in the legislatures great efforts both to cut  taxes at the state and local level and to increase expenditures  So it seems to me that we’re likely to  find much more stimulus there than is [implicit] in the projection and I’m disturbed by the stirrings  in Congress about wanting to do something at this level  Once they take the bit in their teeth we  may get a much greater stimulus than firm leadership on fiscal policy would dictate  That is my  comment       Well, I think I’d be a little stronger in my cutback on the [ranges for the] Ms   in view of the adjustment factor we put in [which] makes comparison very difficult over time  I  would go to 2 to 7 on the M1 range and 5 to 9 on the M2 range  We certainly don’t move against  forecasts, but I’d surely move if the evidence came in because as I look down the road, like Henry I  think we’ve got to face the unpleasant task [of moving the funds rate up] and I’d rather move  earlier than later [given] the magnitude of the problem  But I’d go to 2 to 7 and 5 to 9 in view of  the seasonal adjustment we’ve put in there because the comparisons really are going to be quite  extreme       I agree   "
717,1978-04-18,"  Mr Chairman, I would like to ask a question with respect to the home  component of [the staff’s] presentation  To what extent have you factored in the multifamily  developments, which are really quite spectacular, offsetting the single-family decline?  [By that I  mean] the changes that have taken place in the financing area, with the pension funds and insurance  companies now doing the short-term financing as well as the long-term financing and with home  prices going up and even apartment rent going up faster than inflation  But the multifamily  construction is really quite a sensational development in the housing area       The interesting thing is that with the increases in rents that are taking place, you  change your calculations pretty fast  And even though there is increased cost in the multifamily  area, the borrowing hasn’t increased and there has been an increase in equity  I think some of these  people are going to get disappointed in their returns, but it’s kind of an interesting phenomenon      The second factor that I’d mention is the warehousing area; you can’t rent warehousing space  anywhere  And if you get a buildup in inventories and that sort of thing over a period of time  you’ve got a real push in construction  And the center city office building is a big phenomenon, so  [the outlook] may be more optimistic than [the projection] indicates       Mr Chairman, following upon Mark’s question  Does [Congress] get you in  any way into the short-term targets at the same time they are talking about the long-range targets?       It seems to me that that gets you quickly into Chuck’s problem of suppose we  have to very quickly--       I concur with your [recommendation]       Mr Chairman, I think the statement you made earlier about your changed  opinion in the last six weeks is essential, really, to a forecasting episode  The only way you can  forecast successfully is to keep forecasting because the scenario changes on you and all of the  underlying assumptions that you have made in the outline you have sketched for the year ahead can  change very drastically in the period  I would keep it on a personal view with the thought that you  are going to change your mind over time  If it becomes institutional--and nobody has a very good  record on that sort of thing--you are going to find that policy then becomes a matter of  Congressional concern because difference is what they are aiming at for the short term versus the  long term  And I think you will get yourself involved in problems you really don’t want to take on  at this time       Well, we are pretty much in agreement  I think it is probably important that the  top of the range be down more than the bottom in terms of imagery and determination  And I  remind you that we don’t have to freeze these in stone for the month  We can come back by  telephone and other ways to make adjustments  I think we have to feel our way along  The 5 to 9  or 4 to 8 is a move that would be agreeable to me on M1, and perhaps 5-1/2 to 9-1/2 on M2  And I  would buy the [funds] range of 6-3/4 to 7-1/2  I wouldn’t want to do that too specifically in terms  of a move that is in a sense determined  I think we will be faced with Reg Q [constraints] very  fast I hope we don’t get backed [against] the wall before we [enact] that relief because once you     4/18/78             50  are up to that ceiling any time you raise it you are up to the other ceiling  And I think it is  imperative that we move on track as [much as] we can as this [firming] move starts    "
731,1978-05-05,"  Mr Chairman, before you do that, could I ask Steve Axilrod if he adds M3 and  M4 in there, will he get a different picture than from the M1/M2 picture?       Mr Chairman, thank you  I share Paul’s feeling in that I’d like to see the  discount rate as a response to these numbers and let market [rates go] up anyway  I don’t need to  hit too much on the problem of the Treasury  The longer we wait--and being advised in terms of  the size of these numbers [unintelligible]--the opposition politically tends to build against the  increased rate  If we go up [now], we could be able to increase the [unintelligible] approval rather  than disapproval  But my guess is the market will turn on us because disintermediation, I suspect,  will increase pretty much  So we’ve got a bigger personal problem along with [unintelligible]  I  would be inclined to stay with the 7-1/4 percent funds rate but on the discount rate I couldn’t  possibly [disagree]    "
755,1978-05-16,"  On the housing figure, shouldn’t we put back in manufactured homes or mobile  homes?  It fell out of bed but it’s really coming back very strong  I wonder if we shouldn’t look at  that         Second, the inventory behavior is the thing I’m beginning to be puzzled about  in terms of what lies ahead  [That] is occasioned by a couple of factors  One is steel, which is  talking about operating at 90 percent capacity, and that introduces the capacity argument  But the  question is  How much of that is for inventory rebuilding and what is happening there?  And if you  look at warehouse space problems, again you wonder if there is not some inventory building  And  with this big spurt in sales, what’s the prospect that we’ll follow this with an inventory cycle before  we get into the capital goods cycle of an expenditures problem?  You see this in certain chemical  lines now, in steel, and a whole host of areas  [It] makes me wonder if we may not be on the verge  of a--        The third point I’d make has to do with the capacity problem  Part of this is in  steel and part of it is in transportation equipment where you just can’t get rail cars for anything  If  you try to get on a plane, you feel like the same thing [is going on] there  Delivery time on  machine tools has been extended and that’s one indication of the problems in this area  The labor  market problem is another  To what extent are we really close to capacity bottlenecks here that  throw off the price expectations pretty fast?       Ford shut down in the Cleveland area because of no engines       5/16/78              11     No engines, which they have been importing through Canada       I guess I have a little stronger feeling about the economy than the staff  And I  see a more normal cyclical kind of development out of that than Dave does in terms of the setup  The price phenomenon bothers all of us and I think we are picking up the fact that [inflation] is  suddenly accelerating in the service area  Some of my [lawyer] friends are increasing their fees by  20 percent and they are amazed that they are not running into any resistance        Yes, they are not charging me  With the prospect for what seems to me a  typical inventory cycle in the setup coinciding with the bottleneck problem in the construction  [area], I get worried about ’79 and not about ’78  The ’78 pressure seems to me much bigger than  we have anticipated  It creates challenges to us in terms of what we do here  On the credit side, I  would just like to make a couple of comments  One is that I think we ought to be a little concerned  about what’s happening in the margin credit area, particularly with the options on some of these  things  In the real estate area we are seeing a very different phenomenon  These apartments and  shopping centers and other buildings are all being constructed with much higher equity than in the  1972-74 boom  Where [formerly] it was a 20/80 kind of equity/debt ratio, we are now seeing 33- 1/3 and 66-2/3, which is really quite a different phenomenon in this area  So that building boom  strikes me as being a better base in terms of the credit side of the picture, but in some of these other  areas I am getting concerned [about] what we are seeing       I don’t care where the money comes from, as long as it’s in there       I’m puzzled as to what happened to V in our alphabet       Paul Volcker       I’m afraid I’m not contributing much wisdom but I do have a sense of  experience at having been burned for being a little foot-dragging in our efforts to broach some of  these problems  I guess my tendency is to average out to perfection by erring on the other side       I understand, but I can do two wrongs as well as a right sometimes  My  tendency would be to be concerned about the image of the Fed and its actions as they are perceived  by others  The problems are very real in terms of the inflation front and activity  While I realize  what we do has impacts down the road and not immediately, my tendency would be to proceed  cautiously, but certainly  [I’d go] with ranges of 4 to 8 or 3 to 8 and 5 to 9--I don’t really care too  much on those--with the funds rate range of 7-1/4 to 8 with a 7-1/2 midpoint and a conference call  before we proceed over 7-3/4  But at least it makes us face up to it again should the aggregates  [grow] more rapidly than we’re projecting     "
783,1978-06-20,"  Two comments, Mr Chairman  First, one inconsistency that I have trouble  identifying is that if you look at freight truck traffic it doesn=t really seem to relate to the other  measures of economic activity that we have  Has something gone wrong in those  measurements?       You=d think that inventory would pile up or something if you look at  production figures and those other things  My second comment is that I think it=s important in  terms of cyclical behavior in the future to look at the dissimilarities from what we=ve had in the  past  For example, take the housing problem  As we look ahead, if financing does tend to pinch  off that activity, it would be occurring at a time of the lowest vacancy rates since World War II   This could in some ways be salutary in terms of the price impact, perhaps some offset by Q or  some other factors here that may not be altogether bad  We looked at other cyclical behavior  I     6/20/78                12  think you=ll find a difference in terms of the structure of the real economy now versus other  kinds of excesses that have given rise to cyclical behavior in the past       That sounds like [my view] too  But those in the business community  certainly have the bit in their teeth and are running hard with the feeling that this year is going to  be better than most of the projections that have been given  And it seems to me that momentum  is going to carry longer  Second, the unrest on the inflation [front] seems to me to be increasing  The tax revolt in California was part of this but I sense it is everywhere--the bitterness about  prices and the feeling that we are losing ground  And this is true at all levels of income, not just  the lower levels  My guess is that everybody attempts to take care of themselves under those  circumstances, so we are probably going to get more [unfavorable] price behavior  Should we  get the slowing down that [the staff is] projecting, my guess is that the fiscal assumptions will be  altered  Things change very rapidly  And attitudes can alter in six months of time so that a  projected cutback may be an increase rather than a cutback  If that holds, it gets pretty     6/20/78                17  precarious in terms of one’s projections, but my roll of the dice is that I suspect the real GNP  will be up 4 percent and I’d say maybe 7-1/2 percent on prices       That is right       Mr Chairman, I have a feeling that we stopped reading on page 6 when the  problem got severe and didn=t look ahead to what is an alternative for us       My feeling is that market conditions are more favorable for action now than they  will be in the future, with possibly accelerating credit demands, and that we should push now to try  to moderate things rather than be faced with rate increases in the fall  My inclination would be a  federal funds range of 7-1/2 to 8, with narrower ranges [for the aggregates, which] probably would  force us to look at it  I thought 3-1/2 to 8-1/2 [on M1] and perhaps 5 to 9 on M2       Well, I would prefer 4-1/2 to 8-1/2    "
808,1978-07-18,"  Mr Chairman, I am intrigued with the games economists play and I think we  must not forget that it is a game  As I look at Africa, the Middle East, South America, and the Far  East and the problems in municipal finance at home and in some other areas, it seems to me that  there are a number of factors we haven’t put into our models to judge their impact  So I think we  need to be reminded that we are playing this game  I personally think that momentum is still  running very strong, and I would suspect that we still will achieve by the second quarter of next  year 3-3/4 to 4 percent real GNP growth  I am more pessimistic on the inflation outlook, with the  wages and structuring by business people and others to try to offset some of these things, so I am 8  percent plus by the middle of the year, and I have a 6 percent unemployment rate       I thought that was the instruction       It seems like we have backed ourselves into a win/lose posture no matter which  way we go, which is not the way I like to look at alternatives  To minimize our risks, it seems to  me that the status quo, for reasons that have already been expressed, would be the best posture       Point of information, Mr Chairman  In the bank credit numbers, are we getting  the foreign bank credit in that picture or not?  Is it just loans to domestic companies?       That is not the branches here but the foreign banks?       7/18/78              36     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am concerned about the momentum I see on  prices, attitudes, and even real activity, in view of our past experience of waiting and then having to  raise rates too sharply  I share Paul’s feelings that I would rather do it now than later, as I felt last  month  Therefore, I vote for alternative C for the funds rate, with 4 to 8 and 6 to l0 as  specifications on the aggregates       The timing is not that important    "
833,1978-08-15,"  What happened yesterday, Scott, that caused this outbreak in markets?       8/15/78             4     What sort of volume did the market have yesterday?       I am concerned about the inflation developments and I'm not sure that they're  all attributable to organized labor  As you know, we suggested to our Chairman that he not send a  letter to the [banks] on inflation issues and the Secretary of the Treasury did  And I noticed that a  large number of banks were having very substantial [wage] increases at midyear this year  When  you talk to them they say Well, we're afraid of wage controls and we want to get them in early   So, we're starting to see this sort of a movement  If you go to a restaurant and you complain about  what's happening to their prices, they say Well, we're afraid of price controls  We hear more and  more of this in conversations as we talk to business people; they're all very quietly trying to get  their prices up just as rapidly as they can, which tends to accelerate  I think [it’s] a rather broad  view      Second, I'm a little more concerned [about capacity constraints]  While I agree that  generally capacity looks all right, it's the bottleneck problem that kills you and we’re seeing that     8/15/78             11  more and more in terms of skilled labor  More [firms] are using this as the restraint--their ability to  increase not physical capacity but the skilled labor component  The steel companies will say   Look, if we could change the mix, we'd be all right  But talk about drilling equipment, we're in  trouble; talk about wire, we're in trouble  If we talk about certain flat steel for automobiles, we're in  trouble  But in general people still talk about 80 percent or 85 percent in terms of capacity   So you see, the general figures look good but you get to specific areas and you begin to [see] the  bottlenecks  Whether that will show up in prices or in delayed delivery or what, I don't know      So, I think the capacity problem may be more of a constraint than indicated and, therefore, I  would say that the real growth would probably be in the 3-1/2 to 3-3/4 area but my price concerns  would be higher  I'd be in the 8 to 8-1/2 percent area [with] everybody starting to raise [prices] in  view of the real certainty they feel that price controls are around the corner  And they look forward  to rent controls, so everybody is trying to get in [price increases] in advance of controls  So I think  you're going to see a frightening--       I was just mentioning that the banks are now raising their wages in view of  the letter they received from Mr Blumenthal  They've had very fine earnings this first half, as you  know, and instead of waiting until the end of the year they're making the adjustments now and  saying they'll be more in line at the end of the year  But [the wage increases] will be in advance of  any possible wage controls  On unemployment, I'd say around 6 percent       Yes, Mr Chairman, I would also be inclined to lower the ranges a bit on M1  and M2--to 3 to 8 or 4 to 8 on M1 and 6 to 10 on M2  And I’d have 7-3/4 to 8-1/4 on the funds  rate, again using this as our discipline to reevaluate the situation rather than permit wider rate  fluctuations  I'd also use the aggregates directive and move ahead to the 8 percent and raise the  discount rate       No I really don't, Mr Chairman       I share the skepticism  I think we are again addressing the symptoms and not  the real problem  I'd rather see our attention focused on the real issues and not divert our attention  here    "
859,1978-09-19,"  Mr Chairman, a question and comment  The question, Jim, involves the   problems of the seasonality of the adjustments on the new orders of durable goods  The fiscal year  shift, you take unadjusted figures and you get a different picture  Yet that's one of the puzzling  developments here on the current scene      My comment, Mr Chairman, has to do with my role as one of Governor Jackson’s stable   boys  I think it's proper to call the attention of the group to the explosion that's taking place in  credit in the securities markets and the rapid expansion in the numbers of customers--if you can  depend upon the statistical reporting series, which I think is questionable  But there is quite an  explosion of activity there and the independent action of the exchanges to raise the margins on  certain kinds of securities       I just wondered if there is something in that that accounts for some of this   behavior      I'd remind the group that for the last couple of years we've been making   funeral arrangements for the economy after the strong starts at the first of the year and then worries  [later]  My own feeling is that it still may be a bit premature for this event  The durable goods  [figure is a] question--what prompted my question earlier--but I have a feeling that we may have       9/19/78            15  more strength than is apparent  But what worries me is further down the road for two reasons, or  three reasons maybe  First, commercial construction and apartment house construction are really  running full out  And there is no apparent barrier in terms of financing and [related] factors  So,  what worries me is that if these are brought on stream, then we may suddenly get a glut in this area  with a very sharp turnoff      Second, we're seeing some interesting things in consumer spending; jewelry, furs, and other   premium items are really going great guns  The nondurables are having problems  And what  worries me on this score is that with consumer credit [readily available]--with the credit cards and a  number of other things--we may have introduced a much higher degree of cyclical behavior in the  consumer area than we've experienced previously  And if this occurs simultaneously with  construction and a few other things coming to a head further down the road, there may be a  problem  But at the moment I suspect we're going to get more support in the consumer area as a  result of the still pushing of the credit card and credit and other factors we've projected  So, on  balance, I come out with the feeling that for the few months ahead the staff forecast is probably  more on the low side--not much, but we may see unexpected strength       Mr Chairman, I guess I’ve come full circle  It's a circle we have been around   here in our discussion  I associate myself with the Volcker position in the sense that I think we do  have to continue signaling our concern about the aggregates growth, whatever those aggregates are,  with the periodic adjustments we make to them  And we also need to retain a sort of “watch and  look” posture in the sense of the 4 to 8 and 6 to 10 on the aggregates with an 8-1/4 to 8-3/4 funds  rate range  That doesn't seem like a draconian kind of development and it gives us a chance to  assess later on the changing economic scene as well as the developments in these aggregates and  move then to 8-1/2, with an aggregates directive    "
885,1978-10-17,"  I would say perhaps a little lower on the real GNP--real output of 2-1/2 to 3  percent--and a little higher on prices, at 7-3/4 to 8-1/4 or something of that kind  What disturbs me       10/17/78 16             in all of these forecasts are the price developments  I just don't think you can talk to people without  coming away with a different sense that this is simply not sustainable, in terms of the bitterness that  is building up in a very, very broad area  I get public reactions that are different than we put into  our forecast       On the price developments       Well, their reactions are either going to be explosive on one side or complete  withdrawal on the other  At the moment I'm not sure how that will fall out but it's a very  widespread feeling and the first time I've encountered it  It’s such that you can't talk to any group  without that being the dominant factor in the picture       Steve, have the TT&L changes been factored into your November estimates?       I think my preference would be a money market [directive] with an 8-3/4 to  9-1/4 [fed funds] range and alternative 2, I suppose, [given] our lack of knowledge of what's  happening       Yes       On another matter, Mr Chairman, I've been unhappy this year with our  experience with the Ms, and the meeting today convinces me that we're certainly not sure about       10/17/78 57             how to measure them or what they are  I wonder if this isn't the time to reopen the question of our  guidelines  Even though we've explored it and buried it a number of times, [I’d like us] to reopen  the issue of some sort of reserve base aggregate to be used to guide our actions  I think it's time    "
908,1978-11-21,"  Scott, [you mentioned] the $46 billion of our intervention; what's the foreign  intervention at the same time?  The footnote in the Bluebook about $11 billion is for direct  placements in foreign securities in the bill market by foreign accounts       Before we leave the area, Mr Chairman, I wonder if [Alan or Scott] would  comment on the weakness reported on the foreign exchange markets this morning     11/21/78              7       On the business [side], you get a strange dichotomy  If you ask them how  their business is they'll tell you it’s very good but they're told by their economists that it is going to  get poor  Their own assessment is quite different from [their sense of the] general environment   On Jim's point on the consumption spending, the thing that bothers me a little bit is that if you look  at the service component of personal consumption expenditures, the big factor in its growth is  related to housing, as I understand it, including such things as storm windows and other things  It  seems to me that we may get more fluctuations out of changes in personal consumption  expenditures than we have had previously because of the real difference in mix that is going into  that service component  Some I find it hard to call “services” but that's the way they classify them       I think the variables are too great to be very confident on any kind of  projection  You can spell out four or five scenarios and I don't have a very strong feeling at this  stage as to which one is going to happen  I think we're paying too much attention to the retail sales  of the past month or so, which I think are affected by weather and differences in terms of the  samples [used] in collecting the data  I think we have more variables in those numbers and I feel  less confident about those than anything  I'm thankful for Christmas ahead to keep some  stimulation  And if we get some of this snow in Boston, it may actually spur sales rather than  handicap them       Across the country  Well, coats haven't done very well either       But you can trace some scenarios here of stability  [With a] regain of  confidence and a sudden purge in inflation, [we can get] output that we don't [have forecast]  On  the other hand, we can coast over to a very sharp decline very quickly here by consumers pulling in  their horns  I'm not sure how much [good] a yearly forecast does us at this stage with the kind of  variables we're faced with  I can see inputs that would lead to this result, but there are alternative  inputs that can give us quite different results       I would put a cap of 5 percent on M1, a range of 6 to 9 on M2, and 9-3/4 to  10-1/4 [for the funds] rate, staying at 9-3/4 until we see what's happening here       I'll go along with it    "
933,1978-12-19,"  Can you elaborate on your last comment a little bit?       Things are rather bizarre in Cleveland  I hope you won’t think that I am  following the Cleveland tradition in my comment  I’d like to take a little different path  I think we  are frozen in a pattern of operation that should be reexamined when you think about our focus on  rates  If we examine other underlying conditions, we assume that it’s going to take up to 14 to 15  percent on the [short-term] interest rate to get the braking effect that we want in terms of our  present tack  I suspect we could do the same thing with maybe a 1/2 or 3/4 percentage point  increase on the long-term end of the rate range  And I think maybe we ought to think that through  a bit      Usually we put our brakes on at the end of a cycle and then end up with over-capacity in a  number of areas  Then when we try to stimulate things, we feel equally frustrated on the other side  We are faced with looking at problems of commercial and industrial building where we probably  have a 1-1/2 to 2 year run without going into over-capacity  Yet that’s very interest-rate sensitive  to the long-term rate, but 14 to 15 percent on short-term rates is not going to slow that a bit  And if  we could effect some slowing down and braking at that end of activity, we might be able to rush  that very quickly with a change in the rate level because rates are the chief cost factor in a great  deal of that kind of construction activity  I wonder if we shouldn’t think a little more clearly on our  focus of what we are trying to achieve in terms of strength and whether a slight increase of that  might avoid a very big rise in short-term rates, [which is] what I’m afraid it is going to take to  accomplish our purpose  I’m thinking about not only the braking effect, but the stimulating effect  that may be far more effective at that end than the [short] end where we are focusing most of our  attention      The second comment I’d like to make is that the wage factor, at least in our state, is  certainly starting to get out of control  [That’s true of] everything from the state legislature on  down, [including] the Teamsters and others  So the wage factor is a very big problem in terms of  people’s thinking and what they’re [doing]      The third comment I’d make is that I consider the retailers the soft underbelly of the future   I’m not quite certain as to how that [sector] is going to behave  We have had sales stimulus from  the pre-Christmas season but very little price cutting, as I recall  And whether we will get an after-  Christmas price cutting and change attitudes or not, I don’t know  But it seems to me that that’s  very sensitive to where we go in the future      12/19/78          19       [Let me make] two other incidental comments  Cleveland doesn’t confine itself to  Cleveland in terms of its investment interest  I get all kinds of danger flags pointed to the Southern  California condominium real estate markets, à la the Florida markets a couple of years ago  More  people have been beating my ear on the dangers happening there, which always are pointed at the  other fellow, I guess       It would be welcome, I’m sure  The natural gas [situation] that Ernie  mentioned is not restricted to Texas  It’s also prevalent in Ohio; excesses are being reported and  they have no storage space  It’s partly that the winter weather has been mild in contrast to previous  winters  So we do have excess showing in that area         I’m concerned that we may be closer to changes in trends than we have been previously,  and I think this needs to be watched very carefully  And I share the feeling that maybe seven  weeks is too long between meetings, with the international and the domestic situations  My  personal feeling is that because of the psychological factors and the focus on us and the strength  that I agree is prevalent throughout [the economy, it] requires further attention on our part  So I  would feel that perhaps a little more modest braking would be appropriate but I’d like for us to  consider the long-term end rather than the short-term end         I can accept the suggestion made by Steve  I think I would prefer dropping  the ranges to 0 to 6 on M1, 4 to 8 on the M2, and 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 [on the funds rate]        Isn’t this just a reporting requirement, not an operating requirement?  In other  words, we have to report twice a year on this basis but there is nothing to prevent you from looking  or acting in the interim period when conditions change        It’s a reporting requirement, not an operating requirement        That’s still a reporting requirement, not an operating requirement        Otherwise we are locked in the ages-long controversy between automation  and judgment as a policy        The second Wednesday--isn’t that a possibility?        It does in July but we could make an exception     12/19/78          50          I would just raise the question with respect to January, in view of the  uncertainties that are prevalent  I’m wondering what the public relations aspect of it is, even  though we hold it by telephone, to say that there is not a meeting in January     12/19/78          51          I think we are missing the market aspect of this        I, too, would share the feeling that this is sort of a back-of-the-hand treatment  to a problem  I grant that it’s not a good guide and I don’t insist that it be in the targets or ranges,  but I think we have made a mistake in the past in ignoring the supplemental information that this  provides for us  And I’d like to see an examination in somewhat more detail of whether this  supplemental information tells us something about what’s going on in the aggregates, particularly  with respect to the future, that we have chosen to ignore  I don’t advocate that it be part of the  specs       12/19/78          68        That’s really all I’m talking about    "
980,1979-03-20," M r   Chairman, a sobering exercise at a time like  this is to go back to the first quarter of last year and use our  models or any other approach and ask oneself what conditions would  produce a negative rate of growth in money supply in the first quarter  of this year We get astronomical interest rates and a lot of other  things that we really haven't seen So then we ask ourselves, given  that everybody is expecting weakness at this time--and that's  certainly the news--where do we find it? Again, if we follow our  models, they may not work out quite this way Having spent the winter  falling into potholes, I take a pothole approach to economic  forecasting One of the potholes, of course, is in the energy area,  with tremendous problems with respect to refining capacity I really  don't see how we can get out of this on any short-term basis What  this means for the consumer is that he may find he can't buy, beg, or  steal gasoline    Okay Then we divert more of our oil supplies to  producing electricity; with the shutdown of the atomic plants in this  area, I don‘t quite know what this means Another pothole I would  call to your attention is the fact that we focus pretty much on the  domestic scene in terms of our analysis Now, the international  situation looks a little better at the moment, but as I travel around  and see the diversions of some of these economies into the military  side, I get concerned about what this means down the road If a  country puts that much of its [economic resources] into the military,  the tendency is to use it in one form or another How this will turn  out, I don’t know, but we certainly can see trouble in Yemen and lots  of other places that aren‘t in the headlines at the moment The third  point is the confidence factor on the international side and the  tremendous flows that occur And I look at confidence in another  area--at many of our so-called monetary mechanisms Take the credit  unions and look at their loan/deposit ratios and their lack of cash;  yet they‘re in the share draft business What does it mean if  customers really step up their demands for [withdrawing] their money  from some of these [institutions] or want to transfer it? So, I would  project the potential for weakness that everybody’s talking about, and  then I’m raising the question of whether there are other possible  developments The only real weakness I can find at the moment in the  District is the coal situation, but in other areas such as cement  there is strength A number of the raw materials producers are at  capacity Steel is running flat out There’s just isn’t any [more  capacity] If we get demand for steel in excess of [the current  level], we will really be faced with a blow-up the other way Now, it  may not occur   M R   MORRIS Did you say the demand for coal is weak?    Yes, weak    I would say I end up confused in my outlook; I  think the uncertainty level is really quite high    Hold steady    Mr Chairman, I'd take generally alternative B  with a 4 to 8 percent range on both the M1 and M2 ranges and an  aggregates directive  "
1004,1979-04-17," Jim, in the last three weeks we've been getting a  little more evidence that disintermediation is starting to take place  We see it in terms of traffic in the Bank--direct purchases of  [Treasury] securities--and we see it in looking at some of the  institutional outflows Parallel to that is the fact that long-term  rates are starting to increase, particularly for the financing of  office buildings and other such things I get a reading that across  the country for the first time [builders] are really starting to look  very hard at costs and that a number of projects have suddenly been  pulled back in April Are we starting to see the bite of the policies  that have been in train for some time? If that's true, then one gets  a little different outlook than you projected for some of these  things    That's right, but the April data--    I wonder if the flows are going to go into market  investments?     4/11/19 -7    I think we are going to see more    I hate to see such unanimity over there I don't  want to be a counterforce today The inflation situation is still  very bad It seems to me that any easing would be misinterpreted and  could only be counterproductive On the [plus] side, it seems to me  that the transfer mechanisms really are at work, both from the budget  side and the food side [As for] the oil side, we really don't know  what that means I have a feeling that our policies are really  starting to work; they've been slow to take hold, but [monetary  policy] is not a quick fix And to be impatient at this stage would  be a mistake So I end up right in the middle--[no change]    I have no quarrel with alternative B I just  wonder, in view of the discussion, if there's some symbolism that  could be effected without really much change in market conditions,  such as a 114 point increase in the discount rate Reserve  requirements might be expanded on some other items such as on  Eurodollars and other [components where we know of] problems I don't  know whether this is the appropriate time--  "
1049,1979-05-22," May I borrow a little sand to feed my machinery?  I still get the reading that the financing of [housing] has been  turned off almost absolutely And there is about a 3-month lag  between financing and starts O n  that basis, starts should [fall]  very sharply starting by the end of June Insurance industries, in  contrast with the banks, report very little demand for financing at  the moment, which is rather surprising All of that leads me to feel  that commercial construction is in for a rather sharp decline, though  maybe not until the third quarter     5/22/79 -13-   The other comment I’d make is that the trucking industry  reports rather sizable declines in the last two weeks Now, whether  that’s the adjustment to the after-strike effect or whether there’s  something basic happening, I don’t really know    Mr Chairman, I sense a growing ugly mood in our  society I don't know whether the reaction is going to be in the  political sector or in the economic sector or in the racial area, but  I suspect it won't be a moderate reaction So I think we are in for  some rather volatile times ahead that could throw these estimates off,  but I certainly don't want to predict them My feeling would be that  this is not the time to tighten But in view of the uncertainties and  the inflation problem and other problems, I would say that we would be  well advised to stay where we are in terms of the current status of  policy I would favor a slight increase in the discount rate because  of the position of the banks; the inviting differential there is hard  for them to resist    I support Steve's recommendation    [Unintelligible]  "
1092,1979-07-11," I haven't any quarrel with the staff's projections  and I have only two comments on that One is that the continuing  inflation may force greater financial problems for some of our public  bodies--schools, cities, and so forth--and we may get some reactions  in that area that aren't really factored into the formula Second,  there is a potential that energy and some of the other problems may be  a greater stimulus to real investment on the part of the corporate  sector--if the growing recession talk doesn't scare them off on that  score--so that might be a potential stimulus   On the aggregates, I would certainly like to echo Henry's  comments on the meaning of these numbers and our not getting trapped  by putting too much emphasis on these as we make our projections  because of changes [occurring] everywhere Maybe it's all these other  [financial instruments] getting into those aggregates measures I  have trouble with drift And I have trouble trying to explain April  and June in spite of the [staff's] explanations I don't find them  very satisfactory as to what really has happened, which makes me  uncertain as to the future I would stay with the recommendations of  Steve Axilrod; I would go perhaps a little lower in 1980 because of  the uncertainties with respect to what's happening to ATS plus the  growth and magnitudes of these other numbers So I would be more  cautious with the '80 number I think than he was, but I have no  quarrel with extending the ' I 9  ranges  "
1113,1979-07-17," Mr Chairman, I have a feeling that we may have more of an iceberg here than we like to think Intervention alone won't [work] and probably is too expensive [if our aim is to achieve] a turnaround I am a bit sympathetic to [taking action] a little earlier rather than later because we can reverse it A discount rate change and a slight fed funds rate [increase seem] appropriate But I think the question we need to ask is If the first move in this direction doesn't stem the flow, are we really prepared to go further along this line? Apparently the answer to that question is more uncertain I think I'd have a tendency to march down that road much earlier than later, however, thinking that we'll know very quickly [as we undertake] that move "
1134,1979-07-19," Mr Chairman, I urge that we follow the directive and permit the funds rate to rise to 10-1/2 percent And then I would urge that we change the discount rate In the announcement, however, I would focus on the behavior of the aggregates That gives us the flexibility to back down in response, hopefully, to better behavior [of the aggregates] and the underlying economic situation But I think we have to give some signals to the international markets if we are going to stem this dollar inflow We certainly can't peg [the dollar]; we shouldn't peg it anyway But we can't peg it, I think, just by direct intervention with no signal or we are going to find more funds flowing in than we can possibly handle   I feel the way Paul does I'm not sure it makes that much difference, Mr Chairman, but I can't oppose it    7/19/79   Murray, this is Willis Winn Will you call me at home after 930? "
1162,1979-08-14," Mr Chairman, I wonder if the attitude of the group would differ if the economic outlook for Mexico worsened rather than brightened--if the oil reserves proved to be a little less than now [thought]   Mr Chairman, I have a great deal of sympathy with the identification of the box, which you so aptly described I personally believe that we haven't started to feel the social costs of inflation and that they are going to surface to an increasing extent this fall, with more attention on them But in thinking of how we get out of the box that we have sort of built ourselves into, I have less confidence in our forecast of the aggregates than I do in the forecast of the economy--not only in terms of the numbers forecast but what they mean On the other hand, I think any action we take--because we are certainly in the spotlight today--will be looked at very eagerly and there are psychological reactions coming from what we do So that would make me just a bit cautious as to how extensive the symbolic action we take today [should be] Yet in trying to find a way out of this box I think we do have to make some changes And while this may go against the grain of your background, Mr Chairman, let me suggest a possible course I suggest that we shave the ranges of the aggregates and shave them considerably from what appears here At the same time, we could widen the range of the funds rate and for once in our lives pay some attention to that and let [the funds rate] roam Doing that gives us somewhat more adaptability to the circumstances as they unfold It gives us an opportunity to evolve gradually from where we are rather than take an action which, if we get a reaction within the next week, then puts us back in another box that may become difficult This would avoid tying our hands with respect to future actions, which I am a little concerned we might do with a major action today, although I have sympathy for that sort of move [Given] my confidence that the aggregates may be much stronger even than the estimates, by narrowing their ranges I think we achieve your goal but do it with a different mechanism than a retention of a policy [unintelligible] at this time "
1191,1979-09-18," I think we ought to look at the wage behavior of  this year with a sense of encouragement, not discouragement With     9 / 1 8 / 7 9  -8-    inflation running what it is, I think it's surprising that the  settlements in the electrical area and even in the automobile area for  current employees have been remarkably restrained Maybe they've done  a better job than we have here in terms of inflation problems    Well, in this case, for current employees it looks  as if the total cost might come out to 11 percent--that's my estimate  --on an annual basis [The total is] 33 to 35 percent and part of  that is for the retirees, not for the current employees So if you  adjust that back down, given double digit inflation behavior, I think  that's remarkable restraint, really, in the labor area    But the electrical settlement really wasn't that--    I understand that this is not making our problem  any easier, but I think we ought to recognize that there has been some  restraint this year    I'd just like to make one more comment, Paul It  seems to me that we're in an environment in which we have the most  advertised recession in history, with talking our way into it perhaps  contributing more because I think we're going to get an uptick in this  third quarter, too I don't know how that's going to be manipulated  from a press [standpoint] When you talk to business people they all  tell you that their business is still very strong But then they will  ""bad mouth"" because everybody else is bad mouthing and that's what  they read I think psychologically we may have built ourselves into a  box    I don't want to monopolize this, but I'd like to  raise one more question about your inventory calculation for the  fourth quarter We're going to have a big crop harvest in corn and  soy beans and with the price changes being what they were I wonder if  that may not throw the inventory calculation off again in that period  [unintelligible] storage space    On this issue, Paul, I hear more comment in the  market about credit controls of various types as the way of doing it  to avoid Reg--    I guess we're going to have to rearrange the  seating here a little; we're kind of [taking] sides and I'm out of  place here in terms of my approach! I think we're dealing with  expectations in a variety of ways, and when we [focus on1 our cyclical  analysis we forget the changes in price behavior that we're faced  with [Prices] are not going to behave in the traditional way in the  future, but they're still one of the canker sores we have to deal  with With the publicity we've had recently [regarding] our behavior  we have a real problem of expectations and a growing cynicism in the  markets The markets don't believe that the System has the resolve to  cope with these problems; [they think] that we tend to shift our  targets and keep our interest rates stable so that if we miss our  target we just push it up and say we're going to catch up later on  They're getting rather pat in the way they view our activities I  feel that we need to change their expectations about us in terms of  our behavior, as I argued last time   Consequently, I'd be in favor of widening the federal funds  rate spread and I'd let the rate behave on the basis of what actually  happens marketwise Secondly, I'd use this opportunity to change the  discount rate because it doesn't really change market [rate] levels  it would change expectations because there isn't an immediate foreign  exchange pressure that forces us into doing some of these things We  can use it to have an announcement effect without actually changing  the level of rates marketwise, reinforcing a resolve to do things a  little differently and, therefore, changing expectations I'm not in  favor of really hiking the rate level at this stage unless the  aggregates do continue their rapid growth     9/18/79 - 3 0 -    I'd point out to those who mentioned the decline in demand  deposits that this represents part of the continual shifting and  changing in the nature of the money concept, as people take advantage  of opportunities to keep their funds at work with RPs and other  things Consequently, I am still concerned about our overshoot in  this area With all of our comments and people pointing to us as  being concerned about this development, I'd like us to show by some  action that we are concerned without necessarily changing the rates  significantly In terms of expectations, I have one that is  different from those of the group I'm not sure we're going to get a  mild [recession] next spring I think we're going to get an uptick  this quarter That is going to change expectations for the final  quarter and we may get a stronger final quarter than projected I  think the basic forces of decline are with us What I can't see is  the bail-out after we get into a substantial decline I don't see the  forces there to provide the uplift So I think it can degenerate into  a somewhat larger decline than has been projected, with the fiscal  implications and the consequent problems with respect to continued  price inflation And I'm worried on that score    I’d just spread the [range on the funds] rate, M r    Chairman, but I wouldn’t quarrel too much [with your proposal] I’d  go with 11 to 12 percent and an aggregates directive    Paul, marketwise, is there any way we could make  this shift [in the funds rate] today rather than tomorrow, to throw  the markets a little off balance in their shooting duck attitude  toward us?  "
1225,1979-10-06," Paul, during this past period, the rumors were  everywhere One of the ones that bothers me the worst is the feeling  of an explosion on the wage front For example, we see banks  violating the guidelines pretty generally  knowledgeable friends seem to be predicting 20 percent increases next  year and that really frightens me They all had solutions with  respect to what we ought to be doing But they never have as a  solution that we should do nothing So I've tried to [assess] what  the risks and implications are of doing nothing in this area and that  was rather frightening Being s-ympathetic to what you're proposing, I  wonder if we really have tried to look at the risks inherent in this  We've talked about the price on the international side and so forth,  but what are some of the risks here? While we say we don't emphasize  interest rates, the implication of this [proposal] is considerably  higher rates And if we think about that, what does that mean at  least in the short run in terms of money flows? What does that mean  in terms of those with prime plus 3 percent embedded in their costs?  What does it mean to those institutions with short-term funding? What  does it mean in terms of the commitments and lines of bank credit that  will be accelerated? In other words, what are the risks on this side  that we have to grapple with as well as the risks that we've talked  about on the other side?   Some of my most  "
1245,1979-10-22," Mr Chairman, I share the feeling that we have got  to show as firm a resolve as we can As far as technical problems, is  there a Treasury financing after this--?    Okay My feeling is that one way we can show our  resolve is to increase the discount rate again--not to accomplish an  increase in interest rates but just to keep it in line Pressure at  the window gets a message through to the banks that we mean business  I have no problem with rates fluctuating a little higher than we  thought in order to try as hard as we can to meet our targets  "
1271,1979-11-20, The 10th is a [board] meeting date  
1299,1980-01-08," Well, I would take a somewhat different tack You talked about the complexity of reality as we view the Ms and reserves I think the complexity of the economy with respect to the outlook is even greater Second, I think we are boxed in because of the law saying we have to do this and do that If I were doing it, I would indicate very clearly what my economic scenario is and then what my recommendation is in [that context] rather than say that this is our target irrespective of what happens I suspect that the economic outlook is going to be far more variable--and I'm not saying on which side--than any of the projections would indicate, and that makes our target setting even more important And I would offer to go back to Congress at an appropriate time because of my lack of confidence in my long-range forecast on the economy I would surely put my economic scenario out there if I put out any kind of targets   Well, that's correct But [I'd say Given] this hypothesis, this would be true For example, Paul, go back to October and look at what you would have projected on the international front versus what you feel now That can change far more dramatically in a very short period of time Let's assume we go to a military draft or assume we get involved militarily; all of these [projections and targets] would be out the window On the other hand, if we just take a look at our inflation rate and what that could do, [the recession] may be far deeper than any projection we have if things started to come unravelled on that score Then we would have to adjust to the reality as best we see it at the time, rather get into this longer range kind of set up You can take the President's economic outlook or any one you want, and say If that's true, then this would be our goal But because we are not certain about these things we are going to have to adjust as time goes by and we are willing to come back and report when we adjust But to get caught in a longer-range [target], even a year's target at the moment, is really buying ourselves another trap Or else we have to have a wide range because of our uncertainty about the reality   At this time, yes   That's right; that's what I mean   It could be very wrong I think the reality is that we have a much greater [chance] of being wrong this time than has been true in a long time   Around 5 or 5-1/2 percent as a midpoint, Paul   I get lost in the fiscal forest For a number of years we had budget results in which expenditures fell below appropriations To what extent is this going to be reversed? Plus the fact is that there is no reason why one can't anticipate next year's appropriations; orders [and] expenditures come later And I don't quite know what you assume on those off-balance sheet activities such as Chrysler and other things To what extent might we get a real surprise on the expenditure side or the orders side, as contrasted with this?   I'm somewhat amazed at the amount of money that's suddenly showing up in Cleveland I don't know if that's the subject of charity coming home or what but the money seems to be coming out of the woodwork for that sort of thing I'm gathering that this is really going to mean that this year we're not going to have any appropriations that weren't spent  SPEAKER(?) That could [mean] a very big difference in the federal spending   Related to that is the fact that inventories are rather tight and [are being carefully] watched in most of these special sectors If we get any change in that area, we're going to see explosive prices and people scrambling for the short supply  My final comment is that I'm struck by the number of people who tell me they're now pricing for inflation They tell me they tried a price increase in midyear but it didn't go because their competitors didn't meet it They tried a price increase in December and not only did their competitors meet it within 48 hours but they [moved] ahead of them in terms of the prices themselves There seems to be an explosive development related to the inventory shortage in this area   I guess I was shaken by last year's experience with money growth, so I am suspicious of almost any number we put on these things, frankly I remind you that any number we pick is fine- tuning of a degree, and I'm not sure the numbers differ that much in terms of the fine-tuning aspect I suppose because of last year's experience and the concern as to what will happen in the money demand area, I would probably stay with ""C"" "
1327,1980-02-04," Well, I have the feeling that the honeymoon of our experiment is about over Consequently, I get a little more itchy to fiddle with the machinery rather than to let it stand I am convinced that the acceptance of the Federal Reserve making this [procedure] work is going to be more important than for membership and a whole host of issues I would not back off because of the effect it may have on the membership legislation at this time This is more important than the membership issue I am convinced that while there are programming problems involved, we can get it done faster than we assume if we change our priorities a bit I would give up on some of the other things we are doing, I think, and put this in place I am not sure how much time [it would take] but the biggest problem is getting the Banks to rearrange their priorities in order to mesh with it I would pick up on some of the other comments about the importance of saying that this [procedure] works I am concerned that the slippages are going to show up much more There is a lack of confidence in the market now about what we are doing and either [we need to do] that or look at the discount rate again, or perhaps both, very promptly or I think we are going to be in trouble  I would like to raise one question With [the development] of the managed liabilities and RPs and other things, are we seeing a change in the adjustment process now that will [become more pronounced] if we start to tighten? Are we seeing that [adjustment not] formally showing up in the deposit base but in some of these items? I get lost in all the accounting as to how that flushes out  -11-    2/4-5/80   Paul, I hear more doubts being raised in more areas than I ever thought possible Their suspicion is that we are [not] on a money target [unintelligible] very much a funds target   Well, we are confusing it by all these different money supply figures we are surfacing   People are looking, Paul, at the reserve base until we get--   I think it's great that we get these scenarios out on the table My only concern is that my camera may be in sync but it may be out of focus So the picture that comes out may be quite distorted But let's take several of these assumptions that we've passed over First, the level of interest rates I must confess that when we talk about double digit interest rates, I get nervous But I remember that last year I got lectured by any number of people that if we passed the 10 percent rate, that was going to cut things off; and I remember after October 6th how things just dried up completely But I think we forget that it's real interest rates that people probably take into consideration And I have been amazed at the amount of money coming out of the woodwork in the last two weeks of January and the number of deals that are being formulated with respect to apartment houses, hotels, commercial buildings, and so forth The amount of money that is being committed in this area has stepped up tremendously after this hiatus I think we see it in the bond market, John, in terms of their attitudes Some of the current financing I think is being done to repay short-term debt There's an awful lot of talk going on with respect to financing, but that's not going to come into the investment picture until the last half of this year And that being laced on top of defense expenditures, should they come along, makes a little different scenario for this year's [performance]  One other thing In terms of your employment figures, have you put anything in there for a possible draft or increased military employment?   If you do this, you get a different scenario Again, this doesn't occur over night but it is another factor that seems to me is down the road   If you put a draft in the picture, then it changes these employment figures   It's probably down the road; I don't say it is immediate But, again, as one [looks at] various scenarios with some different inputs, there are different results, obviously While housing is down, I too am amazed at the amount of money that is even showing up for housing at the moment So, as I look at the level of rates, I go back to looking at availability; and I get nervous as to what [level of] interest rates it will take to have a damping effect on some of these [sectors]  In my scenario, I come out with a dip in the first half of this year because I think it's already under way But I can see some revival in the second half, so that I get a 1 percent decline for the year but it's quite a different shape The price [situation] really scares me Go back and look at 1973 and 1974; maybe we're going to multiply that distortion created by prices And if the world situation changes, some of the pressure for relief could come next year--I think it's already under way for this year--and carry through for a while But we may be [unintelligible] upswing continuing through part of 1981 and then real price distortion problems hitting us by the end of the year I see price problems in the 15 percent [CPI] rate; that is going to give rise to increased wage demands and re-opening of contracts and all kinds of pressures and we don't know how that is going to factor through to the balance of the year And that's not in your scenarios, in terms of the wage assumptions that you put in One gets different price results with some of these different assumptions So I am even more concerned about inflation developments and what they mean not only for 1980 but perhaps for 1981 and thereafter And that has implications for the international side and a whole host of things, which change the [scenario] I think the pressure for a tax cut is going to come both with the election problem and the first half year results That will further complicate the problem and I would be opposed to it This would be in my scenario, Paul   I get an [average] unemployment rate from the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter of maybe 7 percent, but I think it will probably go higher before it comes down unless we get a draft and some other things that would change my numbers I don't know what is going to happen, but you get a different picture if you change your assumptions   Very much so  -39-    2/4-5/80   Paul, we have talked about the kind of minds we have I think we can all claim to have confused minds And it's clear that that's going to be the problem you face in your presentation I would urge that we be sure to have the contrast between last year's targets and this year's targets on a similar basis so that people can understand whether the policy formulation is an increase or decrease or remains the same   Those would be the figures on the same basis? We won't present last year's on last year's basis and this year's on this year's basis--   It seems to me that we have to get this into perspective   I have a tendency to want to eliminate the confusion [caused] by too many numbers We only add to the confusion So, I would be inclined to use M-1B at the moment as being the most meaningful, although I share Henry's feeling that it's not a very good measure still in terms of--   I think the admonition that we are not casting these in concrete forever is a very important one at this stage We have a chance to look at these again based on [unintelligible] The inflation problem still dominates the public's attitude both toward our policy and what we are trying to achieve, and I would certainly want those numbers to look lower than last year's in terms of how they are set up I think I'd probably come out with alternative III   Well, I'll go back to my original question What are you going to say about last year's ranges?   People are going to compare ranges and ranges, not--   That's what we hit, but [the question is] Are we setting our objectives lower or higher?   But didn't we say 3 to 6 percent last year on Ml? Sure it has changed, and so forth--   Paul, there's another question Maybe this is not relevant, but in view of our unwillingness to come to terms with the lagged reserve question and in view of my nervousness with respect to our luck in holding out on this setup, is this perhaps the appropriate time to raise the question, given the fluctuations in borrowings and the growing differential between market rates and the discount rate, about changing the rate as part of this picture of [unintelligible]?   The discount rate   But the danger is that we will lose control in the latter case "
1367,1980-03-18," Paul, before you turn to that What's our posture for the month ahead in this area as the markets bubble?  -6-    3/18/80   Peter, on the unsuccessful unwinding of some of these GNMA futures with the failure of a firm or two Do you see any more problems ahead on that score with [more of those market instruments] reaching maturity?   Mr Chairman, the crosscurrents are so extreme that it's difficult to sort them out and get a fix, particularly with last weekend's adjustments not being factored into many people's thinking Three or four things, I think, are interesting One is that we turned off commercial construction--that is, apartment houses, office buildings, and so forth--completely in October, and it turned back on in an unbelievable fashion in January and early February We've turned it off again, I think, really in the last couple of weeks; there are just no deals being made But the profits picture that is coming through on the deals that have been made are so unreal that it's almost unbelievable With the acceleration of rents and with [builders'] fixed costs not moving up, the flows back to profits are very, very high That's particularly true where tax relief occurred, in California and Texas and places like that In spite of increased operating expenses the profits picture is almost unbelievable So, if we get any stability in [interest rates], my guess is that those [activities] will explode on us again as building picks up  The second thing I'd report is that the major chemical companies are showing profits in the first months of the year, and I've seen figures for month-to-month developments While these are worldwide operations and one can't sort it out [for individual countries], it was interesting to me that the price increases from January of last year to January of this year were over 30 percent Now, I don't know how the price increases were divided up worldwide, but these are pretty substantial price changes They have those [changes] built right into June--this was before last Friday--so  -25-    3/18/80  there's a big move in some of these factors And their earnings are unbelievable  While building has phased down and the automobile industry is staying a bit soft, [businesses] in our area are reporting unbelievable orders and profits expectations Our railroad people are reporting really quite good operating results, much better than they had projected And this is across the line, [even] with the downward push occurring in their automobile business Our banks are showing a mixed picture Many of them are pretty well loaned up and are not seeing too much demand because of rates in agriculture and some other areas On the other hand, they are not seeing any problem with respect to delinquencies or slow pays or any of the normal [signs] one sees on that score We had, of course, in the last couple of weeks this tremendous drive to increase commitments Their customers were told that lines of credit wouldn't be honored and they had to convert those into revolving notes So there was a tremendous scramble to offset the anticipated [government credit] control system by such things as price increases and wage increases and also by an explosion, really, in lines of credit They were taking to their boards demands for loans that were 5 to 6 times their normally weekly increase  We really don't know what the outlook is because we don't know how people will adjust; it's a crude guess that we're making In view of your statement yesterday and other concerns, I am very concerned about the [potential] April bulge, which could be much larger than is shown here And unless we react to that, our own credibility is going to be questioned even though [we expect the bulge to unwind] We can't say ""Oh well, it's going to go down in May and June, so we'll get back on target"" I have a feeling that we have to respond to current developments While the targets of ""B"" seem to me appropriate, in order to make those targets I'd like to raise that funds rate range by 2 points, let's say, to 13-1/2 to 20 percent, to give the Desk [the flexibility to respond], if necessary, if we get this kind of bulge I don't want to raise it just to raise it But unless we respond to the increase, which could be quite large in this period, we're going to have a real credibility problem  I am impressed with those who watch the Desk They will tell you exactly what the intervention points were; they don't see any change in terms of our intervention points which [they say are apparent] to the market People, in spite of all the changes, are reading [our operations] as if we were operating under the old guidelines While their perceptions are wrong, they still are perceptions; and we're dealing with perceptions as people interpret what we're doing and how they will react   I know, but it's amazing to me that they can tell you what hour we intervened and at what rate That hasn't changed But I am really concerned about this April bulge and how it will be interpreted "
1390,1980-04-22," We hear a good bit of publicity about domestic credit problems The Chrysler story is in the paper this morning, and so forth I hear no mention of international credit problems, and that seems to me to be an exposure that gets overlooked in the assessment I don't know whether you have any feel for this or not   That's the sort of thing I mean It seems to me that's a problem that is ahead of us in spades   One more question The freezing of the Iranian assets [added] one aspect to the diversification desires of other nations Did the suggestion in the latest of the President's proposals that we seize them--not only freeze them but seize them--to meet various expenditures, etc have any further repercussions?   So moved   I had a question I wanted to raise, which may be more on the technical side than the general side, Paul Do you want to hold that?   Okay Steve, you have made an income analysis for money demand in the period ahead If one looks back at many previous    4/22/80  credit crunches, one sees that after the economy turns down, we get a bulge in credit demand The margins start to narrow; sales are off and inventories are up and there is continued price pressure for more carry So, first, there's the seasonal adjustment [problem] that makes me quite nervous about May and June Now, this may or may not happen, but there is also the possibility, it seems to me--with interest rates turning a bit and attitudes changing a little--of a rather substantial increase in borrowing in the May-June period as well   But that runs out eventually   But if you talk to some of these businessmen, they don't have [unintelligible] they can hold out without having to come back in They are out now Rates have scared them off and they are using up what they have   They kept inventories pretty tight; but if sales drop off, they still are faced with having to carry [inventories]   The adjustment is not quite as easy as we like to think of it sometimes   Paul, the seasonal adjustment for April makes me fairly nervous, so I'd like to get a bit of feeling for May before we pump in an inordinate amount of reserves in the next week I think the danger of being whipsawed is very great I haven't any concern about your suggestion   No, I understand   With the inflation problem being what it is and with the fact that everybody doesn't read our policies the same way, a flip in our policy on inflation at this time could be most unfortunate, given all the other things we've done to move in the other direction "
1408,1980-04-29," I can agree with Chuck's analysis of the economic situation I'm not sure that a week may cut much difference in terms of our policy moves at the moment We may even want to reconsider the 13 percent floor if we get a better reading on unfolding developments I am concerned about having whipsawed here--allowing further rapid declines in rates and then having them go up very rapidly--in terms of market impact and interpretation and so forth I could see holding [rates] where they are and taking another reading next week, Mr Chairman "
1428,1980-05-06," In Cleveland we would prefer the 10 percent, too; we need the flexibility "
1452,1980-05-20," Mr Chairman, I think this is a time when we need to go back and restudy some of our history on these things The problems of our undershoots and overshoots are a little sobering it seems to me It's a problem, really, of the gaps that occur in this process It's not just [a question of] when we get back on target, because the gaps are never corrected I think our [undershoot] problem is something to be concerned about I share some of Henry's concern as to what we do [later], but it seems to me that we have an even more important problem as to what we do now Consequently, I'm  -20-    5/20/80  in favor of making an effort to get back on path by September But I doubt that even the funds range specified in alternative B is going to do that I think we have to have a wider funds range if we're going to be serious about our efforts, and I'd be inclined to consider a 7 to 14 percent range--not knowing what is happening on that score--as a basis of approaching our target by September rather than December One reason is because the gap between now and December is going to be a painful thing for you to have to testify about in January or February because I think [the members of the Congressional Committees] are loaded for bear Others have studied the misses we have had in the past, and it seems to me that we ought to learn a little from history in our approach to the current problem "
1474,1980-06-05," I join the group   Paul, the steel industry is very much in a state of panic They are really hitting an air pocket in their business   Not when your neighbors are out of work, Paul "
1501,1980-07-09," When we look at gold market developments and some of these flows, I wonder if we're not being a little oblivious to the fact that it's not all economic considerations that are causing them, with the Saudi situation now surfacing In terms of the news, it's a potential Iran We hear rumblings out of places like Nigeria and South Africa that we may get big money market flows, which have nothing to do with interest rate differentials or the economic outlook or anything of [that nature], although I don't know how to put a number on it   On the other hand, with our freezing of the Iranian [assets], if you were a Saudi trying to maneuver would [the United States] be where you'd want to put [funds]? I don't know   I think somebody ought to be optimistic here and try to search for what might be a more positive approach or we are going to have all the probabilities on the wrong side of the forecast Your housing starts figure, as I understand it, is for single-family homes   Well, the inventory of single-family homes is rather a puzzle in terms of the overhanging supply, which may be larger than it seems But in apartments and the whole commercial area, one can't beg, borrow, or steal space One gets the feeling that that could snap back somewhat more quickly than it has in other cycles So that's a positive [note]   Yes, it's starting to pick up in some areas At least the builders and the people in the financing area are talking about a fairly sharp turnaround, Paul So that's a positive Second, if one looks at these declines, how much is psychological and how much is real in terms of the shock effect that we had? And to what extent can we have factors that will go the other way? For example, my guess is that while the 1972 to 1979 budget experience indicates that expenditures fell short [of the estimates], I have greater confidence in the Administration this year so I think that may not be the case We may get a bigger deficit in 1980 than has been projected, [particularly] if we get the tax cut--and at least the discussions of that seem real And perhaps people are not being sophisticated in their analysis and are simply taking the present deficit and then adding on the tax cut, whatever that may be You talked about a deficit in the area of $110 billion for next year In that environment what kind of reaction will we get in terms of peoples' behavior? Third, [in the area of prices] I realize the animal problem gives one pause but, on the other hand, the grain prospects look quite good So I don't know to what extent we might get a stand-off on the food side Psychologically we have the problem that gasoline is about to run out our ears in terms of storage What happens if we start to cut gasoline prices? I realize the Saudis and others are talking about raising [prices for] crude, but what kind of psychological impact will we get from that kind of development and from the scare [tactics]--the ""look what lies ahead with $110 billion deficits"" and that kind of talk? Will we again get some psychological reactions?  We have talked about the shift in demand for money and so forth But when we look at these capital ratios, have we made allowance for that shift in terms of how they will behave, even though you've commented on the deterioration that has occurred versus previous cycles? So, I'm trying to search for things that could give  -26-    7/9/80  us a positive push at this time rather than the more negative kinds of inputs that we hear   Mr Chairman, my posture would be to emphasize the rapidity of change we've experienced and the likelihood that we may encounter continued rapid changes down the road I'd indicate the kinds of changes that have taken place and that may take place in the future I would keep monetary policy unchanged but stress that maintaining policy might involve some fluctuations in interest rates ahead, some of which may be adverse In view of the rapidity of change and the many uncertainties, I would be extremely hesitant to be very specific about next year Inflation developments may go one way or the other in the fall, which may influence [our decision] We have the technological changes with nationwide NOW accounts We have the uncertainty with respect to taxes and a whole set of [unintelligible] So I would be more concerned [about making sure] that policy is appropriate with respect to the changed circumstances, whatever they might be And I'd say that [ranges] will be announced in February, with the thought of then being very specific  With respect to taxes, I would be inclined to talk about tax reform, not just the deficit side of the picture, and to stress the importance of waiting until there is a chance to consider those moves deliberately rather than hastily I am very sympathetic to the social security tax problem--what it means cost-wise, income return, and all the impacts--and the need to do something on the investment incentive side That may require a cut in expenditures, depending on the circumstances when [the Congress] starts to consider this So I think they are caught in that As for wage-price policy, I don't feel that does much good; I'd [rely once again on] market forces   Mr Chairman, we've talked about the impact on the international scene, which I recognize Is there any impact on fiscal policy in terms of what we do in this period? For example, if [money growth] comes in low and we don't lower the funds rate, are we really pinning ourselves to the wall in terms of people saying we are not going to support anything [to spur the economy], so it has to be done with fiscal policy? Then we might get a bigger tax cut than we'd otherwise get I don't know the answer to that, but we don't want to miss that side of the equation either   Well, let's say the money supply falls short   That's right; I mean that whole area   Why don't we move the M2 rate up to 9 percent and make it 7, 8, and 9 percent?   But they tell us that M2 is going to be out of line, so what the heck   I think it's time for a compliment I'd like to compliment the Bluebook this time I thought it was very helpful and very good "
1520,1980-07-25," This is Willis Winn I agree with you, Paul Do you want to put in any remark saying that, of course, in February these circumstances that we've footnoted may cause us to alter these?   No, no   That's good   And Cleveland "
1546,1980-08-12," I have to differ with my colleague on the left on price expectations I sense quite a feeling that our inflation  -16-    8/12/80  problem is not behind us Labor is very restive, with food costs being a real trigger for their demands Secondly, new car prices are going to surprise people Every business that I can find is quietly trying to raise its prices to position itself In that kind of environment, I think there's an explosive side The other factor is the political environment on top of that, with everybody trying to out-promise everybody else If we just look at what has happened to sensitive materials prices in the last few weeks as well as all of the others, it seems to me that, despite our roller coaster ride, we have not dented inflation expectations very much I think we have a real groundswell for an explosive development on that side again In spite of all we've done, we haven't laid to rest the inflation expectations very much   I am a bit on the fence I guess I'd join those who favor splitting [the difference] in terms of the target set-up I'm a little confused, as I listen to the conversation, as to whether we're following our resolve to try to target the aggregates or whether we're back on an interest rate course It seems to me that we've all based this [analysis] on a projection of growth in the aggregates that may or may not occur If it doesn't, then it seems to me that we have some responsibility to get the path back up and let the [funds] rate hit the bottom If the aggregates explode, it seems to me that we have to face the interest rate problem right now And we will have deferred it I've been around this table for some time, and I've seen us drag our feet time after time and then get caught in a real squeeze I'd rather face it now if this explosive problem--   No, I wouldn't bias it upward I'd wait and see what happens But if the aggregates explode, it seems to me we'd have to face it "
1559,1980-08-22," A part of it is certainly this social security thing, but not all of it   How much of it is due to the shift that's going on in the payment mechanism? Some of these banks may be trying to get ahead of the NOW account phenomenon by shifting over the ATS accounts and that sort of thing   Let's hope it doesn't look really bad to us in September   Goodbye and have a good rest, Paul "
1583,1980-09-16," Paul, I wonder if the October 6th anniversary date doesn't give us an opportunity to make some educational efforts that are unrelated to the current market scene to reaffirm some of these things   Paul, personally, I have been surprised at the bounceback I don't know how many more months it will take to convince me that I'm wrong on that score, but I still have a question mark But I think we have lost our benchmarks regarding the impact of certain things on economic activity Take interest rates, for example, and the changes in financing practices that have taken place to offset [the effects of changes in interest rates] There is all this building being done now with different kinds of financing where the interest rate per se is not as high, but a 10 percent gross kicker is established on top of any interest rate so that whenever we raise the level of rates it doesn't necessarily change the outlook in the [usual] sense of the term [Lenders] have gone to financing that is not long-term; it's a 30-year commitment with a rollover every five years and a 2-1/2 percentage point change in interest rates either way adjusted over that [5-year] period of time So there has been a lot of adaptability--in terms financing structures--to changes in rates, just as we have had adaptability in terms of money I'm impressed as I watch the checks on the money funds flow through our office When you see a check for $12 million drawn against balances that don't exist, you wake up to what is being measured and what velocity means There was an announcement this morning by Master Charge about their introduction of new check concepts and plastic money to replace some of our measures [of money] So, again, I think our benchmarks in terms of what we do [and the impact on] economic activity need to be reexamined  On the other side, I'm impressed with the sociological changes that are taking place in our society Part of this goes back to the inflation issue We ought not miss the polarization that is taking place in society between those who are being pinched by inflation and those who are not It's no longer just a racial issue; it's showing up in a variety of ways And that scares me, frankly, as  -26-    9/16/80  I ponder what it means down the road When one talks to doctors and psychologists and others about what complaints they hear [from patients], one finds that finance has suddenly become the biggest factor in their consultations Personal bankruptcies in Ohio are the third or fourth largest in the nation and they are growing Again, our benchmarks are lacking in terms of our ability to appraise what is happening on that score There is a certain segment of our society that is really being squeezed by inflationary developments, and food prices are only going to add to this So the pressure for a tax cut is going to be very real The problem is that it won't really address the problem It will just bail out a few people and the issue will come back again down the road   Mr Chairman, I share the concern over the change in the funds rate range in alternative B and I would prefer to see it at 8 to 14 percent Or, if we are going to move it, I would move the top range as a signal without an intent to use it But it seems to me that is the wrong way to signal what the staff had in mind Secondly, I'd remind us of the considerable literature that we have created that is less than three months old on the shortfall and its desirability and so on and so forth and the feeling that we need to perform this time if we are ever going to I would favor alternative B or something even a little less with a chance to review it after experience I do not feel that this [decision] is carved in granite and can't be changed, but I'd set out on that course because certainly we have underestimated more often than we have overestimated   Don't we have to have a discount rate assumption, though, to make that borrowing assumption? "
1607,1980-10-21," Could I make one comment, Paul, before the break? We pay a lot of attention to the shortcomings of our quantity measures Are we paying enough attention to the shortcomings of some of the national aggregate measures that we are trying to [deal] with? I don't have a feel as to whether the underground economy is more or less than it used to be But I'm becoming more and more skeptical of some of these national figures that we are using in some of these other areas   That's my feeling So I'm wondering, in terms of what we are trying to do to the national figures, if we are really keying [our actions] to the real changes that are taking place   Mr Chairman, I have several comments First, with respect to the forecast, it seems to me that it's based on the internalities of our economy rather than the externalities I don't know how to recalculate it, but it seems to me we have oil problems and military problems [If one is] just conscious of what we're shipping overseas at the moment, one can't miss the kinds of activities that are going on, and they are going to have a delayed effect Second, if one looks at the figures and then takes a small sample--and I realize the danger of samples, but try to go to a  -30-    10/21/80  shopping center some weekend You can't find a place to park If you go in, you can't believe the prices they're charging And people are all saying Well, the price is only going to get higher; we better buy it now And when you add to that what I see in the agricultural area, with foreign demand springing from China and Russia and other places, the inflation pressure is very real to a whole host of people So the saving rate decline wouldn't surprise me a lot, given what we see people doing It seems to me that somehow that [inflation] expectation has to be halted And if the externalities get out of hand on us, which we really haven't factored in [to the forecast], we will have an explosive situation on that side of the coin that we haven't thought about too much Consequently, I lean rather strongly to the feeling that with all the publicity that has been given to our activities we at least have to do our best to perform because there are not many areas in which people have much confidence these days Going back to my college days where A was a good mark, I guess I'd strive for an A+ I'd not be too aggressive, but it seems to me that we really have to lean against the [tide] this time "
1633,1980-11-18," To step back a little on the economic picture, Paul, I am concerned about two things One is the energy situation While at the moment we are faced with a glut of storage space for oil  -24-    11/18/80  in this country and temporarily have a big supply hanging over the market, trying to get a fix on what is happening in the Middle East is extremely difficult I came back from there with reports of from 3 to 10 years to put things back together In this country we are talking about 3 to 10 months I don't know what the truth of the matter is, but I think we are more heavily exposed to energy problems than we have been in the past If [those problems materialize], the price implications are very scary for agriculture and [many other sectors] because of the energy situation Things are happening, and we have had an interruption of supply And not to try to get a better fix on that is a serious mistake   They are talking about big increases in prices this time, and that really scares me My second observation--and this is perhaps a sample of one--is that I can't help but be impressed by the amount of military supplies that are being moved to the Middle East And that makes me think that defense expenditures in real terms are going to be much larger than anything we see in the budget figures today I realize that the expenditures have gone up but it seems to me that the assumption built into the models needs to be questioned seriously And this could alter the budget figures, resulting either in offsetting [cuts] in other areas or again an uncertainty in the picture that hasn't been completely built into the forecast for next year   I am afraid we are going to get both [higher] energy costs and a big increase in defense expenditures   Tighter, sir   Yes, I came back very much depressed about the inflation picture over there and the complacency with which they face it--the efforts to index it and then to juggle the index, the whole problem of what it is doing to the economy, the brain drain that has set in and the implications of that I think it's a complacency that we just can't buy in this country   Israel and Egypt   But don't we have to consider the trajectory effect on 1981? To take the end of the year as the horizon with regard to where we want to be I think is the wrong [approach]  -40-    11/18/80   What do you consider to be the normal rate at this time? "
1672,1980-12-05," Paul, this is Willis I haven't any objection to the statement of the principle I would feel a little more comfortable if we [lifted] the federal funds range and told the Desk not to go above 18 or 19 percent, except temporarily "
1689,1980-12-12, Winn Okay 
1715,1980-12-18," Mr Chairman, what sort of rules do we have with respect to moving the other way with this deck of cards in our hands? Is there a tendency as we pile up more reserves to want to peg rather than to smooth or whatever? I'm not quite sure what either of those terms means, but--   Scott's comments are what scares me in the sense of the profit and loss being confused with the intervention issues It seems to me that's the danger of large balances--that one starts to use them in the profit sense of the term rather than stabilization I'd like to hear the pros and cons of establishing swap agreements when we're not under pressure as a way of doing this intervention versus the holding of large reserves   Well, we protect ourselves with swap agreements so we can get funds if we need them rather than--   That's right  -20-    12/18-19/80   Paul, this morning I feel as if I have been sitting with a group of blind people describing a passing scene and I'm starting to lose confidence in my seeing-eye dog I would like to try not to repeat what has been said [since I] share many of their feelings But I'll pick up a little on our credibility problem in trying to find how we go from where we are to where we ought to be [in terms] of having a realistic target It seems to me that several things might be said on that score First, we are where we are and there's no use trying to assume some other basis; we have to go from where we are But we could aspire still to get back into what we think would be appropriate target ranges that have some relationship to what we've decided in the past The critical issue is the time period that we say it's going to take us to get there It may not be within the year; it may take us longer than that to work in that direction But that at least should be in our statement Second, we should recognize that we are dealing with a number of variables here We tend to concentrate on the Ms And I think the shifts that Jerry was talking about have effects on the velocity of money and at least we ought to get that more into the conversation, not that we understand what's happening on that score We have price developments and we probably should pay a little more attention to some of these than we do For example, I got nervous about commodity market developments and the speculative activity and the credit being used in some of these areas Maybe we should be somewhat more vocal on some of these things rather than ignore them   No, it's not that, but maybe we should take another look We don't have control over the margins in all areas, but I'm not sure those are all proper in this kind of environment On the output side, I have a gut feeling that the year may turn out to be stronger than we're expecting rather than weaker I say that for several reasons One is that we may have a sharper decline in the first part of the year than some of us are expecting But what strikes me is the underlying demand that is building up in a number of areas, from autos to office space and certainly housing If attitudes change and the environment changes, we could have a sharper snapback in some of these areas than many of us are expecting  So, I would still stay with trying to address our concern about prices through our targets I would not try to confuse people by shifting, although I recognize all the shortcomings of the present measurements that we have I would build the targets from where we are, but with regard to what we thought our targets zones would be And I'd accommodate the concerns of Henry and others in this area; maybe we ought to think not of a symmetrical zone around the median point, but [aim] somewhat on the lower side--perhaps 2/3 below and 1/3 above it That may help us a bit in terms of the kinds of pressures that will build externally should the numbers fall short during the early part of the year And hopefully doing it that way will avoid some of the pressures for a very sharp reduction in interest rates should the quantities fall short of [our targets] I'd talk a little about our hope to be back in that zone over a period of time And that doesn't have to be fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter; it could be somewhat longer You will recall, Paul, our visit with some business people [in my District] I interpreted them as recognizing the pain,  -52-    12/18-19/80  but they didn't really see any other show in the works that would help us relieve it While some of them were feeling [the pain], they weren't suggesting that we remove it In spite of the outcries we're getting in other areas, I think we ought to try to balance that with [unintelligible] across the board   Are these numbers internally consistent?   You're going to specify the borrowing at-- "
1744,1981-02-02," Mr Chairman, I would like to join John in complimenting the staff for what I thought were the right procedures of really looking at what we have done and trying to learn some lessons from it One of the technical developments last fall, particularly, was the development of excess reserves Did we really ever focus on what happened on that to throw us off in terms of--   Well, I tried with our banks, and some of them that suddenly have acquired branches or tried to consolidate their holding company operations really got fouled up in their calculations But we didn't find a heck of a lot in our District; I've tried that And many of them who denied that they held any excess reserves, when they really got into their figures found that they had them So, sometimes it's a matter of their not knowing what they're saying   Paul, could I ask one more question? If we looked at our cyclical experience in the past where the fluctuations were wider than we would have liked, do you think we could have used various types of smoothing techniques, such as subsidiary targets-- whether you used credit or nonborrowed reserves or any of those things? Of course, our experience is very short lived But you do get some smoothing effect from that On the other hand, that's a [unintelligible], and other problems could arise   To try to eliminate the fluctuations In addition to using the procedures we had, if we had had a subsidiary target with respect to nonborrowed reserves or credit or any of those things to modify considerably your intervention points--   You get different intervention points   I don't know what we're voting on   The forecast falls out from our model and I think the question we need to ask is How good are the assumptions? One of them, as I understand it, is that you have assumed that there is no real change in the international situation I'm not sure that's a fair assumption, although I'm not predicting as Henry is that it's going to fall apart on us But that's one assumption Second, I think we've overlooked a rather basic change, which Ed Boehne referred to, and that is the change in psychology that has occurred in the last month, which may turn out to be false expectations I would mention the fact that advertising sales are really quite high The television chains report that they have sold out for the first quarter, which is really a rather surprising development given the pessimism in certain areas That has been a pretty good leading indicator in the past; it may not prove to be this time But if you talk to business people whom you would expect to be distressed and depressed, they're fairly optimistic Whether this is based on the psychology of a change in government and what is going to come out of that, and if it doesn't quite work out that way we will get disappointment in reaction, I don't know But the first half of the year could turn out to be a lot stronger than any of us expects Automobile sales could be stimulated by the [higher] energy costs rather than depressed, for example So,  -94-    2/2-3/81  I think one could make a case for a somewhat stronger outcome than the model   Well, you have quite an expository problem The only advantage I see is that now instead of targets [unintelligible] the Shadow Committee [unintelligible] I think continuity in exposition requires that we keep our numbers in line with last year as a starting point The only thing we can do honestly is to promise adjustments and information as it develops I think we have to give them, for instance, what the adjusted range would be at the moment in order to compare it with the figures as they are published because that's what people are going to judge them by And I think we have to be on record as recognizing that these targets are on the old basis--I don't see any way we can avoid that--and then promise that as adjustments and information develop you will be back to indicate what that means To me the difference between alternatives I and II is really not as important as is the recognition that we still are faced with the problem of trying to reduce the ranges I find alternative I acceptable Because of the continuity and exposition problem, I'd reduce the M2 and M3 ranges at this point We might have to go back and change that, however, as things unfold So, I'd be inclined to start with alternative I [for M-1A and M-1B], with 6 to 9 percent and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent on M2 and M3 For bank credit we probably have to raise the range a little in light of market developments   In this wonderful world of exposition that we're faced with, are you troubled by the imaginary targets that we're setting out and then an imaginary short-term target that's above the ranges that we prescribed? That seems to me to become a difficult problem   That's why I'd like to come in at least between ""B"" and ""C"" I'd put a restraint on the funds rate being over 20 percent instead of-- "
1765,1981-02-24," Mr Chairman, this is Willis I have two or three things One is that we have one method now of addressing our base drift problem with these developments and we really didn't address that in our previous discussion Second is that loan demand is not off as much at the small banks, I think, as it is at the large banks with the shift into commercial paper, given the lagging prime rate And third, a technical way of achieving the same purpose--although I think it would be far more difficult to explain--would be to drop the band but at the same time raise the discount rate That would do almost the same thing, although it's more difficult to explain, that we'd accomplish with raising the borrowing assumption above the $1 billion base--    2/24/81   I think that's right, Paul, but it's another way to do it   Immaterial to me, Paul "
1790,1981-03-31," Mr Chairman, I feel that we're really trapped or tripped up by our own procedures We built in the expectation that we've lowered the ranges and yet we make no allowance for base drift in our targets   That's right That would be my point We're in the upper end of the old range even though we're below the range for the--   Well, that again is where we've tripped up If we start to adjust the aggregates for the transaction part of money market funds, that is clearly one thing It's not the total money market funds, but we see the transfers going through on our check clearing operations, so they are being used Second, we have RPs and Eurodollars and one can argue how much of that belongs in the picture And if we adjust the aggregates on a real M-1B or transaction type basis, it results in a much higher figure than we're reporting So, not only have we got our targets out of focus but the bullets [with which] we're trying to hit the targets all seem off to me We really have two major sources of confusion for which I'm afraid we're going to get beaten over the head no matter what evolves Add onto that a look at the economic analysis We have inventory certainly tight or under control; we have consumers who certainly have behaved far stronger than anybody thought they would, but they're continuing to do that; we've projected construction expenditures in office buildings, apartment houses, and hotels that really are starting to jump in a very big way; and we have the stimulus from the deficit that's certainly a pretty big one And we ought to recall that we've been projecting declines since 1979 Now, one of these times we may get that, but we're not sure we're going to get that So we're higher in the range than we think we are We're much higher if we adjust the aggregates And we may have a stronger economic picture than we think we are facing All of these factors give me pause as we start to set our objectives for the next three months   Oh, no, ""B"" to ""C,"" or something like that "
1812,1981-04-28," Paul, what does this do to M2?   Paul, do you get any indication of institutional stresses and strains?   I was just wondering if the interest rate pickup is going to cause panic in certain sectors   I agree "
1855,1981-05-18," One of the interesting areas is the steel industry, which is running currently almost at capacity How much of that is inventory building is not quite clear, but think about what would happen if automobile sales should pick up or--this is hard to determine--if defense orders start to flow to a greater extent than they have previously We'd have a really tight bind with respect to steel The second thing is that if you look at retail sales across the board, and they have been very strong, [our sources] all report that it is for top-of-the-line merchandise The bargain stuff isn't moving very well This is not a feeling of weakness in my judgment in terms of what is happening there One has to watch this comparison with last year--which is how retailers report sales--because of the credit crunch and the difference in when Easter falls and other things But retailers thought sales would tail off after Easter and they are continuing quite strong even through last week, which is a rather strange phenomenon The third point I'll make is that on John's point about office building and other kinds of activities we may have a bit of a booby-trap in this area in that most of those have been financed on construction loans without take-outs in some instances And the question is With the change in interest rates, what kind of take-out set-up are we going to have for some of these things? They went ahead with the buildings thinking that if they couldn't find financing, they would sell them We may have more for sale here suddenly than some people have expected And this is a financial booby-trap out there that may or may not snap at us   They add it onto the price, Tony They just jack the price up  [VICE  But that's with no change in the rate of flows in and out If we have any kind of increased disintermediation, that would precipitate it in a heck of a hurry   Mr Chairman, there are several things we haven't really talked about this morning, including the international situation, the Middle East, and a number of other things that certainly could alter the outlook very quickly A second point is that I'd be very happy if somehow we could get away from the check writing privileges on these money funds, because I think we are exposed there with the funds investing in issues that could go sour on them We may have more volatility built into this than we are thinking about The third is that we talk about targets as if they were fixed and we forget base-drift and a whole lot of history that goes into them I'm not sure that hitting the midpoint of our new range is what we really ought to be doing A little miss on the low side might be more helpful than misses on the high side I'm disturbed by the M2 and M3 figures, which tend to go on the high side in this set-up On the other hand, I have some sympathy with Lyle's point of view in that I'd hate to see us run the rates up and then run them right back down again That would not be very helpful in terms of our longer-run objectives To take a stance at this time, I would be content to be able to hit somewhere between ""B"" and ""C"" rather than to set a target and then be all over the lot in terms of our performance I, too, would be inclined to raise the borrowing objective to help move in that direction; I'd go to $21 billion or something in that neighborhood as a first move   Is it through June or to June, Paul? I'm worried about the lack of [unintelligible] "
1892,1981-07-06," Mr Chairman as I listen to this and think back over what we've had to read, I become more and more impressed with the fact that we are hung by our own petard in the M-1B concept If one really tries to convert that to a deposit category, and makes any allowance for the money funds and for repos, then the whole perspective changes One's whole interpretation and thinking about this changes I just think we are hanging onto something that is not very real I know the difficulty of trying to get rid of it, but it certainly--   It really alters one's whole perspective on this to think about it in a realistic sense   Well, I think one understands it a lot better if one thinks of it in terms of the behavior being somewhat different than reported   Sure You get a much higher growth rate if you convert this We talk to people who are using money funds for their deposits; they're banking the rest of it Something has to give   My thought is that if you change the measurement of what we call [M-1B], then you get a different behavior path And you get a different outlook on this whole history as well as on current developments   That's right   Mr Chairman, we've mentioned very little about wages, but we have the backdrop of the air traffic controllers, the upcoming post office [negotiations], and baseball as another indication of the popular mood on wages   I don't see much easing of inflation occurring It may show up But at the moment, with utility rates going up and the possibility of food [price increases], the mood in the public toward inflation easing isn't very evident Everybody is looking more for it to hold [steady]   My second point is that in talking around--I've been in the building game a little recently--builders all complain that they haven't had a chance to increase their prices in the last two years because of the status of housing They are all sitting there with [price hikes of] 20 percent or more ready to go anytime there's a little uptick in the housing area Now, this may be wishful thinking, but they certainly are not psychologically adapted toward holding the line Finally, all our scenarios suggest a smooth process developing I just think about all the uncertainties and the questions I don't think we have a year to go on the thrift industry before we start to see some major shifts of funds I don't know whether it will be people getting scared and shifting funds, or an acceleration [of flows] into the money funds, or a money fund going kaput Then we could wake up with $100 billion more looking for a place to go We may have major problems from crises and movements of money, which are going to impact institutions in a way we don't foresee And that's going to be the biggest psychological change to take place in the period ahead   Mr Chairman, I'm impressed with the power of the number We should remind ourselves that [when] we were sitting here a year ago and thinking about the future we forgot base drift in setting our targets If we go back and adjust for that and secondly if we adjust for the changes that have occurred in M-1B--and the Michigan survey, I think, does not include corporations' use of money funds in the transactions balance set-up--the adjustment probably is in the other direction [If] we were sitting around the table at the moment faced with the fact that we were over our targets, not under our targets because of the base-drift problem and the adjustment of M-1B, I wonder what our reactions would be I think we can get trapped by the numbers we're playing with here if we're not careful  Second, contrary to the view most people have expressed, I'd be very strongly in favor of changing our targets at the moment I think we're going to get trapped next spring if we don't Suppose we're successful in the sense of coming in at the lower end or less; that becomes our base, if we use precedent on this score Think what kind of adjustments we're going to have to make and to explain at that stage to make this fit any kind of economic analysis related to those that we've heard If we're not careful, we're going to be increasing our numbers in February I feel it's much easier to try to explain it now Also, if we set targets, we ought to try to shoot for the midpoint When we set targets and say we're going to shoot at the lower end or less, I think we're playing games a little Moreover, if we have to make an adjustment, I think it is easier to make it now and then not make one in February I think we have ourselves trapped by this annual review, particularly when we base it on where we are rather than on having some continuity in the series over time I'd be in favor of making the adjustment now and, if we're lucky, that would bring us closer to the midpoint of the adjusted range Then we would not have to make a change on an annual basis to make a continuous effort to achieve our inflation objective It seems to me that we ought to avoid getting trapped into basing our ranges on where we are and do it rather on a continuous series over time   I remind the group that we come back together in about six weeks, so we are not casting this in cement for the next six months I'd be inclined to somewhere between ""B"" and ""C"" with the funds rate range of 15 to 21 percent or something of that nature and $14 billion in borrowing "
1931,1981-08-18," Mr Chairman, we have been sitting around waiting for a recession to happen now for a good many years, and I couldn't help but notice driving down yesterday that Lordstown, which is one of the large GM operations, had probably the fullest parking lot I've seen in the last five or six years in terms of employees' cars   That's right This may just be a temporary build- up, which could be shut off quickly when the cars don't sell, but I was interested in the obvious employment there Secondly, I am surprised in talking with my business friends how few of them appreciate that the corporate tax benefits are effective in 1981, not 1982 They were effective on January 1, 1981 and we may have some realizations on that score that give rise to some activity in the fall On the other hand, when the realization hits of the size of the deficit inherent in the present tax and spending programs, we may get some reactions the other way based upon the amount of budget cuts that still have to be made, if they are going to be anywhere close to it   Just one comment, Mr Chairman I'm not sure I understand completely the economic implications of the redistribution of the retail sales figures, in which the upper end of the price range is the big factor in supporting sales and the lower end is having a real struggle When you add on to that the implications of the tax bill, I think we're seeing a rather widespread shift in the distribution of income and I'm not sure I understand all the economic implications of that "
1957,1981-10-05," Just one question To what extent did the Libyan pull-out [of funds] from this country affect the rate movement?   Yes If I understand, there was a big withdrawal of Libyan funds from this country   Transfer   I'd just raise a question about the margin and the valuation [for System repurchase agreements] What is the margin requirement?   I'll say a couple of things One is that many of the small businesses are holding on and as such they're delaying or [canceling] any orders for new equipment and delaying expansion, so we're going to get some secondary effect from this curtailment Many of them have worked out financing arrangements at under prime so they get a little relief on that score, and the banks have been cooperating with them on that to hold them together They complain about the large companies not paying their bills more than [about] one another; they say the large [companies are] carrying themselves through the impact on some of the smaller companies And this is a source of complaint Strangely enough, none of them that I've heard really [favors] a change in Fed policy They realize it's tough, but they want us to hang with it still Another point is that if we look at large capital investments and that sort of thing, it's interesting to see the changes that are taking place in the debt/equity ratios It used to be that a firm financed a building [entirely with] debt and no equity and now the ratio is up to about 50/50, which is an interesting turnaround in terms of the financing arrangements in our area My concern is largely that the crunch is going to come with some of the financial institutions, not with some of the business firms, and that the unexpected fallout or the repercussions may send shock waves through the system They talk about months until the end of the line   Yes   No, there are a few banks   That's right That is the thing I think is the real [unintelligible] side of it   Some of our large national companies have quietly renegotiated the COLA contracts out of their labor agreements I think that's a very positive step   Does anybody have a feel for what federal government policy is going to be on this score?   Mr Chairman, I would mention the fact that the fiscal outlook has changed rather substantially since our last meeting, and that's going to have an expectational effect that will probably put us to a much greater degree at the friction point here in terms of our struggle I don't think we should ignore that aspect   Mr Chairman, I get a little nervous about the 42-day gap before our [next] meeting with any of these specifications I don't know how to assess the Sadat situation I don't know whether we're faced with the problem of increasing retardation in business activity or whether this is temporary and the economy will bounce back I'd hate to see us with any of these limits with a negative rate of growth of M-1B in October That's not viable in terms of the political side On the other hand, I don't want a precipitous rate decline I'd rather put some sort of limit on the M-1B growth and a narrower funds range and in 20 days consult again as to what the implications some of these rather dramatic events are going to have for us To set up wide specifications for a 42-day period I think is a mistake at this juncture I'd prefer something between ""B"" and ""C"" in terms of the aggregates and I'd like to consult at the 13 percent level [on the funds rate] But I'd sure hate to see that [rate] go up over 16 percent at this time until we have a better feeling as to which way to turn By the end of the period we may have to make changes on both of these   Maybe we should resolve never to meet on October the 6th "
1982,1981-11-17," Mr Chairman, it disturbs me to sit here and let us contemplate what is really a fiction, which is these numbers that we're going by I'm watching the volume of our check clearings in Columbus suddenly shoot up, which is an unusual phenomenon at the moment If you look into that, it's unbelievable the money fund transfers that are being put through by one our Columbus banks I wonder if the numbers we are dealing with here were closer to the reality of transactions balances if we'd have the same kinds of reactions we're having to these numbers To play these numbers out seems to me to be a serious mistake in terms of transactions balances against the economy I think these are too low in terms of reality if we adjust for the money funds, which are growing very rapidly [based on] the push being made, at least in our District, not only in terms of large corporations but of individuals moving into these money funds The pressure is really very great to get individuals to convert into money funds, which are transaction balances It seems to me that it would behoove us to move promptly to find out what proportion of these money funds is in fact transactions balances and to start to factor that into our thinking about these aggregates, if this becomes a guide in terms of our policy  My second point is that it seems to me we're stuck not only with arbitrary numbers but that our perspective is too short If we think a bit longer term about what we're trying to do, we get away from some of these extremes in our thinking concerning this 5-week period Third, to try to get away from this damn base drift problem, which is going to kill us on the one side as it did last year on the other, I'd put this in perspective by going back to the fourth quarter of '79 and then making some growth rate projections out into these periods for what it takes to get us on a reasonable path from that level until the March figure gives us somewhat different numbers than have been presented to us here So, this is a series of things that we need to think about in our policy considerations  -10-    11/17/81  On the economic front, I have a concern which is not shared by my colleagues, I must confess I think we've kind of gotten over the interest rate bulge temporarily here in terms of pressure on corporations But I have a feeling that the profits squeeze is setting in and that some managements are going to throw in the towel and that we're going to have more financial problems in the months ahead than I think are factored into some of these forecasts I don't know what the fallout of that is going to be in terms of psychology [and the effect on] this turnaround that is projected in the months ahead This really is causing me concern because of the fallout that would have for financial institutions that think they're in pretty good shape and could suddenly wake up with some rather sick loans on their hands that really aren't [known by] the public   That's right   Can't we go back and take a look at some of these accounts and see to what extent they really have--?   What strikes me is the number of people one talks to who are becoming aware of them and now starting to use them That really is accelerating   That's the thing I think in the last few months we've seen a really marked shift into this sort of account   What's that going to say? "
2012,1981-12-21," The other Polish problem is their debt Do we have any feeling at all on when that will start to come to a head?   The end of the year is the due date, is it?    12/21-22/81   There are more than the Polish loans out there that are in trouble The insurance industry reports a considerable increase in the amount of problem loans Our Canadian friends have come down and done a big real estate investment without taking out financing, so some of the office building complexes are in a peculiar status at the moment, and they may be coming on the market My guess is that the building boom has about run its course--well, it may go another year--but that office space is starting to show up as a little on the heavy side across the country   I would like to join the chorus of those who are calling for a re-examination of these measurements because I think we are just playing mumbo-jumbo with the numbers game now I think we can do a better job of providing measurements of what money is all about And until we do that, Fed targets don't make much sense to me because we just explain them away by all these deviations In Columbus, for example, our money market fund clearings have gone from 25,000 a day to 115,000; that gives you some idea of the kind of activity that is going on in that area This is the Merrill Lynch clearing setup And here is a backward way of getting into that measurement   On the money market funds   I think we have to get on with the measurements [As for] Frank's point on seeking other measurements, unless we have some measure of the reserve base or something else, we don't really have reserveable assets involved in the money concept I just think we must get on with an attempt to remeasure some of these magnitudes They may not be very accurate, but they are a lot better than reaching in the dark for some numbers that really don't mean anything And then if we don't hit them, we explain it away because of all these deviations In view of that uncertainty, I would prefer to stay right where we are with these targets but to get on with the recalculation of some of these numbers Unless we do that, we won't have any way of establishing a reserve basis for these items We are playing more and more an inequitable game in terms of those who participate in the conventional forms It just behooves us to get on with the problem of measurements I don't think we have any real basis for our shift adjustment; it [involves] numbers that we had some time ago but I don't think those are accurate I urge that we get on with the problem of a re-examination of these targets   Yes, I will make an effort   Chuck, what do you do with M2, then?   I would take to heart your caution that we better look down the road in terms of the short-term target as well as just the immediate problem And I would go along with the 4 and 9 percent on the aggregates because they're in line with our longer-range targets [For the funds range] 10 to 14 percent is fine On the other hand, if the aggregates should come in stronger, a little increase in the rates, not a major one, would not bother me as a warning in terms of what lies ahead So, I would not be upset, if the aggregates were strong, to see a little firming in rates as a warning to what the fall may hold for us "
2039,1982-02-01," Well, the thing that troubles me most in your forecast is the level of unemployment There is very little progress made during the period of the next couple years With the supplemental unemployment benefits starting to disappear and with the situation in the states being worse than projected--I think you get your totals because of Alaska and Texas, which are in very strong positions--we have a widespread absence of support for the [affected] population group, in light of the reduction in some of the federal programs in this area And I think the FDR [television series] is not helping us much in terms of a background on that I sense in the labor movement and in the political movement a stirring that I don't think is going to let this thing grind out in the kind of sequence that we see Then supplement that with further bankruptcies in some of these sectors, and it seems to me that we haven't factored into this [forecast] a scenario that could be quite explosive This level of unemployment is quite different than in previous [recessions] in terms of the hard core element And we're removing support [by scaling down] some of the programs that perform the cushioning effects    2/1-2/82  there So, I think there is more explosiveness in these numbers than is apparent in the actual figures   This is purely a technical change, but a couple of banks with the largest increases in NOWs closed out their ATS accounts, so it was just a transfer And that would still--   [The total would] still be the same, but just for the NOW account category--   Mr Chairman, against the background of the behavior [of M1] in January, I think any changes we make would be subject to a misinterpretation regarding what our intentions are Second, I'm really concerned about the thing we call M1 because it's going to become less and less of a measure of transaction balances I watch [banks] in our District as they tool up for [changes in] cash management, and there are big, big, numbers here that don't show up at all as M1 numbers The sweep accounts also are being tooled up in a big way and that's going to affect behavior, so I think we have a real case [for not changing the ranges] in terms of the changes that are occurring in the aggregates themselves in this period alone Our concern should be to get a better feel for what these numbers really are than on this [unintelligible] that we play out here I'd also focus on the ranges and not the midpoints because the midpoint overemphasizes our precision and our ability to achieve these things  -46-    2/1-2/82 -47-  Third, it seems to me, with this uncertain economic background, that we can't just stay with this willy-nilly And we ought to factor that into the report that is made at this time, saying that as things change, we too will reexamine what we're trying to achieve "
2065,1982-03-29," What is the status of the Polish financing? Doesn't that come up at the end of this month again?    3/29-30/82   Could I raise one more question, Mr Chairman? What's the status of Mexico, with the devaluation?   Steve, does your Arima [seasonal] adjustment allow for the change in the tax structure this year--that because of the change in the tax laws we shouldn't have the borrowing that formerly accompanied the corporate tax bills and so forth?   That is going to be a big change, I think, in the way it affects--   Could I raise a question? Thinking about Peter's recitation of the policy actions taken over the past months, and then looking back a bit over history, how do you answer the question Has the policy caused or prevented short-run variability in monetary growth?   I'll be brief One, I think there's too much doom and gloom here   If you look at the cyclical figures, they don't look as bad to me as the early '70s cycle While unemployment is    3/29-30/82  high, it started from a much higher level, so the decline [in employment] is really not that great And if you look at the possibility for inventory adjustment and an inventory cycle and then factor in the tax cut at midyear, it seems to me that we have some very positive forces there  The second comment I'd make is that [I wonder if] we really have adjusted our thinking for the changes taking place in fiscal policy I must confess that [a deficit of] $160 billion blows my mind as does the [potential for] crowding out But I think we have to recognize that it's a quite different kind of deficit in the sense that previously we had the tax rebate or whatever that was called and then [the financial system] had to turn around and lend to corporations to supply the goods to take care of the [unintelligible], so there really was a double whammy in the finance market Today we have the problem that--what was the tax savings for IBM, $100 million? And while that shows up in the deficit, IBM is out of the market by that amount If you look at the savings certificates and IRAs and other accounts, again there is a different impact on the market from this deficit in terms of financial demands than we had previously It's not in the sense of $160 billion to zero by any manner of means, but I wonder if we don't overplay the size of the problem just a bit I'm not saying that I'm happy with the $160 billion deficit, but in terms of its impact on markets we may not get the crowding out because we may get a change in demand And the deficit is really financing a lot of the savings and corporate needs that otherwise would show up in the open market   Interesting   My concern is the reported understatement of M1 in terms of our money funds, the sweep accounts, and all these other phenomena If that were constant, I wouldn't be so concerned; but I think it's a growing proportion, so we may be getting more growth there than we recognize With that in mind, I'm a little sympathetic to the problem of getting beyond April and what we do from there I would associate myself with the comments being made with respect to ""B"" leaning a little toward ""C"" "
2116,1982-06-30," I have it ""It is the sense of the Congress that if Congress acts to restore fiscal responsibility and reduces projected budget deficits in a substantial and permanent way, then the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee shall reevaluate its monetary targets in order to assure that they are fully complementary to a new and more restrained fiscal policy"" "
4654,1992-11-17," [Unintelligible] only from Mr Gonzalez and only from his staff or Mr Auerbach We don't know what the new subcommittee chairman's agenda may be A footnote Steve Neal is still trying to keep [the chairmanship of] both the financial institutions and the monetary policy [subcommittees] But whether that will work out or not remains to be seen I would note that back in 1977--   Dick, if I go back to this survey that Steve Neal did in 1976 I'm afraid I don't have a very good answer for you because he didn't put the question in those terms Although there were a number of respondents who in reacting and addressing the issue of verbatim transcripts or memoranda of discussion said such things as ""but I also favor an immediate release of the policy directive,"" that wasn't really the issue on the table Obviously, immediate release of FOMC decisions is the issue in the Hamilton-Dorgan Bill Clearly, there are some members of Congress who are interested in that, but we don't know how many That has not moved along in the Congress, but obviously some members are interested in that   Well, I would guess that the members of Congress are more interested in knowing the results and knowing the results  -52-    11/17/92  quickly than in having a detailed record that comes out in three to five years So, if you put it to a vote, it would probably go that way On these public disclosure issues--the Freedom of Information and Government in the Sunshine Acts--the record of Congress is that whenever those kinds of bills are put before them, it is very hard not to vote for them So, if you put the issue on the floor of the House this minute ""Is the House of Representatives in favor of immediate disclosure or not?"" there's a political bias toward immediate release of information On the other hand, the fact that legislation like that hasn't really moved along in the Congress makes one question how much real interest there is in the subject I don't know if that's responsive to your question, but that's the best I can do   We cannot deal with this long-term disclosure of verbatim minutes ourselves because of the Freedom of Information Act problem The only thing that we have any control over is release of the policy directive   Jerry, I'm not sure that I heard all you said   Right, but what were you proposing? You were asking me-- "
4704,1993-01-06," The bill Chairman Gonzalez introduced yesterday does address this issue very explicitly There are two provisions that deal with the issue of disclosure One says that there should be minutes, a transcript, and a videotape--all three--of the meeting that would be made publicly available within 60 days Secondly, there is a provision that says that any determination, decision, directive, or other conclusions by the FOMC must be made available to the public within a week of the meeting So, this one-week provision is a new angle that had not been mentioned in his earlier correspondence or press releases but is now a part of this new legislation Let me also say that I have just finished a written detailed summary of what is in this bill, and I will be putting that in the Pouch to you tonight along with the text of the legislation and a section-by-section summary that his staff did I don't know if the disclosure provisions that I've just described shed much light in terms of how we should deal with the letter It does show what is on his mind "
4885,1993-10-05," Bob, in my conversations with Gonzalez's staff they have indicated that they expect Chairman Greenspan to testify on the broad issues in the legislation on the 13th, but that their view of the hearing on the 19th is that it would be limited to that part of the Bill that deals with minutes, transcripts, videotapes, and their release, plus the questions in the letter I have not explored further with them their motivation behind those questions So, I do not have any information about what they're getting at beyond the statements in the invitation to you They did grant that at the hearing some other members may raise some of the issues in the Bill But they expect that our testimony and written statements would be focused on the minutes issue And I think they're trying to confine the hearing on the 19th to that issue   I've talked to Committee staff and they do expect that each one of you would make an oral statement, but a short one I'd think the written testimony itself would surely be rather short, maybe three or four pages   They have not decided yet on the exact format  -11-    10/05/93   They have invited all of the Governors and virtually all of the Reserve Bank Presidents at this point My last count is that they would have at least 15 of us present I asked how they were going to set it up and they're currently thinking of having the Governors appear first on one panel and then having the Reserve Bank Presidents appear as a second panel but also having Chairman Greenspan remain at the table But they would ask each individual to have a short oral statement   My understanding was that what they expected in the written statement was a reaction to that part of the Gonzalez Bill dealing with the minutes  -12-    10/05/93   And the three questions "
4904,1993-10-15," I think the answer is no I don't have any sense that they have any knowledge whatever of what we've been talking about   I have a few words about arrangements on housekeeping matters on Tuesday They seem pretty mundane after the previous discussion   I have a few points on arrangements We will have 16 witnesses on Tuesday At this point all of the Governors except Vice Chairman Mullins will be there and all of the Presidents except Bob Forrestal and Bill McDonough will be present I am being told by the Committee staff that they are planning to have one large table at which all 16 witnesses will be [seated] Chairman Greenspan will testify first The other members of the Board of Governors will be at the center of the table and the Presidents on either end of the table The other Governors will testify after Chairman Greenspan and then the Presidents will testify They will be asking that you summarize your written statement in a two or three minute time period They will have eight microphones at the table; each of you will have to share a microphone with one other After the initial statements they will have questions They are hoping to adjourn this first panel [around lunch time] They're hoping it won't go later than 1230; it might go to 100 But as you know, they have other witnesses They have Anna Schwartz and Jim Miegs and they have a bond trader from the West Coast who will be talking about the effects of leaks in the market Some of you may be bringing a staff person I believe that I can secure enough seats so that if you do have a staff person we'll be able to accommodate that, but not more than one We will provide transportation to the Rayburn Building from the Board for anyone who wishes to do it that way You may also wish to take a cab directly from your hotel But if you want us to transport you to the Hill, if you are in the Board's garage by 930 we'll be able to get you there We'll leave shortly after 930 We'll also bring you back from the Hill to the Board; we'll have transportation to do that We will be able to provide lunch here at the Board for you  In terms of areas of questioning, I think they plan to try to focus on what they said would be the subject matter of the hearing But it would be well for all of you to have in mind ahead of time and to be able to respond, say, in a paragraph--if anyone were to ask--on what's going on in the economy in your area, Also, I think it's almost inevitable that you will be asked about your view on the provision in Gonzalez's bill that the President of the United States appoint the Reserve Bank Presidents and that they be confirmed by the Senate; it's almost inevitable that people will ask that question   I believe that we now do have a transcript and it will be in this evening's pouch, so you should have it on Monday I think you should also note that in Gonzalez's initial announcement of these hearings he did say that he would ask the Federal Reserve witnesses about diversity, so that subject could come up   We'll make some extra copies so that they'll be available   Yes "
4974,1993-11-16," Bob, I don't think there's any way I can give a clear answer to that question I think to some extent it depends on the decision the FOMC makes with respect to the release of the transcripts or how we may make those transcripts available But I would say that Chairman Gonzalez does make a distinction--at least he has in his letters so far--that while he is interested in the public release of these documents in some orderly way and it appears that there would be some time lag, he is asking at the same time that the raw transcripts be turned over to his Committee So, even if we decide on a program for the public, he is still interested in our turning over all the transcripts and tapes to his Committee And he may pursue that To some extent how the whole Committee would feel about a demand for the raw transcripts may depend on what we decide to do in terms of their release to the public   A majority; [it] would be 26 of the 51   I think there are instances, at least in the past, where committees have delegated to the chairman   That is not the current set of rules in the House Banking Committee   I'm not clear on that   Mr Chairman, the '84 bill would have released transcripts that were between four and five years old  SPEAKER(?) Transcripts or MODs?   I'm sorry, MODs between four and five years old The '79 bill was--   The '79 bill would have released them between three and four years "
5003,1993-12-21," Mr Chairman, I have the letter here in front of me In fact, we have two different letters We have one dated December 17 that said ""Please provide the Committee staff with access to the transcript and tape of the October 15th conference call"" The one on December 3 says ""Please make the transcript and tape of the FOMC conference call available to the Committee staff for review next week"" So it's somewhat ambiguous how they put it I think we can understand it as they--   They called obviously to come down and view the table and the recordings, etc I guess I understood their call to mean they were coming here "
5314,1995-01-31," I agree with your impression, Mr Chairman My understanding from talking with the committee staff is that there was interest on the part of the new chairman of the committee on including something on this subject in legislation Indeed, the bill that was introduced on the first day of the session concerning the Reserve Bank presidents probably would have included a provision dealing with transcript-type issues--maintenance of the transcript, release of the transcript, and the time period for the release Such a provision was left out because there was an understanding on their part that we would be addressing this issue So, the interest in the transcripts subject cannot be thought of as simply a matter that the other side of the aisle was focused on and interested in It is a subject that continues to be of interest in the Congress It is also a subject in which the new chairman of the committee through his staff has expressed an interest to us The expectation on their part is that we would make some kind of policy decision   I would note with respect to dealings with foreign central banks that Congress, back in the late 1970s and the early 1980s when they were considering legislation dealing with the maintenance of transcripts, did contemplate an exemption dealing with foreign central banks that would have allowed us to withhold that information for 30 years   Mr Chairman, when we are dealing with monetary policy, it is a lot easier to defend preserving the confidentiality of a document I think there really is a lot of respect for the independence of the Fed in the Congress When anyone is trying to get information and we can say it relates to monetary policy, we are going to be more successful in defending documents of that nature Where it is not monetary policy--and that was the kind of tape we were dealing with--it is very hard to raise our best arguments in protecting our information I guess that argues for limiting what is taped to monetary-policy types of information It is hard to defend non- monetary-policy types of information from a Congressional request or demand   I really do not have the sense that this is a point of great significance to the Hill people I don't think we need to base our determination in terms of input that we have gotten on that I just cannot report anything significant on either side of the aisle   I think you recall correctly, Mr Chairman, that we came up with it as an alternative to some of the proposals that we were getting from the Hill It is not a Hill proposal "
5460,1995-09-26," I spoke with one of Senator Mack's staff yesterday afternoon with respect to the hearings schedule, asking what the likelihood was I got no specific answer to that question But in the course of the conversation, I did bring up this issue with him as to what their intent was in terms of the Employment Act of 1946 Had they intended to wipe out the employment objectives of the Employment Act? The impression I got was they had not realized that they had eliminated the ""maximum employment"" objectives of the 1946 Act Their response was that they had intended to repeal Humphrey-Hawkins and the various aspects of the Humphrey-Hawkins Act that amend the Employment Act of 1946 as well as the Congressional Budget Act; they had intended to take out those pieces from the Employment Act of 1946 On the other hand, they also said that they had substituted new policy objective language, which I think is on the bottom of page 3 in the copy of the bill that I circulated I mentioned to them that there was no reference to employment in that provision, which relates to the objective of price stability, and it appeared that they had not realized that They seemed to indicate that that had been an oversight on their part There is some indication that they would be willing to make some changes Of course, I was speaking with only one staff person; I don't know how representative that conversation was of the views on the Hill  By the way, on the hearings issue, they really have not planned what they are going to do next They could have more hearings in the Joint Economic Committee or in the Senate Banking Committee; the timing really has not been decided I asked if there is a likelihood of a hearing before the end of the year They said there is a distinct possibility of that   You made the point earlier that in terms of support for this legislation it appears that all of the majority members of the Senate Banking Committee and the JEC seem to have lined up behind this bill A committee staffer told me that after yesterday they also have as sponsors the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, and all of the members of the Senate Republican leadership So, at least in terms of support on one side of the aisle, they feel that they have key members  -50-    9/26/95  of the Senate supporting the legislation Now, obviously the detail of the sponsors' knowledge of this bill is something that has to be considered But in terms of an initial push for this legislation, Senator Mack and his staff are quite pleased by the response they have gotten so far   We have not heard anything   There clearly will be opposition from some important Senators on the Democratic side Senator Sarbanes probably will not be supportive of this legislation "
6156,1999-02-02," It is the reporting requirement that expires, not the goals of the   Federal Reserve Act This doesn’t have anything to do with the goals of maximum   employment, price stability-­   The way the Federal Reserve Act reads, we are supposed to submit   this report on a semi-annual basis and then we are to consult with the Congress on the   report The “consulting with the Congress” has meant the testimony If there is no   report, it is hard to see how there is any obligation to testify on anything    That is my understanding  "
