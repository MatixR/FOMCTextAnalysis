 I think we’re in imminent danger of building  into the economy a higher rate of inflation and of putting ourselves  into a position, with or without a subsequent recession, of having to  work that off and starting from a higher level with less chance [of  success] than we had the last time around It’s not true that we  can’t work off inflation; we did it after the experience of ’74 and  ’15, But we’ve done very poorly of late and our surprises have always  been that we’ve found more boominess in the economy and more inflation  than we expected up through the last forecast which shaded the     3 / 2 0 / 1 9  - 2 3 -    boominess a little So, I see our main risk on the side of inflation  And I fear that we’re in some danger of validating the increase in the  price of oil and accepting that as inevitable I think we ought not  to do that; I’d accommodate this kind of outside shock only partly  It seems clear that the economy is much closer to capacity than we had  thought That is, I think, accountable for a good part of the  pressures we’re getting Whether or not a recession is in the works  is probably something that is beyond the power of monetary policy now  to remedy I think we have more chances of doing something about  inflation than doing something about a recession If there is a  recession, it is likely to be a moderate and short one I have that  reaction because of the fact that it’s so widely advertised and, in  the face of that, business behavior has been to step up plant and  equipment expenditures It seems to me they’re looking beyond the  valley; they can’t possibly be planning to put much [capacity] in  place before some kind of a slowdown occurs Meanwhile, the inflation  pressure is threatening the President’s wage and price program and if  that collapses, we‘ve lost one further instrument It threatens the  dollar and if something happens to [weaken] the dollar, we will have  more inflation All this suggests to me that the dangers are more on  the side of inflation than on the side of the real sector I don’t  want to minimize those real sector risks; I think they are real I  might add that people who are concerned about excessive boominess and  excessive inflation are not just a small minority I’m surprised how  much support one sees around the country, even in the Congress and  even among economists whom we have listened to and not usually found  on the restrictive side--and even, if I may say so ,  amony some people  in the Administration So if we are talking about beds, there are  some prospects for unusual bedfellows here   A s  for the aggregates, I have much sympathy for Steve‘s  analysis I think it is reasonably persuasive except perhaps the  magnitude  something like a proxy for the aggregates, realizing that it’s not a  very good measure of total credit S o  that brings me to what I should  say about policy I think if we fail to do something that recognizes  the threat of greater inflation, we will really add to that inflation  A demonstration [of our anti-inflationary resolve] is needed At a  minimum, I would not relax the funds rate for that reason I’m very  reluctant to push it up because I can see that six months from now we  might regret having done that if the economy has weakened I think  some demonstration--an action on reserve requirements or the discount  rate--might be more [appropriate], within a broader program than this  Committee would ordinarily deal with On the funds rate, I would like  to hear the rest of the discussion   I would look at bank credit at the present time as
