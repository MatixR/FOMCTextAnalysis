8396,2008-10-28,"3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be using the packet with the green  lettering on the cover entitled “Staff Presentation on Nonfinancial Developments”  Over  the intermeeting period, the data we received on real activity were considerably  weaker than we had been expecting  That, combined with the intensification of  financial turmoil since mid-September, led us to significantly mark down our near- term and medium-term projections for economic activity       Your first exhibit focuses on the near-term outlook  As shown by the blue bars in   the top left panel, we currently expect real GDP to fall at an annual rate of slightly  more than 1 percent, on average, in the second half of 2008—a reduction of about  2 percentage points from our projection in the September Greenbook (the red bars)   One factor that has informed our thinking about the near-term forecast is the labor  market, which looks weaker than at the time of the last FOMC meeting  As you                                                     3 The materials used by Mr Morin are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   October 28–29, 2008 47 of 206    know, payrolls fell steeply in September  Since then, initial claims for unemployment  insurance (the black line in the top right panel) have been quite elevated, even after  adjusting for factors that are temporarily boosting claims (the red line)  As shown in  the inset box, the latest claims data point to another sizable drop in employment this  month     Turning to spending, sales of light motor vehicles (plotted in the middle left   panel) have been dismal of late and are expected to stay that way at least through the  end of the year  Motor vehicle sales have been depressed, in part, by financing  constraints, limited sales incentives, a retreat by the automakers from leasing, and  worsening consumer assessments of car-buying conditions  More broadly, as you can  see by comparing the black and red lines in the panel to the right, consumer spending  excluding motor vehicles has been significantly softer in recent months than we were  expecting  In addition, the conditions influencing consumer outlays have worsened  considerably, including a sharp drop in household wealth, tepid real income gains, a  weakening labor market picture, historically low levels of sentiment, and reduced  credit availability  Consequently, as reported in the inset box, we substantially  revised down the projection for overall real PCE in the second half of the year  In the  housing sector, single-family starts, shown in the bottom left panel, fell to about  550,000 units in September—6 percent below our expectation  Even with the  ongoing cutbacks in production, the weak demand has left the months’ supply of  unsold new homes (not plotted) very elevated, and we expect starts to decline well  into next year  In the business sector, the spending data in hand are somewhat stale— tomorrow morning we receive the advance reading on durable goods shipments and  orders in September—but the information we do have points to softening business  investment in the third quarter  Moreover, as shown on the right, the first available  surveys on business activity in October plunged to very low levels     Exhibit 2 summarizes the enormous changes to the key conditioning factors that   we confronted in putting together the staff forecast  As shown in the top left panel,  reflecting the recent plunge in equity prices, the stock market path in this projection is  markedly below the path anticipated in our September forecast  This downward  revision, together with the projected declines in house prices that Bill Bassett  presented in his briefing, leaves the level of the wealth-to-income ratio, plotted to the  right, substantially lower than in the September Greenbook  As a result, over the next  two years, household wealth exerts a much greater drag on consumer spending than  we assumed earlier  Yields and spreads on corporate bonds, illustrated by the Baa  rate in the middle left panel, soared over the intermeeting period  We expect the  higher cost of capital in this forecast to weigh on business capital spending over the  projection period  A further drag on economic activity in the medium term is the  recent jump in the exchange value of the dollar, shown to the right  While we expect  the dollar to decline a touch more quickly than in the September Greenbook, by the  end of 2010 it remains more than 4 percent above the level assumed in our previous  forecast  In addition, as Linda Kole will discuss shortly, the outlook for foreign  activity has deteriorated  A partial cushion to these factors depressing activity is the  plunge in oil prices over the past few weeks; the bottom left panel shows the spot   October 28–29, 2008 48 of 206    price of West Texas intermediate crude oil  The path for oil prices over the projection  period, based on futures quotes, averages nearly $30 per barrel below the September  Greenbook path and should provide some countervailing support to household  purchasing power and consumer spending  As noted to the right, according to our  standard forecasting models, the lower level of equity prices, the higher bond rates,  and the higher exchange value of the dollar—all of which are intertwined with the  intensification of financial turmoil—exert a considerable drag on real activity over  the next two years  Through conventional wealth, cost-of-capital, and terms-of-trade  channels alone, these developments would lead us to revise down real GDP growth  about 1¼ percentage points, on average, in 2009 and 2010  But these effects likely  understate the full extent of the fallout on real activity from financial turmoil  This is  because our standard models do not explicitly account for the additional effects of  such factors as tighter lending standards and heightened uncertainty       Consequently, for some time we have been using supplementary analyses to try to   account for these credit-channel effects in our judgmental projection  Your next  exhibit provides some detail on how we updated these adjustments in light of the  intensification of financial stress during the intermeeting period  Two measures that  we have found useful for measuring the extent of financial turmoil are plotted in the  top row of your third exhibit  On the left is an index of financial market stress, and  on the right is an index of bank credit standards derived from the Senior Loan Officer  Opinion Survey  Both indexes have skyrocketed lately, reflecting the sharp  deterioration of financial conditions  As discussed in the past two Greenbooks, we  use two basic empirical approaches to try to quantify the effects of financial turmoil  on real activity that are not captured by our standard models  One is based on the  historical correlations between these financial turmoil measures and errors in FRB/US  spending equations, and the second method incorporates these indicators of turmoil  into small-scale vector autoregressions       The middle left panel shows estimates of the cumulative effect of our judgmental   adjustments for financial turmoil, outside the conventional channels noted earlier   The effects are shown relative to the level of real GDP in the fourth quarter of each  year  The solid black line is the judgmental estimate built into the current Greenbook  forecast, whereas the red dashed line plots the estimates used in the September  projection  The shaded area shows the range of results from the model-based  estimates detailed in Part 1 of the October Greenbook  As you can see by comparing  the black and red lines, we now expect that financial turmoil, outside the usual  channels, will impose a markedly greater drag on real activity than we projected in  the last Greenbook  For 2008, we think that much of the unexpected weakness  observed recently in the spending data reflects financial turmoil effects, which puts  our judgmental adjustment near the bottom of the model-based range  In contrast, our  adjustment for 2009 is in the middle of the range of model-based results, whereas for  2010 our adjustment is near the top end of the range  We are more optimistic than the  models for 2010 in part because none of the model-based estimates fully accounts for  what we assume will be the likely restorative effects over time of the actions taken by  governments to mitigate the problems afflicting the financial system  As shown in   October 28–29, 2008 49 of 206    the middle right panel, these restraining influences, taken together, led us to mark  down our assumed path for the federal funds rate  We now assume that the funds rate  is lowered to ½ percent by early next year and is held at that level until mid-2010     Although the path for the funds rate is appreciably lower than we had assumed in   the September Greenbook, the additional monetary easing only partially offsets the  greater restraint on activity from the other factors shaping the projection  All told, as  shown in the first line of the table at the bottom of the page, we project that real GDP  will fall at an annual rate of nearly 1 percent in the first half of 2009 and then turn up  modestly in the second half  In 2010—with the drag on activity from the strains in  financial markets beginning to ease, housing market conditions stabilizing, and an  accommodative monetary policy in place—activity accelerates further, and real GDP  increases 23 percent over the four quarters of the year  The contributions of selected  domestic spending categories to changes in real GDP are shown in lines 3 to 5  As  you can see, we think that consumption will begin to recover next year and that the  drag from housing will diminish over time  In contrast, we expect business fixed  investment to remain quite weak next year, reflecting in part the lagged effects on  investment of declining business output, the high cost of capital, and heightened  uncertainty  Although each of the major components of private domestic demand  contributes to the acceleration in economic activity in 2010, the contribution to  growth from net exports (line 6) is expected to turn slightly negative late next year      As shown in the top panels of exhibit 4, the margin of slack both in labor markets   (the panel to the left) and in the industrial sector (the panel to the right) is expected to  remain substantial through the end of the projection period  We expect this persistent  slack to be a source of downward pressure on inflation  Other influences are also  likely to hold down inflation over the projection period  As shown in the middle  panels, energy prices and core goods import prices decelerate sharply from their  recent elevated paces  The projected path for consumer energy prices (the left panel)  largely reflects the effect of the intermeeting plunge in oil prices, and the forecast for  core import prices (the right panel) reflects both the sharp drop in commodity prices  and the stronger dollar  As shown in the bottom left panel, while the Michigan  survey readings on near-term inflation expectations have remained elevated (the black  line), those on longer-term inflation (the red line) have more than retraced the run-up  observed earlier this year  Taken together, as shown in line 7 of the bottom right  panel, we now expect core PCE inflation to move down to 1½ percent in 2009 and to  slow further to 1¼ percent in 2010, roughly ½ percentage point less in each year than  projected previously  Total PCE inflation (line 1) is projected to run at about the  same rate as core PCE inflation in both years     Turning to exhibit 5, a critical feature of the staff forecast is our assumption that   the strains in financial markets will ease gradually over the next two years  However,  the current situation is so extraordinary, in terms of both the financial disruptions and  the policy responses to those disruptions, that an extremely wide band of uncertainty  surrounds this assumption  Matters could easily turn out much worse or much better    October 28–29, 2008 50 of 206    To give some sense of possible magnitudes, this exhibit reviews two alternative  scenarios from the Greenbook        In the first scenario, outlined in the top left panel, financial turmoil intensifies   further over the projection period rather than gradually abating, and the  accompanying economic fallout turns out to be more severe than in the baseline  projection  Specifically, risk premiums on loans, corporate bonds, and equity jump a  further 50 basis points and are slower to fall back over time; in addition, the level of  house prices falls an additional 10 percent relative to the baseline  We also assume  that credit-channel and other nonconventional effects are even more restrictive in  2009 and 2010 than those built into the staff forecast—to a degree more in line with  the bottom end of the range of empirical estimates I presented earlier  As shown by  the red line in the middle left panel, with the intensification of the financial turmoil  and the larger judgmental adjustments for the impact of financial stress on economic  activity, real GDP is significantly weaker than in the baseline (the black line)  As a  result, the unemployment rate (plotted to the right) rises faster and farther, peaking at  nearly 8½ percent at the end of 2010, more than 1 percentage point above the  baseline  Reflecting the greater accompanying slack, core PCE inflation (shown in  the bottom left panel) moves down appreciably faster than in the baseline, reaching  just ¾ percent at the end of 2010  With substantial slack and a low and falling  inflation rate, the funds rate remains pinned through 2010 at ½ percent and continues  at that level through 2012 in the extended simulation presented in the Greenbook     In the second scenario, outlined in the top right panel, the stress weighing on   financial institutions and markets lifts much more quickly than in the baseline,  perhaps in response to the extraordinary recent government actions  Here, we assume  that risk spreads recede by early next year to the levels that were projected in the  September Greenbook, and as a result, equities reverse most of their recent losses by  the middle of next year  In addition, we cut back the size of the judgmental  adjustments for financial turmoil to their September Greenbook levels  As shown by  the blue lines in the middle panels, economic activity responds fairly vigorously to  the improvement in financial conditions, with GDP growth reaching about 4½ percent  by the end of 2010 and the unemployment rate moving down to 5¾ percent  As  shown in the bottom left panel, the narrower margin of slack in the alternative  scenario tempers the decline in core PCE inflation relative to baseline  Finally, as  shown to the right, the federal funds rate, under an optimal control monetary policy,  declines briefly to 1 percent early next year but then moves up steadily as it becomes  clear that the financial strains are lifting rapidly  Linda Kole will now continue our  presentation        One quick follow-on comment  In exhibit 3, in the middle left panel, if   you look at our financial turmoil effects, with the gray shading, the bulk of the markdown in   2008 actually is what we’re labeling the financial turmoil  But those are data we pretty much   already have in hand  We are calling much of the shortfall in consumption that we expect to see   in the third quarter as “financial turmoil”  So much of the weakness in the second half of this   year isn’t just taking a flyer on what we think turmoil is going to do; some of it is already in the   data      Right now, although the odds are that there will be a fiscal package next   year, it is not a feature of the baseline forecast  We discussed two alternative simulations for   different packages, but additional fiscal stimulus is not a feature of the baseline  "
