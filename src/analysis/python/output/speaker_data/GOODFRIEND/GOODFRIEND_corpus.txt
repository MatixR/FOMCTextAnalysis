  May I answer that please?     I'm sorry to interrupt; I know this is unusual  The   revenue for money creation could be regarded as basically the result, on a secular basis,   of the growing demand for real currency balances that the public wants to hold  If one   regards the revenue for money creation, which is sometimes called seigniorage, as a tax   flow just like any other tax that the government receives on a yearly basis--     That's right     The main issue is that we can provide the public--      That’s certainly true given your assumptions about the   rest of the government’s fiscal position  President Broaddus’s point is that no one in the   government needs to acquire private assets to implement monetary policy         Okay  Then if one of our goals is to minimize private   assets acquired by the government, we could make that understood by the rest of the   government, in which case they would do with the money what Governor Meyer is   saying--    3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I recognize that thinking  about what monetary policy can do at the zero bound on nominal interest rates is a  kind of third rail of monetary policy  As is the case with social security, the various  proposals of possible alternatives provoke strong reactions, reactions that are  reminiscent of the Keynesian-monetarist controversies of old about fiscal and  monetary policy With that acknowledgement, I offer my assessment of some of the  options I will spend most of my time explaining how what I think is the best  option—expanding the monetary base—could work to stimulate the economy at the  zero bound I will discuss five other options briefly at the end of my presentation  I  plan to follow closely the material that you should have in front of you  So, please  turn to page 2 and follow along from there    Usually, open market operations are constrained to accommodate the demand for  the monetary base at the opportunity cost spread between the intended federal funds  rate and zero There is a need to defend an interest rate spread when the federal funds  rate is positive, and as a result, the monetary base is not an independent instrument  available for policy in those normal circumstances  But once the federal funds rate is  zero, there is no need to defend an interest rate spread, and policymakers are free to  expand the monetary base further to stimulate the economy     Central banks can pursue what I call quantitative monetary policy—as  distinguished from interest rate policy—at the zero bound  As noted on page 3, to  appreciate the power of quantitative policy at the zero bound, we need to distinguish  between narrow and broad liquidity services  In models of the demand for money,  narrow liquidity services are provided by the medium of exchange, which allows  banks and the public to economize on transactions costs or so-called shopping time  costs For example, people hold currency to minimize trips to the ATM; they hold  checkable deposits to avoid sales of nonmonetary assets in order to replenish money  balances and make payments; and banks hold reserves to save on transactions costs in  the federal funds market  When short-term nominal interest rates are at zero, narrow  liquidity services of the kind I just described are no longer scarce because there is no  opportunity cost of holding currency or bank reserves, and the channel of monetary  policy transmission that we ordinarily use is exhausted    Broad liquidity services are not exhausted, however, and they provide what I will  argue is the leverage for quantitative monetary policy to stimulate the economy  further at the zero bound Let me first define what I mean by broad liquidity  Broad  liquidity is a service yield provided by assets according to how easily they can be  turned into cash, either by their sale or by serving as collateral for external financing    3 Materials used by Mr Goodfriend are appended to this document (appendix 3)               January 29-30, 2002 Page 18 of 194  Broad liquidity services are valued (page 5) because they minimize the exposure of  households and firms to what I call the external finance premium  That premium is a  consequence of imperfect information, costly enforcement, and costly monitoring of  loan contracts that create a wedge between the cost of funds raised externally and  those generated internally The existence of an external finance premium gives rise to  a demand for broadly liquid assets that over time has been referred to in the  profession as “precautionary savings,” “a liquid buffer stock,” or “self-insurance”   Broad monetary instruments include bank deposits, money market mutual fund  shares, and short-term government securities  These could be used to meet spending  needs in excess of current income—in other words, to protect households and firms  from having to go to banks or credit markets to borrow and thus pay the external  finance premium    Turning to page 6, quantitative monetary policy at the zero bound must expand  broad liquidity in order to be stimulative because stimulus from narrow liquidity is no  longer available Open market purchases of short-term government securities, the  usual vehicle for an expansive monetary policy, would create a monetary base by  withdrawing from the system an equal value of short-term government securities  At  zero interest, the liquidity services provided by base money and short-term securities  would be roughly equivalent So, if the central bank operates in a “business as usual”  mode, that would not increase broad liquidity in the economy  Other methods of  operations must be employed   There are three avenues that could be pursued to increase broad liquidity by  expanding the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet  One would be to buy from the public  relatively illiquid assets such as long-term government bonds, which would provide  the public with base money that would then be deposited in banks  The banking  system would expand, deposits would grow, and the banks would hold reserves  against these additional deposits It’s important to understand that even if banks do  not use these reserves to expand lending—and thus there is no secondary expansion  of bank deposits—the Fed has increased broad monetary liquidity in the economy as  a result of its purchase of relatively illiquid long-term bonds on the open market   Alternatively, the Fed could buy assets other than long-term government bonds—  anything one can imagine that is relatively illiquid—and in that way also increase  broad liquidity The third way would be to monetize a government budget deficit   That would involve the government’s issuing new short-term securities, say, which  the Fed would buy We would thereby be providing the government with a monetary  base, which in turn it would transfer to the public through a tax cut or in some other  way The funds placed in the hands of the public would be deposited in the banking  system and deposits would increase, as would broad liquidity   On page 7, I discuss the channels of monetary transmission by which quantitative  policy might be expected to work  The two components of the transmission  mechanism are the portfolio rebalancing channel and the credit channel  I will  discuss those two channels sequentially, though you will see in a minute that to a  large extent they are intertwined  By expanding broad liquidity in the economy the                       January 29-30, 2002 Page 19 of 194  Federal Reserve reduces what I’m going to call the “marginal implicit broad liquidity  services yield on monetary assets”  The implicit marginal liquidity yield falls  because a greater abundance of broad liquidity reduces the exposure of households  and firms to the external finance premium The portfolio rebalancing channel operates  this way After an injection of broad liquidity that drives down its implicit yield,  people will feel compelled to hold assets that are less liquid but have a higher explicit  rate of return Portfolio balance would require a similar fall in the explicit yield on  nonmonetary assets  Equilibrium prices of nonmonetary assets would be bid up to  restore the required return differential   Turning to page 8, higher asset prices raise desired consumption out of current  income  And higher asset prices relative to their cost of production would revive  investment  The increased investment would raise employment, and higher  utilization rates and profits would raise asset prices further  That is the essence of the  portfolio rebalancing channel   Let me talk for a minute about the credit channel (page 9)  Because asset prices  are higher, collateral values would be higher, net worth would be higher, and bank  capital would be higher As a result of the higher valuations available to back loans,  the external finance premium would come down  Credit spreads would narrow, bank  lending would revive, and spending would rise as the cost of borrowing against future  income prospects falls  Those developments would occur along with the portfolio  rebalancing channel, but I call them the credit channel because they are distinct in  that they operate in the credit markets    Turning to page 10, I want to note two implementation problems that I think  would be hard to overcome  Even if the transmission mechanism outlined above  works well otherwise, these two problems would hinder making the broad liquidity  channels operative  Injections of monetary base can provide an impulse to get the  recovery going, but for the recovery to be self-sustaining the public must be confident  that base money will be expanded by as much and for as long as needed  That is,  monetary policy must be supportive until the economy expands enough to support  asset prices on its own To acquire such credibility, the central bank must overcome  the perception that it is excessively concerned about the inflationary risk of  potentially very high growth in the monetary base  The monetary authority must be  prepared to overshoot—perhaps by a wide margin—base money that will be  demanded at stable prices after the economy recovers    There is a second related, but distinct, implementation problem that would make  gaining credibility for quantitative policy difficult  Ordinarily, relatively small  changes in bank reserves suffice to support interest rate policy  We hardly have to  move the System’s balance sheet at all to support even large changes in the intended  federal funds rate At the zero bound, however, policy will have to exert its effect  through broad liquidity rather than very narrow reserves liquidity  What we’re  talking about is operating on a monetary aggregate like M3—which is roughly around  8 trillion dollars—plus the stock of short-term Treasury securities, which involves                   January 29-30, 2002 Page 20 of 194  another $1 trillion to $2 trillion  The order of magnitude of that aggregate is about  that of GDP  That will require large-scale injections of monetary base, substantially  increasing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, I believe, in order to have  the desired effect through the two broad liquidity channels of monetary transmission    If all this is true, the Federal Reserve will need more fiscal support for  quantitative policy at the zero bound than we usually are granted by the fiscal  authorities For one, there might not be enough long-term bonds to buy in order to  expand the monetary base Of course, we could buy other assets  But either way the  Federal Reserve would be exposed to capital losses that might leave it with  insufficient assets to reverse the huge expansion of its balance sheet that is being  contemplated  In other words, to be willing to use quantitative monetary policy at the  zero bound, the central bank must be able to inject large quantities of base money into  the economy and be confident that it will have the assets to drain this money after the  economy has recovered  In particular, we’d need to be able to drain money that  threatens to become inflationary, or we would be reluctant to embark on this process  in the first place   The fiscal authorities could come into the process in a number of ways (page 13)   They could promise to transfer to us enough assets—in effect to recapitalize the  central bank if necessary—to allow us to drain the amount of base money that needs  to be withdrawn from the economy  Alternatively, the fiscal authorities could agree  to run a budget deficit at the central bank’s request to help us inject broad liquidity  into the economy  The central bank could monetize short-term debt issued to finance  the deficit and then withdraw excess base money later by selling that debt to the  public Quantitative monetary policy actions at the zero bound could result in a  significant increase in government debt in the hands of the public when this process is  over The fiscal authorities might be unwilling to allow the public debt to expand at  the discretion of the central bank Yet the central bank might be unwilling to pursue  an aggressive expansion of its balance sheet without a commitment from the fiscal  authorities to support monetary policy fully  A prearranged agreement could enable  quantitative policy to work credibly, flexibly, and effectively—at least the way this  story goes That concludes my discussion of quantitative policy at the zero bound  In  my remaining time, I would like to discuss briefly five other policy options   The first option, “do nothing unusual” (page 17) involves keeping the federal  funds rate at zero without increasing the monetary base any more than would be  necessary to do so As Dave and John pointed out, the contraction would likely be  deeper than usual because we’d be constrained at zero  But I want to point out two  other risks that I think would arise that are not ordinarily discussed in conventional  simulations   One is that if we have a distressed banking system, banks would provide inside  broad liquidity much less elastically than usual  Ordinarily, banks would  accommodate an increased demand for broad liquidity by accepting deposits and  making relatively illiquid loans  That is, they would reintermediate the funds  If                 January 29-30, 2002 Page 21 of 194  bank capital is impaired, banks may instead buy Treasury securities with new  deposits If they do, banks would not be accommodating the increased demand for  broad liquidity at all  They would accept the deposits but would withdraw other  instruments that would have been providing broad liquidity in order to hold those  assets on their own balance sheets In that case an excess demand for broad liquidity,  which could be substantial in a depressed situation at the zero bound, would work the  monetary transmission process in reverse  The excess demand would not be met by  the Federal Reserve in this “do nothing unusual” case nor by the banks, and that  excess demand for broad liquidity would depress asset prices and spending  That is  one problem with doing nothing unusual  A second is that a policy vacuum would  occur, which could encourage ill-advised fiscal actions  Some fiscal actions may be  beneficial, but many would not be  For instance, the government might enact  legislation that results in wasteful government spending, inefficient credit subsidies,  or forbearance in the banking system in connection with deposit insurance  As the  debt-GDP ratio rises, the government might resort to off-budget fiscal policies such  as anti-competitive measures to help wages and prices in particular sectors  All told,  such actions could lower the level of potential GDP and its rate of growth, as they  appear to have done in the United States in the 1930s and in Japan in the 1990s   What I’m arguing is that “doing nothing” does not mean that nothing gets done  It  means that the ball would be in the court of the fiscal authorities, and we’re not sure  what would happen in that case   A second possibility (page 18) is that the Federal Reserve could commit to  holding the federal funds rate at zero by writing options on future short rates to give  itself an incentive to keep rates down in the future—Dave and John mentioned this  briefly That possibility has the advantage of acting directly on long-term rates; the  disadvantage is that the effect would be relatively small if long-term rates are close to  zero anyway—as they are, for example, in Japan today  There is another problem in  that I think the credibility of any commitment to keep rates low would be doubtful,  given the pressures to take interest rate actions deemed appropriate at each point in  time    Another option (page 19) is that the Federal Reserve could buy foreign assets or  depreciate the foreign exchange rate or both  Though different, I’ve grouped these  actions together because they both make use of openness  For instance, we could buy  foreign government securities to help increase broad liquidity as part of a policy  package designed to stabilize domestic economic conditions; such a program need not  have any effect per se on the exchange rate  The advantage is that we already are  authorized to make such purchases; and if we could do that in lieu of buying long- term bonds, it would help us perhaps to operate independently of our own fiscal  authorities One problem, as with the acquisition of any non-Treasury security, is that  we would bear the credit and price risk—in this case, the exchange rate risk   Separately, we could depreciate the exchange rate, which has the advantage that it is a  well known and readily understood policy that has been tried around the world  The  disadvantage from the US perspective is that our economy is very large and not all                 January 29-30, 2002 Page 22 of 194  that open, so we could export deflation and recession without helping the domestic  economy very much     Moving on, the expand credit policy option (page 20) would call for increased  discount window lending and the purchase of private debt  That would reduce private  credit spreads and help to finance credit-constrained firms  The advantage is that we  have wide latitude to lend to banks on collateral  We would need new legislation to  buy private debt, but by all accounts our current ability to lend through the discount  window would be sufficient to accomplish our objectives  However, I believe that  the central bank would make a poor financial intermediary  I would argue that a  central bank should use credit policy sparingly and temporarily only to foster  stabilization in financial markets but not for general policy stimulus  It is worth  remembering that quantitative monetary policy, as I discussed earlier, works partly  through the credit channel Quantitative monetary policy would go a long way  toward facilitating intermediation in the private sector by raising collateral values and  net worth and reducing the external finance premium  It is possible, therefore, that  the central bank could improve the flow of credit in the economy at the zero bound  without becoming a financial intermediary itself, which I believe is an important  factor to bear in mind   The last option (page 22) is that the central bank could pursue deliberately an  inflationary policy—again a possibility raised by Dave and John  Based on my  discussion of the broad liquidity channels of monetary transmission, I believe that  quantitative monetary policy could stimulate the economy at the zero bound without  creating inflation or inflation expectations  Temporary inflation would be desirable to  reverse prior deflation that raised the real value of nominal debt  However,  unleashing inflation could be counterproductive; if such a policy were utilized  routinely near the zero bound, then expected inflation would rise any time that the  federal funds rate approached zero Rising inflation expectations would be  destabilizing and difficult to manage, just as inflation scares in the bond market have  been difficult to manage in the past  So, I don’t think that we would either need or  want to create inflation to try to overcome the zero-bound problem  That concludes  my remarks  I would be happy to answer any questions    In a way, my discussion had an advantage in that I didn’t have a   model [Laughter]    I will say that the discontinuity—though I didn’t use that word—   worried me  There were a number of possible discontinuities that worried me, such as banking   system distress or fiscal interventions—things that don’t usually happen but that occur at the zero   bound That’s why I was focusing on mechanisms that could get money into and out of the   system  I was thinking about how we would position ourselves against this kind of unleashing of   inflation—that’s the term I used—rather than “punting” on where that glass ceiling would be  I   wanted to think about designing a system that would be robust against it  That is more or less   what I was doing    Yes, Japan has gone so far down the road that, you’re right, it’s   very hard to imagine that it could dig itself out with quantitative policy  But I’ll say this As I   was working on this, I was motivated by the current situation in Japan I think there are a   number of points of contact where I could see what I’ve been talking about happen in the   Japanese situation The first is that if the Bank of Japan were going to engage in quantitative   policy—if it were willing to expand the size of its balance sheet by as much as I believe would   be necessary to be effective—I believe it would need to get some prior commitment from the   fiscal authorities that it would be able to pull the money out later  As you know, the Bank of   Japan was made independent from the Ministry of Finance just two or three years ago  I think   it’s hard for them to get back together and cooperate when they’ve spent a good deal of the last   fifteen years trying to get a divorce  So that’s one problem  As a central banker, I have some     January 29-30, 2002 Page 28 of 194  sympathy with the BOJ situation on that score  I’ll get to your rate of return question last; that’s   the most difficult   The next issue is the banking situation Much of the problem in Japan is not a central   banking problem; it’s a fiscal bank regulation problem  If I were a central banker in Japan, I   would be willing to pursue quantitative monetary policy aggressively if I could get two   commitments from the Ministry of Finance  one, for the fiscal authorities to support monetary   policy along the lines of my earlier discussion and, two, for the fiscal authorities to deal with the   problems in the banking system     To get to your last point, it’s true that as the deflation gathers speed, it’s harder to get out   of this jam  But the mechanism I was talking about—the margin upon which quantitative policy   would operate—would still be there  The implicit shadow broad liquidity services yield would   be still there In fact, it may be bigger in Japan than it has been for a long time because the value   of having liquidity is much higher now than previously  That is the case, in turn, because the   external finance premium is elevated as a consequence of the fact that asset valuations are   depressed and loans are more costly to monitor and enforce Therefore, I believe that there would   be a substantial shadow margin for Japanese monetary policy to exploit if the BOJ were to do   quantitative policy in the way I was suggesting    I’m a little confused about one thing  I could see that reflation   would be beneficial if there had been a prior deflation  But are you arguing that even if there   were no prior deflation you would want to set up expectations of inflation as a way to help us out   of a zero-bound situation?  I might disagree in that second case     Yes, I think that’s true  If this policy were known to be effective   and all the pieces were in place to make it work, it’s probably true that you could get by with a   much smaller increase in the monetary base  That’s because once people saw that it was going to   work, they would be more optimistic about the future  As with all these models, credibility is   everything If the policy is really credible, asset prices would begin to rise, and then the   economy would start to recover I think that would be true
