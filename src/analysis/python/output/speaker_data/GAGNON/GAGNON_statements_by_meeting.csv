7351,2004-06-29,"  Your next exhibit considers the implications for both the US and   foreign economies of an abrupt depreciation of the dollar that could be associated with a  disorderly adjustment  As described in the top left panel, we examine three scenarios  that build on each other using the staff’s FRB/Global model  We note at the outset that  these scenarios are illustrative of some of the issues that may arise and should not be  viewed as forecasts or even as particularly likely outcomes       June 29-30, 2004 8 of 203          In scenario 1, there is an exogenous permanent drop in demand for dollar assets that  would cause the broad real index of the dollar’s value to decline 30 percent over the next  two quarters in the absence of any responses in domestic and foreign interest rates  The  only decline of this magnitude in the history of the broad real index occurred over a  three-year period from 1985 to 1988  In this and subsequent scenarios, we assume that  US and foreign policy interest rates follow a Taylor rule  The dotted black line in the  panel to the right shows that the dollar actually depreciates less than the full 30 percent  in this scenario, as higher US and lower foreign interest rates offset some of the  depreciation shock  Column 1 of the middle panel shows that US GDP (line 1) is about  2 percent higher after six quarters  The effect on the level of US output peaks at just  over 2 percent in early 2006 and then gradually unwinds  Higher output is more than  accounted for by net exports (line 3), as domestic demand (line 2) declines  By the end  of 2006, core PCE prices (line 4) are 1½ percent higher  This price increase is stretched  out over ten quarters, so the annualized inflation rate never rises more than a percentage  point above baseline  Most of this rise reflects the direct pass-through of higher import  prices (line 5), but a little is attributable to the rise of output relative to potential  On its  own, this shock would not be considered disorderly, and it reflects a relatively benign  response to such an abrupt dollar depreciation  Nevertheless, the negative effect on  trade-weighted foreign GDP (the dotted black line in the bottom left panel) is a bit larger  than the positive effect on US GDP as policy rates in many important US trading  partners hit the zero bound on nominal interest rates  Foreign real consumption does not  fall as much as foreign output because dollar depreciation lowers the cost of imports to  foreign consumers  The opposite effect is at work in the United States, showing that  even though dollar depreciation is good for US production, it does have adverse effects  on US consumers      In scenario 2, we posit that this abrupt dollar depreciation is associated with a   widespread loss of confidence in US economic prospects that leads to a 250 basis point  increase in the risk premium on equities and long-term bonds in the United States  The  higher premium and lower expected profits cause US equity prices to fall about  50 percent  Because of the importance of the US economy and US financial markets  in the global economy, it is likely that such a large drop in US equity prices would  spread to foreign markets  The overall effect on foreign financial markets would likely  be muted by safe-haven flows to government bonds in major foreign countries  Thus,  we set the size of the foreign financial shock to have half as much effect on foreign  output as the US financial shock has on US output  Asset-price declines add  contractionary impulses to the simulation, and now US GDP, shown in columns 3 and  4 of the middle panel, declines on balance  At the same time, the upward pressure on  US prices (line 4) is reduced a bit, owing to slack in resource utilization  As shown by  the dashed red line in the bottom left panel, asset-price declines in foreign economies  and spillovers from the United States have a substantial contractionary effect on our  trading partners  Policy rates in most of these countries drop to zero early in the  simulation and remain there     Scenario 3 considers the possibility that, when policy rates hit zero, foreign central   banks might engage in quantitative easing or other nontraditional policy actions to   June 29-30, 2004 9 of 203          stimulate their economies  Because the channels for such policies are not built into the  model, we chose to relax the zero bound on policy interest rates and allow these rates to  become negative, still following a Taylor rule  As shown by the solid green line in the  top right panel, easier monetary policy abroad leads to less dollar depreciation   Nevertheless, the level of US GDP (line 1, columns 5 and 6 of the middle panel) is  essentially identical to that in scenario 2  The reduced stimulus to US GDP from a  smaller depreciation is roughly offset by the reduced drag from a smaller contraction in  foreign GDP, shown by the solid green line in the bottom left panel  The smaller  depreciation helps to damp the rise in US prices (line 4 of the middle panel)  The  bottom right panel displays the classic J-curve effect of a depreciation on the trade  balance  Most of the effects are completed by early 2006  The trade deficit narrows  about 1½ percent of GDP from the exchange rate shock alone and about 2 percent of  GDP when other asset prices also drop  These scenarios engender a substantial degree  of external adjustment, though not enough to eliminate the trade deficit, which is  currently around 5 percent of GDP      All together, these simulations clearly indicate that disorderly adjustment of the US   external balances is likely to have a very contractionary effect on foreign economic  activity  A large dollar depreciation—which is likely to be at the heart of any disorderly  adjustment—provides a substantial stimulus to US exports that offsets much of the  negative effects of any financial distress on US activity  Meanwhile, lower US  imports are a direct drag on foreign economic activity      In light of the dollar depreciation that occurred over the past two years, exhibit 6   explores whether external adjustment is already under way  The last major period of  external adjustment in the United States occurred during the late 1980s  We find it  instructive to compare the recent experience with that of the 1980s  The dashed line in  the top left panel displays the rise and fall of the broad real dollar between 1979 and  1990  The solid red line displays the broad real dollar in recent years, with the peak of  February 2002 aligned with the earlier peak of February 1985  The amplitude of the  cycle was greater during the 1980s, but the broad contours look similar  The recent  interruption in the depreciation is more pronounced than in any comparable period in  1985-87  Should the recent break in the dollar’s downward trend persist, it would be  reasonable to expect any adjustment to be interrupted  The top right panel displays the  trade balance over the earlier and later periods  Despite the smaller swing in the dollar  in the current episode, the trade deficit as a percent of GDP has widened more than  during the 1980s  Abstracting from the effects of the 2001 recession and 2002 recovery,  there does appear to have been a flattening out of the trade deficit recently  In the 1980s,  the trade deficit did not begin to narrow until more than two years after the dollar  peaked—we are just now approaching the comparable point in the current episode  The  middle panel shows that external adjustment in the late 1980s was associated with a  sustained higher growth rate of real exports (the dashed blue line) relative to growth of  real imports (the solid green line)  In the current episode, the growth rate of real imports  has exceeded that of real exports continuously from 1997 through late last year, but the  gap has now closed  Adjustment will require a further rise in the export growth rate  relative to that of imports     June 29-30, 2004 10 of 203                                                            2 The materials used by Ms Goldberg are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   The bottom left panel displays weighted foreign real GDP growth minus US GDP  growth  As shown by the dashed line, foreign economies grew faster than the US  economy in the late 1980s  Robust foreign growth undoubtedly contributed to a  relatively smooth adjustment process during this period  In contrast, during recent  quarters, foreign economies on average have grown more slowly than the United States  (the solid red line), and we are not projecting a reversal of this relationship in the near  future  The bottom right panel gives some indication that the willingness of  international investors to fund our widening external deficits may be diminishing  Net  private inflows of securities have failed to continue rising since the dollar’s peak in early  2002; foreign official inflows have taken up the slack to finance the continued growth of  the current account deficit  A similar rise in official inflows occurred at the beginning of  the adjustment process in the 1980s      The top left panel of your final exhibit compares the recent behavior of import prices   with the previous episode of adjustment  As shown by the red line, import prices have  turned up with the dollar depreciation and the commodity price increases of the past  couple of years  But the rate of increase is much smaller than that observed in the late  1980s  Moreover, unless the dollar depreciates significantly further, we expect that  import-price inflation will drift down over the next year or so  The panel to the right  shows that there was not a substantial increase in core consumer price inflation  associated with the 1980s adjustment  We do not expect a major increase in core PCE  inflation in the near future  Overall, the evidence to date points to a pause in the  widening of the trade deficit, but that is far from a significant adjustment  Indeed, as  Karen mentioned previously, if the dollar remains near its recent level we would project  a renewed widening of the trade deficit      In conclusion, we believe that recent levels of the US external deficits are not   sustainable indefinitely  However, we know little about the path that adjustment will  ultimately follow, including how long our large trade deficits can be financed  The  depreciation of the dollar in 2002 and 2003 has helped to slow the widening of the trade  deficit, but there is no evidence that a sustained or significant adjustment has begun yet   Assuming that US and foreign output remain close to our estimates of potential, a  substantial further dollar depreciation is required just to get adjustment started  The  relatively orderly adjustment of the late 1980s was associated with an acceleration of  foreign economic activity and brighter investment prospects abroad  On the other hand,  a disorderly adjustment process would more likely be associated with a loss of  confidence in US economic policies and prospects  In a disorderly adjustment, the  contractionary effects on output could well be greater for foreign economies than for the  US economy  While asset-price declines tend to depress output both at home and  abroad, dollar depreciation tends to boost US production and damp foreign production   The effect on US inflation of even a large depreciation is likely to be quite modest   Linda Goldberg will now continue our presentation       Mr Chairman, may I?     We have looked, partly at your suggestion, into whether the lags might   have changed, because I think the mechanism you are talking about would likely show up as a   longer pass-through lag  Obviously we don’t have enough data to determine if this is a recent   change in the past couple of years; we can’t tell  We looked at whether the ’90s were different   from the ’80s and couldn’t find any evidence of a longer lag time  The lags are pretty short   June 29-30, 2004 17 of 203            There would be dynamic feedbacks  We use the FRB/Global model,   which will simultaneously capture both effects—from the United States on foreign economies   and from foreign economies on this country  So, yes, it’s a property of the model that things that   happen in the United States have a bigger effect on the rest of the world than vice-versa, in large   part because in this exhibit we weighted the rest of the world by US trade weights to give   greater weight to countries that trade with us a lot, such as Canada and Mexico and Asian   countries  If we had done the weighting by market or PPP-GDP, say, we would get a smaller   effect      Fiscal policy certainly could help  The models are such that if you   want to hit a target, you can raise or lower taxes or raise spending enough to help to some extent    You might not like the other consequences  But the answer to your question is yes  While we   did not actually run those types of simulations, the logic of the model is such that fiscal policy   could help in that regard     In scenario 1, we have the federal funds rate following a Taylor rule    The funds rate increases 70 basis points in the first half and gradually moves up about 200 basis   points  I don’t have a weighted foreign adjustment, but I can tell you that, in the case of our   major trading partners, they hit the zero bound in that scenario     Yes, but just barely  In scenario 2 they are quite strongly constrained;   in scenario 1 they just barely hit the zero-bound constraint  I could tell you how much they   would have to lower rates if there were no zero bound  Japanese rates would be down 300 basis   points, and euro rates would be down 400 basis points     No, because they just barely hit the zero bound  So, it’s true that if   you’re looking at the effect on their GDP—is that what you’re looking at?     In that case, in the bottom left panel, the dotted black line goes down to   minus 1½ percent rather than minus 2½ percent     And in the staff model, it would be about $100 of trade adjustment for   every $300 of fiscal contraction     About 25     I think we agree on what we’ve seen in the past and, of course, we both   are wondering what will happen in the future  I’d just like to say that I believe a lot of the   differences in our views come from how we think about commodities  That’s an issue to   consider going forward  We both looked at import prices, disaggregated and aggregated  When   we look at aggregated import prices, we tend to put commodity prices separately in our   regression in addition to exchange rates  We, too, find that there was less pass-through in the   June 29-30, 2004 38 of 203          1990s  The question is, What is the story lately?  I think that’s where we may have some   difference   In the past few months we’ve been saying that more of the rise in prices has occurred   because commodity prices are rising, which we think has some exchange rate component but   also has a large cyclical component—domestic demands in China or, more broadly, a world   demand component  To our mind, that may explain why the pass-through seems to be higher   lately  Time will tell which will turn out to be right  Frankly, I have a lot of sympathy with   perhaps a return to a higher pass-through in the future because I think, as Linda said, the lower   pass-through in the ’90s might have been because it was a time when China’s economic growth   was rising and their currency was pegged to the dollar  Even though a lot of countries in Asia   had exchange rate movements up and down in the ’90s, for those who compete with and   integrate their production processes with the Chinese, there was an 800-pound gorilla that they   couldn’t really compete against  So they were forced to price along with China, and China’s   currency was tied to the dollar and thus our pass-through estimates would fall  When we’ve   looked bilaterally at which countries seemed to have passed through less in the 1990s, it was   Japan, developing Asia, and Mexico  So it’s quite possible that, if China were to revalue or think   of a change in that respect, all bets could be off  Maybe we’d go back to the historical pass-  through  The jury is out on that     You are referring to the background paper that we circulated?     In that we had a somewhat different model simulate a rise and fall in   the current account balance  I’m not sure that we are here to hang our hat on one explanation for   the rise and fall of the current account; clearly a number of things were going on then  I   wouldn’t say that the portfolio preference shock is entirely the story  But one reason that I chose   to highlight it, to some extent, was that, if you look at a number of variables in the US economy   at the time—interest rates, output, inflation, the exchange rate, the trade balance, and so forth—  it’s the one shock that sort of moves things jointly together well  That doesn’t mean that some   other combination of shocks might not also have worked out that way  But it is one that does   work out that way  So in that regard it has some nice features  Another obvious shock that we   highlighted was the productivity shock, and the reason we didn’t use that alone is that it just   doesn’t do enough  You’d need a much bigger productivity shock in our model for any   reasonable calibration to explain the trade balance     That’s a very good question  I don’t sense that it is that important  A   movement in foreign exchange intervention of, say, $100 billion or so in the model is not going   to swamp the exchange rate, if that’s what you’re saying  Is the portfolio balance built to do   that?  No, I don’t think it would do that  I actually can’t point to specific evidence, though, so   maybe we should look into that  But my sense is no—that the simulations are not sensitive to   that assumption—because these are very large numbers  Even intervention of large amounts by   the standards we are used to is not going to be large enough to make a difference  We’re talking   about a trillion dollars  But your point is a good one  As a modeling convention, it really helps   in terms of actually solving these models  It’s quite normal in these kinds of models to put in   something like this because the model can be stable and you get to a steady state you can   understand  So it’s not unusual to do that, but it’s a good point  "
7875,2007-01-30,"  Your first international exhibit (exhibit 9) covers recent market   developments  As shown by the green line in the top left panel, oil prices dropped  further this month, bringing the West Texas intermediate spot price back to pre- Katrina levels  The IMF index of nonfuel commodity prices (the red line) was little  changed this month after a year of remarkable increases  Readings from futures  markets imply a flattening out of nonfuel commodity prices and only a moderate  increase in oil prices going forward  The top right panel shows that our real trade- weighted dollar indexes declined on balance last year  In recent weeks the dollar  rebounded modestly against the major industrial-country currencies (the red line), but  we estimate that it continued to decline in real terms against the currencies of our  other important trading partners (the green line)  As usual, our forecast calls for a  small downward trend from current levels, reflecting our belief that the risk of  significant depreciation is slightly greater than the risk of significant appreciation,  owing to the unsustainably large US trade deficit  The bottom panels report equity  market indexes, with industrial countries shown on the left  The lines are set to equal  100 in March 2000, the previous peak month for the Wilshire 5000  Equity prices  have risen broadly across the industrial countries over the past two years and are now  just above their March 2000 levels in the United States, the United Kingdom, and  Japan, but not in the euro area (the red line)  For major emerging markets, on the  right, equity indexes are well above March 2000 levels  In Mexico (the blue line),  equity prices have more than tripled over this period  In Thailand (the green line), the  government’s recent attempts to slow capital inflows and relieve upward pressure on  the currency have taken their toll on equity prices, but contagion to other emerging  equity markets has been minimal  Overall, commodity and financial market  developments are consistent with expectations of strong global growth     Exhibit 10 focuses on financial flows between emerging markets and industrial   countries  As shown in the top left panel, the major developing regions have  continued the downward trend in their reliance on external borrowing  Fiscal deficits  have declined in most countries, and many governments have turned increasingly to  local, rather than external, borrowing  The panel to the right shows that yield spreads  on dollar-denominated sovereign debt of emerging market countries have dropped to  historically low levels     But emerging markets, in the aggregate, have gone much further than just   reducing their borrowing  In recent years, emerging markets have experienced record  outflows of official capital (the gold bars in the middle panel)  These official  outflows are composed of the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, the  servicing and paying down of sovereign debt, and the purchase of foreign assets by  government-run investment funds such as the Kuwait Investment Authority  In all  the emerging market regions, official capital outflows have recently exceeded current   January 30-31, 2007 18 of 255    account surpluses (the blue bars), which are themselves at record levels  For  example, the IMF estimates that in 2006, governments in emerging Asia invested on  balance $270 billion outside their borders, a sum that greatly exceeds their combined  current account surplus of $185 billion  Most of these official flows have taken the  form of additions to foreign exchange reserves, as governments have built up war  chests against future financial crises and sought to counter upward pressures on their  currencies     The bottom panel looks at these flows from the point of view of the industrial   countries, plotting aggregate emerging market net official flows (the gold bars)  relative to industrial-country GDP, with negative values denoting net flows into the  industrial countries  The statistical accounts do not report the destinations of all these  flows, but the available evidence suggests that the overwhelming majority is destined  for the industrial countries  Before 2003, net official inflows or outflows from the  emerging markets had never exceeded 1 percent of industrial-country GDP  But  since 2003, things have changed  Net official outflows from emerging markets are  now estimated to equal 2½ percent of the combined GDP of the industrial countries   As shown in the panel, the timing of this unprecedented increase in net official flows  corresponds well with the puzzling decline in real short-term interest rates in the  industrial countries (the green line) that persisted long after industrial-country GDP  growth (the purple line) rebounded from the slowdown early in this decade  The  evidence suggests that aggregate policy-driven capital flows from the emerging  markets may be an important factor behind low real interest rates in the industrial  countries  Moreover, low real rates are not limited to short-maturity instruments     The top panels of exhibit 11 show that ten-year indexed bond yields are also low   and have been for several years in the major industrial countries  These rates have  ticked up over the past month or two, but only by a small amount  Long-term  inflation compensation (shown in the middle row of panels) remains contained   Indeed, in Japan and Canada (the two panels on the right) inflation compensation has  moved down in recent months  In the euro area and the United Kingdom (the two  panels on the left), where inflation compensation lingers above policymakers’ targets,  we project modest additional policy tightening early this year, shown in the bottom  row of panels     Despite recent and expected future inflation rates close to zero, the Bank of Japan   seems poised to tighten gradually over the next two years  In Canada, policy is  expected to remain on hold  If these projections prove to be the peak policy rates for  this cycle, they will be the lowest cyclical peaks for short-term interest rates in these  countries for at least forty years  Nevertheless, we judge that these policy stances are  likely to be consistent with low and stable inflation this year and next  The large  capital inflows and low real interest rates in the industrial countries have contributed  to rising housing prices in many of these countries  Higher home prices in turn have  stimulated housing construction  The top panel of exhibit 12 shows that the extent  and timing of the house-price boom differs markedly across countries  The  Netherlands (the blue line) was one of the leaders of the global housing boom, with   January 30-31, 2007 19 of 255    prices rising continuously since the early 1990s, though at much slower rates in recent  years  Japan (the green line), on the other hand, is a notable exception to the trend of  rising house prices in recent years, reflecting the lingering effects of the bursting of  the 1980s asset bubble and Japan’s extended economic slump  The middle panels  focus on two countries that experienced strong house-price increases (the purple  lines) early in this decade but where house-price increases subsequently halted, at  least temporarily  In both Australia and the United Kingdom, as in the United States,  residential investment (the green lines) responded positively to higher house prices   In Australia, on the left, real house prices have been flat for the past three years, and  residential investment has declined gradually about 1 percentage point of GDP,  though it remains above its historical average  In the United Kingdom, on the right,  house prices stabilized in 2005 and picked up again modestly last year  Despite lower  house-price inflation, residential investment has continued to rise toward historically  high levels  The relevance of these foreign experiences for the United States is  difficult to gauge, but they provide some support for Larry’s forecast that the  downturn in US housing is nearly over     In light of the signals from financial and commodity markets, as well as other   real-side indicators, we project continued solid growth in the foreign economies at  rates that are not likely to strain resources or to put upward pressure on inflation  As  shown in the bottom panel, total foreign growth (line 1) is estimated to have stepped  down last year from 4½ percent in the first half to about 3½ percent in the second  half, and it is projected to remain around 3½ percent over the forecast period  This  projection is about 1 percentage point stronger than the staff’s projection for US  growth, shown at the bottom of the panel  The foreign industrial economies (line 2)  overall are projected to grow at about the same rate as the United States, Japan a bit  slower (line 4), and Canada a bit faster (line 5)  The emerging market economies  (line 6) are projected to grow at nearly twice the pace of the industrial economies  over the forecast period  We expect that emerging Asia (line 7) will continue to grow  very rapidly and that Latin America (line 8) will grow at a solid, though not  exceptional, rate  Our forecast assumes that the Chinese government will take  additional measures if necessary to reduce the growth rate of investment, and we  project that Chinese GDP growth will be slower this year than last  But the risks to  our growth forecast for China are probably greater on the upside     Exhibit 13 provides an assessment of what all these foreign influences mean for   the US economy  Overall import prices, the black line in the top left panel, fell  sharply last quarter and are projected to continue to fall in the current quarter,  primarily owing to the drop in the price of imported oil  As oil prices stop falling and  begin to move gradually back up, overall import price inflation should turn positive   Prices of imported core goods (the red line), which exclude oil, gas, computers, and  semiconductors, rose at a rate of nearly 4 percent in the middle of last year, primarily  owing to sharply higher prices of nonfuel commodities  With commodity prices  projected to stabilize and with only a small depreciation of the dollar in our forecast,  prices of imported core goods should increase at a subdued pace over the next two  years   January 30-31, 2007 20 of 255      The contributions of exports and imports to US GDP growth are shown in the   lower panel  We now estimate that the external sector made a positive arithmetic  contribution to growth last year, the first positive annual contribution since 1995   Import growth stepped down from previous years as US GDP grew more slowly   Export growth benefited from robust foreign economic activity, but exports turned  out even stronger than our models project  Line 1 in the top right panel shows that,  for the first eleven months of last year at an annual rate, exports of goods grew  10½ percent from the previous year in real terms  Lines 2 through 4 show that three  categories of capital goods—aircraft, machinery, and semiconductors—contributed  nearly half of total export growth  Although it is possible that blistering growth rates  in exports of these goods may continue, we base our forecast on a return of export  growth to a rate more consistent with historical relationships  With the vast majority  of aircraft production being exported in recent months and with aircraft factories  running at high utilization rates, further large increases in exports from this sector, at  least, do not seem likely     Returning to the bottom panel, we project that the negative arithmetic contribution   of imports (the red bars) to GDP growth will outweigh the export contribution (the  blue bars) in 2007 and 2008 by about ¼ percentage point (the black line)  This  projection is driven by the historical tendency of US imports to grow at a much  faster rate than US GDP  In addition, the larger value of imports relative to exports  means that, even if imports and exports were to grow at the same rate, the negative  contribution of imports would be greater than the positive contribution of exports   The projected strong growth rates of foreign GDP, discussed in your previous exhibit,  are not large enough to outweigh these factors over the next two years  On balance,  relative prices have little effect on net exports over the forecast period, as the real  trade-weighted dollar has moved in a relatively narrow range over the past couple  years and is not projected to move substantially over the forecast period  And now  Larry will complete our presentation       That’s correct      Actually, I’m not sure of the answer about unit labor costs per se, but   these growth rates are close to what we think these countries can sustain without exceeding their   capacity limit      They are close to what we think their potential rates are, and they don’t   seem to be above or below their potential rates by very much in the aggregate  There are a few   exceptions, of course—Argentina, perhaps, and Venezuela      Yes      Well, the export contribution to GDP growth last year was about   ⅓ percent, and I would have to check, but I’m guessing that it might have still been zero if we   hadn’t had this surprise  It would have been close to zero  I can check on that      This topic is actually close to my heart in terms of research, and I wish   I could say it was so and maybe it will be so  [Laughter]  I thought it was so around 2000, when   we had really strong exports we couldn’t explain, and then it all went away with the recession of   2001-02, and it’s only now coming back  But I looked at a lot of other countries, and it does   seem that you can explain these differences between export and import elasticities based on   potential growth rates  The one country that seems to fit the worst is the United States, and I   have never understood why the most important country is the one that doesn’t fit  I won’t go   into details, but there are theoretical reasons to believe that, indeed, you shouldn’t expect such   elasticities to be structurally different      The relationship between the official flows and the current account   surpluses?     People often talk about China’s reserve accumulation affecting US   interest rates, but they are only two countries in a big world and you may think that the United   States, Europe, and Japan have relatively open financial markets with a lot of mobility  If you look   at all the industrial countries together and the flows to all of them together, however, maybe there’s   less mobility between the industrial countries as a group and the emerging markets as a group  That   might be more believable  That—along with the fact that these flows are big, even when you   distribute them over all the industrial countries—is what makes me think that there may be an   effect  That may raise a doubt in your mind  It’s not just to the United States or just to Europe; it is   in the aggregate   To answer President Stern, it looks to me—and I’ll double check with our experts—as   though, according to our forecast, our model would have predicted negative real net exports last   year  So all the growth is a surprise     The positive contribution from net exports last year, about ⅓ percentage   point, is entirely a surprise  In fact, it would have been negative, if I am reading our model   correctly     Yes  "
8504,2009-03-17,"2  Dave Reifschneider and I will review the papers on large-scale  asset purchases (LSAPs) that were sent to the Committee last week  Considerable  evidence indicates that policy-induced changes in the supply of long-term bonds  affect bond yields As noted in the top panel of your first exhibit, a memo circulated  to the FOMC last December reviewed the economic literature on this question and                              March 17–18, 2009 11 of 266  reported that a Federal Reserve purchase of $500 billion of long-term Treasury  securities could plausibly reduce the 10-year Treasury yield by 20 to 100 basis points   Such a purchase would also be expected to lower long-term private yields  Generally  speaking, public and private long-term debt markets are closely linked, and  correlations of changes in yields across these markets have historically been very  high However, in recent months these correlations have declined noticeably, raising  the possibility that spillovers across markets may currently be lower than normal   The middle panel presents evidence on the effects of recent central bank  communications on bond yields On November 25 (the first column) the Federal  Reserve announced a program to purchase $600 billion of agency debt and agency  MBS On December 1 (the second column) Chairman Bernanke stated that the  Federal Reserve was considering purchasing substantial quantities of long-term  Treasury securities On December 16, the FOMC stated that it stood ready to expand  its purchases of agency securities and confirmed that it was considering large-scale  purchases of Treasuries  On each of these occasions, the 10-year Treasury yield and  long-term private yields fell substantially  On January 28, the FOMC did not indicate  any change in its stance toward purchasing long-term Treasuries, whereas market  participants reportedly attributed a significant probability to such a move  Long-term  yields rose markedly  None of these moves appears to be attributable to economic  news As Trish mentioned, on March 5, the Bank of England announced that it plans  to purchase £75 billion of mainly long-term sterling Treasury securities  The final  column shows that a range of public and private long-term yields fell sharply after the  Bank of England’s announcement   Household mortgage rates are quite a bit stickier than yields on traded securities,  which makes them unsuitable for inclusion in the table  However, as shown in the  bottom panel, most of the decline in Treasury yields since mid-November (the red  line) has passed through to conforming 30-year mortgage rates (the black line)  I’ll  now turn the presentation over to Dave    Exhibit 4 presents some risks that might arise from expanding  LSAP programs  The most important risk, which is covered in the upper panel, is  whether large asset holdings might threaten the Federal Reserve’s ability in the future  to achieve its monetary policy objectives  Spence Hilton will be discussing this issue  in the context of the overall balance sheet of the Federal Reserve, and Brian Madigan  will discuss potential new policy tools to ameliorate this risk  Large-scale holdings of  marketable assets are not likely to constrain the Federal Reserve’s policy stance in the  future With short-term interest rates pinned at the zero bound, asset purchases  provide macroeconomic stimulus, and asset sales provide macroeconomic restraint   If it were deemed necessary to raise short-term interest rates, and holdings of long­ term assets appeared to conflict with this goal, these assets could be sold off or  potentially used as collateral for reserve-draining short-term operations  However,  outright sales of long-term assets could lead to a financial loss; and some of the tools  that could be used to drain reserves without engaging in outright sales are still under  development   Moving to the lower panel, even though fiscal revenue is not an objective of  monetary policy, it may be of interest to note that LSAPs are significantly increasing  the income generated by the Federal Reserve  This is because the interest rate earned  on long-term assets is much greater than the marginal interest rate paid on liabilities   However, by increasing the leverage and maturity mismatch of the Federal Reserve’s  balance sheet, LSAPs increase the volatility of future income   Your final exhibit discusses strategies for pursuing LSAPs  The upper panel  reviews three classes of long-term security that the Federal Reserve is authorized to                              March 17–18, 2009 14 of 266  purchase Treasuries, agency debt, and agency MBS  As Dave discussed, under  current market conditions, we believe that MBS purchases provide a somewhat  greater macroeconomic stimulus than equivalent purchases of the other two classes   This primarily reflects our view that MBS purchases will reduce private interest rates  more than an equivalent volume of Treasury purchases  However, in light of the  considerable uncertainty surrounding our estimates of the spillover effects across  asset markets, including a significant share of Treasury securities and a modest share  of agency debt in any expansion of Federal Reserve purchases may be a prudent  strategy   The lower left panel shows that the spread of mortgage rates over MBS yields  rose in December with the surge of refinancing applications  These two series have  been highly correlated in the past The staff projects that current low mortgage rates  and the Administration’s new Making Home Affordable program are likely to create  another, more sustained, surge in refinancing applications in coming weeks  As  discussed in the panel to the right, there are some potential actions the Federal  Reserve could take to hold down the spread of mortgage rates over MBS yields and  thus enhance the macroeconomic impact of its policies  These include focusing  purchases on new-production MBS to support new loans rather than seasoned loans   Another possibility, if it were determined to be consistent with the Federal Reserve’s  statutory authority, is selling put options on forward MBS to help mortgage  originators hedge the uncertainty of their application pipelines  Perhaps even more  unconventionally, the Federal Reserve could provide some assurance through its  communications to the market that low mortgage rates are likely to persist for several  months or more This might reduce volatility in rates and thus reduce originator  hedging costs It might also ease the crush of homeowners trying to refinance at the  same time, which strains the currently reduced capacity of mortgage originators and  puts upward pressure on mortgage rates Thank you Nathan Sheets will now discuss  foreign currency liquidity swaps    If I could start with the first couple of questions, I think our views have   been evolving somewhat as we’ve been working on this  When I looked at the literature while I   was working on the December memo, there wasn’t an agreed-upon way to normalize or scale           March 17–18, 2009 35 of 266  purchases like this So what I did at the time was to take the most common approach, which was   to look at the total size of the market across all maturities—and that was about $5 trillion for   US Treasuries The idea was to consider a purchase over a broad range of maturities at the long   end, say, maturities of more than three years, but I didn’t fine-tune it to segments or look at just   the long end per se You might want to do that    I have been moving in the direction that you’re thinking of about   whether there are differential effects, but there’s just not an accepted view in the literature on   how to do this—it isn’t even really discussed very much  On the MBS market, if you take MBS   and agency debt together and then net out the agency holdings of MBS, you get about $7 trillion    But it’s not clear you should merge them in that way; if they were each treated separately, as two   separate markets—agencies and MBS—those would each be smaller  I wasn’t sure, I threw up   my hands and said, “well, it’s roughly the same size”  That’s how we got the $500 billion   treated that way in each market  Since we wrote the December memo, Treasury debt has gone   up a lot; and it’s noted in our latest memo that, in fact, the range we get, which is quite large—   20 to 100 basis points—would need to be shifted down some, given that about $1 trillion of   Treasuries have been issued just since we wrote the earlier memo  So the ground is shifting   beneath our feet And I didn’t really pay attention to that until quite late in the process  But   these ranges are quite large We just don’t know within a big range where the answer is   One final thing before I let Dave jump in is, given all of that, we still thought purchases   of MBS, especially initially, would have a bigger effect on MBS yields than purchases of   Treasuries would have on Treasury yields, because the MBS market was strained and spreads              March 17–18, 2009 36 of 266  were unusually high We thought we could push the spreads down  And they’re still on the high   side historically, so there is still, I think, some scope to do that  And if you keep going down that   road, presumably, the scope to do further improvements of spreads does diminish  In terms of   your question, we have the effect of MBS purchases lowering the corporate spread to Treasuries    Dave, is that right? And we have Treasury purchases raising the corporate spread     So, again, we thought buying private assets would reduce private   spreads generally to some extent, whereas buying Treasuries, which are the favored asset,   actually might widen spreads    The thought was that the Treasury purchases would be taking a safe   haven out of the market and then that would lower Treasury yields more than other assets, so it   would widen spreads For MBS purchases, it seemed to us that just generally you’re helping   remove private sector assets, so it should help all private sector assets relative to Treasuries    I would just note that MBS yields have come down a lot more than   Treasury yields over this period, so that would support our view  Whether that would continue   for the next $500 billion or the $500 billion after that—maybe not    One of the costs might be fiscal, in some sense  "
