7654,2004-06-29,"  Your next exhibit considers the implications for both the US and   foreign economies of an abrupt depreciation of the dollar that could be associated with a  disorderly adjustment  As described in the top left panel, we examine three scenarios  that build on each other using the staff’s FRB/Global model  We note at the outset that  these scenarios are illustrative of some of the issues that may arise and should not be  viewed as forecasts or even as particularly likely outcomes       June 29-30, 2004 8 of 203          In scenario 1, there is an exogenous permanent drop in demand for dollar assets that  would cause the broad real index of the dollar’s value to decline 30 percent over the next  two quarters in the absence of any responses in domestic and foreign interest rates  The  only decline of this magnitude in the history of the broad real index occurred over a  three-year period from 1985 to 1988  In this and subsequent scenarios, we assume that  US and foreign policy interest rates follow a Taylor rule  The dotted black line in the  panel to the right shows that the dollar actually depreciates less than the full 30 percent  in this scenario, as higher US and lower foreign interest rates offset some of the  depreciation shock  Column 1 of the middle panel shows that US GDP (line 1) is about  2 percent higher after six quarters  The effect on the level of US output peaks at just  over 2 percent in early 2006 and then gradually unwinds  Higher output is more than  accounted for by net exports (line 3), as domestic demand (line 2) declines  By the end  of 2006, core PCE prices (line 4) are 1½ percent higher  This price increase is stretched  out over ten quarters, so the annualized inflation rate never rises more than a percentage  point above baseline  Most of this rise reflects the direct pass-through of higher import  prices (line 5), but a little is attributable to the rise of output relative to potential  On its  own, this shock would not be considered disorderly, and it reflects a relatively benign  response to such an abrupt dollar depreciation  Nevertheless, the negative effect on  trade-weighted foreign GDP (the dotted black line in the bottom left panel) is a bit larger  than the positive effect on US GDP as policy rates in many important US trading  partners hit the zero bound on nominal interest rates  Foreign real consumption does not  fall as much as foreign output because dollar depreciation lowers the cost of imports to  foreign consumers  The opposite effect is at work in the United States, showing that  even though dollar depreciation is good for US production, it does have adverse effects  on US consumers      In scenario 2, we posit that this abrupt dollar depreciation is associated with a   widespread loss of confidence in US economic prospects that leads to a 250 basis point  increase in the risk premium on equities and long-term bonds in the United States  The  higher premium and lower expected profits cause US equity prices to fall about  50 percent  Because of the importance of the US economy and US financial markets  in the global economy, it is likely that such a large drop in US equity prices would  spread to foreign markets  The overall effect on foreign financial markets would likely  be muted by safe-haven flows to government bonds in major foreign countries  Thus,  we set the size of the foreign financial shock to have half as much effect on foreign  output as the US financial shock has on US output  Asset-price declines add  contractionary impulses to the simulation, and now US GDP, shown in columns 3 and  4 of the middle panel, declines on balance  At the same time, the upward pressure on  US prices (line 4) is reduced a bit, owing to slack in resource utilization  As shown by  the dashed red line in the bottom left panel, asset-price declines in foreign economies  and spillovers from the United States have a substantial contractionary effect on our  trading partners  Policy rates in most of these countries drop to zero early in the  simulation and remain there     Scenario 3 considers the possibility that, when policy rates hit zero, foreign central   banks might engage in quantitative easing or other nontraditional policy actions to   June 29-30, 2004 9 of 203          stimulate their economies  Because the channels for such policies are not built into the  model, we chose to relax the zero bound on policy interest rates and allow these rates to  become negative, still following a Taylor rule  As shown by the solid green line in the  top right panel, easier monetary policy abroad leads to less dollar depreciation   Nevertheless, the level of US GDP (line 1, columns 5 and 6 of the middle panel) is  essentially identical to that in scenario 2  The reduced stimulus to US GDP from a  smaller depreciation is roughly offset by the reduced drag from a smaller contraction in  foreign GDP, shown by the solid green line in the bottom left panel  The smaller  depreciation helps to damp the rise in US prices (line 4 of the middle panel)  The  bottom right panel displays the classic J-curve effect of a depreciation on the trade  balance  Most of the effects are completed by early 2006  The trade deficit narrows  about 1½ percent of GDP from the exchange rate shock alone and about 2 percent of  GDP when other asset prices also drop  These scenarios engender a substantial degree  of external adjustment, though not enough to eliminate the trade deficit, which is  currently around 5 percent of GDP      All together, these simulations clearly indicate that disorderly adjustment of the US   external balances is likely to have a very contractionary effect on foreign economic  activity  A large dollar depreciation—which is likely to be at the heart of any disorderly  adjustment—provides a substantial stimulus to US exports that offsets much of the  negative effects of any financial distress on US activity  Meanwhile, lower US  imports are a direct drag on foreign economic activity      In light of the dollar depreciation that occurred over the past two years, exhibit 6   explores whether external adjustment is already under way  The last major period of  external adjustment in the United States occurred during the late 1980s  We find it  instructive to compare the recent experience with that of the 1980s  The dashed line in  the top left panel displays the rise and fall of the broad real dollar between 1979 and  1990  The solid red line displays the broad real dollar in recent years, with the peak of  February 2002 aligned with the earlier peak of February 1985  The amplitude of the  cycle was greater during the 1980s, but the broad contours look similar  The recent  interruption in the depreciation is more pronounced than in any comparable period in  1985-87  Should the recent break in the dollar’s downward trend persist, it would be  reasonable to expect any adjustment to be interrupted  The top right panel displays the  trade balance over the earlier and later periods  Despite the smaller swing in the dollar  in the current episode, the trade deficit as a percent of GDP has widened more than  during the 1980s  Abstracting from the effects of the 2001 recession and 2002 recovery,  there does appear to have been a flattening out of the trade deficit recently  In the 1980s,  the trade deficit did not begin to narrow until more than two years after the dollar  peaked—we are just now approaching the comparable point in the current episode  The  middle panel shows that external adjustment in the late 1980s was associated with a  sustained higher growth rate of real exports (the dashed blue line) relative to growth of  real imports (the solid green line)  In the current episode, the growth rate of real imports  has exceeded that of real exports continuously from 1997 through late last year, but the  gap has now closed  Adjustment will require a further rise in the export growth rate  relative to that of imports     June 29-30, 2004 10 of 203                                                            2 The materials used by Ms Goldberg are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   The bottom left panel displays weighted foreign real GDP growth minus US GDP  growth  As shown by the dashed line, foreign economies grew faster than the US  economy in the late 1980s  Robust foreign growth undoubtedly contributed to a  relatively smooth adjustment process during this period  In contrast, during recent  quarters, foreign economies on average have grown more slowly than the United States  (the solid red line), and we are not projecting a reversal of this relationship in the near  future  The bottom right panel gives some indication that the willingness of  international investors to fund our widening external deficits may be diminishing  Net  private inflows of securities have failed to continue rising since the dollar’s peak in early  2002; foreign official inflows have taken up the slack to finance the continued growth of  the current account deficit  A similar rise in official inflows occurred at the beginning of  the adjustment process in the 1980s      The top left panel of your final exhibit compares the recent behavior of import prices   with the previous episode of adjustment  As shown by the red line, import prices have  turned up with the dollar depreciation and the commodity price increases of the past  couple of years  But the rate of increase is much smaller than that observed in the late  1980s  Moreover, unless the dollar depreciates significantly further, we expect that  import-price inflation will drift down over the next year or so  The panel to the right  shows that there was not a substantial increase in core consumer price inflation  associated with the 1980s adjustment  We do not expect a major increase in core PCE  inflation in the near future  Overall, the evidence to date points to a pause in the  widening of the trade deficit, but that is far from a significant adjustment  Indeed, as  Karen mentioned previously, if the dollar remains near its recent level we would project  a renewed widening of the trade deficit      In conclusion, we believe that recent levels of the US external deficits are not   sustainable indefinitely  However, we know little about the path that adjustment will  ultimately follow, including how long our large trade deficits can be financed  The  depreciation of the dollar in 2002 and 2003 has helped to slow the widening of the trade  deficit, but there is no evidence that a sustained or significant adjustment has begun yet   Assuming that US and foreign output remain close to our estimates of potential, a  substantial further dollar depreciation is required just to get adjustment started  The  relatively orderly adjustment of the late 1980s was associated with an acceleration of  foreign economic activity and brighter investment prospects abroad  On the other hand,  a disorderly adjustment process would more likely be associated with a loss of  confidence in US economic policies and prospects  In a disorderly adjustment, the  contractionary effects on output could well be greater for foreign economies than for the  US economy  While asset-price declines tend to depress output both at home and  abroad, dollar depreciation tends to boost US production and damp foreign production   The effect on US inflation of even a large depreciation is likely to be quite modest   Linda Goldberg will now continue our presentation       Mr Chairman, may I?     We have looked, partly at your suggestion, into whether the lags might   have changed, because I think the mechanism you are talking about would likely show up as a   longer pass-through lag  Obviously we don’t have enough data to determine if this is a recent   change in the past couple of years; we can’t tell  We looked at whether the ’90s were different   from the ’80s and couldn’t find any evidence of a longer lag time  The lags are pretty short   June 29-30, 2004 17 of 203            There would be dynamic feedbacks  We use the FRB/Global model,   which will simultaneously capture both effects—from the United States on foreign economies   and from foreign economies on this country  So, yes, it’s a property of the model that things that   happen in the United States have a bigger effect on the rest of the world than vice-versa, in large   part because in this exhibit we weighted the rest of the world by US trade weights to give   greater weight to countries that trade with us a lot, such as Canada and Mexico and Asian   countries  If we had done the weighting by market or PPP-GDP, say, we would get a smaller   effect      Fiscal policy certainly could help  The models are such that if you   want to hit a target, you can raise or lower taxes or raise spending enough to help to some extent    You might not like the other consequences  But the answer to your question is yes  While we   did not actually run those types of simulations, the logic of the model is such that fiscal policy   could help in that regard     In scenario 1, we have the federal funds rate following a Taylor rule    The funds rate increases 70 basis points in the first half and gradually moves up about 200 basis   points  I don’t have a weighted foreign adjustment, but I can tell you that, in the case of our   major trading partners, they hit the zero bound in that scenario     Yes, but just barely  In scenario 2 they are quite strongly constrained;   in scenario 1 they just barely hit the zero-bound constraint  I could tell you how much they   would have to lower rates if there were no zero bound  Japanese rates would be down 300 basis   points, and euro rates would be down 400 basis points     No, because they just barely hit the zero bound  So, it’s true that if   you’re looking at the effect on their GDP—is that what you’re looking at?     In that case, in the bottom left panel, the dotted black line goes down to   minus 1½ percent rather than minus 2½ percent     And in the staff model, it would be about $100 of trade adjustment for   every $300 of fiscal contraction     About 25     I think we agree on what we’ve seen in the past and, of course, we both   are wondering what will happen in the future  I’d just like to say that I believe a lot of the   differences in our views come from how we think about commodities  That’s an issue to   consider going forward  We both looked at import prices, disaggregated and aggregated  When   we look at aggregated import prices, we tend to put commodity prices separately in our   regression in addition to exchange rates  We, too, find that there was less pass-through in the   June 29-30, 2004 38 of 203          1990s  The question is, What is the story lately?  I think that’s where we may have some   difference   In the past few months we’ve been saying that more of the rise in prices has occurred   because commodity prices are rising, which we think has some exchange rate component but   also has a large cyclical component—domestic demands in China or, more broadly, a world   demand component  To our mind, that may explain why the pass-through seems to be higher   lately  Time will tell which will turn out to be right  Frankly, I have a lot of sympathy with   perhaps a return to a higher pass-through in the future because I think, as Linda said, the lower   pass-through in the ’90s might have been because it was a time when China’s economic growth   was rising and their currency was pegged to the dollar  Even though a lot of countries in Asia   had exchange rate movements up and down in the ’90s, for those who compete with and   integrate their production processes with the Chinese, there was an 800-pound gorilla that they   couldn’t really compete against  So they were forced to price along with China, and China’s   currency was tied to the dollar and thus our pass-through estimates would fall  When we’ve   looked bilaterally at which countries seemed to have passed through less in the 1990s, it was   Japan, developing Asia, and Mexico  So it’s quite possible that, if China were to revalue or think   of a change in that respect, all bets could be off  Maybe we’d go back to the historical pass-  through  The jury is out on that     You are referring to the background paper that we circulated?     In that we had a somewhat different model simulate a rise and fall in   the current account balance  I’m not sure that we are here to hang our hat on one explanation for   the rise and fall of the current account; clearly a number of things were going on then  I   wouldn’t say that the portfolio preference shock is entirely the story  But one reason that I chose   to highlight it, to some extent, was that, if you look at a number of variables in the US economy   at the time—interest rates, output, inflation, the exchange rate, the trade balance, and so forth—  it’s the one shock that sort of moves things jointly together well  That doesn’t mean that some   other combination of shocks might not also have worked out that way  But it is one that does   work out that way  So in that regard it has some nice features  Another obvious shock that we   highlighted was the productivity shock, and the reason we didn’t use that alone is that it just   doesn’t do enough  You’d need a much bigger productivity shock in our model for any   reasonable calibration to explain the trade balance     That’s a very good question  I don’t sense that it is that important  A   movement in foreign exchange intervention of, say, $100 billion or so in the model is not going   to swamp the exchange rate, if that’s what you’re saying  Is the portfolio balance built to do   that?  No, I don’t think it would do that  I actually can’t point to specific evidence, though, so   maybe we should look into that  But my sense is no—that the simulations are not sensitive to   that assumption—because these are very large numbers  Even intervention of large amounts by   the standards we are used to is not going to be large enough to make a difference  We’re talking   about a trillion dollars  But your point is a good one  As a modeling convention, it really helps   in terms of actually solving these models  It’s quite normal in these kinds of models to put in   something like this because the model can be stable and you get to a steady state you can   understand  So it’s not unusual to do that, but it’s a good point  "
