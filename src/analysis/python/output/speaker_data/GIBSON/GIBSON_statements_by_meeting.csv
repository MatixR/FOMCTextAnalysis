8141,2008-01-29,"  As noted in the top left panel of exhibit 5, we would like to stress  two key points on the rating agency and investor issues  First, credit rating agencies  are one of the weak links that helped a relatively small shock in the subprime  mortgage market spread so widely, though certainly not the only one  This is not just  our staff working group’s view—most market participants have also expressed the  opinion that rating agencies deserve some of the blame  Second, the way that some  investors use ratings for their own risk management has not kept up with financial  innovations, such as the growth of structured finance  These financial innovations  have made a credit rating less reliable as a sufficient statistic for risk  The top right  panel provides a roadmap to our presentation  To start, I’ll expand on some of the  points that Pat made on the role of rating agencies in the financial crisis  My aim is to  show why credit rating agencies were a weak link, which will lead naturally to our  recommendations on rating agency practices  As we go, I’ll point out several places  where the rating agency issues link up with the investor practices issues that you’ll  hear about next from Bev  We feel strongly that the ratings and investor issues are  really just two angles on the same underlying issue     The crisis began in the subprime market, the subject of the next panel  The   subprime mess happened—and keeps getting worse—in part because of the issues  associated with rating agencies (though as I said earlier, there is plenty of blame to go  around)  Our staff working group was asked whether the rating agencies got it wrong  when they rated subprime RMBS  The answer is “yes”—they got it wrong  Rating  agencies badly underestimated the risk of subprime RMBS  Last year, Moody’s  downgraded 35 percent of the first-lien subprime RMBS issued in 2006 The average  size of these subprime RMBS downgrades was two broad rating categories—for  example, a downgrade from A to BB—compared with the historical average  downgrade of 1⅓ broad rating categories  As indicated in the exhibit, the rating  methodologies for subprime were flawed because the rating agencies relied too much  on historical data at several points in their analysis  First, the rating agencies  underestimated how severe a housing downturn could become  Second, rating  agencies underestimated how poorly subprime loans would perform when house  prices fell because they relied on historical data that did not contain any periods of  falling house prices  Third, the subprime market had changed over time, making the  originator matter more for the performance of subprime loans, but rating agencies did  not factor the identity of the originator into their ratings  Fourth, the rating agencies  did not consider the risk that refinancing opportunities would probably dry up in  whatever stress event seriously threatened the subprime market  Of course, the rating  agencies were not alone in this  Many others misjudged these risks as well  Some   January 29–30, 2008 167 of 249    have suggested that conflicts of interest were a factor in the poor performance of  rating agencies  While conflicts of interest at rating agencies certainly do exist,  because the rating is paid for by the issuer, we didn’t see evidence that conflicts  affected ratings  That said, we also cannot say that conflicts were not a factor  The  SEC currently has examinations under way at the rating agencies to gather the  detailed information that is needed to check whether conflicts had a significant effect     In the next panel, I turn to the ABS CDOs that had invested heavily in subprime    Rating agencies got it wrong for ABS CDOs  The downgrade rate of ABS CDOs in  2007 was worse than the previous historical worst case, just as it was for subprime   AAA tranches of ABS CDOs turned out to be remarkably vulnerable  Last year,  twenty-seven AAA tranches were downgraded all the way from AAA to below  investment grade  As indicated in the exhibit, the main reason that rating agencies  got it wrong for ABS CDOs was that their rating models were very crude  Rating  agencies used corporate CDO models to rate ABS CDOs  They had no data to  estimate the correlation of defaults across asset-backed securities  Despite the many  flaws of credit ratings as a sufficient statistic for credit risk, the rating agencies used  ratings as the main measure of the quality of the subprime RMBS that the ABS CDOs  invested in  And the rating agencies did only limited, ad hoc analysis of how the  timing of cash flows affects the risk of ABS CDO tranches  As a result, the ratings of  ABS CDOs should have been viewed as highly uncertain  As one risk manager put it,  ABS CDOs were “model risk squared”  A final point on ABS CDOs is that the  market’s reaction to the poor performance of ABS CDOs makes it clear that some  investors did not understand the differences between corporate and structured-finance  ratings  Because structured-finance securities are built on diversified portfolios, they  have more systematic risk and less idiosyncratic risk than corporate securities  They  will naturally be more sensitive to macroeconomic risk factors like house prices, and  by design, downgrades of structured-finance securities will be more correlated and  larger than downgrades of corporate bonds      Turning to the bottom panel, as Pat noted, in August of last year the subprime   shock hit the ABCP markets, especially markets for ABCP issued by SIVs  Rating  agencies also got it wrong for the SIVs  More than two-thirds of the SIVs’  commercial paper has been downgraded or has defaulted  The problem with the  ratings was that the rating agencies’ models for SIVs relied on a rapid liquidation of  the SIVs’ assets to shield the SIVs’ senior debt from losses  While this might have  worked if a single SIV got into trouble, the market would not have been able to  absorb a rapid liquidation by all SIVs at the same time  Once investors began to  understand the rating model for SIVs, even SIVs with no subprime exposure could  not roll over their commercial paper  Investors who thought they were taking on  credit risk became uncomfortable with the market risk and liquidity risk that are  inherent in a SIV’s business model     The next exhibit presents the staff subgroup’s recommendations for addressing   the weaknesses in credit ratings for structured-credit products  A common theme of  our recommendations is drawing sharper distinctions between corporate ratings and   January 29–30, 2008 168 of 249    structured-finance ratings  First, we recommend that rating agencies should  differentiate structured-finance ratings from corporate ratings by providing additional  measures of the risk or leverage of structured-finance securities to the market along  with the rating  We don’t make a specific recommendation on exactly what measures  of risk or leverage because we believe rating agencies and investors should work out  the details together (on this and the recommendations to follow)  Second, rating  agencies should convey a rating’s uncertainty in an understandable way  The ratings  of ABS CDOs were highly uncertain because the models were so crude  This is what  I call the Barry Bonds solution—put an asterisk on the rating if you have doubts  about the quality  [Laughter]  Third, we recommend more transparency from rating  agencies for structured-finance ratings  What we need is not just a tweak to the  existing transparency, but a whole new paradigm that actually helps investors get the  information they want and need  For example, why can’t the rating agency pass on to  investors, along with its rating, all the information it got from the issuer that it used to  assign the rating?  Fourth, we recommend that rating agencies be conservative when  they rate new or evolving asset classes  Fifth, the rating agencies should enhance  their rating frameworks for structured products  For example, when they rate RMBS,  they should consider the originator as well as the servicer as an important risk factor   Our last recommendation is addressed to regulators, including the Federal Reserve   When we reference a rating, we should differentiate better between corporate and  structured-finance ratings  Sometimes we do that already, but we could provide some  leadership to the market by doing more  Now Bev will discuss the work on investor  practices       Are you talking about the credit rating agency weaknesses?       There are plenty of investors who said, “We are staying out of that ABS   CDO market because we don’t trust the ratings and we don’t think we have an ability to model   it”  But there are also enough who were willing to take on that risk  So I think it is a   combination     That used to be the way it was before 1970—the investors paid  I think   the common explanation for why that model faded was that, once photocopy machines came into   existence, there was no way to constrain the information that they were providing just to   subscribers       There is  We are not denying that there is a conflict of interest  We   looked at some of the mechanisms that rating agencies have put in place to address conflicts of   interest, and that is something that every rating agency is aware of  The only question is whether   the mechanisms that are in place to address conflicts of interest were working or whether they   need to be enhanced  Our conclusion was that we don’t really have the detailed information to   know whether there were specific conflicts of interest, and we are looking to the SEC to provide   that detailed information  But lots of other things seemed to go wrong with the rating agencies   that don’t rely on conflicts of interest as an explanation  I think people who have looked at the   question of the issuer’s paying versus the investor’s paying feel that, given how costly it is to rate   these things even in the mediocre way that it has been done, it would be difficult to generate   enough revenue through a pure investor-pay model  That is not to say there couldn’t be more   competition between the two kinds, and there are some proposals out there to do that     There is certainly a possibility that conflicts of interest were occurring in   all these areas  We are taking a somewhat neutral position because we don’t really have the   detailed information to say more     I know, but I am a Federal Reserve economist  I would agree with your   point that separating out these nonrating businesses from the rating businesses is important, and   rating agencies have announced some changes along these lines  When we looked at our   recommendations, we didn’t really feel as though, even if they separated out rating businesses   from nonrating businesses and even if they did all the things that people who are concerned   about conflicts of interest want them to do, it would solve the problem     We think the real problem is that they didn’t differentiate well enough   between structured-finance ratings and corporate ratings, and that is where we would like to put   the focus  Securities regulators are already focused on conflicts of interest, and there are codes   of conduct regarding how rating agencies have to behave, and those are monitored  So, coupled   January 29–30, 2008 174 of 249    with the SEC’s already doing examinations, that wasn’t an area we chose to focus on, but we   really can’t say for sure what was going on     I agree  In fact, ABS CDOs are disappearing or have disappeared    Investors don’t have any appetite for them  SIVs are disappearing as well     Really, the question is, What sort of market forces would produce that   outcome?  It certainly seems as though things should move in that direction, and we feel that   some of the recommendations we are making on the differentiation between structured-finance   securities and corporate securities would encourage the rating agencies to put more scrutiny on   the structured-finance side of it  Yes, those ratings should be lower, especially when you factor   in things like the complexity and the uncertainty     A lot of the SIVs were standalone entities managed by independent asset-  management companies that were set up to do that     All the SIVs are in the process of winding down now, and in the immediate   aftermath of what happened in August, that was when there was a crunch in the ABCP market     SIVs had partial liquidity backup lines from banks covering one week’s   maximum withdrawal or two weeks’ maximum withdrawal  That was the way to a rating  The   SIVs were operating under the regulation of the rating agencies  The rating agencies modeled their   January 29–30, 2008 176 of 249    portfolios, and they modeled the inflows and outflows, so I think it’s fair to blame the rating   agencies at least partially for allowing the SIVs to grow to $400 billion or whatever it was     Your impression may be more informed than mine, but I would say that the   rating agencies are doing a lot of self-examination now  I haven’t seen them willing, in my opinion,   to go far enough in the directions that we’ve outlined  A lot of their recommendations focus on   managing conflicts of interest and doing a better job of separating compensation from the rating and   things like that  I would say that I haven’t seen enough on the sort of recommendations that we are   pushing     I definitely agree with you that it’s more difficult to rate structured-finance   securities than corporate securities because with structured-finance securities you have a lot of   January 29–30, 2008 178 of 249    quantitative modeling of future cash flows with a lot of uncertainty  Clearly the ABS CDOs are   very complicated structures because it’s a two-layer securitization—a securitization that invests in   securitizations—and the rating agencies didn’t drill all the way down to model the ultimate   underlying loans  They relied on simplifying assumptions and aggregations that were very crude    But because they were branded as CDOs, people usually understood them to be corporate CDOs   that invest in 100 corporate bonds, which is a simpler, one-layer structure  So the rating agencies   were willing to rate these much more complicated things and investment banks were willing to   market them to investors who were willing to buy them because they all were willing to believe that   a CDO is a CDO is a CDO, and, in fact, that wasn’t really true     Oh, it’s definitely not a random sample of asset classes that we chose to   look at  The rating agencies have done a great job in many other places, I agree     The regulatory structure has been changed now as a result of the law that   was passed in 2006, at least if you’re talking about getting the regulatory stamp of approval from the   SEC to become a nationally recognized statistical rating organization  That’s now just a notification   process by which, if you meet some minimum requirements, the SEC is required to okay you  So   entry is now easy whereas before it used to be restricted by the SEC  In some sense there’s a bit of   a natural monopoly going on because, if you really had a couple of rating agencies that you trusted,   it’s not clear why someone would be willing to transfer from an established to a new one  But if   you were to take some of our recommendations to the next level and talk about how you would   actually implement this and how you would go about making this have some success, one thing   people have suggested is that maybe we should help investors set up their own rating agencies—  maybe they don’t want to do that now—and maybe more transparency from the existing rating   agencies and from the issuers  It would then be easier for a new rating agency that’s funded by   investors to get going and get some traction if there were more transparency around the whole   process  That’s just one possibility     We have kind of a dual problem in that we want investors to do a better job   of evaluating the risks, and maybe better ratings would help on that  At the same time, the existing   rating agencies did a bad job, so we have to criticize them  We have to find some way to reconcile   those     Yes  "
9185,2013-10-16,"  I’d just like to talk briefly about two things  what we are  prepared to do in the supervision area and a little bit about what we are seeing from  institutions we supervise   In terms of what we are prepared to do, back in 2011, in the previous debt ceiling  episode, we developed some draft interagency guidance in the form of a press release,  and we have refreshed that guidance and talked with the other banking agencies, and  we have agreed that we would be ready to move forward with it if and when needed     The guidance covers three issues  First, it makes it clear that the supervisory and  regulatory treatment of Treasury securities, other securities issued or guaranteed by  the US government or its agencies, and US GSEs, for which a payment has been  missed—these will not have any change in their risk-based capital treatment  Their  risk weights don’t change  They will not be adversely classified or criticized by  examiners, and their treatment under other regulations, such as Regulation W, would  not be affected  Second, the guidance says that potential balance sheet growth from  unusually large deposit inflows or draws on existing lines of credit may result in a  temporary decline in regulatory capital ratios, and that institutions that experience  such a decline should contact their primary supervisor to discuss how to address the  situation, and that supervisors would consider whether such an institution is still in  fundamentally sound condition, even if there is a temporary drop in its regulatory  capital ratio  And, third, the guidance would encourage institutions to work with their  affected customers and use the flexibility that already exists to work with borrowers   October 16, 2013 12 of 50    who may experience temporary financial stress  We have discussed with the other  agencies the draft guidance, and we would be ready to issue that if and when needed   On what we are seeing from institutions we supervise, we have already seen some  signs of defensive positioning  As Simon already noted, we have seen some increase  in bank deposits and corresponding reductions in Treasury positions, although the  amounts are still small so far  We have seen some selling of US Treasury securities  that mature in the so-called red-zone period when the potential default could happen   Of course, on the other side, others have been buying those securities who are  apparently willing to hold them  And we have seen some substitution of collateral  away from Treasuries that pay a coupon or mature in the so-called red zone and  replacement of them with other Treasury securities  We have seen some banking  organizations activate their contingency plans that they already have in existence   We have seen less availability of term repo and term commercial paper  And if  conditions continued in the direction of a default, we would expect that that could  lead some firms that have short-term refinancing needs to come under pressure,  although we haven’t seen that happening yet  I’ll stop there     Yes  It’s the same       Not yet  And we have been tracking the headroom that the different   banks have  As Simon mentioned, the custody banks are the ones where it’s the most relevant,   and so far, not yet     There has been some discussion of “we might have to charge a fee if we   get excessive deposit inflows”   October 16, 2013 13 of 50      I think, generally, we have not been issuing anything in advance of an   event actually occurring  I think our posture had been consistent with other parts of the Fed that   had been not going out with statements  So I don’t know exactly the answer to your question,   but I think we are intending to wait  "
