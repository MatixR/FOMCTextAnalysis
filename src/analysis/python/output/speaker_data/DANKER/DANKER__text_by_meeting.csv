4963,1993-07-06,DANKER," [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, most of the data gathering costs are incurred by the investment companies that provide us with the mutual funds data We have access to these data entirely through the ICI at this point If we want to enhance the quality of those data considerably, that entails at the first level dealing with ICI and convincing them that that would be a good idea or convincing them to let us deal with the funds one-on-one in terms of editing the data There are, of course, alternatives--vendors that sell these data But the ICI seems to have the best series on an aggregate basis  I think the data on the inflows--rather than formally shift adjusting the aggregate--are very helpful in looking at the developments in M2 and in figuring out how it's [behaving] vis-a- vis its path The Feinman/Porter work last year looked at using an aggregate that just cumulated the inflows But that's not very satisfying when viewing it in terms of an aggregate and one thinks of the capital gains that occurred 10 years ago not counting as money today But on a shorter-term basis thinking about inflows as some kind of shift adjustment I think can be helpful  Well, if you think of it as a stock adjustment process, it's going to be over after some period of time and this    7/6-7/93  isn't a brave new world or something like that So, maybe we'd just want to shift adjust it for a while There has been an explosion in bank offerings of mutual funds that might make that appropriate I don't know that we get a sense of there having been a discrete step so much as a somewhat more gradual broadening of assets  The only thing we subtract out of those are foreign currency denominated [assets]  For example, the aggregate value of these things is about a trillion dollars, but only about half of that will show up in M2+ because of the institutional and IRA/Keough accounts "

7898,2006-03-27,DANKER,"  I will read the directive wording from page 25 of the Bluebook  “The   Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price   stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run objectives, the   Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing   the federal funds rate to an average of around 4¾ percent”   And now the risk assessment from the statement that was just handed out  “The Committee   judges that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both   sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance  In any event, the Committee   will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives”   Chairman Bernanke  Yes  Vice Chairman Geithner Yes  Governor Bies  Yes  President Guynn  Yes  Governor Kohn  Yes  Governor Kroszner  Yes  President Lacker  Yes  Governor Olson  Yes  President Pianalto  Yes  Governor Warsh  Yes  President Yellen  Yes      3                                                    3 The materials used by Ms Danker are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)     The next item on the agenda calls for us to address the date of  the next meeting, which the Chairman has indicated that he wishes to confirm for  Wednesday, May 10  More broadly, however, this is an opportunity, while memories   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 142 of 167       are still very fresh, to review the experience of this meeting and to think about  possible enhancements to the format of future meetings     In the past for the FOMC, various formats have been used  Just for example, in   terms of the two-day schedule, the FOMC introduced two-day meetings back in 1972  because it felt that it needed additional time every so often to take a longer-term  perspective on policy  Thus, during the mid-1970s, when the Committee was  meeting about monthly, three or four or as many as five of those meetings each year  were two-day affairs  More recently, since 1990, the Committee has consistently held  two two-day meetings each year, scheduled to coincide with the Federal Reserve’s  semiannual report to the Congress     To help focus your comments about the current meeting, we distributed at the   break a list of questions you may wish to address in any comments you may have   Before hearing those comments, though, I want to mention what I think is the  baseline assumption about the path forward after today regarding the meeting  schedule  First, the Committee will meet for one day next time, just as originally  planned, because the timing of international meetings in May makes it difficult to turn  that meeting into a two-day one  Of course, if it would be helpful, that May meeting  could be scheduled to begin a little early, say 830 in the morning, to give you  additional time  Then, in June, the Committee already has a two-day meeting  scheduled  At that point, having had some more experience with this format, the  Committee might be prepared to decide whether to shift most of its remaining 2006  meetings to a two-day format  As Vincent’s memo from earlier this month pointed  out, your September meeting will have to be confined to one day, again largely  because of the international meeting schedule  But the August, the October, and the  December meetings could be expanded to an additional day if you wish     Around the time of the June meeting each year is when we would typically be   publishing the tentative schedule for meetings for the following year—for 2007, in  this case  But that announcement could always be delayed a little this year to allow  for time to decide on the usefulness of the two-day format, and any changes to the  2006 schedule could then be announced at the same time    "
7921,2006-05-10,DANKER,"  I will be reading the directive from page 29 of the Bluebook    “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price   stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the   immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an   average of around 5 percent”   And the risk assessment from the press release that’s being handed around   “The Committee judges that some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation   risks but emphasizes that the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the   May 10, 2006 106 of 120    evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information  In any event, the Committee will   respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to support the attainment of its objectives”   Chairman Bernanke  Yes  Vice Chairman Geithner Yes  Governor Bies  Yes  President Guynn  Yes  Governor Kohn  Yes  Governor Kroszner  Yes  President Lacker  Yes  Governor Olson  Yes  President Pianalto  Yes  Governor Warsh  Yes  President Yellen  Yes    "
7946,2006-06-28,DANKER,"  I’ll be reading the directive wording from page 29 of the Bluebook and the   assessment of risk from the table that was handed out with Vincent’s briefing   “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will   foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run objectives,   the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with   increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 5¼ percent”   And “Although the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to limit   inflation pressures over time, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain  The extent   and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the   evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth as implied by incoming   information  In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed   to support the attainment of its objectives”   Chairman Bernanke  Yes  Vice Chairman Geithner Yes  Governor Bies   Yes  President Guynn  Yes  Governor Kohn  Yes  Governor Kroszner  Yes  President Lacker  Yes  President Pianalto  Yes  Governor Warsh  Yes  President Yellen  Yes     June 28-29, 2006 139 of 177     Just to follow up on the memo that was distributed summarizing  the results of the survey on meeting format, that survey revealed a number of areas of  clear agreement  The recent format with the separate go-rounds on the economy and  policy is viewed as a good one, and there’s little appetite for substantial change to the  format at least for now, but more give-and-take during the meetings would still be  welcome by most  Also, special topics are overwhelmingly considered a good use of  time, with strong sentiment for using staff from both the Board and the Banks as well as  for allowing enough lead time for ample preparatory work  Finally, there appears to be  widespread sentiment for lengthening the amount of meeting time, but opinions are split  about whether two-day meetings are the best way to accomplish this      On this last point, the survey results and subsequent consultations suggest that a   consensus could probably be reached around a steady state of, say, four two-day  meetings each year  These four would consist of two meetings with special topics (two  was, in fact, the modal response to the survey question on that) and then two meetings  before the Chairman’s semiannual testimonies to allow a more in-depth discussion of  the economy and the outlook with the lead-in of the chart show  For 2007, we are  thinking of a baseline of two-day meetings in January and June, as those precede the  testimonies, as well as two-day meetings in perhaps March and October for  traditional-style special-topic presentations  Whenever possible, we would schedule  those two-day meetings on Tuesdays and Wednesdays since that was the day-of-the- week option that appeared least distasteful to you in the aggregate  [Laughter]     Now, coming back to the nearer term, as Governor Kohn noted, communications   issues are likely to require significant additional meeting time before the end of this  year, including perhaps a couple of two-day meetings  Therefore, we would like to add  time to the August meeting both by beginning a bit earlier and by extending into the  afternoon as much as needed  As long as the policy decision has been completed, the   June 28-29, 2006 142 of 177    announcement could be released as usual at 215 in the afternoon, even while the  meeting remains in session  In addition, we would propose to expand both the October  and the December meetings to two days to accommodate the communications topic   Discussions on this topic are, of course, expected to spill over into next year as well, but  for now we are not proposing additional two-day meetings for that purpose  Depending  upon how the extended one-day meeting in August goes and how the communications  agenda itself progresses, there would be various options for setting aside meeting time  next year for those discussions     So, going forward, if you are broadly in agreement with this approach to the   schedule, we will be sending to your offices in the next couple of days a proposed  calendar of meeting dates for the remainder of 2006 and through 2007  We would  request, if possible, a relatively prompt turnaround on identifying significant calendar  conflicts because we’re receiving numerous inquiries about next year’s meeting dates,  which would typically have been released by this point     Also, as to the special topics, we plan to survey you later this year to see what   special topics would be of interest for the slots next year  So if you have any specific  suggestions to make, please let Vincent or me know before then  Then once the topics  are chosen, we propose to use the System Research Advisory Committee to organize the  work, with perhaps Board staff leading one special topic effort and Bank staff leading  the other     Finally, thank you also for the additional comments many of you provided on the   survey  They will be useful going forward     Monday and Tuesday, again, was not the least distasteful option from the   perspective of the survey respondents    We’ll distribute the precise dates in the next couple of days and then please   just get back to us    I think the intention is to package the ’06-’07 calendar together  We hope   to have clearance from your offices before the end of July, at which point we’ll go out with the   calendar going forward  I’m sure our Public Affairs colleagues will assist us, explaining the   additional meetings later this year on the basis of the communications topic, which I think should be   straightforward since that has been in the minutes    And lunch  [Laughter]   END OF MEETING   June 28-29, 2006 145

8728,2009-04-28,DANKER," I will give it a shot, and the eventual vote will be on both the   alternative B directive from the Bluebook—I don’t think it is affected by this language change—   and the statement that I am about to read  Please correct me if I don’t have it right     April 28–29, 2009 157 of 201  “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates   that the economy has continued to contract, though the pace of contraction appears to be   somewhat slower  Household spending has shown signs of stabilizing but remains constrained   by ongoing job losses, lower housing wealth, and tight credit  Weak sales prospects and   difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses to cut back on inventories, fixed investment,   and staffing Although the economic outlook has improved modestly since the March meeting,   partly reflecting some easing of financial market conditions, economic activity is likely to remain   weak for a time  Nonetheless, the Committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to   stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will   contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability   In light of increasing economic slack here and abroad, the Committee expects that   inflation will remain subdued  Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could   persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer   term   In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote   economic recovery and to preserve price stability  The Committee will maintain the target range   for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and anticipates that economic conditions are likely to   warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period  As previously   announced, to provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall   conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of up to   $125 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt by the   end of the year In addition, the Federal Reserve will buy up to $300 billion of Treasury   securities by autumn  The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts                April 28–29, 2009 158 of 201  of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in   financial markets  The Federal Reserve is facilitating the extension of credit to households and   businesses and supporting the functioning of financial markets through a range of liquidity   programs  The Committee will continue to carefully monitor the size and composition of the   Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in light of financial and economic developments”        Chairman Bernanke Yes    Vice Chairman Dudley Yes    Governor Duke Yes    President Evans Yes    Governor Kohn Yes    President Lacker Yes    President Lockhart Yes    Governor Tarullo Yes    Governor Warsh Yes    President Yellen  Yes  "
8765,2009-06-23,DANKER," Yes The vote covers the statement that’s in the packet that was handed   out today, with two changes  One is dropping the phrase “and indicators of consumer and   business sentiment have risen”  The other is dropping the bracketed sentence at the bottom   In addition, the vote covers the directive from page 69 of the Bluebook, with one   amendment  That directive had included the sentence stating that the Desk is expected to   purchase at least $500 billion in agency MBS by the end of the second quarter of this year    Given that it is June 24, and they already have purchased $500 billion, that sentence has now   been changed to, “The Desk is expected to purchase up to $125 trillion of agency MBS by the   end of the year” So it just covers the full year amount   Chairman Bernanke Yes   Vice Chairman Dudley Yes            Governor Duke  Yes  President Evans  Yes  Governor Kohn  Yes  President Lacker  Yes  President Lockhart  Yes  Governor Tarullo  Yes  Governor Warsh  Yes  President Yellen   Yes   June 23–24, 2009 201 of 261 "
