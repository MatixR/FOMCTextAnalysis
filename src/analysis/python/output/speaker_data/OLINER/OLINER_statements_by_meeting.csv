6455,2000-11-15,"  We have some rough estimates  I wouldn’t characterize them as   anything more than that  What we actually did was to look at the movement in bond yields for   investment grade borrowers and for speculative grade borrowers, looking at the whole group in   each case  Then we tried to take a weighted average of those two that reflected the shares of   investment spending that borrowers in each group did relative to one another  The investment   grade group is by far the large majority  It’s on the order of roughly 80 percent, which tends to   suggest that we should be putting more weight on what is happening in the investment grade part   of the market where conditions don’t look nearly as adverse as in the speculative grade part    Nonetheless, there is a nontrivial weight on what is happening in that lower end of the market   that should be taken into account     There is, which is taken account of in this calculation that I just   mentioned  So if we take a weighted average of how bond yields have moved since the   beginning of the year, they’re up about 70 basis points; and from the time of the last FOMC   meeting, they’re up about 30 basis points  There’s wide variation around those increases,   depending on whether you look at the speculative grade firms, where spreads have risen   dramatically, or the higher grade firms in the investment grade category, where they haven’t   risen much     I can compare the weighted average that applied then versus where it   stands now and it’s up about 200 basis points from 1998  I’m not sure what you--       That’s a very hard question to answer  For the lower grade borrowers,   the spreads now are as high and perhaps a little higher than they were in the fall of 1998     But my sense is that the markets are not as disrupted now as they were   in the fall of 1998     I haven’t, but --    "
6868,2002-06-25," Your next two exhibits survey the financial backdrop for our  forecast, starting with the corporate sector  On the whole, we think this sector is in  reasonably good financial shape, though there are clearly pockets of stress  One  indicator of this stress, shown in the upper left panel, is the elevated default rate on  corporate bonds The rise in defaults has its roots in the buildup of corporate debt in  the late 1990s As can be seen to the right, such debt expanded in real terms at  roughly a 10 percent annual rate during 1998 and 1999  Although the rapid debt  growth has created difficulties for some firms, we do not anticipate that a debt  overhang will be a major constraint on business spending  Even among lower-rated  firms, debt problems are the exception rather than the norm, as indicated by the  middle left panel, which plots interest expense as a share of cash flow for speculative- grade firms  As you can see from the red line, this measure of interest burden has  risen sharply for the firm at the 75th percentile of the distribution  But for the median  firm—the black line—the interest burden remains well below its peak a decade ago   In addition, as shown to the right, nonfinancial corporations have a lot of cash to  service their obligations The ratio of liquid assets to short-term liabilities rose  sharply last year as firms used the proceeds from heavy bond issuance to bolster their  balance sheets   Ultimately, the financial health of the corporate sector depends on its ability to  generate profits The lower left panel plots the annual relationship between the  growth in economic profits (the vertical axis) and the growth in nonfarm business  GDP (the horizontal axis), with each dot representing a single year  As shown by the  red dot for 2002, the staff’s outlook for profit growth this year is stronger than the  historical relation would suggest, while the forecast for 2003 is a little below the  regression line  Averaging across the two years, we’re expecting a fairly normal  pickup in profits conditional on the pace of output gains  We worry, though, that the  profit growth in our forecast will fall short of market expectations  As shown to the  right, securities analysts forecast that earnings per share for S&P 500 firms will  increase more than 19 percent in 2003 and will post long-term gains of 12½ percent at  an annual rate Analysts tend to be a bullish lot, so in the second column we have                            June 25-26, 2002 55 of 179  restated these forecasts on a bias-adjusted basis  We have written down ranges rather  than point estimates because the estimated bias depends on the time period over  which it is measured  Even the bottom-end figures appear overly optimistic given our  view that trend growth of the economy, in current-dollar terms, probably is in the  neighborhood of 5 percent annually Hence, the bias-adjusted ranges imply a large  and persistent rise in the profit share of GNP, which seems unlikely  It is this concern  about market expectations that led us to write down the rather anemic baseline path  for stock prices that Dave noted earlier and to include the Greenbook simulation of a  significant decline in the stock market          Your next exhibit turns to financial conditions in the household sector   Households have taken on a lot of debt in recent years, which—as shown in the top  left panel—has lifted the aggregate debt service burden nearly back to the peak  reached in the 1980s The high level of debt has created problems for some  households For example, delinquencies on auto loans to nonprime borrowers—the  blue line in the panel to the right—have jumped over the past year  However, broader  measures of household loan performance look much less worrisome  Auto loans  extended by the financing arms of the Big Three carmakers—the red line—have  continued to perform well  And the aggregate delinquency rate on all consumer and  home mortgage loans at commercial banks—the black line—remains well below the  level seen at the end of the 1990-91 recession   Although the financial press has often highlighted household debt burdens, we  think the real story is on the asset side of the household balance sheet  The middle  left panel displays total household assets and liabilities, both scaled by disposable  income  As shown, household assets are currently about six times the value of  liabilities, and movements on the asset side account for almost all the variation in net  worth, the difference between the two series  Thus, in assessing the influence of  household balance sheets on spending, our focus is on the key drivers of asset  values—namely, equity prices and house prices    Dave has already discussed our outlook for equity prices  The panel to the right  plots changes in real house prices over the past twenty-five years—as measured by  the repeat sales index for existing homes—along with our forecast  As you can see,  these prices have moved up sharply over the past couple of years; indeed, the  72 percent rise from mid-2000 to mid-2001 is the fastest four-quarter change shown  in the chart The rate of price appreciation has come down somewhat of late and, for  the forecast, we assume that house price gains will moderate further    The rapid appreciation in recent years has prompted talk of an emerging house  price bubble, similar to the boom-bust cycle of the late 1980s and early 1990s  While  we would not entirely dismiss these concerns, we believe they are overblown  The  lower left panel presents a key piece of evidence in this regard  Here we have plotted  real house prices (in red) against real per-capita income (in black) for a set of major  cities on the East and West coasts  We focus on these coastal cities because this is  where house prices were subject to the widest swings in the last cycle  As shown,                             June 25-26, 2002 56 of 179  house prices in these cities zoomed relative to per capita income in the late ’80s and  then corrected back down to the income path over the next several years  More  recently, house prices have again risen relative to income, but the gap between the  two is considerably smaller than in the prior cycle  Given the slowing in house price  inflation already under way, we do not expect prices to diverge from income to the  extent observed in the late ’80s   Before concluding this tour of financial conditions, the lower right panel makes a  very brief stop at the banking sector  Quite unlike the situation a decade ago, banks  are in good shape overall The aggregate return on assets— the black line—has  remained high, and the share of assets at well-capitalized banks—the red line—  continues to hover close to 100 percent Accordingly, we anticipate that the banking  sector will not impede the recovery, in contrast to the headwinds that came from this  sector in the prior cycle   A key issue in the staff projection is the outlook for business investment, the topic  of your next exhibit As shown in the top left panel, we estimate that real business  fixed investment (line 1) edged up in the current quarter, which would be the first  increase in more than a year We look for moderate gains in spending over the  second half of this year, followed by more robust growth in 2003  The initial impetus  for this pickup comes from stronger outlays for equipment and software (line 2), as  construction spending (line 3) is expected to decline further in coming quarters and  then to stage only a tepid recovery next year   The current picture for high-tech equipment—an important driver of total E&S  outlays—is decidedly mixed The good news is that real outlays for computing  equipment turned up late last year and appear to be on a solid, if unspectacular,  growth path The panel to the right plots real computer shipments (in red) along with  domestic production of semiconductors (in black), which we have found to have  some leading information for these shipments  As you can see, semiconductor output  continued to rise through May, which bodes well for further growth in computer  outlays We expect the spending gains in the second half to remain close to those  recorded of late, consistent with anecdotal reports that see no breakout—on the  upside or downside—from recent trends  In contrast, the news from the telecom  sector remains downright abysmal  The industry still has too much capacity, and as  shown by the red line in the middle left panel, analysts are continuing to mark down  their estimates of year-ahead earnings growth for telecom service providers  In this  environment, we expect no upturn in spending on telecom equipment before next  year That said, telecom equipment is only a small part of total E&S spending, and  we think the outlook for aggregate outlays is considerably brighter  The panel to the  right shows the historical relationship between the growth in real E&S spending—on  the vertical axis—and the acceleration in business output—on the horizontal axis  As  you can see, our forecast for 2002 is very close to that implied by a standard  accelerator, while the projection for next year is somewhat above the regression line,  in part because we expect spending to get a noticeable boost from the partial  expensing allowance that expires in 2004                           June 25-26, 2002 57 of 179  The near-term outlook for nonresidential construction activity, shown in the lower  left panel, is rather bleak, reflecting the widespread overhang of available space  As  you can see from the red line, contracts for nonresidential projects—which tend to  lead actual construction— have continued to trend down, suggesting that the decline  in activity has not yet run its course However, we believe that the ongoing supply  adjustment is sowing the seeds for a recovery, albeit a mild one, next year  The panel  to the right illustrates this point for the office sector  As shown by the black line, real  office construction peaked in late 2000 and has since fallen by about one-third, which  contrasts with the much slower adjustment in the late 1980s  The wide shaded area  shows that it took five years, from 1985 to 1990, for construction spending to drop as  much, in percentage terms, as during the latest five quarters, even though the high  vacancy rates at that time clearly signaled an excess supply of space  The faster  contraction today likely reflects the greater discipline now being exerted by lenders  and the financial markets  As a result, we do not expect anything like a repeat of the  prolonged dislocation in the earlier period   Your next exhibit presents the outlook for household spending  The top panel  documents the unusual behavior of these outlays during the recent recession  As  shown on line 1, PCE and residential investment spending typically increase slowly  leading up to the cyclical peak, edge down during the recession, and then rebound  sharply during the first year of the recovery  In contrast, during the current episode,  real outlays remained on a solid uptrend through the recession  Given that there has  been no spending decline to recover from, and with negative wealth effects still at  work, we anticipate that the gains over the forecast period will be well below the  cyclical norm The unusual nature of the current cycle is also evident from the  behavior of stocks of consumer durable goods and housing, shown in the middle  panel The growth of the durables stock—the black line—normally slows sharply  during recessions and then rebounds during the first couple years of recovery  This  time around, the stock of durables continued to expand rapidly through the recession   The high current level of outlays on durables, combined with our forecast of a  moderate further rise, keeps the stock growing at a historically fast pace  The story  for the housing stock—the red line—is roughly the same Its growth was well  maintained during the recession, and our outlook for residential investment spending  implies no slowdown through 2003    Obviously, we do not agree with those who say that household spending has “hit  the wall” after several years of rapid growth  Our outlook is more favorable because  we expect productivity to remain on a strong uptrend, which will generate sizable  gains in real income  The longer-term relationship between productivity and income  growth is shown in the lower panel, where we have plotted percent changes from five  years earlier for both series in order to smooth through some of the cyclical effects   As you can see, these smoothed series are highly correlated, and with productivity  gains expected to remain hefty, we anticipate that households will have the  wherewithal to keep spending on an upward track  Dave will now discuss our  outlook for productivity in more detail                         June 25-26, 2002 58 of 179   I’m not really trying to say that I think all these ratios will look as good   one or two or three quarters down the road as they do now  I’m just saying that the starting point   right now is very different from what we experienced ten or fifteen years ago      We had a panel on that     June 25-26, 2002 122 of 179 "
7124,2003-06-24,"4  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Earlier this morning we received  new data on orders and shipments of durable goods, and we’ve distributed a single  page chart that I’ll refer to in a moment as I review those data  I should also note at  the outset that this single-page chart replaces one of the panels on page 5 of your  chart show package, which was produced before we had the data  The top-line figure  in this morning’s data release showed that new orders for total durable goods edged  down 03 percent in May  As you know, within this aggregate we focus on the series  for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft to get a read on business equipment  spending  Orders for this grouping of goods declined about ½ percent in May, and  shipments were off a tad more  Although these numbers sound weak, they were  actually a little better than we had expected and would cause us to nudge up our  forecast for equipment and software purchases in the current quarter  In addition, as  you can see from the chart we handed out, orders (the solid line) have moved above  the level of shipments (the dashed line), providing some support for the moderate  near-term increase in capital goods outlays that we have assumed for this projection     Turning to your regular package of charts, the data I just reviewed plus the   stronger defense spending that we reported last Friday lift our estimate of real GDP  growth this quarter to 1¾ percent at an annual rate from the 1½ percent figure shown  on line 1 of the table  We are projecting a marked step-up from this pace during the  second half of the year, largely on the basis of the policy stimulus—both monetary  and fiscal—now in train  This acceleration continues into 2004, when we expect real  GDP to advance more than 5 percent  As you can see by comparing lines 1 and 2, the  first half of this year turned out to be weaker than we had expected in January, and we  now project a sharper acceleration going forward  We anticipate that much of this  pickup initially will take the form of stronger household expenditures  As shown on  line 3, the growth contribution from consumer outlays is projected to start moving up  next quarter, as lower withholding rates and rebate checks begin showing through to  spending  With household demand firming, the caution that has pervaded the  business sector should gradually recede, boosting outlays on equipment and software  (line 4) in 2004  We also expect a sizable growth contribution next year from  inventory investment (line 5), as firms build stocks to accommodate the advance in  final sales  The faster growth in 2004 reduces the unemployment rate (line 6) to 54  percent by year-end, the same level we had projected in January     The incoming data provide some faint signs of the anticipated transition to faster   growth  As shown in the middle left panel, private payrolls were essentially flat in  April and May, suggesting that labor demand may be turning a corner after declining  for two years  Industrial production, not shown, edged up in May after recording                                                     4 The materials used by Mr Oliner, Ms Johnson, and Mr Wilcox are appended to the transcript (appendix 4)   June 24-25, 2003 66 of 211    sizable declines in March and April, and we are looking for a modest rise in June   This outlook is consistent with the indexes for new orders from the various  purchasing managers’ surveys, which—as shown to the right—have moved up since  April  Among the recent indicators of spending, real consumer outlays on goods  other than motor vehicles bounced back in May, as indicated in the lower left panel,  and appear on track to post a moderate gain for the quarter as a whole  As shown by  the barbell in the lower right panel, the automakers’ forecasts of light motor vehicle  sales in June are centered near the sales pace of recent months     Although these data are still too mixed to conclude that activity is firming, we   believe that the foundation is in place for a substantial pickup, as discussed in your  next chart  An important part of that foundation is a heavy dose of fiscal stimulus,  including the newly enacted tax law  As noted in the top panel, we had anticipated  many provisions of the new law, including the pull-forward of cuts in marginal tax  rates, marriage-penalty relief, and the boost in the child tax credit  But the law also  contained provisions we hadn’t anticipated in the April Greenbook—notably, the  dividend and capital gains tax cuts, an increase in the partial-expensing allowance for  equipment investment, and some grants to state governments  Moreover, the personal  tax reductions are occurring sooner than we had expected  Taking account of the new  tax law plus the continuing effects of earlier tax cuts and the large increase in defense  spending, we estimate that fiscal impetus at the federal level (shown by the black line  in the middle left panel) will be very large this year and next  Indeed, the cumulative  amount of stimulus now in train well exceeds that provided by the tax cuts and the  defense buildup during the Reagan Administration  Only a small part of this stimulus  is expected to be offset by restraint at the state and local level, shown by the red line     Financial conditions are also conductive to growth—and have become more so   since the last forecast round  Given the rally in stock and bond markets, we have  revised up our assumed path for the Wilshire 5000 (the middle right panel) about  10 percent  We have also taken on board the substantial decline in a wide array of  long-term interest rates, including the mortgage rate displayed in the bottom left  panel  As shown to the right, we have incorporated the further depreciation of the  dollar since the last Greenbook     Your next chart takes a look at financial conditions in the household sector  On   the whole, we think households are in good financial shape, though there are pockets  of stress  As shown in the top left panel, the household bankruptcy rate has continued  to rise, no doubt boosted by the still soft conditions in the labor market  However, the  bankruptcy rate focuses on the worst tail of the distribution and does not tell us much  about typical households  Broader measures of loan performance have been sending  a more positive signal  As shown by the red line in the panel to the right, the  delinquency rate on all household loans at commercial banks continued to trend down  in the first quarter  At the same time, the delinquency rate on auto loans at finance  companies (the black line) has ticked up but remains near the bottom of its range over  the past decade      June 24-25, 2003 67 of 211    Households have been restructuring the liability side of their balance sheets  through another wave of mortgage refinancing  As shown by the red line in the  middle left panel, the “coupon gap,” which measures the difference between current  mortgage rates and the average rate on the stock of existing loans, is currently very  wide, providing a strong impetus to refinancing activity  We estimate that “refi”  volume (the black line) hit yet another record this month, with households extracting  a sizable amount of cash through these transactions  Even though mortgage debt has  been growing rapidly, the household debt service burden (shown to the right) has  been edging down in recent quarters, owing to the decline in interest rates and the  lengthening of loan maturities  Going forward, we expect debt burdens to lighten  further, as income growth picks up and as households continue to refinance higher- cost debt     Turning to the asset side of the household balance sheet, some observers have   continued to raise concerns about the emergence of a housing price bubble  The  lower panel shows that house prices, as measured by the repeat sales index for  existing homes, indeed have been growing rapidly in real terms  While we would not  entirely dismiss concerns about a bubble, we believe the price increases in recent  years largely reflect solid fundamentals—most notably, the sharp reduction in  mortgage interest rates  The rate of house-price appreciation has tapered off from its  peak in 2001, and looking ahead, we expect the gains to slow quite a bit further   However, outright declines appear unlikely under our forecast of above-trend  economic growth and only small increases in mortgage rates     As shown in the top left panel of your next chart, businesses also have been taking   advantage of the drop in long-term interest rates to improve their balance sheets  The  corporate sector has been relying heavily on bond financing (the red bars) while  paying down bank loans and commercial paper (the hollow bars)  This substitution  toward longer-maturity debt is now in its third year, and the cumulative effect can be  seen in the panel to the right  The red line plots the aggregate ratio of current debt to  assets for nonfinancial corporations, where current debt consists of short-term  obligations plus the portion of long-term debt due within one year  As you can see,  this ratio has fallen to the lowest level in more than a decade, even though the ratio of  total debt to assets (the black line) has not changed much on net in recent years     The combination of lower interest rates and the shift toward longer-maturity debt   has reduced the debt service obligation for corporations, as indicated in the middle  panel  We have defined this obligation as interest expense plus debt due within one  year, expressed as a percent of after-tax cash flow  The debt service obligation for  the median investment-grade firm (the black line) has now reversed its entire run-up  between 1997 and 2000  For the median speculative-grade firm (the red line), the  decline has been less pronounced but this series still has fallen to the lower part of its  historical range  These trends are obviously good news about corporate financial  positions      June 24-25, 2003 68 of 211    At the same time, many companies are having to cover funding shortfalls in their  defined-benefit pension plans  As noted in the bottom left panel, pension  contributions by S&P 500 firms tripled in 2002, reaching $45 billion  Although this  is a sizable figure, we doubt that the pension situation poses a major threat to the  health of the corporate sector  For one thing, the funding gap is highly concentrated  among investment-grade firms, which accounted for roughly 90 percent of all  contributions last year  Moreover, even for these firms, last year’s pension  contributions amounted to only a small part of their total cash flow—about 5 percent  by our calculations  Overall, we believe that corporate financial positions have  improved a fair bit, and financial markets evidently agree  As shown by the red line  to the right, the spread between the yield on ten-year BBB-rated bonds and  comparable maturity Treasuries has dropped sharply from its peak recorded last fall   In addition, as shown by the black line, a market-based measure of expected defaults  over the coming year has moved lower as well     Against this backdrop of stronger financial conditions, a key element of our   projection is the outlook for business investment, addressed in your next chart  As I  noted earlier, the data on nondefense capital goods through May painted a mildly  encouraging picture about the demand for business equipment  In contrast, as the top  right panel shows, nonresidential construction activity remained quite sluggish  through April, our latest reading       To gather more timely information about the investment outlook, we asked the   Reserve Banks to query their business contacts on this topic  As noted in the middle  panel, about 35 percent of the respondents plan to increase their capital spending over  the next six to twelve months, somewhat outweighing the 20 percent that intend to  reduce spending; the rest plan to leave their outlays about unchanged  These  responses seem roughly consistent with our forecast of a moderate uptrend in nominal  investment spending in coming quarters  Among the firms planning to boost their  spending, about two-thirds said that they had already started to place the orders to  achieve this increase  We also asked about the major factors driving the reported  plans  Few respondents mentioned the cost or availability of external finance, and an  equally small fraction cited the partial-expensing provisions as a reason to increase  spending over the relatively short horizon on which we focused  Rather, the outlook  for sales growth was the factor cited most often—both by firms that plan to increase  outlays and by those that don’t  This focus on sales growth accords nicely with a  standard accelerator model of investment     The bottom panel characterizes our outlook for equipment and software spending,   using the accelerator framework  This panel shows the historical relationship  between the growth in real E&S spending (on the vertical axis) and the acceleration in  business output (on the horizontal axis)  As you can see from the red dots, spending  in both 2001 and 2002 was below the regression line, and we expect 2003 to end up  as another weak year  However, our projection for 2004 is considerably brighter  We  expect the degree of business caution to fade, which should provide a substantial  direct lift to spending and also make firms more willing to take advantage of the tax   June 24-25, 2003 69 of 211    incentives and low financing costs now available  Karen will now continue our  presentation       In 2002  That’s right       In January we also had a set of special questions on capital spending   plans  I think what might have been a little different this time around—and others can correct   me if I’m wrong—is that we tried to structure the questions to get quantitative responses that we   June 24-25, 2003 83 of 211    could tabulate as opposed to a more qualitative sense of what respondents’ views were  But yes,   we’ve done something like this before     Yes, that’s absolutely right  Across the Banks there was a fairly close   correspondence in the answers to the top line question about increase, decrease, or no change    But as President Moskow noted, there were some discrepancies across the Banks with regard to   the other questions—the more supportive questions about whether that was already happening or   when the orders would be placed  "
7350,2004-06-29,"4  Thank you, Mr Chairman  We have received a lot of information  about economic activity since the April FOMC meeting  Focusing first on the data in  hand when we closed the Greenbook, the top left panel shows that labor demand has  clearly strengthened  Private payrolls increased at an average pace of 300,000 per  month in April and May, building on the improvement in the first quarter  These gains  were broadly based and included an upturn in the manufacturing sector that  accompanied a surge in factory output  As shown to the right, manufacturing IP rose at  an average annual rate of nearly 9 percent in April and May, up from the already brisk  6 percent pace in the previous two quarters  Despite the rapid rise in goods output,  inventory–sales ratios (the middle left panel) have moved sharply lower outside the auto  sector, and we anticipate that stockbuilding will gradually pick up, adding support to  production in coming months  In addition, housing activity has been stronger than we  anticipated  As shown to the right, starts of single-family homes remained elevated in  May, and sales of new homes shot up to a record high      However, the key data released after we finished the Greenbook have been softer   than we expected  After folding in the new data on consumer spending, we now project  that real PCE, shown in the bottom left panel, rose at a 2½ percent rate this quarter,  down from the 3½ percent pace in the Greenbook  No doubt, some of the recent  weakness in spending reflects the hit to real income from the larger-than-expected rise in  consumer prices of late  After the Greenbook closed, we also received new data on  orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods  As shown to the right, both series  dipped in May, indicating slightly less robust demand for business equipment than we  had anticipated      Taking this new information on board, the table in your next exhibit shows that we   currently estimate real GDP (line 1) to have increased at a 4¼ percent rate this quarter,  ½ percentage point below the Greenbook forecast  Combined with the downward  revision to first-quarter GDP in BEA’s latest estimate, growth in the first half of the year  now appears to have been less vigorous than we had thought, and we have marked down  the second-half forecast a bit as well  Nonetheless, the basic contour of our projection is  little changed from the Greenbook  We continue to project that GDP growth will move  up in the second half of the year—on the strength of faster increases in consumer  spending and some inventory restocking—before dropping back to about 3½ percent  next year as monetary policy becomes less accommodative and fiscal policy turns  slightly contractionary  With real GDP increasing a little faster than potential over the  forecast period, we project that the unemployment rate (line 3) will drift down to about  5¼ percent by the end of 2005      David will discuss our outlook for inflation in a few minutes  At this point I would   simply note that the price data released since the Greenbook contained some further   June 29-30, 2004 62 of 203          upward surprises, and we now project that the core PCE price index (line 5) will rise  2 percent this year and 16 percent next year         In light of the less favorable news on inflation that we received since your last   meeting, we have incorporated a greater degree of policy tightening in the current  forecast  As shown in the middle left panel, we assume that the federal funds rate  reaches 3 percent by the fourth quarter of next year, compared with 2¼ percent in the  April Greenbook; this change results in a slightly higher assumed path for long-term  interest rates  The thrust of fiscal policy, shown to the right, is essentially the same as in  April  Among the other key background factors, the bottom left panel shows that we  have shifted up our assumed path for crude oil prices by roughly $3 per barrel, in line  with the revision in futures prices  Moving to the right, equity prices were a tad weaker  than we had expected over the intermeeting period, prompting a small downward  adjustment in the path going forward  Taken together, these revisions to interest rates,  oil prices, and stock prices shaved a few tenths from our projection of GDP growth for  2005      Your next exhibit reviews the current state of asset valuations, beginning with the   equity market  The top left panel plots the forward earnings–price ratio for the S&P 500  (the red line) and the real yield on long-term Treasuries (the black line)  The gap  between the two series reflects the combined effect of the equity risk premium and the  market’s outlook for earnings growth  This gap has changed little over the past few  years, holding at a level around the average in the first half of the 1990s  By this metric,  stocks appear to be reasonably priced  We believe the same is true for corporate bonds   The shaded area in the panel to the right shows our estimate of the risk premium in the  high-yield bond market, which we calculate as the difference between the observed  high-yield spread over Treasuries (the red line) and the part of that spread that  compensates for expected future defaults (the black line)  Although the implied risk  premium has come down a lot from its peak in 2002, it remains well within the range  typically observed during periods of economic expansion      The valuation picture for housing appears somewhat less sanguine  As shown in the   middle left panel, prices of existing homes have risen 7 to 8 percent annually for the past  several years  Meanwhile, housing rents have increased much less, which has caused a  steep decline in the ratio of rents to prices, the analogue to the earnings–price ratio for  equities  The panel to the right plots the rent–price ratio against the same long-run  Treasury yield that we used to assess equity valuations  Note that the rent–price ratio  can be calculated only as an index number, so its absolute level cannot be compared  with the level of the Treasury yield; nonetheless, changes in the relative position of the  two series over time shed light on valuations vis-à-vis historical norms  Currently, the  rent–price ratio is very low relative to the Treasury yield, suggesting that valuations are  rich  Accordingly, we anticipate that the gains in home prices will slow sharply over the  forecast period; for 2005, we have penciled in an increase of only 2½ percent, which  would be the smallest annual rise in a decade       June 29-30, 2004 63 of 203          The bottom panels present similar data for commercial real estate  As shown in the  left panel, prices for these assets have risen slowly, on average, over the past three years,  reflecting the soft demand for commercial space  The net operating income from these  properties has been even weaker, falling about 4 percent in 2002 and 5½ percent last  year  As a result, the ratio of net operating income to price, shown by the red line in the  right panel, has plummeted over the past few years, which has compressed the spread  over the long-run Treasury yield  Currently, this spread is narrower than it has been for  more than a decade but is still wider than it was throughout the 1980s  At this point, we  don’t think commercial valuations are as stretched as those for housing, but the situation  bears watching, and we anticipate only small increases in commercial real estate prices  over the forecast period        The top left panel of your next exhibit shows the implications of this analysis for   household wealth positions  As you can see, we project that the ratio of net worth to  income will edge off a bit over the forecast period, as the subdued rise in real estate  prices holds down the gain in net worth  However, this anticipated downdrift offsets  only part of the increase in the wealth-to-income ratio since the middle of 2002  Taking  account of the lagged response of spending to changes in net worth, we expect wealth  effects to make a small positive contribution to real PCE growth this year and to be  about neutral in 2005       The key factor shaping our outlook for consumer spending is the path for real   disposable income  As shown by the blue bars in the right panel, we expect real DPI to  rise at a pace of more than 4 percent over the forecast period, reflecting a combination of  sizable employment gains and increases in real compensation per hour  Our projection  for real spending growth (the red bars) is slightly below that for real income, as we  expect the saving rate to move up toward its longer-run target level over the forecast  period  In the housing market, higher mortgage rates are expected to damp activity,  causing residential investment (shown in the middle left panel) to post a small decline  next year      Some commentators have expressed concern that a firming of monetary policy will   dramatically raise interest payment burdens for households  We believe that such  concerns are overblown, in large part because most household debt carries a fixed  interest rate, which slows the adjustment of interest costs to rising short-term rates  The  middle right panel illustrates this point for mortgage debt  The black line shows the  thirty-year fixed mortgage rate, while the red line displays the average rate on the  outstanding stock of fixed-rate mortgages  As shown, the policy tightening from mid- 1999 to mid-2000 boosted the thirty-year mortgage rate more than 150 basis points, but  the average rate on the stock of debt barely budged  We expect a similar pattern to hold  over the forecast period  To be sure, interest rates on adjustable rate mortgages will  move up, but even for these loans, the average rate will rise gradually because many  ARMs start off with a fixed rate for several years  The bottom left panel shows the  staff=s broadest measure of household financial obligations, defined as the sum of  required principal and interest payments, auto lease payments, and rent payments, all  scaled by disposable income  As shown, this ratio has come down from its peak, largely   June 29-30, 2004 64 of 203          reflecting the wave of mortgage refinancing that reduced the average interest rate on  mortgage debt  Going forward, we expect the ratio to remain about steady, as the slow  rise in the average interest rate on outstanding debt is offset by some further substitution  of mortgages for higher-cost types of debt  Our relatively upbeat view about household  financial conditions seems to be shared by market participants  One indicator, shown in  the bottom right panel, is the interest rate spread on securities backed by credit card  receivables; this spread has narrowed quite a bit over the past few years      In the business sector, the subject of your next exhibit, all signs point to healthy   financial conditions  As shown in the top left panel, firms have continued to deleverage,  reducing the debt-to-asset ratio for nonfinancial corporations (the black line) to the  lowest level in many years  With the lighter debt load, the share of cash flow devoted to  meeting interest expenses (the red line) has fallen dramatically as well  Reflecting this  improvement in financial ratios, the delinquency rate on C&I loans at banks (the red line  to the right) has retraced much of the run-up from 1998 to 2002, and the default rate on  corporate bonds (the black line) has dropped even more sharply      Some analysts believe that businesses—like households—will suffer significant   financial pain from a rise in short-term interest rates  The middle left panel presents a  key part of the argument against that view  The black line shows an estimate of the  interest rate that corporations face on new debt, calculated as a weighted average of  bond yields and bank loan rates  This rate jumped during the tightening episodes that  began in 1994 and 1999 and has plummeted in recent years  However, the average  interest rate that firms pay on their stock of debt (the red line) has been far more stable   In particular, this average rate increased only about ½ percentage point during each of  the two tightening cycles  More recently, the average interest rate has held steady  despite the drop in the cost of new debt  This unusual pattern largely reflects the fact  that the latest downswing in borrowing costs was driven by shrinking credit spreads on  corporate bonds rather than by declining short-term rates  The reduced spreads had no  direct effect on interest costs for the large volume of fixed-rate debt sitting on firms’  balance sheets      The financial health of the business sector ultimately depends on its capacity to   generate profits  As shown to the right, the profit share of GNP now stands at its highest  level in more than three decades  Although we expect earnings to soften somewhat over  our forecast period, the profit share should remain quite high by historical standards   Thus, firms have the wherewithal to support solid increases in capital outlays, and the  caution that had been holding down spending now appears to have faded, as illustrated  in the bottom left panel  This panel plots the well-known relationship between the  acceleration in business output and the growth in real outlays for equipment and  software  The line drawn through the dots shows the fitted relationship for the period  from 1985 through 2000  As indicated by the red dots below the line, E&S spending  was exceptionally weak during 2001 and remained soft in 2002 and 2003  However, the  strong gains recorded so far this year suggest that 2004 will end up above the fitted line,  and we expect the same to be true in 2005  The table to the right summarizes our  forecast for total business fixed investment  As shown, we project that total BFI (line 1)   June 29-30, 2004 65 of 203          will expand 12 percent in real terms this year and another 9 percent next year  This  contour reflects the pattern for spending on equipment and software (line 2), which we  expect to be boosted this year by the partial-expensing tax benefit that expires at year- end, after which spending hits a temporary pothole  For nonresidential construction  (line 3), we expect a gradual upturn in activity this year, which should strengthen in  2005 as the sizable amount of vacant space gets worked down  David will now continue  our presentation        I think just because that’s a convention we’ve had for a long time, but we   can plot it to GDP     We can certainly change that     We’ll be happy to change it  The impression that one gets from alternative   measures of the profit share using a denominator of the type suggested basically—    June 29-30, 2004 76 of 203            I would offer a couple of observations  The first is that there is a long-term   trend over the past twenty to thirty years for corporate investment to be shifted toward shorter-lived   assets and away from structures because of pronounced price declines in real terms  So the stock of   structures in the NIPA has not been growing very rapidly, and I’m confident it has been growing   less rapidly than potential     Yes, I think that’s right  And in the past couple of years the stock has been   growing particularly slowly because construction has been at a low level  At the same time, there’s   a lot of unused space out there  When we look at vacancy rates for the office sector, they are still   close to the highs that we saw in the last couple of quarters, and industrial vacancy rates are still   pretty high  Really only in the retail sector does it appear that vacancies are at relatively low   historical levels   June 29-30, 2004 77 of 203            In the household sector, we definitely think there are pockets where   financial problems still exist  The bankruptcy rate has come down over the past half year from   where it was at the end of last year, but it is still quite high  Most delinquency rates have been   coming down as well, but the levels of some of them are still relatively elevated  So there is   certainly a component of the household sector in which financial stress is a consideration  As for   the business sector, our feeling is that the tail has probably gotten quite small at this point  We do   look at the most distressed part of the speculative-grade universe of nonfinancial firms, and for them   there has been a marked improvement in the types of financial ratios that I showed here     The biases referred to in that footnote were really technical biases in the   construction of the two measures shown here, the rent measure and the price measure  Had we not   adjusted for them, the rent-to-price ratio would have been much lower at the end point  So it would   have looked more alarming  In part we think the published data have some technical problems that   need to be taken care of before this analysis can be done in a way that is meaningful   With regard to the question of owning versus renting, it depends to some extent on what is   happening to interest rates because that changes that calculation at the margin  So it’s really   important to plot any kind of valuation measure relative to an opportunity cost  Just showing the   rent-to-price ratio I think would have been somewhat misleading; it’s really that gap that we think is   the meaningful measure of valuation  And it looks somewhat rich, taking account of the fact that   interest rates are relatively low and income growth has been relatively strong  I don’t want to leave   the impression that we think there’s a huge housing bubble  We believe a lot of the rise in house   prices is rooted in fundamentals  But even after you account for the fundamentals, there’s a part of   the increase that is hard to explain     Maybe I’ll just start off by talking for a moment about how we got the   assumption for the ten-year rate  We begin by asking ourselves where we think the ten-year rate   would go by the end of our forecast period under the market-based assumption for the funds rate    Our guess is that it would be up about ½ percentage point from where it is now, just using the usual   term structure arguments that relate short-term rates to long-term rates  So we deviated from that by   holding the ten-year rate essentially flat  That reflects our belief that, if our view for inflation turns   out to be correct, there will be a favorable market surprise that will keep the ten-year rate from   rising along the path that it otherwise would have taken     I was actually here at the Board during that period, and I remember that we   were concerned as well in the late ’80s about real estate valuations and the amount of construction   still going on given that the tax benefits had been withdrawn in 1986  We did not really understand   what the rationale was in the market  Ultimately it turned out that there was a massive amount of   over-construction and lending standards that were too lax  I think there are some reasons to be   watchful of developments in the commercial construction sector at this point  It is clear that the   compensation for risk has gotten somewhat thinner in this market than it was throughout the 1990s,   presumably after market participants had learned some lessons from the very thin compensation that   they accepted through the ’80s  On the other hand, we do see some rather substantial differences in   the structure of the commercial real estate market at this time  Lending standards do seem to have   June 29-30, 2004 89 of 203          held much firmer  And there’s a lot more transparency in the market now because of the more   widespread availability of data on prices and rents to market participants  So we think the   decisionmaking is better  I wouldn’t say it is perfect  We do feel that there is some reason to be   alert to developments in that market      The rent and the price data come from different sources; they are not part of   an integrated system  The rent data are from the CPI, which is itself only an index number  So   there is no way to say the rent–price ratio is 8 percent—like an earnings–price ratio, for example     Yes  We could make the level of the red line anything we wanted to, but we   could only move it in a level adjustment up and down     Right  With creative charting we could make the relationship between the   two series shift up and down however we wanted  That’s why we’re stressing—     You can make the squiggles as small or as large as you want     No, I think the argument has to do with the size of the gap between the two    And the current gap relative to its average over history—      No matter what we used for our charting convention, the gap would be   relatively narrow now compared with its historical average  "
7503,2005-03-22," Mr Chairman, I think on a year-by-year basis the correlation is going to   be loose at best When we look back over the second half of the ’90s, we had a lot of capital   deepening in high-tech equipment, which directly contributed to labor productivity growth  It’s   true that multifactor productivity picked up and was strong—    Right    Right    It is possible What we’re really talking about are the organizational   efficiencies that are produced by high-tech investment, which don’t necessarily occur   contemporaneously with doing that investment  It takes some learning over time    Not exactly What we did was to try to quantify the pickup in multifactor   productivity growth from those industries that produce high-tech equipment or semiconductors   and computers  That framework was important    Right  "
7528,2005-05-03," Mr Chairman, just one follow-up  The staff’s constructed BBB index   already downweights outliers to try to get a more accurate, smoother index      Not entirely, but it gets downweighted by a significant amount    Yes    Yes, exactly  "
7555,2005-06-29,"7 We have received a fair amount of data since we closed the  Greenbook Just this morning, BEA reported that real consumer expenditures, shown  in the top left panel, were flat in May  This was actually a bit stronger than we had  expected, but there was also a small downward revision to April  For the second  quarter as whole, shown in the inset box, we project that real PCE increased at a 31  percent rate, unchanged from the Greenbook forecast  Meanwhile, housing activity  continues to be robust, with sales of new and existing homes (shown to the right)  having remained at historically high levels in May    Turning to business spending, we received new data on orders and shipments of  nondefense capital goods after the Greenbook closed  As shown by the red line in the  middle left panel, shipments edged up in May, while orders (the black line) softened a  bit These data were nearly spot on the Greenbook estimate and point to a moderate  rise in real E&S [equipment and software] spending this quarter  Looking ahead, the  results of the Reserve Bank queries on capital spending plans appear broadly  consistent with a solid upward track for outlays  As shown in the panel to the right,  42 percent of the respondents expect to increase their spending over the next six to 12  months, while only 12 percent plan to decrease spending, similar to the results in  January   Moving to the lower left panel, the data on initial claims released this morning   showed that the four-week moving average (the red line) edged down to about   325,000, a level that we estimate to be consistent with moderate growth in payroll   employment    Rounding out this review of recent indicators, we received new data this morning  on PCE prices As shown in the inset box to the right, the core index rose 02 percent  in May, a tenth below our Greenbook forecast  Also, the increase in March was  revised down a tenth, although that revision was confined to the nonmarket part of the  index The latest data leave the 12-month change in the core PCE index at 17  percent    Your next exhibit briefly describes the key background factors for our projection  As shown in the upper left panel, we assume that the federal funds rate (the black  line) will gradually rise to 3¾ percent by the end of next year, very similar to the path   7 The materials used by Messrs Oliner, Wilcox, and Leahy are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)                                    June 29-30, 2005 80 of 234  in the April Greenbook Long-term Treasury rates (the red line) are expected to hold  about steady through next year, following a path just a shade below that assumed in  April As shown to the right, the impetus from fiscal policy steps down this year to ¼  percent of GDP and remains at about that level in 2006; these fiscal assumptions are  essentially unchanged from the April Greenbook  Among the other key background  factors, we have taken on board the upward surprises during the intermeeting period  for equity prices (the middle left panel) and house prices (the panel to the right),  which raised the assumed path for household wealth  In contrast, the higher oil prices  in this projection (the lower left panel) and the recent appreciation of the dollar  (shown to the right) were negatives for our growth forecast  On balance, the revisions  to these background factors had little net effect on our projection of real GDP   The next exhibit summarizes our forecast of growth and inflation  As shown by  the black dashed line in the top left panel, we project that real GDP will expand  roughly 3½ percent this year and again in 2006, just a bit faster in both years than the  growth of potential As you can see in the table to the right, since January we have  revised down the forecast of GDP growth about ¼ percentage point in both 2005 and  2006   On our current forecast of GDP growth, we expect that the unemployment rate  (the middle left panel) will hold steady at its current level of 51 percent through the  end of the forecast period  As shown to the right, the projected path for the  unemployment rate has not changed much since the January Greenbook   With regard to inflation, the lower left panel shows that we project core PCE  prices to rise a bit more than 2 percent this year and a tad less than 2 percent in 2006,  up from the 1½ percent increase recorded last year  The table to the right shows that  the projections for this year and next are each up half a percentage point from the  January Greenbook   Dave Wilcox will now continue our presentation     We will now focus on a set of key financial issues for the outlook   Your next exhibit explores whether markets appear to have built in sufficient  allowance for risk—in effect, taking yesterday’s discussion of asset valuation to  markets beyond housing  The top panel begins with the equity market, and plots the  staff’s measure of the earnings-price ratio for the S&P 500 (the red line) and the real  yield on a synthetic Treasury perpetuity (the black line)  The gap between the two  series provides a rough estimate of the equity risk premium  Currently, the gap lies  within the range that prevailed from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, before the  bubble period in the stock market  By this admittedly crude metric, stocks appear to  be priced with an adequate allowance for risk   The middle left panel explores the same question for corporate bonds  The  shaded area shows our estimate of the risk premium in the high-yield bond market,  calculated as the difference between the high-yield spread over Treasuries (the red  line) and the part of that spread that compensates for the expected loss from defaults  (the black line) Earlier this year, the implied risk premium fell to the lowest level  since the go-go days of the late 1990s However, the problems at GM and Ford  appear to have sparked a renewed appreciation for risk among investors, boosting the  premium back to a level that appears to provide appropriate compensation for risk in  the current economic environment   Yesterday’s discussion of whether houses are overvalued raises the same question  for commercial real estate As President Yellen noted yesterday—fully anticipating  my remarks—the middle right panel shows that the prices of commercial properties  (the red line) have been rising at a good clip in recent years even though the net  operating income—or NOI—that they generate (the black line) has been falling  This  divergence has pushed down the ratio of net operating income to property prices, the  analogue to an earnings-price ratio for equities  The lower left panel plots the NOI­ to-price ratio against the synthetic Treasury perpetuity yield  As you can see, the gap  between the two series has narrowed in recent years and currently sits in the lower                                     June 29-30, 2005 86 of 234  part of the range observed over the past decade, which might be viewed as cause for  concern   However, the case for overvaluation in commercial real estate is not open and  shut by any means  Net operating income has been held down by the unusually high  vacancy rates that emerged several years ago  But, as shown in the panel to the right,  the fundamentals for commercial real estate appear to be improving  The vacancy  rate for office buildings—one of the hardest-hit property sectors—started to tip down  last year and, according to preliminary data, it fell further in the second quarter  In  addition, the market rent for available office space has turned up in recent quarters  If  demand for space continues to firm, the apparently rich prices for commercial real  estate may turn out to have been justified, as investors—in retrospect—will have  correctly looked through a temporary period of weakness     Your next exhibit addresses another question that has attracted attention  Is  corporate credit quality starting to slip?  The first point to note is that, at present, the  corporate sector is in excellent financial shape overall As shown in the upper left  panel, the default rate on corporate bonds and the delinquency rate on C&I  [commercial and industrial] loans at banks are both very low  In addition, as shown  to the right, the share of cash flow that nonfinancial firms devote to meeting interest  expenses (the red line) has continued to decline, and these firms still have a large  stockpile of cash (the black line)   That said, we believe that the high point of the credit cycle is now behind us  For  starters, firms have begun to disgorge the cash on their balance sheets  As shown in  the middle left panel, cash payouts to shareholders jumped in 2004 and remained high  in the first quarter of this year, reflecting increases in dividends (the dark blue part of  the bars), share repurchases (the lighter blue part), and cash paid to the shareholders  of target firms in mergers (the red part)  These payouts may well represent the best  use of otherwise idle cash, but they do lessen the resources available to repay the  firms’ creditors   Two developments in the bond market are noteworthy as well  First, bond  issuance has shifted toward weaker firms As shown in the panel to the right, high- yield firms accounted for more than 40 percent of the bonds issued by nonfinancial  companies in 2004, the highest share in more than a decade  The high-yield share  thus far this year, while down from 2004, remains well above its historical average   Second, the use of the proceeds from high-yield bond issues has shifted in a direction  that is less supportive of credit quality  As indicated in the lower left panel, from  2001 to 2003, fully 70 percent of the proceeds from these issues were used to  refinance existing debt, as firms focused on improving their balance sheets   However, that share declined last year and fell again in the first half of this year  This  drop has been mirrored by a sharp increase in the use of bond proceeds to finance  LBOs [leveraged buyouts], other merger activity, and payouts to shareholders                               June 29-30, 2005 87 of 234  Ultimately, the financial health of the business sector depends on its capacity to  generate profits As shown to the right, the profit share for domestic nonfinancial  firms, measured as economic profits divided by sector GDP, now stands at a  relatively high level We expect this share will retreat somewhat over the forecast  period, as it normally does in a maturing expansion  Even so, we anticipate that  profits will remain strong enough to prevent a sharp deterioration in corporate credit  quality   Your next exhibit turns to the question of whether households are facing  significant financial stress Judging by the delinquency rates shown in the upper left  panel, which are all relatively low, the household sector appears to be doing  reasonably well Moreover, lenders seem to have a sanguine view of household  finances As shown to the right, the most recent Senior Loan Officer survey—taken  in April—indicated that banks, on net, have been easing their lending standards for  consumer loans   To dig beneath these aggregate indicators, the staff has begun to analyze the  household-level data collected from the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF)   As noted in the middle left panel, the results are preliminary and will be subject to  some revision as the SCF staff continues to process the data  I should stress that the  results are confidential until the public release of the 2004 data, which is scheduled  for January of next year   The black line in the panel to the right plots the share of households that reported  having any debt payments at least 60 days past due  As shown, the share in the 2004  survey—at nearly 7 percent of households—was higher than in any prior survey,  indicating that financial stress has become more widespread  This trend would  appear to conflict with the low delinquency rates I cited a moment ago  However,  those series were based on the dollar amount of delinquent debt, while the black line  in this panel measures the fraction of SCF households with a late payment  The red  line puts things on more of an “apples-to-apples” basis with the upper left panel by  presenting the share of aggregate debt held by SCF households with a late payment   As shown, these households accounted for 4¾ percent of total household debt in the  2004 survey, a figure within the range from earlier surveys  Thus, from a macro  perspective, the SCF data suggest that repayment problems are not unusually severe,  although the incidence of stress has risen    The lower left panel summarizes some additional findings from the survey with  regard to household balance sheets  First, the substantial rise in household assets  from 2001 to 2004 was driven by the appreciation in house values and was fairly  widespread across income groups  At the same time, the survey revealed rapid debt  growth throughout the income distribution  For households with income near the  median, assets and debt moved up by about the same amount, leaving net worth little  changed between 2001 and 2004 However, net worth rose quite a bit for high- income households                                          June 29-30, 2005 88 of 234  Turning our attention back to aggregate data, the panel to the right indicates that  we expect household net worth, scaled by disposable personal income, to rise a tad  further before edging down next year with the assumed slowdown in house-price  appreciation Taking account of the lagged response of spending to changes in net  worth, this contour implies that wealth effects will make a sizable positive  contribution to the growth of real consumer outlays this year and will be roughly a  neutral factor in 2006   Mike Leahy will now continue our presentation    The final chart displays your economic projections for 2005 and  2006 As shown in the top panel, the central tendency of your projections for the  growth of real GDP this year came down slightly from the projections in February,  while the central tendency of the projected rise in core PCE prices was revised up a  bit The central tendency for the projected unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of  this year is now a shade below that in February  For 2006, your central tendencies  indicate essentially no change in real GDP growth from this year’s anticipated pace,  no change in the core PCE inflation rate, and no change in the unemployment rate  If  you should decide to update your projections, we request that you submit your revised  forecast to Dave Stockton by the close of business tomorrow   We would now be pleased to take any questions you may have    Earlier this year, we were really concerned that the market was underpricing   risk If you look at the panel you referred to at the middle left of exhibit 8, when the gap narrowed   to its narrowest point there, we really did not understand what had caused that  Our view is that                June 29-30, 2005 105 of 234  defaults are going to rise somewhat  You can see our forecast in the black line in the middle left   panel of exhibit 8  That’s our estimate of the compensation for both defaults and losses due to less-  than-full recoveries that would be needed in the current environment  We have that drifting up   some; we don’t have it rising dramatically  In our view what is different now from, say, the late   ’90s is that a tremendous amount of balance sheet restructuring has occurred  That has left even   high-yield issuers, on net, in a better position with regard to their interest service capabilities and   their cash on hand than they were in that earlier period  We see them starting from a very healthy   position after a tremendous amount of restructuring and turmoil in that sector  We think it’s   downhill from here, but not steeply downhill in our judgment  So, we’re taking a middle-of-the­  road view in expecting things to worsen but not dramatically over the forecast period  "
8451,2009-01-27," I am just going to add a few words  I think we are expecting problems in   that sector that will not be as severe as the downturn in the late ’80s and the early ’90s in large   part because we did not have the massive amount of overbuilding in this cycle that we had then    It is true that we have had a tremendous drop in demand for space, but we are coming into this   cycle in a much better supply position  "
