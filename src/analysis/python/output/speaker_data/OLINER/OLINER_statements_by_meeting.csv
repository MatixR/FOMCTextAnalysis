4193,2000-11-15,"  We have some rough estimates  I wouldn’t characterize them as   anything more than that  What we actually did was to look at the movement in bond yields for   investment grade borrowers and for speculative grade borrowers, looking at the whole group in   each case  Then we tried to take a weighted average of those two that reflected the shares of   investment spending that borrowers in each group did relative to one another  The investment   grade group is by far the large majority  It’s on the order of roughly 80 percent, which tends to   suggest that we should be putting more weight on what is happening in the investment grade part   of the market where conditions don’t look nearly as adverse as in the speculative grade part    Nonetheless, there is a nontrivial weight on what is happening in that lower end of the market   that should be taken into account     There is, which is taken account of in this calculation that I just   mentioned  So if we take a weighted average of how bond yields have moved since the   beginning of the year, they’re up about 70 basis points; and from the time of the last FOMC   meeting, they’re up about 30 basis points  There’s wide variation around those increases,   depending on whether you look at the speculative grade firms, where spreads have risen   dramatically, or the higher grade firms in the investment grade category, where they haven’t   risen much     I can compare the weighted average that applied then versus where it   stands now and it’s up about 200 basis points from 1998  I’m not sure what you--       That’s a very hard question to answer  For the lower grade borrowers,   the spreads now are as high and perhaps a little higher than they were in the fall of 1998     But my sense is that the markets are not as disrupted now as they were   in the fall of 1998     I haven’t, but --    "
5560,2005-03-22," Mr Chairman, I think on a year-by-year basis the correlation is going to   be loose at best When we look back over the second half of the ’90s, we had a lot of capital   deepening in high-tech equipment, which directly contributed to labor productivity growth  It’s   true that multifactor productivity picked up and was strong—    Right    Right    It is possible What we’re really talking about are the organizational   efficiencies that are produced by high-tech investment, which don’t necessarily occur   contemporaneously with doing that investment  It takes some learning over time    Not exactly What we did was to try to quantify the pickup in multifactor   productivity growth from those industries that produce high-tech equipment or semiconductors   and computers  That framework was important    Right  "
5608,2005-05-03," Mr Chairman, just one follow-up  The staff’s constructed BBB index   already downweights outliers to try to get a more accurate, smoother index      Not entirely, but it gets downweighted by a significant amount    Yes    Yes, exactly  "
