2208,1994-08-16, Thank you   Thank you; it's good to be here 
2209,1994-08-16," Two issues are of importance to me in assessing the current economic situation First, how much momentum is there in the expansion and second how much slack is in the economy, how close is it to potential output? With respect to the issue of momentum, I  -27-    8/16/94  find myself largely in agreement with the staff analysis presented in the Greenbook Real growth is slowing, but I do think there remains enough momentum to keep aggregate demand growing at a rate somewhat in excess of the growth rate of potential output long enough to push the economy above potential in the absence of some further monetary restraint My own estimate of the degree of momentum in demand has increased over the last few months Most important in my thinking, the decline in the value of the dollar and upward revisions in estimates concerning the strength of foreign economies will be reducing the drag on demand that stems from net exports In line with the staff forecast, I also expect the declining dollar to feed through to some mild upward pressure on import prices Now that the economy is close to potential, higher import prices should create a bit more scope for American producers of import substitutes to raise their own prices I don't want to overemphasize the impact of the dollar decline on aggregate demand and prices, but at the margin, especially in the context of an economy that is nearing potential, this seems like a source of momentum And I see these international factors as offsetting to some extent the moderating influence of higher interest rates on housing and consumer durables spending The strength of new orders for durable goods and the strong profit projections suggest continuing strength in investment, and the staff analysis convinces me that there are risks that the slowdown in demand could be insufficient, absent some further tightening to prevent overheating  With respect to the issue of how close the economy is to potential, I confess uncertainty here Nevertheless, on the basis of both econometric and anecdotal evidence, it seems to me that output has not yet passed potential, although we are approaching it I don't yet see strong enough indications of tightness in labor markets, or enough signs of increasing wage pressure, or sufficient indication of a pickup in the growth of unit labor costs to conclude that we have ventured beyond potential Capacity utilization is high by historical standards, but investment also is adding to capacity at a rapid rate I see only scattered evidence of lengthening lags in filling orders On balance, I'd say my sense is that the economy could stay where it is in terms of unemployment or even shave a few tenths more off the unemployment rate without risking significantly a pickup in inflation This inclines me toward the feeling that there should be some tightening of policy to reduce momentum, but somewhat less than the Greenbook assumes The Greenbook forecasts for real growth in 1995 are somewhat too low in my opinion to end up with an economy in 1995 that is operating near enough to potential "
2210,1994-08-16," Mr Chairman, I support your proposal and believe there is a good chance that a 50 basis point increase in the funds rate now will be sufficient in the absence of significant news And I like the proposed statement that you read "
2267,1994-09-27," I agree with the central message of the Greenbook that most of the new information that has accumulated during the last six weeks points to continued strength in aggregate demand  -29-    9/27/94  The incoming data do not yet provide any significant evidence of a sufficient slowdown in real GDP growth However, this is not based on a great deal of evidence A lot more data will be coming in over the next month that will clarify whether this impression is correct or not I personally am concerned that we have put quite a bit of restraint into the pipeline, a good share of it quite recently, and it may yet make its impact felt Under the Greenbook assumption of an additional 100 basis point rise in the funds rate, I am considerably more pessimistic than the Greenbook about the 1996 forecast for real growth For example, in the MPS model the impact of such a tightening becomes really discernible only after about four quarters, namely by early 1996 And after eight quarters, such a rise would take about 09 percent off real GDP That leaves me with a sense that a forecast of 22 or 23 percent real growth in 1996 may be overly optimistic with that added restraint  A key question now concerns the behavior of prices--whether there is evidence at this stage that inflation is accelerating This in my view is an especially important issue given our concern with inflation as an ultimate policy goal and also the feeling that the economy is operating at close to potential where there is a decided risk that inflation could begin to creep up But here my analysis differs somewhat from the staff forecast In particular, I think we are seeing and will continue to see for a time an increase in the relative prices of raw materials and imported goods These higher prices will feed through into the CPI for a period of time, causing a temporary increase in the rate of inflation but not a permanent increase in the trend inflation rate, or worse yet, an acceleration in inflation I think the increase in inflation will be temporary even if there is only enough restraint to hold the unemployment rate at its present level, roughly the natural rate given staff estimates And I think the markets have overreacted to the increase in producer prices in August  Now, the Greenbook is also forecasting that consumer price inflation will be up for the next three quarters and then will return to roughly 3 percent by the end of 1995, and I agree with that forecast My difference with the Greenbook concerns whether or not a period of unemployment in excess of the natural rate is needed to get inflation back into line I think not, but the Greenbook thinks that it will require a period of unemployment in excess of the natural rate in the latter half of 1995 and 1996 to subdue inflation, and that's something more than a quibble because it does govern one's view about how much additional restraint it is going to take to hold inflation at its present level  To elaborate just a bit, I think we are witnessing now a perfectly normal cyclical phenomenon, namely, the relative prices of primary commodities and raw materials tend naturally to increase with the level of domestic and more importantly world economic activity The prices of these materials have been increasing rapidly all year, but from initially depressed levels I expect these prices to rise further due to faster global growth, but then I expect them to stop rising once economic activity stabilizes Similarly, we have had a significant depreciation of the dollar, which is causing and will probably continue to cause for a time a rise in the level of import prices But the staff doesn't expect the dollar depreciation to  -30-    9/27/94  continue and so we should expect import prices also to rise and then stop rising  My conclusion is that these shocks should feed into faster CPI inflation only for a time, and once the adjustment is complete, inflation should revert toward its previous level I expect this to occur even if the CPI increase feeds partially through into wages, although the greater this feedback, the longer this temporary burst in inflation will persist I agree with Governor Kelley that there is a danger that inflationary expectations can overreact Historically, I think the evidence on the likely pass-through of temporary price shocks into wages is quite inconclusive  The only caveat I want to add in this analysis is that I'm assuming along with the Greenbook that the unemployment rate is not going to be allowed to fall below the natural rate--and that means not very much lower than it currently is--for any significant period of time With respect to the question of whether or not we are below the natural rate, I think wage behavior provides the best direct evidence The fact that wages have been so well-behaved, with average hourly earnings rising only 02 percent last month, for example, convinces me that we have not overshot the natural rate "
2268,1994-09-27," I support your proposal, Mr Chairman I think it's conceivable that sufficient evidence could accumulate over the next month or so to warrant a rate hike before our next meeting, but it would take quite a bit to convince me that further tightening prior to the next meeting is in order "
2328,1994-11-15," Since our last meeting, the evidence has continued to accumulate that there is enough momentum in aggregate demand to carry the economy past potential output We have yet to see much slowdown in the interest-sensitive sectors, and it may well be that easier lending terms have offset somewhat the impact of higher interest rates The news on the international side of yet further upward revisions in foreign GDP growth reinforces the view that the economy will overshoot the NAIRU with potentially inflationary consequences The recent decline in the dollar exacerbates this concern, although fortunately the dollar has risen a bit against both the mark and the yen since the Greenbook was put to bed The amount of slack in the economy, however it is measured, clearly has diminished I think that the performance of wages and prices accords quite well with the predictions of a Phillips curve model in which the economy is currently in the vicinity of the natural rate So there are few surprises there It is not surprising that we are seeing some early warning signs of rising inflation, including business reports that there will be price increases after the first of the year and anecdotes about rising wages to retain and attract qualified employees I think the staff's inflation forecast that the CPI will rise to 3-1/2 percent in the first half of 1995 is quite reasonable based on historic experience It is difficult, though, to construct a scenario in which inflation over the next year would rise by a lot more than the staff forecast So, I think there is limited upside risk of an inflation rate increase over the next year or so The key question, of course, is whether and how quickly this modest rise in core inflation may become embedded in inflationary expectations, feeding back into wage and price formation I think there is risk here unless aggregate demand is restrained  Now, what concerns me most in connection with the Greenbook forecast is that the assumed further tightening of 150 basis points entails considerable downside risk to the economy that will be concentrated in 1996 In light of the current strength in the  -30-    11/15/94  interest-sensitive sectors, it is tempting to conclude that the monetary tightening we have had so far isn't producing and will not produce the slowdown we desire But the time honored view among economists is that monetary policy operates with long lags I consider this view to be supported by considerable empirical evidence If so, there is a real risk of a hard landing, instead of a soft landing, if we are too impatient and overract Demand may be strong now because monetary conditions were so easy until last spring The tightening is really quite recent and its impact most likely has not yet been fully felt Indeed, as President Jordan noted in his comments, the November Michigan survey suggests a sharp deterioration in household appraisals of buying conditions for houses and significant declines in willingness to use credit and savings The October survey suggested that some of the current strength in housing may stem from the belief that interest rates are on the rise, so it is better to buy now than later  This view, namely that there remains restraint in the pipeline, seems consistent to me with the Greenbook forecast because, given the lags of monetary policy, the Greenbook's projected slowdown in 1995 must primarily be related to the interest rate increases that already have occurred, along with other factors, and can't be related primarily to the assumed further tightening of 150 basis points The staff forecast implicitly assumes that we already have enough restraint to slow growth in 1995 by enough to bring unemployment back to the natural rate by the end of 1995 In that case, the argument for an additional 150 basis points of restraint rests on the staff's assumption that without that restraint, demand would rebound strongly in 1996 Now, that view may be correct, but the logic of why there would be this strong rebound in demand in 1996 without the 150 basis points of additional restraint does not seem compelling to me I think there is a distinct possibility that that much extra restraint would represent overkill and that the overkill would make itself felt in 1996 In addition, I would point out that the Greenbook forecast assumes that the tightening is going to have relatively little additional effect on long-term rates While I'm not a good forecaster of movements in long-term rates, certainly that assumption has proven incorrect thus far I conclude that the degree of tightening assumed in the Greenbook poses a serious risk of a hard landing in 1996, although in the absence of some further tightening, I think there would be an unacceptable risk that inflation would accelerate "
2329,1994-11-15," As I mentioned, it seems clear to me that some tightening of policy is needed to prevent inflation from accelerating, but I have strong doubts about the need for an additional 150 basis  -40-    11/15/94  points My guess is that it will take 75 to get the job done, and I can live with 75 basis points today But on balance, I guess I would agree with Ed Boehne, and I would favor 50 today I share his concerns As Don mentioned, it worries me that in the absence of an announcement of the type we issued in August, 75 can backfire Instead of simply flattening the yield curve and our seeing very little effect on long-term rates, a rise of this magnitude may raise market expectations both about the risks of inflation--because we are so concerned about it--and market expectations about the ultimate expected tightening that we intend here I am concerned about the possibility that bond yields could rise more than the Greenbook forecast, which could provoke a stock market reaction My own preference would be for 50 today, but I can live with 75 as well "
2378,1994-12-20," My opinion concerning the strength and likely future direction of the economy has changed just marginally since our last meeting Certainly, the evidence has continued to accumulate that we have an economy with a very good head of steam We see that in the employment report, a significant rise in the help wanted index, growing order backlogs, and frankly to my surprise in the Michigan indexes of car, appliance, and house buying intentions which all turned up after having fallen, in some cases substantially, in November So I must admit I'm surprised to see so little evidence of a slowdown, although I continue to feel--as I stated last time--that we are seeing in part the lagged effects of a prolonged period of low interest rates, as Governor Blinder also noted  There is certainly some risk that real growth will slow less in 1995 than the Greenbook forecast now assumes and that we could overshoot potential output in 1995 by more Nevertheless, I'll just continue to emphasize, as others and I have in the past, that our previous actions have added a great deal of restraint to the pipeline Since our last meeting real interest rates have risen considerably, and as Bill McDonough emphasized, real interest rates by various measures are not low by historical standards We have seen, finally,  -29-    12/20/94  a decline in the stock market, which will bring wealth effects on consumer spending into play, and for once the dollar has been appreciating--which re-enforces direct interest rate effects and plays some moderating influence on the inflation forecast In addition, of course, as Mike has emphasized, inventory accumulation is bound to slow and it seems possible to me that accelerator mechanisms can then kick in to slow the economy significantly  So, I see a number of changes in the pipeline that I expect to work to cool off demand but with a very substantial lag And frankly at this stage I remain uncertain as to just where the economy would be in 1996 with the 100 to 150 basis points increase that is assumed in the Greenbook I share the concern of a number of private forecasters and of some of you that this degree of tightening in the near term could slow demand growth and that we could end up producing a boom/bust scenario To avoid such an outcome, it seems to me that the funds rate would have to fall rather quickly, by more than the Greenbook assumes, once growth slows to trend, even with the economy below the NAIRU "
2379,1994-12-20," Mr Chairman, I favor alternative B to hold the funds rate at 5-1/2 percent at this meeting, and I favor it for the reasons suggested in the Bluebook I also concur with the sentiments expressed by Governors Blinder and Lindsey and President Forrestal I think a wait-and-see strategy is reasonable, given the magnitude of previous tightening and particularly given our uncertainty about whether and how much the economy is likely to slow on its own and my own uncertainty about how much additional tightening is going to be needed I would prefer a symmetric directive with a strong presumption that we would wait until the next meeting in order to act "
2434,1995-03-28," The data that we reviewed at our last meeting provided inconclusive and, as we put it, tentative signs of slowing in growth The magnitude of any moderation in demand growth seemed uncertain and the timing of the long awaited slowdown was also in question That certainly raised the concern that it wasn't going to occur quickly enough to avoid a further reduction in labor market slack, with future inflationary consequences Since that meeting, I think we have learned a lot, although I agree that not all doubts have been erased From my point of view, the Greenbook does an outstanding job of digesting all the new information The analysis it presents is very well reasoned I would say the evidence in hand now points to a slowdown that is somewhat greater and more pervasive than previously anticipated The incoming data coupled, of course, with our recent rate hike have led to downward revisions in the projected growth in virtually every component of demand I think the outlook for net exports, at least beyond the current horizon, is the single modest exception to that pattern From my standpoint, what we are finally seeing is the result of previous Fed tightening emerging through the pipeline, with the interest-sensitive sectors, housing and autos, leading the way exactly as theory and past experience predict On the down side, we are now seeing a significant inventory buildup in automobiles leading to production cuts in the spring, and that significantly weakens the forecast in the near term Investment growth also looks like it is slowing, not excessively but nevertheless slowing So, at the moment the economy looks to me like it is not too hot, it is not too cold, it is just right  The long-term inflation risk, it seems to me, is not entirely absent Therefore, we have to be vigilant to see how things progress from here But it does seem to me that the risk has subsided a little We now have a forecast embodying more labor market slack in 1995 and 1996 than our last Greenbook forecast, and a forecast of significant new capacity coming on line Most important, of course, what we are seeing is, to my mind, surprising and continued moderation in compensation growth and subdued growth in unit labor costs If wages continue to be, as Ed Boehne put it, a nonproblem, that suggests that eventually we may have reason to question whether that the NAIRU is 6 percent or 1 or so lower I think we should keep an open mind on that topic  The Greenbook emphasizes that the dollar poses significant risk to the forecast I thought the simulations in the Greenbook did a very good job of assessing the risk I agree with President Forrestal that the exchange rate should not be a target of our policy, but it does have appreciable effects on output and inflation Nevertheless, it does seem to me that the risks from the dollar are roughly balanced because, although we are told some interesting stories about why the dollar is doing what it is doing, I think when all is said and done that I would agree with Ted's conclusion that in truth the recent movement in the dollar does not seem to be warranted by any perceptible change in fundamentals On balance, I would say that in a market like this where psychology matters so much, random walks work well That is probably going to be the best forecast of where things are headed Certainly, the dollar could move a lot, but  -36-    3/28/95  it could go either up or down The Greenbook assumption of a path with the dollar staying where it is seems appropriate to me, on balance I take as the moral of those simulations that what we need to do at this point is watch and wait and be prepared to adjust policy in either direction if the exchange rate or any other risk factor in this forecast changes significantly On balance, I see the risks to the forecast as being in both directions and roughly balanced at this point "
2435,1995-03-28," I agree with your proposal for alternative B for no change today Although I could live with asymmetric, I would prefer symmetric for the reasons that have been explained by President Forrestal and Governor Blinder At the moment, it seems to me that the economy, with some reasonable probability, is on track for a soft landing There are all kinds of uncertainties in the outlook Indeed, we may have a false negative; we may be learning that There remains a risk that inflation may not come down in the way we would like I certainly hold open the possibility that at some future point we may need to raise rates more But over this next intermeeting period, when I think about what data are likely to come in, it seems to me that the risks are balanced and that tends to call for symmetry Certainly, I agree with what Don said We should not get stuck where we are I have no objection whatsoever to intermeeting changes The approach of possibly smaller changes, 25 basis points one way or another, has a great deal of appeal at this stage It is simply that at this point, for the next month and a half, it seems to me that the risks and likely information indicate risks in both directions and that that calls for symmetry "
2486,1995-05-23," As I evaluate the most recent set of economic data, I remain quite optimistic that we will achieve the soft landing projected in the Greenbook, with growth slowing below trend during 1995 and rising back toward trend in 1996, and with inflation remaining contained during the process Historically, of course, soft landings have rarely been achieved, but this time it seems to me that the preconditions are better First, any overshoot of potential output that has occurred thus far is relatively small in contrast to past cycles Second, inflation has remained remarkably well  -26-    5/23/95  contained Third, inflationary expectations have not risen Fourth, we now have clear evidence of a significant slowdown under way, but there is little evidence of any inventory overhang outside the automobile and housing sectors, and I think that limits the possibility of a hard landing  One of the favorable factors affecting the outlook is that, in the words of the Greenbook, ""labor costs remain under remarkable restraint"" Increases in compensation are running significantly below forecasts based on econometric wage equations Benefit cost increases have slowed substantially, and there has been no offset, at least thus far, in the form of higher wages and salaries In recognition of that fact, the Greenbook has revised downward its forecast of hourly compensation growth But with core inflation behaving about as expected, thus far at least, the Greenbook forecast of core inflation has been revised downward by less That strikes me as a reasonable assumption for the short run, but if the compensation surprise persists over the longer run, it is quite likely that we will see compensation restraint showing through to restraint in core inflation, and we will end up with a slightly more favorable inflation trend as well In that sense, I think the forecast contains some downward risks on the inflation side, but it is really too soon to know whether this compensation surprise will turn out to be transitory or permanent If it is permanent, that would imply a decline in the natural rate of unemployment At a minimum, the economy is in effect experiencing a favorable supply shock, which is quite welcome in a period where the economy may have overshot potential output and there is continuing pressure from the prices of intermediate materials and imports  As I evaluate the risks in the forecast with respect to real GDP growth, they seem to me to be roughly balanced at the present time I do have a few concerns on the down side First, I am concerned about the possibility, which Governor Lindsey emphasized, that the personal saving rate may not decline as much from its current first-quarter level of 51 or 52 percent as the Greenbook assumes, and hence that PCE growth may be less strong Over the last two years, personal consumption expenditures have been buoyed by strong spending on durable goods In line with the Greenbook, I think it is quite likely that the growth of spending on durables will slow substantially because a significant portion of the earlier spending probably went to satisfy pent-up demand Now, it seems natural to expect the personal saving rate as measured in the national income and product accounts, which include expenditures on durables, to rise when spending on durables is weak and to fall when spending on durables is strong simply because durable goods provide a flow of services over a long time horizon and are thus a form of savings from the households' perspective In fact, this is the assumption that is embodied in the Board's MPS model Now, the Greenbook assumes that the NIPA personal saving rate will decline, as Governor Lindsey mentioned, to 44 or 45 percent in 1996, and that is a level somewhat above its 41 percent average in 1993 and 1994 when consumption of durables was so strong But it is well below its 5-1/4 percent average for 1991 and 1992 My concern is that that assumption may be too optimistic, and since consumption is such a large fraction of total expenditures, an error here can have significant repercussions for the forecast  -27-    5/23/95  A second downside risk comes from the potential spillover effects of the inventory adjustment currently under way in the automobile sector, which is forecast to depress real GDP growth in the current and subsequent quarters I don't want to quarrel with the Greenbook analysis here; it is just that I always worry that there is a possibility of significant repercussions through the multiplier if households cut consumption in response to a decline in income and through the accelerator process if investment slows down in response to a decline in the growth rate of real GDP, especially at a time when capacity constraints are easing I am simply saying that these spillovers could turn out to be greater than the Greenbook assumes Governor Lindsey has done an excellent job of describing the risks from fiscal policy, and I share his concerns  Of course, there are also risks on the up side As Vice Chairman McDonough noted, these work through interest rates, exchange rates, and the stock market The Greenbook assumes that the bond market rally is overdone and that a portion of the decline in intermediate- and long-term bond yields will be reversed If this assumption proves false, it is conceivable that interest-sensitive sectors will rebound, turning a slowdown into a pause "
2487,1995-05-23," Mr Chairman, I support your proposal for ""B"" symmetric I think that an unchanged funds rate is warranted given the Greenbook forecast with risks roughly balanced "
2539,1995-08-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman I think the news that has accumulated during the intermeeting period is almost entirely favorable with respect to the outlook, both for real performance and    8/22/95  for inflation over the forecast horizon While I, too, would like to find a reason to disagree with the Greenbook, I find myself in substantial agreement with the Greenbook's assessment of the data Most important to my way of thinking is that we now have mounting evidence that the inventory adjustment under way is proceeding more rapidly and with substantially less disruption of growth in final sales than I had been fearing The continued strength of consumption and investment spending in the face of the inventory adjustment, coupled with strong evidence of a rebound in residential construction, substantially mitigates what I had thought was one of the most serious downside risks At this stage, as David emphasized, substantial risks to the outlook for real growth remain, but I agree that they are much more balanced than they seemed to me in July As David also indicated, it's possible to argue that there remains enough momentum in aggregate demand to potentially rekindle inflationary pressures In that regard, I would simply point out that we have had a significant backup in interest rates since our last meeting, coupled with a significant appreciation of the dollar I think that those two forces are working to restrain this upside risk  At our last meeting, Mr Chairman, you argued that the present level of the real funds rate is above the neutral or equilibrium level that is needed for stable growth with a continuing secular downtrend in the rate of inflation The Bluebook for the July meeting reinforced the conclusion that, particularly with projected fiscal contraction, this neutral real funds rate would be declining gradually over time I certainly agreed with that conclusion then and I continue, as Governor Blinder emphasized, to think that eventually the real funds rate is going to need to decline to keep the economy on track beyond the forecast horizon I agree with Governor Blinder's explanation that if we were to go beyond the six quarters in the Greenbook, we would see initially a mild shortfall in growth below what is needed to keep the economy operating at potential and then the gap would begin to widen It's in that sense that a decline in the real funds rate is eventually going to be needed to keep the economy on track Nevertheless, over the forecast horizon I think that the outlook has definitely improved  On the inflation front, the news has also been quite favorable Recent readings on producer and consumer prices along with the appreciation of the dollar have lessened the concern that the uptick in inflation that we saw in the first half of the year could presage a higher inflation trend And as David Stockton emphasized, the continued moderation in the growth of benefit costs and compensation is a favorable factor in the inflation outlook It may be too soon to break out the champagne, but it seems quite likely to me that we will succeed in capping the inflation rate in this cycle and preserving the gains that have been made on the inflation front in the 1991 recession and the ensuing recovery "
2540,1995-08-22," I support your proposal, too "
2602,1995-09-26," Let me begin by saying that there is a great deal about this bill that I can endorse I think the focus on price stability as the single appropriate long-term goal of the FOMC is correct I endorse the repeal of the Humphrey-Hawkins Act I think those numerical target reporting requirements are unrealistic and counterproductive I like the idea that we should be asked to define price stability and report to Congress on how we intend to achieve it I like the bill's recognition of the fact that the attainment of price stability is not costless in terms of transitional losses in output and employment, and I like the fact that it explicitly directs us to take these losses into account in the transition period So, I think this bill moves us in a good direction  Having said those positive things, I do have two qualms about this bill The first is that it does not positively endorse stabilization policy as an objective Its tone is quite negative and by inference it suggests that if we have just one tool of policy we cannot focus on more than one goal I have said previously that I think that stabilization of economic activity is an important goal in its own right, and I think it will remain so even after price stability is attained I recognize that one could make the argument that the actions that are appropriate to stabilize output and employment are going to coincide with what one needs to do to stabilize the price level, namely, to lean against the wind The problem is that the world is more complex than that, and these two objectives will not always go hand in hand There are apt to be tradeoffs between the variability of output around its trend and the variability of inflation around a level of zero That does not mean that I reject in any way the natural rate hypothesis So, I think our policy ought to be directed to the pursuit of two goals, not one; and as I previously argued, something along the lines of the Taylor rule provides a formal way of thinking about how we could use policy to pursue multiple goals without in any way sacrificing the goal of long- run price stability On the other hand, I do agree with the point that multiple goals have created uncertainty in the minds of the public and Congress about the aims of monetary policy, and I agree  -41-    -42-  with Alan Blinder that we need a systematic way of clarifying what we are doing  The second concern I have is that not only does this bill not positively affirm a stabilization objective, it actually repeals a key portion of the Employment Act of 1946 It goes much further than the repeal of the Humphrey-Hawkins Act It repeals that part of the Employment Act that was a declaration of the responsibility of the government I won't quote the whole thing, but it says in part that the government should ""use all practical means for the purpose of creating and maintaining conditions which promote useful employment opportunities for those able, willing, and seeking to work"" There are two questions The first is whether the Employment Act of 1946 has implications for the Federal Reserve One might say that this Act is just a declaration of government policy and that it has no specific meaning for us whatsoever A little bit of legal research that we did suggests that that is not the case We uncovered a 1971 memo from the Board's General Counsel, Mr Hackley, who wrote, ""The declaration of Congressional policy set forth in Section 2 of the Employment Act unquestionably applies to all agencies of the federal government including the Board, since the Board as well as the Federal Open Market Committee is part of the federal government"" This fact has been expressly recognized by three Federal Reserve Board chairmen-- Chairman McCabe, Chairman Martin, and Chairman Burns What Mr Hackley concluded was that this broad mandate certainly did govern the general policies of the Board, although we did not have the specific obligation to pursue the particular goals set out in the Economic Report to the President So, I think it does have implications for the Board, and even if the Employment Act of 1946 had no implications for the Federal Reserve at all, I would oppose repeal of this feature of the Employment Act because it has implications for the federal government more broadly "
2603,1995-09-26," We don't know the facts   1981   Mr Chairman, my opinion about the national economy has changed very little since our last meeting Although the inventory adjustment may not be entirely behind us, the various sectoral reports on spending seem consistent with continued growth over the next year or so at a pace close to trend I interpret recent inflation reports as confirming that prices remain well contained At this stage I think the biggest single risk to the outlook comes from the fiscal situation Although the odds of a train wreck remain low, a default on the government debt could touch off financial repercussions that would greatly upset Greenbook types of projections But, of course, on that score we will just have to wait and see what happens  The longer-term problem that confronts us at this stage, though, is gauging whether the federal funds rate remains above the level that is needed to achieve trend growth further out in the forecast period, and I mean in late 1996 and 1997 and beyond That seems a long way off, but the Greenbook simulations reveal what we already know, namely, that the lags in monetary policy are sufficiently long that any policy changes that we might undertake over the next months would have their maximum effect in 1997 While it is  -26-    9/26/95  looking into the distant future, I don't think it's entirely premature to be thinking that far ahead What I think the Greenbook projections suggest is that the real funds rate is a little too high to support trend growth with the assumed degree of budget contraction, and it may turn out that the budget contraction will be greater; we will see  In this sense I think we have what Charles Schultz dubbed a ""termites in the basement"" problem, although he was using that phrase to talk about the federal deficits of years ago A ""termites in the basement"" problem is a nagging, chronic little problem that can eventually cause a lot of grief if it is not attended to Termites nibble away slowly so the problem just creeps up and there is no great sense of urgency that one absolutely has to deal with it on one day as opposed to the next That is how I perceive the Greenbook outlook I think there appears to be a problem there It starts as a small problem, but unless it is attended to it will grow into a more significant problem Simulations that we have done with the MPS model reveal that after 1997--I know that is a long way out--the problem really begins to snowball into a crisis The MPS simulation suggests that if the budget is balanced by 2002, the real funds rate would need to decline from roughly its present level of about 2-3/4 percent to about 1-1/4 percent If the funds rate stays where it is, the economy is not likely to remain on an even keel I would also note that the Greenbook and the MPS model are not alone in reaching this conclusion Many outside forecasters are predicting an eventual decline in the funds rate That also seems to be the conclusion of participants in financial markets since longer-term yields apparently embody an assumption of declining short-term rates I think that adjustments in long-term market rates could easily suffice to keep the economy on course, but they are predicated on at least an eventual adjustment in the federal funds rate Again, as the Greenbook suggests, I think the outlook for the near term, next year and even the next two years, looks good I don't view this as a crisis, but I do believe there is a ""termites in the basement"" problem "
2604,1995-09-26," I support your proposal for ""B"" symmetric, although I do find myself very much in sympathy with President Forrestal's analysis I think he has made a case for moving today, but on balance it seems to me that the timing isn't urgent, and I am quite content to wait "
2658,1995-11-15," I will just conclude the roundtable by echoing my agreement with a number of the points that already have surfaced in this discussion Certainly, from my perspective the incoming data flow since our last meeting has contained surprises and the surprises do necessitate some rethinking of the underlying momentum in aggregate demand and also the inflation risk The staff's view is that the news points to significantly greater underlying strength in aggregate demand and a modest reduction in inflation risk I certainly agree with both of those assessments in a qualitative sense, but like Governor Blinder and a number of other members I guess I question whether or not the new forecast does represent something of an overreaction to one month of really rather perplexing economic news In the September Greenbook, the staff forecast an unemployment rate of 62 percent in the fourth quarter of 1997 accompanied by a real federal funds rate of 28 percent The current forecast envisions an unemployment rate of 57 percent in the fourth quarter of 1997, namely 1/2 point lower or as Governor Blinder put it 1-1/4 points higher on real GDP, along with an unchanged federal funds rate of about 28 percent in real terms The staff, I would guess, has concluded that the recent news has not just a transitory effect--it's not just a statistical aberration as Ed Boehne put it--but has permanent significance  A look at a method that I thought was useful for summarizing how much the staff's forecast has changed would be to measure this in terms of the equilibrium real federal funds rate One can infer from the alternative simulations presented in the Greenbook that the equilibrium real federal funds rate, which I am now defining as the real federal funds rate in 1997 that would be consistent with a given fixed unemployment rate, has been revised upward by about 130 basis points since our last meeting In other words, the IS curve has shifted up by about 130 basis points over the last month according to the staff I think the staff procedure for generating the current forecast is easily defended on statistical grounds because surprises in demand do appear to have persistence Nevertheless, I hesitate to accept the conclusion at this point that one month's confusing data should occasion such a large revision in our assessment of the economic outlook, especially when there is a variety of indicators pointing to greater softness in the economy These would include--and all of these have been mentioned--anecdotal reports from industry contacts, yesterday's weak retail sales reading, sluggish auto demand, evidence of rising consumer debt problems that Governors Lindsey and Kelley have emphasized, today's IP number, softness in the purchasing managers' survey, a rising moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance, and signs of softer growth in European economies All this is coupled with impressive commitments to fiscal consolidation And finally, of course, we have the current train wreck, which could impair household finances and spirits going into the Christmas season Rather than quibble with the details of the staff's point forecast, I would prefer to reserve judgment for a while and await further clarification from incoming data, assuming that the government shutdown doesn't actually end up eliminating the continuing data flow  On the inflation front the news since our last meeting, it seems to me, has been on balance favorable I was particularly impressed by the reading on the core PPI which has remained unchanged and the fact that intermediate goods inflation has registered its  -41-    11/15/95  second monthly negative But most important, as a number of you have emphasized, is that total hourly compensation grew at a mere 23 percent in the third quarter, and I guess it is that continuing restraint in the employment cost index that justifies the downward revision of the NAIRU and the improvement in the inflation forecast I think the revisions in the staff's natural rate assumption and in aggregate demand reflect a response to data surprises that we don't fully understand But in this instance I would emphasize that the reaction is based on a lot more than a single month's data I certainly would agree with Bill McDonough's assessment of the evidence here We now have had about six quarters in which the rate of growth in nonfarm compensation, as measured by the ECI, has been falling in spite of continued low measured levels of labor market slack It does seem from my standpoint, and I assume from the staff's and Bill's as well, that most of the models we monitor have been consistently surprised The surprise has persisted; it is substantial Our models are overforecasting, if I understand the evidence properly, on the order of 7 percent in the annual growth rate per quarter, and cumulatively this certainly is a statistically significant surprise Of course, I also agree that we need to be careful here and not overreact to the information I think the staff has been cautious They have not yet concluded that we are witnessing a permanent structural shift I agree this may end up being a transitory supply shock I do remain perplexed that the moderation in compensation and unit labor costs has not yet translated into a reduction in core inflation I would also agree that price-price Phillips curve predictions, while slightly off the mark, remain essentially on track  At our last meeting I argued that the economy suffers from what I called a ""termites in the basement"" problem It is a bias toward below trend growth the further out one goes in the forecast It stems from insufficient momentum in private spending to compensate for growing fiscal drag and the real federal funds rate remaining at its current level As I try to move away from the data and simply focus on economic fundamentals, I find it difficult to understand what components of demand can be expected to replace lost government spending on a persisting basis over the longer term unless there is continuing impetus from interest and exchange rates I think that financial markets share this view Indeed, the Greenbook acknowledges that the present level of real long-term interest rates is conditioned on both the expectation that there will be deficit reduction and the expectation that short-term rates eventually will fall gradually I think the expectation of a cut in the funds rate in the not too distant future, as Peter Fisher emphasized, is built into the current structure of fed funds futures so that a failure to validate that expectation is most likely to lead to a backup in long rates While the current Greenbook forecast calls the markets' views as well as my own into question and indeed the Greenbook may turn out to be right--I have an open mind on this--from my perspective the level of uncertainty has increased I would like to wait and see what the Christmas season and the budget negotiations hold in store, but I consider the preponderance of risks at this point to be on the down side of the Greenbook scenario "
2659,1995-11-15," For the late 1960s and early 1970s I think that's right   I would associate myself with the analysis presented by Presidents Forrestal and McDonough and Governor Blinder, although, Mr Chairman, at the end of the day I support your policy suggestion for ""no change"" at today's meeting I continue to think, for reasons I have given before, that the real funds rate remains on the high side, especially from the longer-term perspective of supporting growth toward the end of the forecast period I certainly would admit that the staff analysis this time around has created some doubts in my mind and I would value having additional information to resolve some of those doubts At the end of the day, therefore, I can certainly support your suggestion of ""B"" On the symmetry issue, because I see the risk as being on the down side from that longer-term perspective, I would prefer an asymmetric directive although I do not think that we will need to move during the intermeeting period in the absence of a significant shock So, symmetry could certainly be an acceptable outcome I am worried about becoming frozen by the budget negotiations and also appearing at the end of the day to be ratifying some Congressional actions I think that concern does tend to support Governor Lindsey's suggestion of a move today However, in the end there are enough uncertainties in my mind about the forecast that on those grounds I would not favor a move today "
2709,1995-12-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman Although we have obtained a significant slug of new data on the economy since our last meeting, my view concerning the outlook has changed very little I continue to think that the inflation outlook is favorable, that growth is likely to proceed at a moderate pace over the next year, and that under current monetary policy, there will be a bias toward below-trend growth over the longer term With respect to inflation, I have been particularly impressed by the decline in inflationary expectations, which Bob Parry mentioned Both long- and short-term inflationary expectations have fallen about 1/2 percentage point since the second quarter of 1995 Direct measures of inflationary expectations  -23-    12/19/95  suggest, I think, a dwindling fear of an inflation breakout on the part of both households and forecasters, and that is a change in perception that is well warranted We should remember that such expectations do have at least some direct impact on workers' demands for wage increases and the willingness of firms to grant them at any given level of labor market slack So, reduced inflationary expectations make a direct contribution to an improved inflation outlook As Bob also mentioned, the decline in inflationary expectations means that real interest rates, both long- and short- term, have not declined as much as nominal interest rates Now, I have no quarrel with the short-term outlook in the Greenbook, although I do think the jury remains out on whether or not inventory adjustment is going to proceed along the very benign path that is projected in the Greenbook But really my most important concern has to do with the longer-term outlook, not for 1996 but into 1997 and beyond I think that should be the focus of our deliberations since that is when the monetary policy changes we undertake now will really take hold, given the long lags in policy My reasoning here is similar to that offered by Larry Meyer in his latest forecast According to his characterization, the outlook is for what he calls a soft landing with bias After a period of near-trend growth in 1996, he foresees a bias toward below-trend growth thereafter with rising unemployment, assuming that the real federal funds rate is kept at its current level Similarly, our own MPS model contains such a bias toward below-trend growth under the Greenbook fed funds assumption, although it does project an even stronger 1996 than the Greenbook due to the lagged but temporary influence of wealth effects from the stock market  I thought I might enumerate some of my reasons for expecting this bias toward below-trend growth, and I will just quickly mention seven factors that are operative in my view The first is that lower long-term rates have been boosting residential construction with a lag, and I would expect, as does the Greenbook, that that effect ultimately will peter out Second, we are finally seeing a cessation of the at least year-long trend toward easier credit terms, and that means that one source of stimulus that has been working as an offset to monetary policy over the last year will stop imparting further impetus to aggregate demand Now, we can dispute whether and how much stock prices matter to consumption, but if higher stock prices are contributing and will continue to contribute in 1996 to strong consumption growth, eventually this influence is going to subside I think it will be gone by the end of 1996 even assuming there is no major market correction Fourth, pent-up demand for consumer durables is presumably spent, and it seems to me that rising delinquencies on consumer debt coupled with higher debt service ratios suggest at a minimum less robust consumption growth going forward Fifth, the growth in business fixed investment seems likely to wane through accelerator effects Sixth, the lagged effects of the depreciation of the dollar, which should stimulate exports in 1996, will be petering out in 1997 and thereafter under the Greenbook assumption of a stable dollar Finally, seventh, I would mention that fiscal drag will, of course, be at work throughout and beyond the forecast horizon  So, it becomes hard for me to see exactly what is going to keep the economy growing at trend over the longer haul In addition, if consumption spending, in contrast to the Greenbook assumption, is currently being buoyed by the strong performance of the stock market,  -24-    12/19/95  then any significant stock market correction imparts some downside risk to the forecast There is consistent empirical evidence in favor of the MPS model assumption of a marginal propensity to consume of 4 or 5 percent out of added wealth If we take that seriously-- obviously we can dispute that--it makes quite a difference In particular, a 10 percent correction of the stock market would add a half percentage point to the unemployment rate after 6 to 8 quarters So, clearly, the view that policy is restrictive at this stage involves a difficult and tricky judgment call I think type I and type II errors are both possible The Greenbook does offer a very coherent defense of the opposing view, and I think Mike defended that view vigorously Fortunately for us, monetary policy is a flexible instrument; it can be adjusted in either direction so that any mistakes we might make are reversible "
2710,1995-12-19," Mr Chairman, I support your proposal I think we have good reasons to feel pleased with the performance of the economy over the last 18 months Our job now, as I perceive it, is simply to enable these favorable trends to continue For the reasons that I have already enumerated, I think the current level of the real funds rate is on the high side It is arguably higher now than it was last February--as you mentioned, Mr Chairman--given the decline in inflationary expectations I think this poses a danger to the outlook, not in the short run, not over 1996, but over the longer term even though I recognize that that is a difficult call about which reasonable people can disagree Nevertheless, having made that call I think that monetary policy should be forward-looking when we are lowering interest rates just as we are when raising them On the fiscal policy linkage issue, it seems to me that acting today rather than waiting for a budget deal to be completed will enable us to mitigate at least to some extent the unfortunate public perception of a Fed that plays budget politics by holding out rewards and punishments related to progress on the negotiations Although having said that, I certainly agree with what Governor Lindsey said Fiscal policy matters to the economy and, of course, we cannot ignore fiscal policy linkages in deciding on our own policies "
2752,1996-03-26," Thank you, Mr Chairman The progress of the economy over the last several months has been reminiscent of ""the perils of Pauline,"" with blizzards, government shutdowns, threats of default on the national debt, strikes, and a frightening albeit brief dive in the stock market threatening the progress of our heroine Nevertheless, the single most probable outcome at this stage is that this economy will survive its treacherous adventure and ultimately attain trend growth with stable inflation I agree with the Greenbook assessment that the stage appears to be set for a rather sharp rebound in economic growth from the average pace in the fourth and first quarters Considerable progress appears to have been made in reducing inventory overhangs, so there is a reasonable prospect that inventories will become a neutral factor in the economy in the not too distant future Meanwhile, demand has held up surprisingly well in the face of a rather large inventory adjustment in the fourth quarter  Over the longer term, a projection of near-trend growth through 1997 with roughly stable inflation strikes me as a plausible scenario, although there are some risks On the negative side, I am particularly concerned at this stage about the possibility of a significant stock market correction The current level of stock prices is not impossible, but it is increasingly difficult to justify in terms of fundamentals Disappointing earnings reports could easily set off a correction I am also concerned about the likely negative, albeit lagged, impact on housing and consumer durable spending of the very substantial increases in interest rates since our last meeting I find the longer-term Greenbook projection of housing starts particularly optimistic in light of these increases On balance, with intermediate- and long-term interest rates at their current levels, I feel less certain than the staff that trend growth is possible as we go out in the forecast period But there are also some risks on the inflation front While recent readings on average hourly earnings provide reassurance that wages are not accelerating, the jump in health insurance costs evident in the fourth-quarter employment cost index creates the worrisome prospect that these benefit cost increases may be poised to rise further I don't think we should overinterpret one single report, but I do agree with the Greenbook's assessment that this is one of the risks going forward "
2753,1996-03-26," Mr Chairman, I agree with your proposal and I also agree with your assessment of the key risks  -27-    3/26/96 "
2809,1996-05-21," I agree with Governor Lindsey I think this is a discussion that we definitely need to have to clarify what we mean by price stability and what strategy we have in mind to get there I am also concerned, especially given my interest in an opportunistic strategy, that it would be awfully hard to fill in the boxes relating to what I would expect in 1998 If we extended the horizon out a little longer to, say, the year 2000, I would find it easier to fill in the boxes and participate in our discussion "
2810,1996-05-21," I would like to comment on two issues central to the national economic outlook first, the possibility that aggregate demand growth will exceed trend over the forecast period, pushing the economy well beyond potential; and, second, the prospect that core inflation will begin to drift upward even if the economy continues to operate with current margins of slack On the first issue, the Greenbook portrays an economy poised for growth near trend by the second half of 1996 In my assessment of the outlook, the risk of sustained demand growth exceeding the growth of potential is not absent Frankly, I was surprised by the strength of both consumption and investment spending in the first quarter Nevertheless, I still consider the Greenbook projection of moderate near-trend growth over the forecast horizon to be sensible and most probable With the inventory adjustment process seemingly nearing completion, at least by the end of this quarter, I find it hard to identify any fundamental factor or imbalance--other than the dangerously lofty level of stock prices--that I consider likely to spur either unsustainably rapid growth or alternatively to pose a significant risk of recession The stock market factor, it seems to me, could cut either way; it poses both kinds of risk Why do I feel that way? For the same reasons the Greenbook emphasized Pent-up demand for consumer durables seems to be spent If we can continue to rely on what is one of the most trustworthy relations in macroeconomics, namely the accelerator, it seems probable to me that the growth of investment spending will slow The combination of moderate growth in our key trading partners, coupled with a dollar that has appreciated about 4 percent just this year--the dollar's movement is working as a stabilizer, as Ted Truman emphasized--should contain impetus originating in the external sector  In addition to the appreciation of the dollar, of course, the most potent force countering any spending shock that may have occurred is the large swing in financial conditions Now, it is arguable that some portion of the roughly 80 basis point increase in long-term interest rates since late January reflects higher inflationary expectations But my own reading of survey measures of inflation expectations suggests that most of the movement represents an increase in real rates I think such an increase is perfectly consistent with the perception that demand is stronger than previously thought, that the shock to demand is not transitory, and that the Fed indeed will need to pursue tighter policies than had been anticipated earlier to keep inflation in check It seems to me that given the usual lags, this interest rate swing should begin to exercise a restraining influence by the second half of the year A rule of thumb I sometimes use is that a one basis point increase in the long rate cuts $06 billion off aggregate demand, which means that, say, a 70 basis point increase in real rates would chop $42 billion or 06 percent off GDP This is sufficient to counter a rather sizable and permanent upward IS shock So, I see the interest rate fluctuations that have occurred as serving as an important stabilizer Under present conditions, it seems to me that the rebound in long-term rates is an appropriate antidote to increased upside risk However--and here I certainly  -22-    5/21/96  agree with the comment that the Chairman interjected in response to Al Broaddus's statement--it seems to me that the 6 percent long bond yield that we had in January was premised on the assumption that we would have several further cuts in the fed funds rate I also would agree that the present level of roughly 7 percent in the long bond rate appears to be consistent with a funds rate that is expected to remain about where it is or, with some probability, to increase slightly during the remainder of the year  I also want to spend a minute, if I may, commenting on the outlook for core inflation because I think the Greenbook inflation forecast is a little too pessimistic Clearly, we have an economy operating at a level where we need to be nervous about rising inflation, even abstracting from supply side shocks We can't dismiss the possibility that compensation growth will drift upward, raising core inflation and in turn inflationary expectations This is a major risk Obviously, we need to be vigilant in scrutinizing the data for signs of rising wages and salaries We should be concerned if a pattern of faster wage and salary growth materializes, if that translates into faster compensation growth, and if in turn the faster compensation growth translates into more rapid core inflation But the sentence I just uttered contained three ""ifs""  First, we need to see a pattern of faster wage and salary growth As a number of you pointed out, we have seen one disturbingly large reading on wages and salaries in the most recent employment cost index survey But the upward movement there was mysteriously rapid for sales workers and one reading does not a trend make The second ""if"" in my sentence concerned whether an increase in wage and salary growth will translate into faster compensation growth, and that is a big ""if"" At this point, the 12-month change in total compensation growth in the ECI has remained virtually unchanged at around 3 percent for five quarters I would just remind you that standard economic theory suggests that both firms and workers going to the bargaining table ought to be concerned with and ought to be bargaining over total compensation, not wages and salaries alone Assuming that both firms and workers recognize the tradeoff they face between benefits and take-home pay, slower benefits growth should be reflected in faster wage and salary growth So, on its own, faster wage and salary growth is not cause for alarm Now, I do not want to push this hypothesis too far because, although this is a reasonable possibility, it certainly is not the only possibility I am simply urging caution and am warning against automatically assuming that the growth in these two components of compensation is unconnected and that they lead their own lives  My final ""if"" concerned the relationship between faster compensation growth and product price inflation and whether we should automatically assume that the translation there will be one-for-one The counter argument is that for the last several years product price increases have outstripped increases in unit labor costs and that has resulted in widening markups, unusually strong earnings growth, and a rise in the profit share In that sense, core inflation is on the high side now, given compensation growth and productivity trends The staff documented this situation and highlighted its implications in the January Chart Show Widening profit margins are a development that should not be expected to continue indefinitely Eventually, those margins are bound to stabilize or even to decline a bit That  -23-    5/21/96  could occur in a number of ways with a decline in the inflation rate coupled with stable compensation growth or with an increase in the pace of compensation growth and stable inflation I think the first possibility implies some downside risk to the inflation outlook, and I do not see that in the Greenbook forecast The second possibility is that compensation growth is indeed poised to rise somewhat, bringing a halt to the continuing widening of profit margins That could occur without any translation into higher core inflation These are a bunch of ""ifs"" They are all imponderables and they are open questions that will only be answered with the benefit of hindsight "
2811,1996-05-21," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for ""B,"" symmetric My preferred policy as this stage is cautious inaction I guess that's called ""watchful waiting"" As I indicated in my earlier comments, the current level of long-bond rates and the stronger dollar seem sufficient to me at this stage to contain the evident upside risk to spending This level of long rates does seem consistent in my view with the maintenance of the funds rate at its present level, at least for the time being The market certainly perceives some chance that the funds rate will need to rise this summer and next fall, and so do I because I think the risks have shifted But the market is not demanding or even expecting such a move today Market participants would be surprised, and I think it could provoke an excessive adjustment in long-term yields  -36-    5/21/96  I certainly understand the reasons for wanting to move in advance of an increase in inflation I agree with that reasoning, and I definitely do not object to the reasoning that is incorporated in the Greenbook about the inflationary process But I share some of the doubts that the Chairman has expressed so well, and also Presidents Boehne and Stern We do not understand fully what is going on in the labor market as evidenced by the errors in our earlier inflation forecasts, and I would like to wait and get a little more information If the current Greenbook forecast is accurate, we will soon see clear evidence of an increase in compensation growth and an uptick in core inflation When we see that, I think we definitely will need to respond The staff's financial indicators package now routinely depicts the recommendations of Taylor's rule This is a rule of thumb that I regularly consult as a very rough guide to reasonable policy I don't mean to say that I think one should follow this rule religiously, but according to that rule--and a number of you have made this point--policy is roughly appropriately positioned at this time It seems appropriate given current inflation and resource utilization But the chart also indicates that it will be appropriate to tighten if the Greenbook forecast materializes, and I accept that conclusion  With respect to the symmetry issue, I prefer symmetry for the reasons that have been explained by Vice Chairman McDonough and President Boehne "
2859,1996-08-20," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation I continue to consider the inflationary risks biased to the up side I believe we have agreed that regardless of whether we prefer opportunistic or deliberate strategies, we should resist any sustained uptick in inflation I support that policy I also think Don Kohn has properly warned us that if we are actually below NAIRU and fail to act, all we will end up doing is buying more output and more jobs now at the expense of less output and fewer jobs later, in effect adding to cyclical fluctuations rather than mitigating them Ordinarily, I would prefer a preemptive approach to controlling inflation rather than, as Tom Melzer put it, simply waiting to shoot until we have seen the whites of its eyes  Nevertheless, I think the current situation is unusual In spite of the apparent inflation risk, which has been present now for a considerable time, inflation has been declining, not increasing, and now demand finally appears to be moderating So, the level of uncertainty about the future course of inflation under current policy settings is extremely high And particularly because a move today would constitute a change of direction and a surprise to the public and to financial markets, I would prefer to have a slightly higher degree of confidence that a policy change is actually needed before making one In situations where forecast uncertainly is extremely high, I, at least, find it appealing to look for some guidance from the recommendations of sensible feedback rules, so I would simply reiterate what Don Kohn pointed out, which is that the funds rate judged by Taylor's Rule or other simple benchmarks is now at quite a reasonable level given current levels of unemployment and inflation On the other hand, the rule definitely calls for a policy adjustment  -44-    8/20/96  if either of two things occurs first, if the degree of labor market slack declines appreciably, presumably because demand fails to slow as we anticipate; or second, if broad inflation measures rise Under those conditions, I would certainly support a tightening of policy "
2915,1996-09-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman In reviewing the data that have accumulated since our last meeting, I find myself in rough agreement with the Greenbook's assessment The evidence clearly points to a reduction in the momentum in aggregate demand with a slackened pace of spending growth now likely in consumption, government spending, and residential investment during the current quarter With the pace of final demand now moderating, the upside risks from inventory investment are also reduced On balance, it seems likely that demand growth will revert toward trend in coming quarters, with the risks to that forecast roughly balanced  The primary problem that confronts us is that labor markets are already tight, and during the assumed transition to trend growth slack is likely to diminish even further We thus appear to be on course toward a landing that is ideal except for the fact that we are now poised to hover above the runway without actually touching down [Laughter] Even if we agree with the Greenbook's argument that the  -20-    9/24/96  decline in the unemployment rate to 51 percent in August should not be interpreted literally, it does seem evident to me that the labor market has notched tighter In this respect the unemployment data seem consistent with the anecdotal evidence It is not uncommon to hear that it is now ""impossible"" to find qualified entry-level workers, whereas six months ago the word ""difficult"" would have been used more frequently At a recent Dallas board meeting that I attended, one director described the pressures that an inability to hire entry-level workers was placing on supervisors who were forced to work overtime He explained that quit rates were rising among his supervisors as a consequence I think this is precisely the type of anecdote that one would expect to hear at the onset of an inflationary episode If widespread pressures of this type emerge, it seems likely that firms eventually will be forced to bid up wages to retain workers and then pass through higher unit labor costs to prices At the same time, though, the current episode has some unique features  While the labor market is tight, job insecurity also seems alive and well Real wage aspirations appear modest, and the bargaining power of workers is surprisingly low Although there is upward pressure on entry-level wages, more senior workers and particularly those who have earned wage premia in the past, whether it is due to the power of their unions or the generous compensation policies of their employers, seem to be struggling to defend their jobs and to avoid sacrificing the perks they currently enjoy I would also interpret the UAW negotiations as indicating that we have aging auto workers who are focused on securing their own benefits during their lifetimes but appear reconciled to accepting two-tier wage structures with less generous packages for new hires Of course, we hear reports of continued upward pressure on wages in skilled technical jobs, but that should hardly surprise us because the wage differential associated with skill and education has been widening secularly since the late 1970s, most likely due to technological shifts in the workplace favoring skilled and disfavoring less educated workers And, of course, while wage growth has accelerated, compensation growth has increased only moderately because companies have offset more rapid wage increases with greater health care cost containment We may hypothesize that that favorable trend is about to conclude, but anecdotal reports suggest that corporations remain confident of their ability to achieve further cost savings  In contrast to past expansions that have led to inflationary upticks, capacity utilization is not excessively strained Delivery lags have not increased The world economy is not in a synchronous boom Firms still insist that it is impossible to pass along price increases, and the behavior of broad inflation measures remains consistent with that perception The dramatic table in Part II of the Greenbook reveals no evidence of an intensification in inflationary pressures Nor can we find evidence that compensation pressures are eroding earnings The markup of prices over unit labor costs in the nonfinancial corporate sector, for example, has not been declining, and pressure on profit margins is a typical precursor of an inflationary outbreak Further, we have yet to see any evidence of an uptick in inflationary expectations I found it striking that when rumors surfaced that hinted at a higher chance of a Fed rate increase today, longer-term rates rose rather than fell So, we may well be at a point where inflation is poised to rise, but if we are, I think we are still at an early stage of the inflationary spiral The anomalous  -21-    9/24/96  behavior of inflation in the face of seemingly tight labor markets is, of course, leading virtually all economists to lower their estimates of NAIRU  For all the reasons that I have given, I am sympathetic to the view that the world has changed Nevertheless, let me conclude by saying that I would not want to carry such reasoning too far First, an unemployment rate of 51 percent lies near the lower end of almost anyone's estimated NAIRU range Second, whatever the NAIRU, the unemployment rate does have predictive power for changes in the inflation rate The probability of an increase in inflation is clearly higher when labor market slack is lower For that reason, I conclude that the risk of an increase in inflation has definitely risen, and I would characterize the economy as operating in an inflationary danger zone "
2916,1996-09-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman I can support your proposal to adopt an unchanged policy with an asymmetric directive and to continue to evaluate incoming data as it bears both on the degree of momentum in demand and the inflationary pressures latent in the current environment But I find myself very close to the margin and would also have been quite willing to support an upward adjustment of 25 basis points today, had you proposed that I can support your  -38-    9/24/96  proposal because, for the reasons that I outlined earlier and you explained in fascinating detail, this is an unusual episode I believe we are still at quite an early stage of an inflationary uptick, if indeed this turns out to be one I also agree that with demand moderating and current inflation stable or falling, we may end up deciding that it is unnecessary to move the funds rate upward  But having said that, I believe that a very solid case can also be made for raising the federal funds rate at least modestly, by 25 basis points, on the grounds that the unemployment rate has notched down further, the decline in labor market slack is palpable, and the odds of a rise in the inflation rate have increased, whatever the level of the NAIRU and the associated level of those odds I believe I am echoing Governor Meyer in saying that I favor a policy approach in which, absent clear contra-indications, our policy instrument would be routinely adjusted in response to changing pressures on resources and movements in actual inflation I think such a response function operationalizes the precept that the Fed should ordinarily lean against the wind A 25 basis point increase in the funds rate is a small move that entails only mild resistance to the forces that are threatening to blow the economy off course In my mind, what goes up can also come down, and we risk an error if we make the hurdle for moving our policy instrument too high I am concerned that a policy of maintaining short-term interest rates unchanged, in essence creating a flat LM curve in the face of spending or IS curve shocks, risks increasing the variability of real economic outcomes and decoupling the financial market mechanism and response that should be serving as an automatic stabilizer in the economy I see the markets as doing their part in moving longer-term rates in response to economic news But I think we can only count on those responses if our own responses are predictable and we are perceived as willing to play our part, too My concern is that a failure to shift policy just modestly in response to shifting inflationary risks could undermine the assumptions on which the markets' own stabilizing responses are based "
2966,1996-11-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman Since Thanksgiving is almost upon us, it seems appropriate to count our blessings, which are numerous Economic performance with respect to both job creation and inflation has been excellent, and developments during the intermeeting period have enhanced the prospect that these favorable trends will persist In the first place, it now seems probable that spending  -22-    11/13/96  growth will moderate quickly enough to avoid placing additional strains on the labor market Second, inflation remains well contained In fact, the data on broad measures of inflation in Part II of the Greenbook suggest that inflation performance has been better than merely well contained since, as Bob Parry mentioned, every broad measure of inflation other than the total CPI has been trending downward since 1993  With respect to inflationary pressures in the pipeline, the third-quarter ECI report failed to confirm our collective fear that labor market pressures would translate into an accelerating compensation trend I was quite pleased to see that with the passage of yet an additional quarter in which compensation ran at such a moderate pace, the staff has finally revised down their estimate of NAIRU to 56 percent I consider this a sensible response to roughly two years of evidence that the dynamics of inflation have changed a bit Additional good news from an inflation perspective is that prices of commodities and intermediate goods have turned down since our last meeting The outlook for food prices has improved, and even the outlook for energy prices is more favorable In contrast to pressures in the labor market, pressures on capacity do not seem intense at this point, and investment in plant and equipment is still rapid enough in the staff forecast to mitigate capacity pressures even further over the forecast period  Finally, there are hints that firms may be stepping up the less visible investments that they make in their workers to create through training the skills they require in their workforce but find in short supply in the labor market I would agree with Governor Rivlin's comments in this regard In particular, I was struck by a recent Business Week article that detailed myriad ways in which the Marriott hotel chain and several other large corporations are working with unskilled, disadvantaged workers to inculcate good work habits and in particular to teach English as a second language to improve basic literacy and create opportunities for eventual promotions into more responsible positions These investments are on the flip side of the hysteresis process that is believed by many observers to have raised NAIRUs in European countries; that occurred as young people unable to find jobs experienced deterioration in their skills and lost attachment to the world of work So, I would agree with the view that there are benefits as well as costs to tight labor markets  In spite of all that is going right in the American economy, I too remain concerned about the outlook My first worry relates to the Greenbook's assessment I agree with the staff that we may well be living on borrowed time and that inflation will eventually accelerate if the unemployment rate remains at its current level, as in the Greenbook forecast Although I believe there is strong evidence that NAIRU has declined below 6 percent, it seems difficult to use the data in hand at this point to defend the proposition that it is as low as 52 percent  My second worry relates to the behavior of aggregate demand Here I have no quarrel with the staff's estimate of moderation in growth to a shade above trend in 1997 and 1998, but I am concerned about the risks With drags on growth stemming from government spending, residential spending, and trade, and with reduced impetus to growth from investment spending, the behavior of consumption, as Mike  -23-    11/13/96  Prell emphasized, is critical to the outlook The Greenbook assumes that consumption will quickly rebound and then grow in line with disposable income As Mike noted, consumers have greater income and wealth and their confidence is high, so it is perfectly reasonable to assume that the third-quarter spending lull was temporary and a statistical aberration Indeed, I think one could easily justify a much stronger consumption forecast than in the Greenbook, given the enormous gains in stock market wealth and the huge increase in household net worth that we have seen in spite of the buildup in consumer debt On the other hand, I am equally concerned about the downside risk to consumption because at this stage a rebound in consumption spending is a forecast and not yet a fact During the third quarter, it seems that three things occurred simultaneously consumer spending stalled, the growth of consumer credit plummeted, and lending standards tightened I do not know just what caused what, but with household debt burdens--if one includes leasing payments as Governor Lindsey likes to do--approaching all time highs and with bankruptcies surging and consumer credit charge-offs running well above expectations, it is not very surprising that lenders would tighten standards It seems perfectly possible to me that the consequence could be weaker spending by liquidity-constrained households than the Greenbook assumes I also would agree that a significant stock market correction, which cannot be ruled out, adds downside risk  Well, where does that leave me? It leaves me thinking that it is certainly within the realm of possibilities that growth may slow enough over the forecast period to bring the economy back toward NAIRU under the Greenbook assumption concerning monetary policy "
2967,1996-11-13," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation I think that an asymmetric directive is warranted for all of the reasons enunciated in the Greenbook I believe the inflation risk definitely remains asymmetric I also share Governor Lindsey's and President Minehan's concern about euphoria in asset markets On balance, though, it seems to me that the incremental data since our last meeting point toward more moderate growth than last time as well as a better inflation performance I would consider it perfectly possible for demand to end up moderating more than the Greenbook assumes, eliminating the excess pressure in the labor market and any need for additional monetary tightening So, for now I am certainly comfortable with more watchful waiting "
3021,1996-12-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will try to be brief this morning because my view is little changed from last time The limited new data that are available since our last meeting support the staff's prediction that the lull in consumer spending over the summer was likely a temporary aberration and not the onset of any period of significant retrenchment due to tightening consumer credit or escalating debt burdens Indeed, I have been fighting the crowds and searching in frustration for parking spots at local malls in recent days only, I assure you, to provide some firsthand independent research concerning the strength of Christmas spending [Laughter] Frankly, my concern with the possibility that consumer spending may be too robust rather than too weak has increased At a minimum, the risks with respect to consumption now seem to me to be quite balanced However, moderation in government spending and residential investment combined with the significant drag from net exports--and that drag has been revised upward in the latest Greenbook due to the stronger dollar as Ted Truman mentioned--those sources of drag, I think, should offset above-trend growth in consumption and investment spending over the forecast period If we add to that the fact that inventories are seemingly at reasonable levels in relation to sales, the Greenbook forecast of overall growth in demand seems perfectly plausible with the risks looking quite balanced, as Governor Meyer stated a minute ago Meanwhile, the news on the inflation front does suggest continued moderation in core inflation, with relief on the horizon most likely with respect to energy prices  To my mind, labor markets are undeniably tight You remarked last time, Mr Chairman, that we should be careful not to lull ourselves into a false sense of security about incipient wage pressures by reading too much into that suspiciously low third-quarter ECI, and I agree with that So, I still feel that we need to avoid complacency about the potential for inflationary pressures to emerge from the labor market down the road But while I think we cannot rule out the possibility that this long expansion is about to end with a period of stagflation and that that is a significant risk over the term of this forecast, that outcome is by no means a certainty Capacity utilization, as a number of you have mentioned, is not strained at this point Incoming data do suggest that earnings and profitability remain strong, so I do not see any squeeze on corporate profits at this stage In fact, this stunning combination of strong corporate profits, a healthy but sustainable pace of real growth, low and maybe even declining inflation, and lower real interest rates due to enhanced prospects of a balanced budget is a mix that may indeed continue to support a level of stock prices that the Greenbook--I liked the staff's term for this--called aggressive I thought, if anything, that that was an accurate statement and, given the careful analysis done here at the Board, that it was perhaps an understatement Like Governor Lindsey and some of the rest of you, I consider the stock market a significant continuing risk to the outlook So, I do worry that this confluence of favorable events has fostered what you describe, Mr Chairman--I think appropriately--as irrational exuberance in asset markets I think your recent remarks alluding to the potential for large asset price movements that are likely to have adverse impacts on economic activity was extraordinarily useful in prompting at least some introspection and some second thoughts by market participants about the rationality underlying the current evaluation of equity prices Maybe your speech also served to heighten just a little the appreciation by the market  -31-    12/17/96  that there do remain real risks around what is admittedly a very rosy forecast "
3022,1996-12-17," I forgot that   I support your recommendation I see policy as appropriately positioned now and agree with President Parry that that becomes apparent from the observation of rules or from the Greenbook forecast But to my mind the risks are asymmetric I appreciate the clarification of the meaning of that term, and with that clarification I certainly am happy to support continued asymmetry today "
5354,2004-08-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Twelfth District economy has expanded at   a solid pace in recent months  After a pause in June and early July, District consumers appear to   have opened their wallets again—spending more on entertainment, travel, and a range of services    Even with higher fuel prices, District tourist destinations are well booked, and industry contacts say   that they are having a good summer  Housing markets remain vibrant, but higher materials costs   and anticipated interest rate increases have begun to temper the pace of new building    On the business side, firms remain focused on containing costs and improving efficiency    Contacts note that almost no decision gets made without asking how it will affect productivity over   the next five years or so  After the long decline in the District’s IT sector, signs of improvement are   August 10, 2004 40 of 103          emerging  Production capacity is up, employees are working more hours, and firms have begun to   add jobs  In some areas, demand for employees with technical training or experience has risen so   sharply that it is outstripping supply, and businesses are responding by poaching from other firms,   producing sizable wage payments in these IT-focused areas  So far, however, rapid productivity   growth has held unit labor costs in check  Improved labor markets and rising wages have begun to   attract job seekers and, after falling for several years, labor force participation has picked up   somewhat in many District states and the fraction of the unemployed that were either new or   returning entrants has increased    Turning to the national outlook, disappointing data for June and the July employment report   have caused us to revise down our real GDP forecast and have elevated our concern about downside   risks to the outlook  Recent weakness in personal consumption expenditures is particularly   worrisome  Growth in consumer spending was probably affected by weather, a temporary dip in   auto sales that was reversed in July, and of course, higher energy prices  But as David mentioned,   standard model estimates suggest that the quantitative impact of the oil price hikes we have seen this   year should have depressed PCE by only a few tenths of a percent  So, in my view we should   therefore consider the possibility, as David did, that other factors may also be at work  For   example, the level of mortgage refinancings in recent months has plummeted, and conceivably—I   have no evidence to this effect, but conceivably—equity withdrawals for cash-out refinancings had   provided a greater boost to spending than was commonly recognized   In addition, the saving rate is at a very low level  Consumers kept up their spending   throughout the recession and recovery despite only modest income growth  With interest rates   rising and equity prices declining notably since our last meeting, households might try to get their   finances in order and bring the saving rate up to more normal levels  An alternative scenario in the   August 10, 2004 41 of 103          Greenbook suggests that an increase in the saving rate to 1 percentage point higher than the baseline   would lower real GDP growth about a percentage point, to a sluggish 2½ percent in 2005—and it   would be even less given the revised staff forecast  With consumer confidence strong and   disposable income likely growing at a solid rate, even with weak job growth in July, I agree that the   odds are good that the economy will soon rebound from the late spring and early summer doldrums    I don’t think we should overreact to a brief lull, but the downside risk to the Committee’s forecast of   sustainable growth has clearly risen, in my opinion     Turning to inflation, I’ve been encouraged by data from May and June showing a   moderation of core consumer inflation  Recent ECI readings also reveal that wage and salary   growth remains very well contained, although overall compensation growth has been elevated by   large increases in health and pension benefits  On balance, these developments support the view   that the recent run-up in inflation mainly reflects temporary factors  I continue to see large risks to   the inflation outlook on both the upside and downside  Of course, we have been, as you have,   continually surprised by increases in oil prices over the past year or so; and the possibility that this   pattern will continue represents an upside risk for inflation at the same time that it represents a   downside risk to demand  But a downside risk for inflation is the exceptionally high markup of   goods prices over unit labor costs  And if the adjustment to a more normal markup is shared in a   typical way by goods prices and labor compensation, this could depress inflation by a noticeable   amount   Looking forward to our policy discussion, the recent moderation in core consumer inflation   coupled with doubts about the robustness of the expansion suggests to me that we should tighten the   stance of policy at this meeting in line with market expectations of a 25 basis point increase in the   federal funds rate  Going forward, my hope is that we will follow a wait-and-see approach,   August 10, 2004 42 of 103          adjusting the pace at which policy accommodation is removed to the ebb and flow of data   concerning both labor markets and inflation developments  In view of the recent weakness in the   economic data and the downgrading of the forecast, I would favor modifying the final sentence in   our statement to indicate that we intend to fulfill our obligations to promote both price stability and   sustainable growth  "
5355,2004-08-10,"  Mr Chairman, I agree with the proposal to raise the funds rate 25 basis   points today and the idea that the default going forward should be to continue doing this on a regular   August 10, 2004 86 of 103          schedule  But I agree with Governors Kohn and Ferguson that our decisions should be data-  dependent  I am concerned about the downside risk and think that we might need to pause   I prefer to include sustainable growth along with price stability in the final sentence  First of   all, I believe very strongly that we have a dual mandate, and that language reflects it  But beyond   that we have the sentence in line 3 that says, “The economy nevertheless appears poised to resume a   stronger pace of expansion going forward,” which is a rather confident statement that we feel we’ll   be able to continue on the path of raising rates  And I think the reference to sustainable growth   simply acknowledges that there is a slight downside risk to that forecast   I understand the desire also to shift back to more formulaic language concerning risks and   away from the kind of explicit statement we’ve had about future policy, though I personally think   the latter approach has worked quite well  I was struck, however, by the difficulties of describing   the risks as I read the language in alternative C  I dislike the language in alternative C intensely; I   won’t go into the reasons right now  But as Governor Gramlich mentioned last time, the Committee   has thought about this issue quite thoroughly and has studied the options, and there are many   problems with the kind of dual risk assessment that is shown in alternative C  I can’t see going back   to that kind of language easily without a thorough discussion of the problems involved  "
5408,2004-09-21,"  I have a question for David  I think one way of summarizing the   Greenbook forecast is to say that the equilibrium real federal funds rate that is implicit in that   forecast is very low  As I read it, it’s on the order of 1 percent, which I interpret as very   depressed relative to the equilibrium real funds rate that would be implicit in the FRB/US model,   for example  I would find it helpful if you could pinpoint what the source of this divergence is    By that I mean which components of spending or aggregate demand do you see as particularly   depressed relative to what the FRB/US model would predict?  Where are the model’s residuals   large?  A related question, in light of the comment that you just made, involves the gap between   the Greenbook forecast and the FRB/US model forecast of the exchange rate  Simply running   the model, given what has happened to net exports, I suspect that one would predict a substantial   September 21, 2004 24 of 100          decline in the real exchange rate  The Greenbook is projecting a much flatter path of the real   exchange rate  Is it because net exports are the big source of the divergence that you have the   very low equilibrium funds rate?      And is that what the FRB/US model would predict?      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our last meeting, economic activity in   the Twelfth District has continued to expand at a solid pace but more slowly than earlier in the   year  In most of the District, housing markets remain vigorous, but there have been scattered   signs of cooling in some areas  High volumes of international trade have kept many seaports   operating at capacity and have overburdened parts of the warehousing and distribution chain  So   far, however, bottlenecks have been relatively minor  District job gains remain modest and well   off the pace of earlier in the year  Looking forward, our contacts report that they expect to   increase hiring in coming months to meet sales and output levels  Many comment, however, on   the difficulty of finding workers with the requisite skills and experience  Relatively unskilled   labor, in contrast, is perceived to be readily available   September 21, 2004 54 of 100          Turning to the national economy, recent data suggest that the sharp slowing in activity in   June was short-lived  The bounceback in consumer spending, including auto sales, is   encouraging, and the drop in oil prices from recent highs should also help  While all of this is   good news, we still haven’t seen real strength in job growth, and it’s not yet clear whether output   growth will return to the robust rates of last year or something much closer to the growth rate of   potential  These are key issues because of the slack remaining in labor and product markets  In   this regard, the Greenbook presents a rather sober view of the economic outlook, despite its   assumption of persistently low real interest rates    I’m in sympathy with the Greenbook’s view  First, while the oil shock almost certainly   had something to do with the recent weakness in the economy, I have yet to be convinced that its   effects were particularly large  Therefore, we might not get a big boost to activity from its   dissipation  Second, it seems likely that partial expensing is providing noticeable stimulus to   equipment investment this year, which means that the underlying impetus in the recovery is not   as strong as many think  Finally, I remain concerned about the potential for weakness in   consumer spending, which could restrain growth even more than the Greenbook envisions  In   spite of only modest income growth, consumer spending provided critical support for aggregate   demand during the recession and afterward, and the saving rate remains at an extremely low   level  With interest rates rising, households may seek to get their finances in order and bring the   saving rate up to more normal levels  An alternative simulation in the Greenbook illustrates that   this could be a potent factor in restraining growth over the next couple of years  In addition,   mortgage refinancings have remained low, and the associated loss of cash flow to households   could undermine spending for a time   September 21, 2004 55 of 100          Turning to inflation, the data for July and August have been very favorable, especially   following the May and June data, which also showed modest increases in core consumer prices    This development strongly suggests that the run-up in inflation last winter reflected temporary   factors   Overall, it’s a bit of a mystery why this expansion has not been marked by faster average   growth together with a larger reduction in the amount of slack, given persistently easy financial   conditions, including the low levels of real interest rates, as well as the decline in the dollar and   the increase in equity prices over the past year or so  But, of course, continuing caution in the   wake of September 11, the wars in the Middle East, and the corporate governance scandals are   reasonable candidates for an explanation  The continuation of this pattern suggests that the   equilibrium real federal funds rate remains quite depressed relative to its historical average, so   monetary policy must remain accommodative for the foreseeable future  A pause in the process   of raising the funds rate is, thus, likely to become appropriate in the near future, especially if   inflation remains well behaved as expected  At the present time, however, the real funds rate is   so low that a modest tightening at this meeting seems justified  "
5409,2004-09-21,"  I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
5461,2004-11-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic situation in the District has   changed little since our last meeting  Activity continues to expand solidly but not exuberantly,   closely mirroring the nation  Housing markets, with only a few exceptions, remain robust    Consumer spending is solid in both the retail and travel sectors  Our ports are extremely busy and   in some cases are even overburdened because of heightened activity on both the import and the   export sides  One area where there may be softening is manufacturing, as some of our contacts   report slower demand growth than earlier in the year  Finally, job gains remain modest in the   District, and unemployment has inched down only slightly  As a result, labor supply remains   ample, and we hear little about worker shortages or accelerating wages   Turning to the national economy, recent data on economic activity have flashed both   positive and negative signals, but on balance they suggest that growth is sustainable though   trendlike—not nearly as robust as the strength we saw last year  In spite of the small uptick in the   unemployment rate, October’s stunning job growth raises the odds that labor market slack will   decline over time  The October employment report is also reassuring because strong job growth   mitigates the downside risk to consumer spending from muted growth in personal income   The Greenbook forecast, even as revised on Friday, was sobering  It shows only a meager   acceleration in activity next year to a rate that is only modestly above potential, despite continued   monetary stimulus and a shallow upward path to the funds rate—shallower than markets now   expect  This forecast seems plausible to me for several reasons  First, of course, oil prices are   surprisingly and persistently high  Second, fiscal stimulus will turn weaker next year  Third,   there’s a good prospect that the private saving rate will rise from its current low level once housing-  price appreciation moderates and the growth in wealth that consumers experience as a consequence   starts to taper off  Fourth, it seems likely that the trade gap will continue to drag down growth,   even though the dollar has fallen somewhat since we last met  And, finally, we do not see business   November 10, 2004 35 of 107    investment in equipment and software rebounding at a sufficiently buoyant pace to propel truly   robust, above-trend growth     The high-tech sector poses risks to the forecast  As David noted, the Greenbook forecast for   IT investment has been revised down rather significantly in the last two rounds in response to   disappointing data that showed real growth of only 4¼ percent in the third quarter  Still, I consider   this forecast quite strong  It anticipates that the share of IT investment out of total equipment   investment will rise almost to the level reached at the end of 2000  I think it’s important to recall   that the 2000 peak was bolstered by several special factors, in particular the capital spending binge   by telecom service providers and the buildup to Y2K  In addition, it was propelled by a very rapid   pace of diffusion of personal computers and networks, a pace which may prove difficult to maintain   much longer  As Governor Ferguson noted in a recent speech and in his remarks to the Committee   last time, the more moderate pace of decline in quality-adjusted computer prices over the last year   may signal a decline in the pace of technological change in this sector  Furthermore, there is some   industry opinion that the pace of the development of software is beginning to slow   On the inflation front, the most recent data have been favorable  Despite the blip in core   CPI inflation in September, it appears that core inflation and longer-term inflation expectations are   well contained  The Greenbook forecast for the next year of 1½ percent in core PCE inflation and   just under 2 percent in core CPI inflation seems quite reasonable, although there are upside risks   from oil and the dollar   Overall, with inflation well contained, output growth that shows no sign of establishing real   momentum, and slack still remaining in the economy, I see no reason to presume without further   evidence that monetary policy needs to be tightened more rapidly than is assumed in the Greenbook   path  In my view, today’s move will complete the process of removing the insurance premium that   was incorporated into the federal funds rate as an emergency measure  As the Bluebook indicates,   November 10, 2004 36 of 107    the federal funds rate will have returned to a range that is consistent with the prescriptions of a   variety of Taylor-type instrument rules  Future moves in my view should, therefore, be data   dependent   If the Greenbook proves accurate, we will have many opportunities to pause in the process   of raising the funds rate over the next year or so, especially if the dollar and the price of oil do not   show significant declines  If they do decline significantly, the appropriate path for the funds rate   could steepen rather dramatically, but there is little need to anticipate changes in these variables   since we can monitor them daily and they take time to play out in the economy  For today’s   meeting, it seems entirely sensible to raise the funds rate 25 basis points  My comfort level with   this move was noticeably enhanced by recent employment gains  But I think the jury is still out on   the appropriate move in December, and I believe that we should craft a statement that leaves all   options open  "
5462,2004-11-10,"  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation to increase the funds rate   25 basis points, but I am concerned about adopting the proposed statement  When I opened the   Bluebook this time, I was actually pleased to see in alternative B what I thought was a well-crafted   statement that hinted at a possible pause in a way that was rather artful and subtle, without   foreclosing any option in the future whatsoever  And I thought the reasoning in the Bluebook in   support of “B” was strong and convincing  As Vincent stated, both before and after the   employment report, market participants expected some hint in the statement of a possible pause   After we received the employment report, there was an update to the Bluebook that   contained alternative B′ as the proposed statement  So I took B′ as a response to the employment   report, and to my mind that was an unwarranted shift  I would note that the Greenbook assessment   of the appropriate path for the funds rate had not changed as a consequence of the employment   report  But we observed a large and, if the Greenbook is right, excessive market response to the   employment report  We saw that in the immediate move in the fed funds futures  I suppose if one   interprets the employment report as a very strong signal—and perhaps this is the view that you were   expressing—that structural productivity growth is lower than we had been assuming, then this B′   statement would be an appropriate response  But it seems to me that the Greenbook has already   incorporated an expected decline in productivity growth  I suppose in the Greenbook the decline is   cyclical not structural, but it is built into the Greenbook forecast  The employment report simply   confirmed what the staff had earlier been expecting when they had been surprised by the low   employment growth  So it seems to me that adopting B′ reinforces the market expectation about the   future path of monetary policy in a way that I would not like to see it reinforced  My own   preference would be to move today but to adopt alternative B rather than B′  "
5523,2004-12-14,"  Well, just briefly, I’d say that I definitely support the publication of the   minutes on an expedited schedule, given that it is feasible  And I agree completely with Don’s   analysis of the benefits  It does seem to me that, in moving toward perfecting a rational   expectations kind of equilibrium, the minutes released in a timely fashion, when they’re still   relevant, contain enough information about the Committee’s reaction to data and how it processes   those data that it should help the market improve its understanding of the rationale for policy  And   that includes the fact that there isn’t unanimity on the Committee; there is a range of opinions about   the outlook and the risks  Just in the brief time that I’ve been back on the Committee, there have   December 14, 2004 93 of 118           been occasions when the minutes were released at a point when they were actually misleading   because the views of the Committee had changed  I’ve found that unfortunate   Let me respond to Cathy’s point  While I can understand that, if the Committee decides to   move back to more formulaic language in the statement and to omit any reference to a consensus   about future policy, some might view earlier release of the minutes as a substitute for those kinds of   statements  But I would consider that both unnecessary and unfortunate  I support Ned’s comments   about that, in that I think it’s actually quite helpful to have an explicit statement about the   Committee’s consensus view regarding future policy  So I would not like to see this become a   simultaneous decision to forgo that in favor of the earlier release of the minutes  "
5524,2004-12-14,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the District is expanding   at a moderately strong pace, closely mirroring that in the nation  Housing markets remain especially   robust, and consumer spending at stores and on travel is solid  The high volume of international   trade flowing through the District has resulted in backlogs at our ports in southern California  In   addition, there have been some reports that firms are facing difficulty in getting access to enough   trucks and railroad cars  Not surprisingly, shipping prices have risen   Turning to the national economy, I’ve been heartened by recent economic data, which for   the most part have been positive  The November employment report was disappointing, but taken   in the context of the last several months of job growth and other data, I have become more confident   that the economy has found solid footing   Looking forward, the decline in the dollar and the recent retreat in oil prices add further   support to aggregate demand  Even so, it is notable that output growth so far has only moderately   exceeded potential despite huge doses of fiscal and monetary medicine  And the Greenbook,   though more upbeat this time than last, forecasts a similar pattern for 2005, even with only a gradual   removal of monetary accommodation    Turning to inflation, the 2005 Greenbook forecast of core PCE inflation of about 1½ percent   and core CPI inflation of 2 percent strikes me as very reasonable  In support of this view, our   contacts tell us that consumer prices remain relatively stable  Indeed, our contacts see continued   competitive pressures to control costs  Such pressures were evident in labor negotiations at grocery   stores in southern California earlier this year and more recently at major hotels in the Bay area  I   see the risks to inflation from uncertainty about the future paths of the dollar and oil prices  Another   risk, which I’ve mentioned before, relates to the high markup of prices over unit labor costs  A   reversion to more-normal levels could result in a significant reduction in the rate of inflation    December 14, 2004 20 of 118           Finally, what happens to productivity growth is also important for the inflation outlook, as the   Greenbook alternative simulations demonstrate   I would like to focus the remainder of my comments on productivity and its implication for   inflation and monetary policy  As we discussed at the last meeting, the recent moderation in the   pace of price declines for high-tech goods, coupled with weakness in high-tech investment last   quarter, hints at the possibility of less-robust productivity growth going forward  If this turns out to   be the case, we would expect some upward pressure on inflation  I would like to emphasize,   however, that there is a real chance that productivity growth over the next few years will come in   higher than anticipated in the Greenbook  Over the past four years, labor productivity growth in the   nonfarm business sector has averaged nearly 4 percent—about 1½ percentage points above its pace   over 1996-2000, in spite of a sharp drop-off in capital deepening after 2000   Some people argue   that improved productivity growth since 2000 is largely temporary and will reverse over the next   few years  For example, the recent surge in productivity may reflect the fact that businesses have   been extremely cautious in adding workers  Proponents of this view expect caution to dissipate and   productivity growth to slow as firms become more confident about the outlook   But if business caution in making long-term commitments were the primary motive for   weak job growth, we would expect—but do not see—employment expanding along other margins,   such as the workweek  One reason for optimism about the underlying productivity trend is that   multifactor productivity during the second half of the 1990s was probably greater than estimates   derived from standard growth accounting  We now realize that a considerable amount of the   investment during the late 1990s had a low or even a negative rate of return, biasing up standard   estimates of the contribution to productivity growth from capital deepening   December 14, 2004 21 of 118           Moreover, all signs suggest that businesses are continuing to adapt and reorganize their   practices in order to take full advantage of the opportunities afforded by new ICT technologies, and   this process seems likely to continue playing out for some time  For example, one of our major   banks indicated that through ongoing use of technology they have been able to support growth in   customers and services with fewer staff  A further example is the continuing expansion of   Wal-Mart and other big box stores—a trend that has had a dramatic effect on productivity growth in   the retail and wholesale sectors   Finally, there is evidence suggesting that the extraordinarily high rates of investment during   the second half of the 1990s were disruptive to businesses  According to one estimate, such   adjustment costs reduced productivity growth about ½ percentage point during that period  All in   all, it’s entirely possible that productivity growth, both structural and actual, could average around   3¼ percent over the next two years, as in an alternative Greenbook simulation  This pace is about   equal to the average rate of productivity growth during the last seven years, including periods of   both high and low investment  In the Greenbook simulation that combines such a step-up in   productivity growth and a declining markup, inflation falls to ¾ percent in the second half of next   year and remains at that level  Such an outcome is troubling, given our concerns about the effects of   deflation and difficulties in conducting monetary policy in such an environment   So, in summary, I consider the 27 percent Greenbook estimate of structural productivity   growth as reasonable and the risks to inflation as balanced  But there is significant upside   productivity potential and associated downside risks to inflation  Given the costs of an unexpected   and substantial decline in inflation, these risks should be a significant concern  For today’s meeting,   it seems entirely sensible to raise the funds rate 25 basis points and to craft a statement that leaves   our options open to eventualities   December 14, 2004 22 of 118          "
5525,2004-12-14,"  I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
5575,2005-03-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Little has changed in the Twelfth District   economy since we last met  It has continued to expand in line with the nation For that reason, I’ll   focus my remaining remarks on the national economy   The data we have received since late January have been remarkably consistent in their   upbeat message  Important indicators from the output side—employment in manufacturing   production, in particular—gained strength over the past couple of months  The same can be said of   most of the major components of domestic demand  The strength in orders and shipments for core   capital goods, despite the expiration of partial expensing, was particularly significant In the   Greenbook, all of this good news appears to show up mostly in the form of higher interest rates that   offset the upward pressure on growth in the second half of this year and in 2006   Developments that bear on productivity have also been heartening  First is the recent   upward revision to fourth-quarter productivity growth as well as estimates of continuing strength for   the current quarter Second, enhanced prospects for business investment in equipment and software   bode well for productivity in the future Finally, some of the signs of slowing in IT [information   technology] investment that were worrisome last year have moderated, although there is still reason   for some caution about the outlook  IT investment bounced back in the fourth quarter, and   production of high-tech industries has been strong in recent months  Taken together, these   developments helped to assuage concerns about a pronounced slowdown in productivity growth, and   I remain optimistic that advances in this area will continue to boost output growth and restrain   inflation   Of course, there are always risks Developments in oil markets are an obvious one, and bond   rates are another concern It is striking that, until recently, long-term rates were falling a bit, even as   policy tightened and short-term rates rose  The 10-year Treasury yield even now is below its level in                          March 22, 2005 42 of 116  June when the Committee first raised the funds rate, and this has led to considerable discussion of   whether term premiums have fallen to levels that are lower than can be justified by fundamentals  If   the term premium is abnormally low now, economic growth could be significantly dampened if the   term premium suddenly returns to more normal levels  And the risks here are nicely illustrated by   an alternative simulation in the Greenbook  For this reason, the low level of long-term interest rates   constitutes a downside real risk to the staff forecast   Our staff decided to examine this issue more closely  We looked at several model-based   approaches to explaining and estimating the term premium for 10-year Treasuries  All of the   approaches predict a lower average premium since at least 2001, compared to the average for the   1990s This result appears consistent with a number of macro developments, including reduced   volatility in interest rates, output, and inflation So a portion of the paradox of why bond rates are so   low may be that the term premium has declined for reasons that are justified by fundamentals   The element of risk for the outlook arises because the approaches we examined suggest that   the term premium is even lower than is justified by fundamentals  According to our estimates, long-  term rates still remain 30 to 60 basis points below the fundamentals-consistent level, even after the   run-up in long-term yields since the last FOMC meeting  Since our previous meeting, the 10-year   bond rate has risen by just under 40 basis points Using the approach that yielded the larger term   premium conundrum, our analysis suggests that about one-third—about 12 basis points—of the   intermeeting increase is due to the correction of the low term premium  The remaining two-thirds is   split between a higher path for expected future short-term real interest rates, presumably due to   strong economic news, and higher inflation expectations  The latter concern is reflected in an   increase since late January in inflation compensation, especially over the next few years  Part of this   increase is probably due to upside surprises in recent inflation data and part of it to increasing oil                    March 22, 2005 43 of 116  prices Our analysis suggests that oil developments might have raised 10-year inflation   compensation by less than 01 percent    To sum up, our estimates suggest that the term premium has probably increased moderately,   about 12 basis points, since our last meeting  But even so, the premium may remain as much as 60   basis points below normal, according to our estimates  Our analysis thus suggests that the risks for   the term premium on bond rates are asymmetric  While the Greenbook expectation of a relatively   flat path for bond rates through the end of next year may be a reasonable modal forecast, I don’t   think the risks here are balanced And, indeed, they seem to be on the side of restraint for demand     Of course, the recent news on inflation, and, in particular, the core PCE in January, was   disappointing And with oil prices rising further, it seems reasonable to raise the core PCE inflation   forecast through 2006 by a tenth or two, to just over 1½ percent But I do not think we should   overreact to January’s adverse inflation data, especially in light of the continued containment of   wages and salaries and evidence of even greater strength in actual and structural productivity growth   than previously assumed in the staff forecast   In my view, the policy situation has changed notably since the last meeting  We now see   stronger momentum in aggregate demand, importantly due to more robust investment spending and   slightly disappointing inflation data This means, as is implicit in the Greenbook forecast, that we   now appear to be further from the real short-term neutral funds rate than previously, and monetary   policy remains quite accommodative    What I would like to see today is for us to raise the funds rate by 25 basis points and retain   both the “measured pace” language and the characterization of policy as accommodative  At   present, I believe the Greenbook path and market expectations are quite well aligned and coincide   with my own view of the appropriate path for policy, given current information  In my view the                    March 22, 2005 44 of 116  term “measured pace” remains a good description of the likely path, and I would think it wise to act   to confirm market expectations today rather than upset them  I don’t think that retaining the   “measured pace” language eliminates the Committee’s flexibility to raise the funds rate by 50 basis   points if it does prove necessary Obviously, such a move would need to be justified by the strength   of incoming data, but with those data I believe the markets would have adjusted to the idea by the   time it became appropriate to implement it    "
5576,2005-03-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation to raise the   federal funds rate 25 basis points I can also support alternative B, although I have significant   discomfort with the balance-of-risk statement in line 5  I agree with President Lacker’s comment   that it has now been made essentially meaningless and can’t stay there long   I would simply echo the opinion given by many people around this table that it is very   important that we continue to communicate our views and what we know about future policy  I like   the line 6 way of doing that Obviously, we have to change the language as circumstances change   and devise at some point an alternative to “measured,” but writing an English sentence or two to   explain where we think policy is going is, I think, the best thing to do And I think we need to do   that even when we get to the point where the expectation is that policy will remain unchanged and   we will be watching news to decide where we go from there   I’ve never been a fan of the balance-of-risk statement  I know there have been a number of   committees that have tried to look at how to revise it  I suppose it’s worth doing that again, but my   sense is—I agree with President Lacker—that it is fatally flawed  But I believe that communication   is very important and we should try to communicate in a less formulaic way  "
5623,2005-05-03," I have a question for David concerning investment  At our last meeting, I   certainly had the feeling that the outlook for the economy and for demand was a lot more robust than                                       May 3, 2005 18 of 116  I had previously thought, and the Greenbook reflected the same view  In large part that was based   on rejecting the pothole theory related to partial expensing for investment  We thought that there   would be a pothole in January It didn’t occur January data on orders were strong, and the staff   decided, I think, that there was a lot of momentum in investment spending  Certainly the   fundamentals seemed quite strong  But for February and March the data are really very weak It   seems to me that the response in the Greenbook this time is to stick with the view that the   fundamentals are strong and the investment spending outlook remains quite strong  There hasn’t   been a lot of downward revision there I wonder if you’d just talk about that a little bit  One   possibility might be that, in fact, January wasn’t a perfect test of partial expensing  Suppose that   firms could take advantage of that expensing provision if they placed an order by December 30    Maybe some orders were placed and didn’t actually show up in the December data  They might   have shown up in January I don’t know the details of how that series is constructed Another   possibility is that we may be learning from the February and March data that the outlook for   investment spending just isn’t as robust as we had thought, but it’s not because of partial expensing    In any event, it seems to me that there was not a lot of downward revision in the medium-term   forecast for investment spending  I just wondered if you would discuss your thinking    Not just ordered?    It’s a level effect    Thank you, Mr Chairman  It has been less than a year since I returned to   the policy table, but already there is a sense of déjà vu all over again [Laughter]   The recent pattern of higher inflation and softer spending seems remarkably similar to the   developments we witnessed late last spring and early summer—then, as now, after a spike in energy                                 May 3, 2005 42 of 116  prices The latest data on employment, retail sales, and durable goods orders reveal unanticipated   weakness on the real side of the economy  Readings on overall and especially core inflation have   been uncomfortably and unexpectedly high  If the current situation persists or deteriorates further,   we could face some difficult policy choices ahead, but I remain cautiously optimistic that the   slowdown in growth and the uptick in inflation will both prove transitory   I believe we can draw some lessons for assessing current conditions and for calibrating   policy going forward from last year’s experience  Last year’s jump in energy prices delivered a   significant shock to consumers and businesses  For a time, the growth of consumer spending slowed   and inflation increased But after the initial jolt, the growth of consumer spending and economic   growth overall rebounded Higher energy prices again have hit consumers hard in the pocketbook   and businesses on the bottom line, but there’s good reason to anticipate a similar recovery in   spending this year, especially with oil prices having come down of late  So the lesson from last   year’s experience is that we shouldn’t overreact to the present soft patch or short-run fluctuations in   real-side data when the fundamentals for growth appear to remain relatively sound    I, therefore, find myself in agreement with the Greenbook’s perspective  Beyond the current   quarter, the forecast has been revised only slightly, with the major components of demand projected   to continue expanding at a fairly healthy pace This forecast mirrors the perceptions of our Twelfth   District business contacts who, outside of the Bay Area and Los Angeles proper, report that they   remain quite upbeat about the economy   For inflation, last summer’s experience similarly advises a cautious policy reaction to the   data The recent uptick in core inflation probably reflects pass-through of cost pressures due to   higher energy, commodities, and import prices  If so, the upturn is apt to be transitory, since now,                                 May 3, 2005 43 of 116  just like last summer, underlying pressures on core inflation appear to remain subdued  Several of   the good fundamentals driving the outlook for inflation are worth highlighting   First, the data surveyed in Part 2 of the Greenbook suggest that at least some, and possibly   considerable, slack remains in labor markets  Corroborating this view, our contacts, even in some of   the most rapidly growing areas of the Twelfth District, report little trouble filling job openings   except in some skilled trades that are in high demand in construction  I met recently with top   executives of SBC West, a major employer in California and Nevada  They indicated no difficulties   whatever in hiring at any skill level, with only a few exceptions, such as accounting  Like most of   our contacts in the District, they also saw no significant wage pressures  Indeed, nationwide data   suggest that labor cost pressures appear quite restrained For example, as David noted, last week’s   ECI data showed no sign of any acceleration in private compensation   The underlying trend in productivity is also solid, and, as I discussed at a previous meeting, I   remain optimistic that it will remain so, in which case unit labor costs are likely to remain   constrained Our contacts report continued scope for productivity improvements  For example, the   SBC West executives with whom we met explained how new technologies permit tasks to be   performed via computers at headquarters that in the past required technicians to make service calls   Of course, “pricing power” is a phrase that is used frequently by our contacts, but the   mention of pricing power is focused exclusively on pass-through of cost increases due to energy,   materials, and transportation  In construction, agriculture, and transportation, firms report   considerable success in passing these cost increases along In other sectors, the experience has been   more mixed  One director who runs a major clothing retailer reported only limited pass-through to   consumer prices in the face of competitive pressures and continued gains in productivity  With   markups still high, firms should be able to absorb some cost increases without raising goods prices                                 May 3, 2005 44 of 116  Moreover, to the extent that these costs are being passed through to prices, they appear to provide   only one-time boosts to the price level   In terms of policy, I support a 25 basis point increase at this meeting and retaining the   “measured pace” description of the likely path for policy going forward, at least for today  Weak   real-side data might suggest a pause to evaluate the extent and likely duration of the slowdown  But   incoming inflation data could justify more aggressive action  Given the latest uncomfortably high   readings on inflation, I think we have to remain vigilant  The constancy of long-run inflation   expectations provides some reassurance, although I worry that if we had similar readings on such   expectations in the early 1970s, they would have been slow to rise then as well, as bond markets had   grown complacent about inflation   Last time, we adopted language that many of us thought made our balance-of-risk statement   tautological In fact, it turns out that the statement is not tautological, and I no longer consider it   true [Laughter] In my view, even with appropriate monetary policy action, the risk to the   attainment of sustainable growth is unbalanced to the downside, while the risk to the attainment of   price stability is unbalanced to the upside It is the risk to our dual objectives, but not to each   individual objective, that I consider balanced overall   Releasing an unchanged balance-of-risk statement might suggest to some that this   Committee has ignored the palpable shift in economic conditions toward higher inflation and slower   growth Indeed, an uncharitable description of the current statement is that it has gone from not   serving any purpose to potentially being perceived as factually incorrect Rather than try to modify   the balance-of-risk statement, I think it is perhaps time to retire it, for reasons that I will explain in   more detail in the policy go-round  "
5624,2005-05-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support, of course, your proposal to raise the   federal funds rate 25 basis points, and I think the strategy that you suggest with respect to the   language in alternative B also has merit for today  It seems to me advantageous at this point to make                                 May 3, 2005 94 of 116  minimal changes in the statement, as alternative B does  I think market expectations are essentially   entirely sensible, and it does not make sense today to do a great deal to perturb those expectations   I think the policy path we’re on, as Don put it, likely has a positive slope I’m comfortable   with the term “measured pace” because I think it continues to indicate that whether we call policy   accommodative or somewhat accommodative, the likely direction of the federal funds rate is up, and   I think we ought to be communicating that  I believe that we retain considerable flexibility to pause   or to be more aggressive  We see that, as you pointed out, Mr Chairman, in the futures path as the   market responds to the news   So, I think we do have flexibility  But I agree with Governor Ferguson that we need an exit   strategy from this exit strategy, and my proposal is to get rid of the balance-of-risk statement    Maybe today is not the right day to do it, but as part of our ultimate exit strategy, which we may well   need at the next meeting, I would love to see that go  I feel that we do need to communicate   something about the future, but in my view crafting a simple English sentence or two to describe the   consensus on the Committee is the way to do it  To me the balance-of-risk statement was an attempt   to give hints about the future path of policy without saying anything about the funds rate directly but   instead about the determinants of policy  And I just don’t think that’s possible   I read President Poole’s memo and I understand the desirability of having standard language,   but we have a Committee that hasn’t obtained a consensus on the determinants of policy We don’t   have a common definition of maximum employment or price stability  We don’t have a common   view on the importance of forecasts or an agreement on relative values of gaps versus growth rates   in making those forecasts  Without that kind of consensus, we just can’t come up with a formulaic   assessment about the balance of risks  It might work for a couple of meetings, but then we’re going   to get ourselves in a situation where it will fail, and that’s where I feel we are today                                 May 3, 2005 95 of 116  So, going forward, it may be that the time to change this language is when we do pause and   no longer feel certain what the direction of policy is Maybe at that time a simple statement that says   something like this will be the sensible way to go  “Under current conditions, policy seems well   positioned to achieve our dual goals and we will respond, as needed, to fulfill our obligations to   foster price stability and sustainable economic growth”  "
5668,2005-08-09," My comment concerned the nonmarket portion of the core PCE and its   revisions, and you’ve covered much of what I wanted to get at in your answer to the Chairman  I   don’t want to belabor the point, but I will spend just a minute on it     In looking at this very large revision in the nonmarket component, I naturally ask myself   whether or not this should change our interpretation of what inflation was in 2004  Is the                    August 9, 2005 27 of 110  character of the revision one that suggests we’ve received additional data telling us that inflation,   indeed, was higher than we thought?  Or is its character more that of a methodological   revision—that is, we have no new data but have processed it differently, and now we’re   changing the yardstick or the ruler we use to measure something?   My interpretation—and I’d like to make sure that you agree with it—is the former  I   believe it’s more of the character of having received new data that told us, with an unchanged   measurement tool, that inflation in 2004 was higher  For the hospital insurance and medical care   component, an analyst made a programming error, and that led to an underreporting of true   inflation in that component in 2004  And in the noncommercial bank, or other financial sector   component, an analyst built in an assumption—I think probably largely about mutual funds—   that the pricing of mutual fund services would be declining over time  But when BEA looked at   the data, they discovered that was a terrible assumption and that it had not occurred  So, that has   the character of new data indicating that what was built into the index was wrong  Therefore,   inflation in the nonmarket component, which I think is 18 percent of the overall core PCE, really   was higher than we thought and there’s no reason to ignore it  At least those were the major   parts of the revision    I admit that there’s something arbitrary about the methodology that is   used But the change we see is not due to a change in the methodology for assessing the truth    One could use a different methodology  The change is akin to new information that, given a   fixed methodology, tells us that inflation was really worse in 2004 than we thought    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Recent data, including the benchmark   revisions, have altered my perception of the economic scene noticeably  We now see more   underlying strength in economic activity relative to potential through the second quarter and into   July The July employment report suggests that job growth has also gained momentum, and   developments in a broad range of financial markets suggest that market participants share this   assessment  The Greenbook, sensibly, has raised its assumed path for the funds rate to bring   growth next year back to the pace of potential     The inflation picture is clouded up in both senses of the word  It is unclear and also a bit   foreboding The picture is a bit foreboding because the benchmark revision boosts inflation as   measured by the core PCE to 19 percent over the last 12 months, which is at the top of my   comfort zone It’s unclear, because our two main inflation gauges are now giving different   readings on the performance of inflation over the last year, although both, fortunately, suggest   that inflation has been relatively tame over the past several months  With a normal gap of about   ½ percentage point over the core PCE, the 21 percent increase in the core CPI, in contrast,   presents a rather benign inflation picture                   August 9, 2005 38 of 110  Of course, the issue for policy is not so much where inflation was in the past but, rather,   where it is headed Given the unusually small and likely transitory gap between the two   measures of core inflation, we tried to break through some of the cloudiness associated with this   divergence in signals by examining statistically which measure typically does most of the   adjusting to bring the spread back into line  A finding that the CPI typically does most of the   adjusting would be bad news A finding that the PCE price index normally bears the brunt of the   adjustment would be good news  Unfortunately, we found few statistical regularities  Both   measures have taken the lead at different times, so we can’t count on either one to provide a   reasonable signal at the present time   Moving from actual inflation outcomes to the pressures affecting inflation going forward,   it seems likely that higher oil prices are being passed through to core inflation to some extent    So unless they rise further, the effect on core inflation should begin to dissipate next year    Unfortunately, I think I also said the same thing at our June meeting, and they did rise again   Another risk relates to unit labor costs, which have risen notably over the past year after   several years of little or no change  This partly reflects slower, although still robust, productivity   growth Insofar as the decline in productivity growth has been cyclical rather than structural, our   analysis, and that of other researchers, suggests that it will have little effect on inflation  In other   words, it is structural productivity growth and trend unit labor costs that mainly drive inflation    It would take a drop in structural productivity growth to boost inflation   As discussed in the Greenbook, the recent benchmark revisions probably do warrant a   modest decrease in our estimates of structural productivity growth, which does add to inflation   pressures, making the outlook a bit less favorable than I originally thought  Nevertheless, it is                         August 9, 2005 39 of 110  encouraging that, even after a downward adjustment, productivity still seems to be growing   somewhat faster than the robust rates achieved in the second half of the ’90s   I’m less concerned about inflation pressures emanating from the other component of   labor costs, namely, labor compensation  Although compensation per hour jumped recently, this   appears to be due to one-time factors and thus should be discounted  This interpretation is   supported by the smaller increase reported in this morning’s release on the second quarter and   from readings from the employment cost index, which excludes these items and has shown only   modest increases   Furthermore, recent increases in labor compensation could be part of the process by   which labor’s share of GPD is returning to more normal levels, following a period of unusually   rapid growth in profits that has been pushing up capital’s share This interpretation is supported   by recent econometric work by our staff suggesting that transitory deviations of the markup from   its mean are typically unwound over time by movements in labor compensation, not inflation   Indeed, our contacts are telling us that in the absence of much pricing power, increases in   labor costs are hurting their bottom lines The increased pressure on margins appears to have   reinvigorated the search for productivity gains  For example, a natural gas drilling company in   our District just installed chips in all of its wells that alert a central control when a well is down    With this technology the firm has been able to shed workers who check the wells manually, and   it has decreased the down time of wells in the network   So for all of these reasons, I’m inclined to think that inflationary concerns about unit   labor costs should be focused more on possible changes in structural productivity growth than   long-term labor compensation                August 9, 2005 40 of 110  Another source of inflationary pressure relates to slack in the labor market  In my view, a   whisker of slack probably still remains, but on balance there is probably less than we saw in   June Of course, the unemployment rate remained at 5 percent in July, but other measures, such   as the employment-population ratio, a survey of job market perceptions, and industrial capacity   utilization now signal a bit less slack   So, overall, the economy is noticeably stronger than seemed likely in June  Some of the   slack that remained at that time has been eliminated, and the trajectory for inflation has shifted   up a bit The market’s expectations concerning the degree of Fed tightening have increased, as   have longer-term yields  I consider it obvious that we should continue on the path of raising the   funds rate, and I’m comfortable with the wording in Alternative B  "
5669,2005-08-09," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation and agree with the   rationale that you gave for it  "
5711,2005-09-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman   It goes without saying that the devastation   caused by Hurricane Katrina has elicited a deep sense of empathy in our District  In terms of the             September 20, 2005 51 of 117  economic effects, we’re paying special attention to energy and international trade  So far, at   least, the effects on the Twelfth District economy appear to have been muted   Since the end of August, retail gasoline prices are up about 30 cents per gallon on the   West Coast, less than elsewhere in the nation  There was some early concern that Gulf Port   cargo would be diverted to the West Coast, creating bottlenecks or significantly increasing   shipping costs, but these concerns have largely dissipated   Our contacts remain fairly optimistic about the prospects for the regional economy but   are very concerned about the future path of energy prices, especially since Hurricane Katrina    Even before the hurricane, they were worried that higher gasoline prices and impending   increases in home heating expenses would curb consumer demand  Indeed, PG&E, the public   utility for northern California, just announced that rising natural gas prices could drive home   heating costs in the area up by as much as 40 percent this winter  Discount retailers in the   District expect these increases to put a dent in holiday spending  In addition, higher fuel prices   already have trickled into prices for building materials, and contacts expect post-hurricane   rebuilding efforts to boost those prices further and lengthen queues on some orders   Turning to the national economy, I share the Greenbook’s assessment of the near-term   impact of Hurricane Katrina on economic growth Pre-Katrina, the outlook was for very strong   growth in the second half of 2005  It now seems likely that second-half growth will be   substantially reduced due to the disruptions to production in the Gulf region and the negative   impact of the run-up in energy prices on consumer spending  Of course, over this time frame   there’s little that monetary policy can do to affect actual outcomes                            September 20, 2005 52 of 117  While the proposed policy statement associated with alternative B acknowledges   increased uncertainty about economic performance in the near term, I believe that the   uncertainties associated with the medium-term outlook have also risen substantially, and risks   now exist that in my view pose a clear and persistent threat  On the upside, rebuilding   commitments are escalating by the day  The recovery and bounceback fueled by massive fiscal   stimulus could more than make up for the slowdown this winter, propelling the economy on an   unsustainable upward trajectory similar to the optimistic scenario laid out in the Greenbook    But downside risks to growth also loom  Rebuilding schedules could easily slip   Moreover, the pace of restarting closed oil and natural gas platforms and rigs in the Gulf of   Mexico has leveled off, and the prognosis for restarting the remaining closed facilities as well as   refineries and natural gas treatment plants remains in question  If disruptions persist or further   shocks to supply occur, the economy could develop more along the lines of the pessimistic   scenario in the Greenbook Moreover, we may not yet have seen the full brunt on spending of   the pre-Katrina energy price increases  It’s sobering to note that in the postwar period, the US   economy has rarely escaped such severe run-ups in oil prices without suffering a significant   downturn   Turning to inflation, I was quite concerned at our August meeting by the elevated rate of   core PCE inflation, which was skirting the top of my comfort zone  Since that meeting, I’ve   become more confident that core inflation remains well contained  Recent data on core price   inflation have been encouraging Core PCE prices have risen at a 1½ percent rate over the six   months through July, right in the middle of my preferred range, and core CPI inflation has also   been well behaved I’m also encouraged by readings on wage growth from the employment cost                       September 20, 2005 53 of 117  index and from the household survey, a series that our research staff has recently started   compiling and tracking  These remain remarkably subdued  The elevated rate of growth in   compensation per hour from the productivity and cost report over the past year far exceeds the   readings provided by these other series and may be more an outlier than a strong signal of tight   labor markets and wage pressures   While my comfort level with respect to core inflation has improved since August, the   Board’s staff has raised the Greenbook forecast of core PCE price inflation in 2006 by 02 of a   percentage point to 23 percent due to the run-up in energy prices since the August meeting  I   must say that I actually found the low-inflation alternative simulation in the Greenbook more   compelling  This scenario assumes that inflation expectations remain well anchored, and it   shows core inflation falling over the next two years, reaching 1½ percent in 2007   On that point, the relative stability of longer-term break-even inflation rates derived from   the TIPS market this year, even as oil prices surged, provides evidence that the public remains   confident in the Committee’s commitment to price stability  Of course, the jump in inflation   expectations seen in this month’s preliminary Michigan survey was worrisome, but we must be   cautious not to read too much into that report since it was taken so soon after Katrina   To assess the likely pass-through of energy into core consumer inflation, our staff has   estimated Phillips curve type forecasting models akin to those employed at the Board  An   important finding emerges  Changes in real oil prices did have an economically and statistically   significant effect on core inflation, but only up to the early 1980s  Importantly for the current   situation, they find no evidence of such a relationship in the data since the early ’80s  The   critical difference between the pre- and post-1980s experience probably relates to the public’s                            September 20, 2005 54 of 117  inflation expectations  During the 1970s, they became unmoored from price stability but now   appear to be well anchored, as in the Greenbook’s low inflation scenario   With respect to policy, I support a 25 basis point rate increase rather than a pause today    A pause at this meeting justified by a need to further assess Katrina’s impact would be sensible if   we actually expected to know a lot more about the medium-term outlook by November, but   that’s unlikely to be the case A pause could counterproductively mislead market participants   about the likely future path of policy or create the misimpression that the Fed is unduly   pessimistic about the outlook  So I consider it wiser to stick with our “measured pace” approach   for now I think it’s well justified by the Greenbook forecast, uncertain as it is, and consistent   with market expectations  But going forward, we obviously need to be flexible and adjust our   views about where we’re ultimately heading on the basis of new data and forecasts  "
5712,2005-09-20," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, and I agree with   Governor Kohn that it is the right thing to do in spite of the greatly increased uncertainty  "
5756,2005-11-01,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  At our last meeting I was optimistic that we   would avoid a brush with stagflation despite the higher energy prices and the setback in production   from Katrina  Developments during the intermediate period have generally reinforced my                                      November 1, 2005 35 of 114  optimistic view  Although considerable uncertainty still clouds the outlook, I regard reports on both   real economic activity and inflation to be generally encouraging   On the real side, it now appears more likely that the disruptions caused by the hurricanes will   be transitory  Oil and wholesale gasoline prices, for example, have fallen below their August levels   before Katrina  Furthermore, rebuilding has been gathering steam quickly, and spending outside of   the Gulf region remains robust  In the Greenbook, the effect of this encouraging news about the   underlying vigor of the economy has been held in check by the assumption of tighter financial   conditions, so the path for GDP is little revised   With respect to the prospects for inflation, I remain more optimistic than the baseline   Greenbook projection  David suggested in his remarks that it was possible to make a case for   inflation doing better than the Greenbook projection, and I will pursue that case now  Certainly, the   latest data have been favorable  Over the six months ending in September, the core CPI increased   only 13 percent at an annual rate, while the core PCE price index was up 15 percent  These data   raise the question Where is the energy price pass-through?  PCE energy prices have been rising at   double digit rates for more than a year, but they have left remarkably little imprint on core inflation   At our last meeting, I described some econometric evidence showing that since the early   1980s, changes in real oil prices have not had an appreciable effect on core inflation  Today I   thought I would cite some reports from our business contacts that appear to be generally in line with   this result They do note that there has been some success in passing energy cost increases down the   supply chain but, given competitive pressures and the lack of pricing power, they tell us that the   buck usually stops before the consumer   I thought I would give you an example inspired by the season  A large pumpkin grower/   processor [laughter] near Portland has seen a 20 percent jump in the price of plastic packaging                                        November 1, 2005 36 of 114  materials  She reports that she can pass these costs on to the small retailers she serves, but they are   not able to charge consumers more for retail pumpkin products  So this Thanksgiving you need not   worry about paying more for your pumpkin pies  Obviously, forecasting beyond that is hazardous,   but looking out toward Christmas, I thought I would note that one of the country’s largest growers   of poinsettias is on our Advisory Council, and he is highly confident that there will be little pass-  through of energy costs into retail poinsettia prices  [Laughter]   Also in contrast to the Greenbook, I see no significant pressure for higher inflation coming   from increased inflation expectations  In particular, despite the surge in energy costs this year,   current estimates of inflation compensation, both over the next five years and the subsequent five-  year period, remain at the same average level that prevailed during the first half of this year  A   further sign that inflation expectations remain well contained can be found in the continued subdued   growth of wages and salaries  Last Friday’s reading on the ECI [Employment Cost Index] I thought   revealed no evidence of any pass-through of higher headline inflation or higher inflation   expectations to labor compensation  So I see no indication of the ’70s style wage-price spiral in the   offing   Overall, I judge our credibility to be very much intact  Of course, our credibility going   forward does depend on continued vigilance  The economy now appears to be close to full   employment, with a good deal of momentum  And annual core inflation, at least as judged by the   core PCE measure, remains near the upper end of my comfort zone and, arguably, inflation risks are   tilted somewhat to the upside  So with respect to policy, I support at a minimum the removal of any   remaining policy accommodation  The Bluebook shows that the funds rate has finally entered a   broad zone of plausible neutral rates, but under the circumstances, I personally would be more                         November 1, 2005 37 of 114  comfortable with a policy position toward the center of this zone  So a few more increases,   including one today, seem to me likely to be required   In implementing monetary policy, it seems to me that actions matter, but so do words, and I   wanted to briefly open up the question of the statement  I think for today the words of alternative B   should suffice, but Vincent has repeatedly suggested, and a number of you have emphasized, that   we need to consider how to modify the statement language  Several elements of this statement have   expiration dates that are quickly approaching  So I think it’s an important issue for us to discuss     As we go forward, I see three problems with using the kind of language that is in alternative   B First, it refers to policy accommodation, which will arguably soon be exhausted  Second, it   refers to a “measured pace,” when at some point presumably we will reach a stopping point in this   tightening cycle  And, third, it now contains a near-tautological balance of risk statement that I   think serves no obvious policy purpose  Of course, these three problems could be fixed at different   meetings  For example, if the inflation picture sours, the “measured pace” language could continue   to be used well past the elimination of the policy accommodation phrase  As Governor Gramlich   feared, the balance of risk statements could outlive us all!  [Laughter]   Still, trying to fix all of these three problems at once has some appeal, and I thought that   alternative C did just that  It eliminates the balance of risk statement and the policy accommodation   language; and it substitutes a new forward-looking policy statement for the “measured pace”   phrasing My main criticism of alternative C is that it jettisons any mention of the conditionality of   our actions on future data, and I believe such conditionality is always worth highlighting and   particularly deserving of emphasis now, toward the end of our tightening cycle   I believe that a good model for future statements would have three sections a policy decision,   a descriptive rationale, and a bit of forward-looking policy guidance  The policy guidance should                                 November 1, 2005 38 of 114  be nuanced—tailored to prevailing circumstances and explicitly conditional—and it should not   include a formulaic balance of risk statement  Let me give a concrete example based on alternative   C If the Committee believes, for example, that further tightening remains necessary once policy is   no longer accommodative, it could state, following the rationale section, that “under these   conditions the Committee perceives that further policy firming is likely to be necessary,” or “will be   necessary,” or “might be necessary”  “Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to any changes in   economic prospects to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability and foster sustainable growth”   Once the Committee feels that further tightening is not necessary, it could state that “under   these conditions the Committee perceives that the current stance of monetary policy will likely   remain appropriate going forward  Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to any changes in   economic prospects, and so forth, to fulfill its obligations”  In any case, I hope that this proposal   might be useful in jump-starting our discussion of these issues  "
5757,2005-11-01,"  Vincent, I have a question that concerns alternative C in Table 1    Currently, the only part of the FOMC statement that the Committee votes on is the balance of risk   section, and that now includes the forward-looking “measured pace” language  My sense is that, to   the extent we continue to have forward-looking language in the statement, it’s something the   Committee should vote on  But in looking at alternative C, what you did there was to move the   forward-looking language into the descriptive rationale part of the statement, which in my   understanding is not subject to a vote  To me there’s a governance issue there that I find troubling,   and I wondered if you would comment on it Was your expectation in alternative C that the   forward-looking language would not be voted on?  Or do you envision the Committee voting on the   entire statement?  So, my question has to do with governance      Is there a reason why the vote now does not cover the rationale sentences?                               November 1, 2005 84 of 114    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for the policy move and also   the statement today And I look forward to more detailed discussions about revising the statement   going forward  "
5800,2005-12-13,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Incoming data since our last meeting have been   quite encouraging  Economic growth over the next few quarters should be boosted by rebuilding and   the full return of energy production in the Gulf  As rebuilding winds down and the lagged effects of   monetary policy tightening take hold, it seems plausible that growth will slow toward potential,   keeping unemployment around the current level of 5 percent, the scenario envisioned in the   Greenbook   The economy’s remarkable resilience in the face of devastating hurricanes and three years of   rising energy prices suggest that the expansion has gained footing and no longer needs support from   monetary policy accommodation  Instead, a key issue facing us over the next few meetings is                                     December 13, 2005 35 of 100  whether policy might actually need to move to a restrictive stance in order to forestall inflationary   pressures   I will therefore focus my attention on the factors affecting the inflation outlook  To do that,   we need to look first at the here and now and remind ourselves that recent readings on core prices   have consistently come in at or below expectations  There are no signs of acceleration  In fact, core   PCE [personal consumption expenditures] price inflation has slowed over the past year; the most   recent reading of 18 percent over the past twelve months is down 03 from the preceding year  And   the downward inflation trend has continued through this year, with core PCE inflation running at only   16 percent over the past six months, which is about the middle of my preferred range  Of course,   even though recent core inflation data look pretty darn good, there may be forces at work that could   undermine price stability  In my remaining remarks, I’d like to comment on some factors that could   push inflation higher and consider their likely effects in the current situation   The first risk to price stability is that, contrary to the Greenbook forecast, growth may not   actually subside toward potential  So labor and product markets could tighten further, pushing   unemployment below NAIRU, which current estimates place around 5 percent  This possibility is   illustrated in the stronger aggregate demand scenario in the Greenbook  That simulation shows that   monetary policy would, of course, need to tighten  But the inflation consequences would be modest,   given a reactive Taylor rule monetary policy response  So to deal with this risk, it seems to me that   policy need not be preemptive   A sustained slowdown in productivity growth would pose a more challenging dilemma for   policy and the inflation outlook  Fortunately, however, productivity growth over the past year has not   slowed  Quite the contrary, it has been surprisingly robust  Output per hour in the nonfarm business   sector grew more than 3 percent over the past year, beating out previous estimates of structural                            December 13, 2005 36 of 100  productivity growth of around 2¾ percent  As I discussed at our meeting a year ago, I think there are   compelling reasons why productivity growth may well remain elevated for some time, having to do   with the gradual diffusion of new technologies and workplace practices throughout the economy    Therefore, I concur with the staff’s conclusion that the accumulated evidence indicates that structural   productivity growth is around 3 percent and with the corresponding upward revision in the outlook for   actual productivity  Given the sluggish adjustment of wages to changes in productivity, the stronger   path of productivity reduces the rate of growth of unit labor costs, putting downward pressure on   inflation  So productivity trends suggest a tempering of inflationary pressures, not an intensification   Energy prices also pose a potential threat to inflation  But as I argued a few meetings back,   the empirical evidence does not support significant pass-through of energy prices into core inflation  I   won’t repeat those arguments today but simply note, once again, that core PCE inflation has actually   moderated, despite a nearly 30 percent increase in energy prices over the past year, on top of a 15   percent rise in the previous year  Moreover, energy prices on the whole have come down sharply of   late, and, therefore, the risk of significant pass-through to core inflation has moderated as well     In addition, it appears that the Fed’s credibility has held up well this year, despite the supply   shocks associated with higher energy prices and hurricanes  Survey measures of longer-run inflation   expectations are about where they stood before the storms  Longer-run inflation expectations based   on Treasury securities have come down about ¼ percentage point since the last FOMC meeting and   are now below levels of a year ago   Finally, it’s possible that wage growth could accelerate, putting upward pressure on the   growth of unit labor costs and inflation  And, indeed, the Greenbook forecast projects exactly such an   acceleration, reflecting lagged pass-through of earlier increases in both energy prices and productivity   into wages In particular, the Greenbook forecasts that hourly compensation, as measured by the                                December 13, 2005 37 of 100  employment cost index, will increase 42 percent in 2006, following a 3 percent gain this year  It   projects an even larger—17 percentage point—acceleration in compensation per hour in the nonfarm   business sector   To gauge the likelihood of such an acceleration in compensation, my staff examined the pass-  through of energy prices and productivity into wages  They used forecasting models in which wage   inflation is determined by lagged wage inflation, price inflation, productivity growth, and the   unemployment rate  Now, it turns out that when the sample period used in the analysis includes the   1970s, our empirical work finds clear evidence of pass-through from energy prices into compensation    But when the sample begins in the 1980s, pass-through effects from energy prices to compensation   are dramatically weaker or insignificant  This result is consistent with the finding I reported   previously  There is no real evidence that energy prices pass through to core consumer inflation since   the early 1980s  With respect to the pass-through of productivity growth into compensation, our staff   finds evidence of only very gradual pass-through regardless of the sample period  Going forward, our   models predict significantly less increase in compensation growth than the Greenbook over the 2006­  2007 forecast horizon  We conclude from this empirical work that an increase in inflation due to a   sharp acceleration in compensation growth is, at most, an upside risk to inflation and not the most   probable outcome   I opened my remarks by noting that a key issue facing us over the next few meetings is   whether policy needs to move to a restrictive stance in order to forestall inflationary pressures  While   we must obviously remain vigilant and respond to developments that threaten price stability, the   evidence that we have at this time, in my opinion, points to relatively low and stable inflation going   forward  Moreover, history teaches us that it is not easy to foresee the point at which past policy                                   December 13, 2005 38 of 100  tightening takes hold and the economy reaches a turning point  Therefore, it’s important that we keep   the lags of monetary policy actions in mind in our deliberations and not go too far  "
5801,2005-12-13,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support a 25 basis point increase today and I   also support the language in alternative B  It seems to me that the framework in “B” maintains  its   existing form and also offers forward-looking guidance  I think we’ve had a very constructive   process, much to my surprise, in the way 19 people have taken turns at drafting a statement that has   evolved really quite nicely  The statement has the potential to evolve further next month and in   March; we’ve already discussed ways in which it can evolve—by eliminating “some,” changing “is   likely” to “may,” or possibly excluding “measured”   For today, I guess I’m comfortable keeping “measured”  I think there are arguments on both   sides of it  I think it is important to signal that we have no intention of doing something more   aggressive than a 25 basis point move  On the downside, as President Pianalto said, when you   combine “measured” with “is likely” and simultaneously remove “accommodation,” markets may                                      December 13, 2005 87 of 100  conclude that we have in mind at least two more steps, maybe more  And potentially removing   “accommodative” may signal that we intend to go beyond neutral into a restrictive stance   But it’s really hard to interpret how the markets are going to react to this  And frankly, I think   this statement comes as close as we can get to doing what I would like to see today, which is to   essentially validate the expectations that are currently in the markets and in the Greenbook  Those   expectations are that we are highly likely or almost certain to move another 25 basis points next time   and that what we will do in March and beyond is an open question  I think this is not a statement that   is likely to bring long-term rates down, although we will see shortly    On the issue of asset prices, I would simply second the comments that Governor Kohn made   about them  It’s a topic for greater discussion in the future  "
5849,2006-01-31,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Recent data on economic activity, as   summarized by the fourth-quarter GDP figure, have been surprisingly weak  But there are good   January 31, 2006 31 of 106    reasons to believe that much of the softness will prove temporary, so I tend to agree with the   Greenbook and other forecasts in expecting a rather sharp rebound in the current quarter   That said, I want to sound a note of caution  This view is based on incomplete data for the   fourth quarter and a paucity of information concerning activity in the first quarter  It is not   inconceivable that the weak numbers for the fourth quarter could presage a more-prolonged,   sluggish phase as the lagged effects of past policy tightening and higher oil prices take effect  This   caution is heightened by my concern that the economy faces some pretty big downside risks,   especially having to do with the interrelated issues of possible overvaluations in housing markets   and low term premiums in bond markets  These risks are highlighted by the alternative simulations   in the Greenbook concerning a rise in the saving rate and a higher term premium  In summary, I see   the Greenbook’s view of real activity for this year as very reasonable, but downside risks to that   forecast give me pause   Turning to inflation, core PCE inflation over the past twelve months—at 19 percent—has   come in higher than I would like to see  But assuming that growth slows to trend later this year, my   outlook for inflation in 2006 is more optimistic than the Greenbook  One reason stems from work   our staff has done on the extent of pass-through from energy prices to both labor compensation and   core price inflation  As I’ve said before, the evidence suggests to us that there has been relatively   little pass-through since the early 1980s, perhaps due to the credibility of our commitment to the   stability of core inflation  Under our assumption of very little pass-through, we expect the core PCE   price index to rise around 1¾ percent, both this year and next  The Greenbook shows an increase of   2¼ percent this year, presumably reflecting larger energy-price pass-through, and then a drop to   about 1¾ percent in 2007 as the effects of energy prices subside  So though I differ with the   Greenbook on inflation in 2006, over the longer period I think we’re about on the same page   January 31, 2006 32 of 106    So as I look at the total picture, I would say that the overall outlook is quite positive  The   economy is near full employment with real GDP tending toward trend-like growth  Core inflation is   within a reasonable range but a bit on the high side  Needless to say, it’s fitting for Chairman   Greenspan to leave office with the economy in such solid shape  And if I might torture a simile, I   would say, Mr Chairman, that the situation you’re handing off to your successor is a lot like a   tennis racquet with a gigantic sweet spot  [Laughter]   Positive though the situation is, it also obviously raises the issue of how much higher the   funds rate needs to go to keep the economy on this desirable trajectory  There are a number of ways   of looking at this question, all yielding similar answers  First, a funds rate of 4½ percent rests right   near the center of the range of estimates for the equilibrium funds rate  Along the same lines, our   staff ran simulations of FRB/US to calculate the net effect of monetary policy actions over the past   several years on real GDP growth  The results are that, after adding importantly to growth over the   last few years, past policy accommodation is roughly neutral in terms of growth this year and next    A second approach is to compare a funds rate of 4½ percent with the recommendations of Taylor-  type rules  Such calculations suggest that a 4½ percent funds rate this quarter is a bit on the tight   side now but should be about right later this year under the Greenbook forecast  The long-run   simulations in the Bluebook are a third method to judge the stance of policy  These simulations   show the funds rate optimally peaking at a little over 5 percent, well above where we are now  But   a major factor accounting for this relatively high peak is the Greenbook’s assumption, incorporated   in the Bluebook simulation, that energy pass-through pushes up core PCE inflation to 2¼ percent   this year  And as I’ve emphasized, we’re not convinced that this much pass-through is likely, and   our lower inflation forecast implies a lower peak for the funds rate along an optimal path   January 31, 2006 33 of 106    Taken together, then, these approaches suggest to me that if we tighten policy at this   meeting, as I think we should, we will be close to the appropriate peak in the funds rate based on   what we know now  As for the future path of the funds rate, I believe it should be highly dependent   on unfolding events and cannot be prejudged with any degree of confidence  So the bottom line is   that we need to position ourselves for flexibility in our policy choices going forward  "
5850,2006-01-31,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  And I also support fully your recommendation   with respect to the 25 basis point move and with respect to the language, and I agree with the Vice   Chairman’s comments that the discussion about what we should vote on is very important  It has all   become an aspect of policy, but there are a lot of details to discuss, and we should defer a decision   on it  "
