5373,1994-09-27," Mr Chairman, economic activity in the Seventh District remains relatively strong Most reports indicate an expectation of continued growth in the near term, with the possible exception of residential construction Manufacturing activity remains robust but has been impacted by capacity constraints as has been mentioned before Most of these constraints in automobile production should be resolved this fall except for some selected, very popular models where shortages are expected to continue into next year Auto suppliers in the District report that orders remain very strong and that production is ""maxed out"" The heavy duty truck industry is also at capacity Our contacts in retailing generally report that sales growth has continued at about the slower pace seen in the second quarter, with several noting some improvement more recently Retailers generally are optimistic about sales over the rest of this year For the most part, inventories are in good shape, and many retailers indicate that they plan to increase their stocks in the near future Competitive forces continue to hold down prices to consumers Labor markets in our District have continued to firm up Demand for temporary workers in our region is very strong, with these firms having to pay wages that are 5 to 10 percent higher than last year to attract workers Recruitment costs may be rising more generally We have had reports of bonuses being paid to hire engineers and truck drivers, for example However, we have had few reports of any significant upward pressure on the wages of permanent workers Some employers reported that they do not expect higher union wage demands  -24-    9/27/94  in the coming months, and others believe that they can offset higher wages through productivity increases  Purchasing managers throughout the District report that prices have been in an upward trend this year Increases in prices for container board, chemicals, and aluminum have been particularly pronounced in recent months Some manufacturers have fixed-price supply contracts that protect them from price increases for the remainder of this year For example, auto and commercial equipment manufacturers will now be negotiating new steel supply contracts for next year However, manufacturing contacts at our recent meeting in Milwaukee contirued to express skepticism that inflationary pressures would prove significant or long-lasting, citing the intense and continued competitive pressures that have been mentioned here before Agricultural conditions in the District remain quite favorable Estimates which had already pointed to a near record corn crop and a record soybean crop have been raised slightly These crops are maturing at a faster than normal rate, reducing the possibility of harvest losses  Our overall macroeconomic outlook for the second half of 1994 is largely consistent with the Greenbook We concur with the Greenbook assessment that little slack remains in the economy The only difference concerns the quarterly pattern of real growth We expect slightly weaker real GDP growth in the third quarter followed by slightly stronger growth in the fourth quarter, and this discrepancy primarily reflects differing assessments of the timing of production patterns in the automotive sector  If I could, I just want to comment on the US/Japan negotiations and the September 30 deadline  Just an observer from Chicago at this point without having had any contact with any of the participants These are complex negotiations, as we know, under at least two different statutes I think that Governor Lindsey's scenario is possible, but I would say the probability is higher that the parties will reach agreement on some of the issues If that's true, then I would not expect any major negative impact on the currency markets  Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation I do not believe we should move today, but we certainly should be prepared to do so between meetings "
5399,1994-11-15," Mr Chairman, economic activity on balance in the Seventh District appears to be a bit stronger than at the time of our September meeting Retail sales and manufacturing output have strengthened, and overall housing activity through September held up better than might have been expected given the rise in mortgage interest rates One cautionary note is that new single-family home sales in the Midwest have been weaker than national trends Contacts in the manufacturing sector continue to report robust activity, and several are now beginning to report gains from higher levels of exports Looking ahead to next year, a number of manufacturers anticipate that growth will slow in their domestic markets, but this slowdown could be offset by continuing increases in exports Similar to the Board staff, we estimate that the auto sector will contribute about 1/2 percentage point to real GDP growth in the current quarter, despite the fact that the auto industry is still struggling to address several model changeover and parts shortage problems We also expect about the same contribution to real GDP growth in the first quarter of 1995  Indicators of consumer activity in the District are quite robust Regional income growth has been above the national average Retail sales have improved, with sales in Michigan and Wisconsin up more than 12 percent in the third quarter, which is well above the 7-1/2 percent national figure More recent reports from two major retail chains indicate that sales in early November were very good and that it would not be a surprise if holiday sales exceeded earlier  -24-    11/15/94  expectations In general, retailers throughout the District are quite optimistic about the holiday season and have been adding to inventories Consumer confidence remains high and well above the national average, but it has flattened out in recent months due to a decline in the expectations component  In the agricultural sector, harvests of corn and soybeans will set new records in the District and the nation Cattle and hog supplies are also running at historically high levels These developments have led to lower prices to date, and prices are expected to remain low throughout 1995 in those areas The banner corn and soybean harvests have taxed the capacity of the grain storage and transportation facilities, but these bottlenecks, which are common in years of big crops, are already starting to ease  Examples of Seventh District industries operating at or near capacity are numerous, including motor vehicles, steel, appliances, construction, agricultural equipment, office furniture, and railroad car loadings Steel price increases appear to be in the 6 to 8 percent range, and significant increases are reported for other commodities such as chemicals and paper products Although manufacturers continue to resist supplier price hikes, conditions seem generally more conducive to such increases Some manufacturers can offset these increases with productivity improvements; others cannot and will increase prices of their products to consumers  District employment growth has been quite good In almost all of our states, unemployment rates are below the national average, including a 51 percent rate in Michigan after many years of significantly higher unemployment rates in that state We are increasingly hearing of labor shortages at the low and high ends of the skills' spectrum from retailers having difficulty filling entry- level positions to manufacturers reporting a futile search for engineers and designers I visited Detroit recently, and it is clear that the help wanted signs are out in Detroit I learned that one large retailer is trying to attract new employees by putting help wanted advertisings in the monthly bills that they send to their customers Despite these shortages, few manufacturers or retailers have reported any significant upward pressure on wages of permanent positions However, as I mentioned at the last meeting, temporary help firms have reported higher wage increases of about 5 percent  On balance, Mr Chairman, we concur with the Greenbook assessment that the economy is now past the point of full noninflationary utilization of productive resources  Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation Quite frankly, I came into the meeting thinking that a series of 50 basis point increases would be preferable for the reasons that Mike Kelley enunciated I also felt that, coming from a business background, it is preferable for people in business to see us moving in a progression that gives a certain logic to the direction we are moving I think this facilitates longer-term planning in business and makes it easier to operate in that type of environment But I was persuaded by the discussion here today I thought that Governor Blinder's and Governor Yellen's comments and their cautions were very helpful, and I think we should keep these in mind in the future I do think that the mild surprise that was mentioned, at least in terms of the financial markets, will be useful now in sending a positive signal "
5424,1994-12-20," Mr Chairman, economic activity on balance in the Seventh District appears to be even stronger than at the time of our November meeting Like the Greenbook, we have raised our estimate for real GDP growth for the fourth quarter, and I expect it to be in the 5 percent range It also seems likely that rapid growth will persist into the first quarter of 1995, with some likelihood of growth in excess of 3 percent With real GDP already slightly above potential output, this robust pace of real activity threatens to generate a noticeable increase in CPI inflation later in 1995, moving inflation above the Greenbook forecast Indicators of consumer activity in the Seventh District remain quite robust For most of the  -10-    12/20/94  District, the holiday sales season is running very strong, particularly for such durables as personal computers, electronics, appliances, and big screen televisions Only sales of soft goods such as apparel have lagged  The District's manufacturing sector continues strong after the summer supply disruptions in the automobile industry Auto and light truck sales are running at about a 15-1/2 million unit annual rate in the fourth quarter Although availability continues to constrain sales for some models, many of the problems should be resolved over the next six months, allowing domestic producers to continue to gain market share Over the next six months, the Big Three automakers plan to boost light truck capacity at existing plants by about 800,000 units through a number of changes to production processes Production schedules for the first half of 1995 are quite aggressive, up 4 percent in the first quarter from strong year-ago levels and up 5 to 6 percent in the second quarter While this is a very upbeat assessment, some extremely tentative signs of moderation in automobile sales were reported to us just recently Specifically, reports yesterday from two major automobile manufacturers revealed some softness in demand at the dealer level Although retail sales remain strong, some dealers have pared back their orders from manufacturers, possibly as a result of declines in showroom traffic, unexpected increases in stocks, or higher interest rates In response, one manufacturer has taken the unusual step of trimming its production plans and reducing overtime levels at several plants Although it is too early to attach much weight to these reports, they may represent early tangible effects of this year's increases in short-term rates  Heavy-duty truck sales were strong again in October, and it now looks as if sales for all of 1994 will set a new record high Orders also remain brisk, with the backlog extending into next year's fourth quarter The backlog is due at least in part to producers allowing customers to lock in current prices and avoid expected price increases next year if they are willing to accept later delivery Significant strength is also evident in our District's steel, machine tool, and office furniture industries  In the agricultural sector, the situation is more mixed It appears that some slowing has occurred in sales of farm equipment, especially for large tractors and combines Still, domestic manufacturing schedules are up strongly in November and apparently in December as well Prices in livestock markets have been depressed by large meat supplies, particularly for hogs On the other hand, crop markets have been supported recently by improving export prospects and by the heavy use of government price support programs, especially among farmers in District states Upward price pressures are reported for food packaging costs, including very steep 25 to 30 percent increases in corrugated cardboard prices, with another increase expected in January, as well as increases in prices of tinplate and bottles used as beverage containers In addition, the explosion of a major fertilizer plant in Iowa has added temporary pressures to tight supplies and sizable price increases already evident for fertilizer  On the employment front, labor markets continue to firm Auto-related employment is at its highest level since 1979, and overall manufacturing employment in the District is back to its 1989  -11-    12/20/94  level In Michigan, the unemployment rate in November was the lowest since the end of 1969, and in Illinois, the rate was the lowest since the late 1970s Moreover, surveys of employer hiring plans in the Midwest are the highest in at least 18 years The tightening in District labor markets has been accompanied by more frequent reports of upward pressure on wages due to labor shortages  Overall, Seventh District economic activity is consistent with the national economy It has continued to grow at a rate that, if maintained, would lead to increasing inflationary pressures  Mr Chairman, we believe that further tightening is almost inevitable because of the unexpectedly rapid pace of the expansion and the prospect of unsustainably robust growth continuing in the future However, in light of the unusually large action at the November meeting, we recommend leaving the rate unchanged for the time being, with the expectation that economic developments in the coming weeks will confirm the need for an increase in the funds rate at the January meeting, if not before So, I would agree with you on the asymmetric directive "
5478,1995-01-31," I generally agree with the thrust of what has been said Let me just preface it by saying, as a newcomer, that I think the announcement policy of the past year has been working quite well Essentially, what we are doing is ratifying the current practice Certainly, we should continue announcing our policy changes after each meeting The announcements should be brief I think the Chairman's suggestion that they continue to be read to the Committee for any comments is good and useful Maybe this is just a nuance on the Minehan/Blinder suggestion, but I would phrase it a little differently though I think I am in complete agreement with what you are saying As I understand the current practice, after the meeting Joe Coyne announces that the meeting is over and that there is no announcement That is the announcement; there is essentially no announcement Now it seems to me that we as a Committee can make an announcement at any time if we want to without changing interest rates We always have the option of making a statement if we want to We could do it after the meeting if we so desired I just would not put it in the context of a ""we are going to announce no-change"" I think I would say that if we have an announcement to make when there is no change, we will make an announcement  That is exactly what I had in mind, Mr Chairman  I am very concerned about making a long-term decision on this today that is going to bind future Open Market Committees for many years to come Since I am very new to this, I am begging indulgence if I ask some very basic questions First of all, you mentioned that Virgil Mattingly's memo came out after the subcommittee had written its report Did the subcommittee consider that legal memo in later deliberations and still agree to go forward with its recommendation?  -21-    1/31-2/1/95  I divide this into two questions One is, would we want to have these tapes today if we were voting today to set up a system of taping and follow the procedure we are going to have? Would we do that today? My sense just from reading this report and from the comments here is that we would not initiate this  Okay If that is the case, then the second question I have is whether we have explored both within the Committee and with those in the Congress who are so interested in this area other ways that we could be more open I agree that we should have a policy of openness unless it is going to interfere with our deliberative process Have we explored other options?  Yes  First of all, I think any of us can set a blackout period if we want to We can just say, my policy is not to speak to the press for a week before, a week after, or whatever the time period is, and the press will respect that if we set it Any of us has that ability I can see a blackout the week before I think  -37-    1/31-2/1/95  it makes good sense that we not talk about the economy or monetary policy before the meeting After the meeting, I view us as having made a consensus decision; we are going to go out and try to explain it to people I think that helps in the education of people and the better understanding of monetary policy I could see some limited blackout time after a meeting--perhaps 48 hours or as Joe suggests through Friday I would go with a more limited period after meetings than one week I wouldn't tie everyone's hands for a full week afterward because I think it can be a great benefit to the Committee and to what we are trying to explain  Mr Chairman, I am from the ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" school It is not that the Humphrey-Hawkins bill is the ideal piece of legislation, which it clearly is not, but I think as Governor LaWare said, this FOMC has implemented it extremely well Our record is good, and I think that opening it up now and trying to make changes in it may raise other problems that we do not want to get into If we are to have any type of targeting or numbers or even ranges, that should require legislation The reason I say that is that for targeting to be successful it clearly would require the efforts of the legislative branch, the executive branch, and of course our own efforts Looking at the experience of other countries that was reported in the staff paper, for those that had targets, I could see that in every case the central bank was doing it jointly with the finance ministry Therefore, the executive branch was clearly tied into it; it was not the central bank doing it alone In most of those countries, the central bank is independent I think it clearly has to be a government-wide effort to do this; it just can't be the central bank alone for reasons that others have mentioned here  On a numerical target, I would be concerned if we announced a numerical target for inflation that we just would not gain that much and also it would limit our flexibility When thinking about this in talking to our staff, I came to the same conclusion that Larry Lindsey came to, namely, that we should choose nominal GDP as the target to give us more flexibility But there are some problems with nominal GDP, too I think we would still have the escape hatch issue, although it may not be as severe as just choosing an inflation target If we have a nominal GDP target, we still have to have a long-term inflation target within the nominal GDP Even then, there could be some cases where we probably would go beyond the nominal GDP target and we would have to lay those out in advance If we lay them out in advance, that affects our credibility Would people really believe this? Clearly, nominal GDP would be much better than a long-term inflation target alone, if we are going to go that route I also thought the paper was interesting in noting that in the New Zealand case, when they started to bump up against the inflation target, they suggested redefining measured inflation to exclude some things that affect prices  I guess my conclusion is that we should not make any changes unless they are necessary If we have to respond to some legislation that is on the table, then I think we should at least seek some alternatives We should have this fleshed out a little more by the staff, and look at some options and alternative ways to respond specifically to that legislative proposal  Mr Chairman, on balance the Seventh District economy is still growing at a moderate to vigorous pace, although there has been some easing recently in a few interest-sensitive sectors As I said to the Committee last time, two US auto manufacturers reported cuts in orders from dealers as early as mid- December but no reduction in consumer sales at that time More recently, there has been a lot of discussion in the press about a possible slowdown in the auto industry In addition to dealer orders being down, reports now indicate that for some models inventories have risen, production schedules have been trimmed, and new incentive programs are being offered In addition, used car prices have been declining in our District The challenge is sorting through all this information to determine to what extent demand has moderated Our assessment is that while there has been some moderation in sales growth, most of the recently reported signs of slowing overstate the degree of moderation, in part because 1994 was such a strong year for auto manufacturers, suppliers, and dealers We expect auto and light truck sales to increase about 2 percent in 1995 This is significantly slower than the 8-1/2 percent increase in 1994, but production would reach a strong level of about 154 million units in 1995  One area where the signs of slowdown are becoming clearer is in the single-family housing sector For example, builders and realtors in the Chicago area started seeing slower traffic and sales in the fourth quarter of last year, particularly in December despite quite favorable weather that month Reports from District retailers are mixed Sales gains remain heavily concentrated in hard goods, with apparel sales still slow Some retailers express concern about high inventory levels, although it is interesting that the Loan Officers Survey indicates that banks are not concerned about loans for inventory financing Competitive pressures are still reported to be intense, and increased promotional activity is widespread The District's manufacturing sector ended 1994 on a very high note with many industries, especially in durable goods manufacturing, reporting a record or near-record year While some industries expect to exceed those levels this year, the widespread expectation is that growth will moderate Utilization rates are quite high and in many cases above the peaks reached in 1989  As I reported earlier, raw materials price increases are pervasive Although many firms are unable or unwilling to pass on such price increases to their customers, some firms are now expressing the belief that price advances are becoming more feasible For example, rapidly rising sales and backlogs have led to two price increases within a month in the heavy paper industry Obviously, we did not hear this from Cathy's Maine producers  In agriculture, recent developments indicate the District's farm sector is holding up better than we had anticipated A sharp unexpected decline in exports from China has significantly enhanced US corn export prospects However, the peso devaluation will  -83-    1/31-2/1/95  undermine some of the near-term agricultural trade benefits that had been expected to accrue from NAFTA In particular for the Midwest, some of the recent gains in corn exports may be lost In addition, the earthquake in Kobe may briefly disrupt our trade patterns with Japan, which is the largest foreign market for US agricultural commodities  On the employment front, labor markets remain quite tight In many metropolitan areas, the reported unemployment rate is below 4 percent, including a rate of 3-1/2 percent in the metropolitan Detroit area A few reports indicated outright shortages of clerical workers, and concerns were expressed about the inability to find sufficiently well qualified workers Wages for clerical workers are reported to be up more than 10 percent from a year ago Overall economic activity in the Seventh District is consistent with a national economy that has moved into a range where a pickup in inflation is considered likely  Turning to the national picture, our outlook for real GDP growth in 1995 is similar to the Greenbook's alternative projection Growth in real GDP should taper off significantly over 1995 The inflation outlook is one area where we are less optimistic than the Greenbook, even assuming further monetary policy tightening this year While we tend to agree with the Board staff estimate of the NAIRU, we expect to see consumer prices responding more rapidly to the low rate of unemployment than is forecast in the Greenbook As a result, we expect CPI inflation to rise perceptibly to ranges in the neighborhood of 3-1/2 percent by the second half of 1995  Mr Chairman, the preponderance of evidence that we have reviewed confirms that the economy continues to grow faster than its potential We expect this will contribute to a perceptible increase in inflation despite the unexpectedly low inflation rates observed toward the end of last year Some moderation of real growth rates does appear likely by midyear as a result of our earlier actions Nonetheless, the adoption of a somewhat contractionary monetary policy is warranted in order to prevent the anticipated inflationary pressures from generating a permanent increase in the inflation rate With the real fed funds rate in the 2-1/2 to 3 percent range, consistent with a policy stance that is only mildly contractionary, this suggests that further action is appropriate These considerations lead me to support your recommendation for a 50 basis point increase in the fed funds rate and also a symmetric directive  Ted, I would like to ask you to sort of step back from this for a second We have talked a lot about the details, and the Chairman has just said that the principle involved is for the Federal Reserve to have zero credit risk and zero market risk What are the risks to the Federal Reserve here? What kind of scenario could you envision that could cause significant problems for us?  -130-    1/31-2/1/95  If I could just follow up on this for a second I do not know the game of zipswitch I think there clearly is a very significant risk The other risk that Ted mentioned first is that the overall program in Mexico will not work  Of course  No, but it has the potential for drawing us in further down the road "
5517,1995-03-28," Mr Chairman, I would like to nominate William Curt Hunter as the associate economist representing Chicago He is now Senior Vice President and Director of Research  Mr Chairman, Seventh District manufacturing activity remained brisk in recent months, but there were signs of moderation in some of the interest rate-sensitive industries, notably autos and single-family housing Sales of autos and light trucks in January and February came in under a 15 million unit, seasonally adjusted, annual rate, which was below industry forecasts as well as our own forecast Auto makers responded quickly by cutting first- and second-quarter assembly schedules In line with the Greenbook, we now expect light vehicle output to add very little to first-quarter GDP and probably subtract at least a full percentage point from second- quarter growth It is important to keep in mind that April is a critical month for the auto industry because that is when they determine their model year build-out Once they determine the number of units produced, they then apply the incentives necessary to sell them for the remainder of the model year Recent reports from the Big Three auto makers as well as from District auto dealers and distributors suggest that light vehicle sales have improved in March, perhaps to as much as a 15-1/2 million unit rate, with sales increases concentrated among those models where incentives have been enhanced I emphasize, ""as much as"" However, it will take another month or so before we know whether the early 1995 softness in lighter vehicle sales reflects what one industry contact called ""the pause that refreshes"" or whether there has been a more permanent pullback on the part of consumers  Single-family housing is the other major industry that showed outright weakness in early 1995 But this is being countered by growing multifamily and commercial construction activity In addition, we have had a few reports that recent declines in mortgage interest rates may have mitigated some of the softening in mortgage demand and existing home sales We are all aware that sales of Michael Jordan's new number 45 Chicago Bulls jersey have been exceptionally strong recently, [Laughter] but overall retail sales growth in the District has slowed from the fourth-quarter pace District reports on March-to-date sales suggest no change from the moderating pace set in January and February Apart from apparel, inventories are not seriously out of line with desired levels, although an increasing number of retailers in our February Michigan survey reported rising stocks Price discounting continues to be pervasive and competition intense  The District's manufacturing sector outside autos continues to expand at a robust pace District steel production in the first quarter will post its second largest year-over-year gain since the end of the 1990-1991 recession However, confidential information we have on the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, which will be released to the public this Friday--I emphasize that this is confidential until  -23-    3/28/95  Friday--will indicate a significant slowing in the pace of expansion during March as well as a slight easing in prices-paid inflation I would add that, on the other hand, the tone of our recent meeting of the Advisory Council on Agriculture, Labor and Small Business was quite positive, with representatives indicating that their small business contacts still expect growth in 1995 to be in line with that in 1994 The agricultural sector is stronger than we had expected Farm land values continue to rise There was a 6-1/2 percent increase in District farm land values last year, and that was the largest annual gain in six years January and February unit sales of farm tractors and combines were the strongest since 1984 and were up nearly 10 percent from a year ago On the employment front, labor markets remain very tight Help wanted ads continue to climb in the region, and the survey of Midwest employers indicates further strengthening in hiring plans Virtually all of our contacts in the personnel supply industry report difficulties finding workers to meet the needs of their customers Our directors as well as the members of our Advisory Council express significant concerns about labor shortages, particularly in the state of Indiana One of our directors from Indiana told of a help wanted ad being placed offering a sign-up bonus of $200 By mistake, the ad ran with an extra 0, offering a $2,000 bonus, and it ran for two days before they realized it They had a total of three responses to the ad! Overall developments in the Seventh District, while upbeat in many respects, are gradually beginning to reflect some of the mixed signals observed around the nation  Our appraisal of the national economic picture is very similar to the Greenbook's In general, we concur with its forecast of slower real growth combined with a modest but increasing rate of CPI inflation  He's now in Chicago  Mr Chairman, I favor no change in the federal funds rate today However, I do think that the risks are more on the up side than balanced at this point In fact, our forecast for inflation for 1995 is closer to 3-1/2 percent than to the 32 percent in the Greenbook It is appropriate to wait for more information on the economy in the coming weeks, but I think we clearly should remain open to further increases It comes as no surprise that I favor the asymmetric directive as well, not only for the reasons that you gave, Mr Chairman, but I think two of the points that Don Kohn made were very well-taken He said that if we were not happy with the 32 percent inflation rate that is forecast in the Greenbook, that would be one argument for an asymmetric directive or if we thought the risks were higher on the up side rather than balanced, that would be another reason I agree with both So, clearly, I favor an asymmetric directive "
5530,1995-04-28," Mr Chairman, just by coincidence is visiting Chicago now and will be in our Bank this afternoon; I'll be meeting with him later I was just wondering if he had any views that would be helpful for us to be aware of "
5549,1995-05-23," Mike, the forecast that you gave has the core CPI running at roughly 3 percent throughout the last half of 1995 and all of 1996, and you have built in, of course, the assumption of a flat fed funds rate at 6 percent Just looking at those two numbers would mean that the real fed funds rate would be roughly 3 percent during this period We have often talked about the concept of a neutral monetary policy I am wondering how you would relate that real fed funds rate to the idea of a neutral monetary policy--whether you see this as a neutral monetary policy  But is there a zone or number that you think of as a neutral monetary policy?  Mr Chairman, on balance economic activity in the Seventh District in the last two months seems to have continued the slowing pace of growth in the first quarter--led, of course, by developments in the automobile sector Confidentially, we have the Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index for May, which I caution will not be public until next Wednesday, May 31 It indicates a resumption in the slowing of the expansion which had been interrupted briefly by a slight uptick in April  In the last few days, our contacts in the automobile industry reported new cutbacks in production schedules, including three more plants that will be down this week and additional cuts to overtime and line speed at a handful of other facilities I note that for automakers these are very expensive actions to take at this time because the materials and supplies for the 1995 models have already been purchased under contract One of the Big Three firms indicated  -13-    5/23/95  to me that they expected a slower start-up of the 1996 models in September and further cutbacks at that time because of large expected inventories of the 1995 models Auto and light truck sales appear to be coming in at about the 14-1/2 million units level so far in May, which is approximately 3/4 million units above the April pace but still well below the expectations earlier this year  Housing activity in the region has been trending down for the last few quarters, but District realtors report some improvement in existing home sales in the past two months Midwest home builders generally continue to report a relatively higher level of activity in our District than in the rest of the country  A long delayed spring in the Midwest has damped consumer spending growth, but retailers' optimism seems to have improved with the weather Retail sales reports have been mixed, with some contacts reporting weak sales in April and the first part of May and others indicating some improvement in sales growth In the capital goods industries, contacts continue to report strong orders for products such as machine tools, agricultural equipment, and heavy-duty trucks Steel output in the District has strengthened slightly since the beginning of the year, but growth has been at a substantially slower rate than in the fourth quarter of last year Some of our steel industry contacts report that orders from the automakers are only now being scaled back Softening in the domestic demand for steel may be offset by an expected rise in steel exports this year  In the agricultural sector, corn planting is proceeding at the second slowest pace in 11 years If the weather improves over the next week or so, there is still a reasonable chance for achieving average yields this year But even with average yields, production would fall short of current consumption, implying above-average prices in the months ahead I should add that the weather forecast for the next 5 to 10 days is for more rain Farmland values and farm equipment sales continued to rise in the first quarter despite widespread talk of trimming farm income and price support programs  On the employment front, labor markets remain tight, with the District's unemployment rate at its lowest level in over 15 years But recent weakness in key District industries, especially autos, has reduced overtime and other labor market pressures somewhat Nevertheless, the surveys continue to reflect relative strength in hiring plans in the second quarter Pockets of labor shortages in western Michigan, Wisconsin, and Indiana have curtailed expansion plans, adding to recruitment and training costs and combining with other factors to prompt price increases in some industries Reports on prices generally are mixed Prices of some materials such as cement, paper, and steel scrap have been increasing Gypsum board prices were raised about 10 percent in mid-February, but one producer reports some erosion in that increase over the last month, and a planned increase for mid-May was abandoned Similarly, a number of steel suppliers are reported to have rolled back earlier price increases and the announced July price hike for steel is not expected to go through In fact, one mini mill has cut its prices for a second time  In terms of the national outlook, Mr Chairman, I am in general agreement with the Greenbook  -14-    5/23/95  Mr Chairman, I support ""B"" symmetric as well I am concerned about the asset bubble problem you mentioned I think it is a real one down the road We may see some signs of an increase in the inflation rate in coming months, but at this point it appears that that increase will be transitory There is some danger of giving up ground on our progress toward price stability, so I think it clearly would be inappropriate to respond too hastily to any signs of weakening in real activity But in light of the evenly balanced risks that I see at this point, the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate "
5575,1995-07-05," Mr Chairman, I favor alternative II for 1995 and alternative I for 1996 In terms of the last point that we were just discussing, assuming that we will have to respond to some type of legislative initiative, I think it would be desirable for us to try to get ahead of the curve, as you were anticipating in your earlier comments Perhaps we could have staff work done to identify some options and some specific language that we could plan to consider at a special meeting or at an extended meeting as you suggested "
5576,1995-07-05," This is on another subject  Peter, I was on the ""morning call"" this morning and one of the subjects was the fed funds futures rate My recollection from this morning was that the fed funds futures rate is now indicating a 60 or 65 percent probability of a 25 basis point cut in the fed funds rate this month I was just wondering how that ties in with what you were saying here this morning  But I thought I heard you saying that the majority of the opinion in the market was that there would not be a move  Mr Chairman, reports from our District ccntacts have been more mixed lately While economic conditions in certain sectors of the District continue to show signs of slowing, some pickup in activity was reported in other industries Reports from our contacts in the automobile industry and, of course, today's announcements indicate that autos and light truck sales in June moved slightly above May's annual rate of 14-1/2 million units, but not up to the 15 million units that we were expecting just a few weeks ago I think that's because of lower sales at one of the Big Three and lower expected sales at one of the foreign nameplates that has not yet announced its sales I don't view this as a pervasive, industry-wide slowing in the last couple of weeks in June I think the slowing is more focused in those two companies And, as Mike mentioned, Chrysler has not yet announced, but we are expecting its sales to be up 11 to 12 percent; of course, that number is confidential until it is announced  They announced today?  Of course, they are the one company that has widespread incentives for both their cars and their light trucks now None of the other manufacturers has incentives across the board Despite the production cuts so far, it is likely that inventories at the end of June remained near the 70-day supply that existed at the end of May This year's weakness in light vehicle sales may reflect factors other than overall consumer demand because the total number of light vehicles sold, including both new and used vehicles, actually has risen slightly this year from last year I think an important factor is the rise in the supply of used vehicles coming off lease, and this trend is going to continue to accelerate in future years as well In addition, despite the incentives on new vehicles, relatively high prices and finance company auto loan rates may be shifting demand from new vehicles to used vehicles Orders for heavy duty trucks are exhibiting signs of weakness However, the back orders remain quite high and cancellations have not picked up On a seasonally adjusted basis, heavy duty truck production in the third quarter is planned to be about even with the first and second quarters of 1995  For other manufacturing firms, particularly in the consumer durables sector, inventory pruning has been a major factor constraining production, but we do not believe that operating rates are falling to recessionary levels Industry reports have indicated noticeable reductions in order backlogs for heavy equipment, further slowing of durable goods production, and planned cuts in overtime and weekend operations and in temporary workers One large producer of heavy equipment has seen a drop in the number of their models on allocation from 30 to 15 in the past few months but, of course, they still have 15 models on allocation at this point Indeed, producers of construction equipment believe that orders and probably production peaked in the second quarter, and firms are now focusing on managing the expected economic slowdown One District appliance maker reported cutting production and workers in May and June in an effort to trim factory inventories accumulated earlier when sales were softening But this contact also noted that the inventory adjustment by appliance dealers appears to have been short-lived For the industry as a whole, factory shipments of appliances strengthened in May and strengthened again in June Purchasing managers' surveys in our District indicate slowing activity overall, with the latest Chicago survey dropping to its lowest level since June 1992 On the consumer side, although reports were mixed, most retailers in the District report that sales growth improved in May and again in June on a seasonally adjusted basis Reports from several national retailers reflected less concern about inventory positions than in previous months, although some added that stocks were still above desired levels Others indicated an inventory buildup at specialty and discount retailers as a result of deteriorating sales  We have not yet seen a widespread revival in the housing sector, although realtors and homebuilders are optimistic and there are increasing signs that lower mortgage interest rates are beginning to have an impact on activity In agriculture, weather-related delays during the spring planting season trimmed this year's crop acreage from initial intentions and increased the odds that per acre yields will be reduced by other problems during the growing season Because  -22-    7/5-6/95  of the increased chances of a significant tightening in supplies, grain prices have risen sharply and are likely to remain quite volatile for the rest of the summer  Although the labor markets in the District remain relatively tight, slowing economic growth had tempered demand for workers and some easing of wage pressures was reported Our average unemployment rate in the Seventh District is 5 percent now compared, of course, to the 57 percent rate nationally On the price side, reports generally have indicated some abatement in upward pressures, mainly in input prices Reports of renegotiations of earlier steel price hikes continue to surface Of course, the planned July increase is widely expected not to go into effect The auto parts producers are reporting renewed pressures from the Big Three to cut prices Energy prices in the District have eased, partly due to soft demand Freight haulers report competition for slower business is pushing down rates One notable exception is paper and paper products, where prices continue to move up  Overall, we agree with the Greenbook that the current outlook is for slower growth in 1995 rather than a recession Even though the second quarter may be worse than the Greenbook forecast, as long as some key expenditure categories do not turn sour, especially business fixed investment, 1995 should not yield to recession While the core CPI has increased at an average annual rate of 38 percent so far this year, we agree with the Greenbook that the inflation outlook is improving There remains substantial uncertainty about the actual level of inflation, but the expected path is one of improvement  I agree and the legislative proposal would be the action forcing the event What I am suggesting is that in anticipation of that coming legislation--  I was hoping that in the work that will be done, we could see some alternative specific language  Mr Chairman, I believe that we should be forward-looking in setting our monetary policy While we had two or three months of bad numbers, there is still a lot of uncertainty about the economy's underlying strength As you mentioned, some of the more recent data that we have seen on housing and orders for durable goods suggest that the economy is stabilizing at a sustainable level of real activity I think it is important that we be careful not to give the perception that we are tying monetary policy too closely to the fluctuations in short-run output That would damage the credibility of our commitment to reducing inflation Clearly, if inflationary pressures are moderating, we should be prepared to reduce the federal funds rate gradually I believe the real federal funds rate should be below 3 percent, especially given the fiscal policy assumptions At this point our forecast has the economy slowing to a sustainable rate of growth with some reduction in inflationary pressures, though not as much as the Greenbook in 1995 This is based on both the forecast that we have from our model and my own personal contacts with people in our District and elsewhere Our forecast also assumes that the Committee will be lowering the federal funds rate by at least 50 basis points by the end of 1995 The timing of this policy action would have little impact on the economy's performance this year By our assessment the 25 basis point reduction in the fed funds rate now will have little quantitative impact, but it may serve as a signal that we are indeed forward-looking However, I think it is important that we not give the impression that we are simply responding to short-run fluctuations in output It must be clear that our action is consistent with the slowing expansion and moderation in the inflation outlook As others have said, I think it is important that we indicate that this is not a change in our commitment to reduce inflation So, I support the 25 basis point reduction and an asymmetric directive  -68-    7/5-6/95 "
5601,1995-08-22," This gets back to Bob Parry's question about labor force participation rates and volatility One of the changes that appears to have taken place in the labor market is this greater use of temporary workers or people who have less than permanent attachment to the workforce I have two questions relating to this One, is this in any way related to the volatility that we were talking    8/22/95  about before? And second, has the Board staff done any studies on this, particularly in relation to whether this growth of temporary workers affects the speed with which firms respond either in expansions or slowdowns in terms of their hiring policies?  We have two of those firms in our District We are working with them to get some data as well  Good  For the most part, Mr Chairman, changes in our outlook for the economy parallel those in the Greenbook, so I am going to focus my comments on developments in the Seventh District Overall, it appears that District economic growth increased in the early stages of the third quarter The inventory correction that slowed growth in the second quarter appears to be nearing completion  -10-    8/22/95  in several industries, notably appliances and steel Recent reports from the appliances industry point to a pickup in shipments to dealers and a sizable reduction in factory inventories These reports were also consistent with increasing production levels in July and early August In the steel industry, District output climbed relatively sharply in the first half of August Orders seemed to be flowing in at a good rate Customers had built up inventories late last year in anticipation of price increases, but stocks now seem to have been worked down to more normal levels Most steel markets have remained fundamentally healthy, especially those linked to construction activity  In the automobile industry, some progress has been made in addressing the inventory overhang, but the July drop in sales may have raised some concern that additional production cutbacks will be needed Automakers we have talked to tend to attribute the July drop in light vehicle sales to temporary factors including reduced fleet sales, shortages of some popular models related to model changeovers, and a drop in Japanese luxury car sales Through the first two weeks of August, showroom traffic is up and sales rates are showing marked increases over July with reports ranging from a 146 to 148 million unit rate for August; that's for the first two weeks At this point, only Chrysler has extensive incentives on 1995 models, but at least one other manufacturer is expected to follow in coming months Inventories have not been a problem in the heavy duty truck market where production has been at capacity for some time However, there have been some significant changes in this industry over the past month or so In June and July, order cancellations for heavy duty trucks jumped to their highest levels since the early 1980s Incoming orders have slowed somewhat from earlier in the year, but backlogs remain nearly as large as last year's record output level Order cancellations are causing production slots to open in the fourth quarter and some producers are responding by trimming production plans and overtime However, major adjustments to production schedules are not expected until early next year  While reports were mixed, most retailers in the District reported stronger sales growth in June and July than earlier in the second quarter As expected, air conditioner sales have been quite robust, but sales gains in June and July were broadly distributed across a wide variety of durable goods categories So far in August, retailers report that hard good sales remain strong but some sales have been hurt by the hot weather, particularly back-to-school and fall fashions as well as home building and remodeling merchandise Retail inventories generally seem to be back near desired levels even for apparel stocks, and some retailers now expect to be adding to stocks over the balance of 1995 Reports from District realtors point to a significant strengthening in existing home sales during June and July Homebuilders remain optimistic, but we have not yet had reports of a strong revival in building activity, partly due to the weather and partly due to the remaining inventory of new homes for sale  Crop conditions vary widely across District states, with crops in Iowa, Wisconsin, and Michigan regarded as above normal and those in Illinois and Indiana below normal Due to late plantings, the corn crop in most areas is not as far along as usual, but warm temperatures have permitted some catch-up The hot weather was not    8/22/95  beneficial for poultry and livestock production, which was temporarily curtailed  Labor markets in the District remain relatively tight, but slowing economic growth has tempered demand for workers The average unemployment rate in the five District states has drifted higher this year, but it remains below the national average in every state Help wanted advertising in the region has slipped a bit There are still areas, though, within the District experiencing labor shortages One Iowa contact, for example, noted that he needs to import workers from South Dakota and Missouri  Reports on prices have been mixed but generally continue to indicate receding inflationary pressures, mainly in input prices Plastic resin prices have actually fallen in recent months Paper prices are still rising, causing concern for catalog retailers and other District firms However, the rate of increase in paper prices seems to be diminishing Steel scrap prices recently rose, climbing to their highest level in four years, but this probably reflects strong demand for scrap-based steels going into construction markets Price index components of the various District purchasing managers' reports continued to move lower through July Our early receipt of the Chicago purchasing managers' report for August, which I caution is confidential until it is released on August 31st, indicates further moderation in price increases The overall Chicago purchasing managers' index shows a modest decline in manufacturing activity, with the index moving down to 493 in August from 497 in July Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support it, Mr Chairman "
5625,1995-09-26," This is a question on a different subject entirely, the fiscal situation Going out to 1997, Mike, I noticed that the Greenbook forecast showed real GDP growing at 2 percent in 1997 The reduction in government purchases seemed to have a big impact on GDP going out that far I really have three questions Is this viewed as a permanent change? What assumption are you making about the steady rate of GDP growth under that type of fiscal scenario? Do you see any offsetting private-sector spending to compensate for this reduction in federal purchases during this period?  But if you kept monetary policy steady at its current level during this period, is there a wealth effect that would increase private-sector spending to compensate for any of this reduction through lower taxes or anything like that?  Mr Chairman, we are in general agreement with the Greenbook forecast, so I'll focus my comments on developments in the Seventh District  Overall, it appears that District economic activity has been picking up in the third quarter Consumer spending seems to have strengthened in September Retailers in the District generally report that while the hot, humid weather adversely impacted sales in August, sales have improved this month as the weather turned cooler Retail inventories are reported to be at generally satisfactory levels Another area where we are getting reports of a pickup in activity is in homebuilding Sales of existing and new homes have been on an uptrend for a while, but it is only recently that the signs of a pickup in construction activity have emerged We did have reports, however, that the hot weather in August slowed some construction work temporarily  In the auto industry, sales of light vehicles have fluctuated considerably in recent months in part due to relatively sharp swings in fleet sales In July and August, sales were at an average annual rate of 14-3/4 million units, and recent reports we received suggest that September sales may come in a bit stronger than this average Measures of overall days' supply moved down toward desired levels in August, but the overall numbers mask sizable differences among producers and among models The Ryder truck strike has led to some accumulation of cars and trucks at plants and shipping points However, the strike is not expected to have any impact until October Better selling models may then be at risk, and in particular light trucks and fleet sales could be depressed Members of our advisory council on small business reported that dealing with the Ryder strike is being complicated by the unavailability of rail cars to pick up the slack in our District In the last few weeks we had discussions with each of the Big Three auto makers regarding their estimates of the long-term demand for motor vehicles In each case, they have reduced their estimates of the long-term trend rate of motor vehicle sales The primary factors contributing to this reassessment are the higher quality and greater durability of new vehicles and the shift from cars to light trucks, which tend to last longer  District manufacturing output stabilized in June and July and now seems to be rebounding from a weak second quarter We are seeing a shift from earlier this year Producers of consumer goods such as autos and appliances are now reporting increasing output while producers of capital goods are the ones indicating a slowdown in activity, although reports from key capital goods industries are now suggesting that the second half of 1995 is actually holding up better than anticipated For example, orders for machine tools have slowed    9/26/95  but still seem to be running ahead of earlier expectations, in part reflecting strength in orders for small machines Steel production in the District increased considerably from July to August and that pickup continued into the first part of September Shipments of appliances to dealers were quite strong in August and early September, and it now appears that the expected shortfall from last year's record pace will be smaller than anticipated at the beginning of this year  In Iowa, problems in accessing rail cars have left some grain elevators still full even ahead of this year's harvest The rail car problems may have been exacerbated by this year's surge in grain exports, which contributed to longer shipping distances and slower turnaround times for rail cars as well as the transitional problems associated with the merger between the Union Pacific and the Chicago Northwestern railroads Weather-related crop damage this year is turning out to be worse than expected for vegetables and corn, and it now appears that an early killing frost may prematurely end the development of some late-planted fields, especially soybeans While the grain harvest is now expected to be about average, it falls short of the record demand for grain observed over the past year Grain prices have risen sharply and will remain high until there is evidence that demand and supply are moving into better balance  District labor markets remain tight and wage pressures continue to intensify at the low end of the wage scale In both June and July, the average unemployment rates in the five District states were 46 percent, a full percentage point below the national average Finding qualified entry-level and skilled workers was cited as a serious problem by virtually all members of our small business and agricultural advisory councils when we met with them earlier this month After slipping somewhat during the summer, help wanted ads in the region picked up in early September Union leaders I speak to emphasize the insecurity factor that we discussed before in explaining wage increases They emphasize the fact that corporate restructurings have continued even though the economy has recovered, so there is constant concern about losing one's job even though the economy is doing well Reports on prices have been mixed but they generally continue to indicate receding inflationary pressures in input prices Price increases for packaging materials have dissipated after the rapid increases last year and earlier this year, and price index components of the various District purchasing managers' reports continued to move lower through August However, several contacts noted upward pressure on building materials prices resulting in further increases for gypsum wallboard and cement and renewed hikes in lumber prices  I agree with your proposal, Mr Chairman  Mr Chairman, we currently seem to have the luxury of a great deal of flexibility because the goals established for the Committee are ambiguous and in some cases contradictory But I think we are moving past that point Once this issue is raised to the level of a serious discussion with hearings and so on, we are going to have to change We have been in the process of becoming much  -46-    9/26/95  more accountable in terms of the announcements that we make after each meeting, in terms of the publication of the transcripts, and our more open disclosure process generally, and I support all of those things But the world clearly is changing, and there is increasing pressure on us to clarify our longer-term objectives So, I support the thrust of this bill, although I have one major caveat I like the fact that it repeals the Humphrey-Hawkins bill My reaction at the time it was enacted was that members of Congress voted for it mostly because of emotional ties to Hubert Humphrey, not because they really supported what the bill actually said I like the emphasis on price stability I think it is clearly, as Governor Blinder said, our primary objective and where we have the most impact I like the flexibility that the bill would give us If we go down this road, I think it is written about as well as we could expect it to be written It can provide a major public education role for us as well, an opportunity for us to educate the public In that respect, I think it will have a useful side benefit  The caveat is the repeal of the Employment Act of 1946 I must confess that I haven't reread the Act, and I have to go back and reread it now since Governor Yellen raised this as a point But in general I support the thrust of the Mack bill "
5651,1995-11-15," Mr Chairman, on balance, the Seventh District's economy is performing at a very high level, generally stronger than the national economy and with some sectors or industries at or near capacity The District's manufacturing sector expanded in October, while manufacturing contracted nationally The purchasing managers' surveys from across the District in Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit and western Michigan all indicated expansion in October, while the national figure dropped below 50 However, there are some areas in manufacturing where I think caution seems to be called for I say this recognizing that our manufacturing firms are now operating at very high levels In my view our situation is not the same as the one Jerry Jordan described for the Cleveland District, where he said that growth actually is starting to decline, but there are areas in our District that we have to watch carefully  One area is light motor vehicles October sales of such vehicles were below September's, and our contacts indicate that sales in early November have not shown any significant improvement so far Of course, this is the early part of the month, but without a pickup from the recent sales pace, it's highly likely that production plans will be trimmed further this quarter Medium- and heavy-duty trucks is another area where caution seems appropriate Net orders have declined substantially, but manufacturers do not plan to cut production this quarter as much as might be expected Although inventories will be increasing, several manufacturers indicate they will wait for the new year before reassessing their production plans Finally, the steel industry needs careful monitoring Steel production in our District has been at very high levels, but spot prices for steel have been dropping sharply  District retailers generally were pleasantly surprised with the early November sales gains, particularly after October's lackluster performance However, retailers are still in a gloomy mood, in part because of weak catalogue sales, and they are boosting sales promotions Retailers with a national presence noted that sales at stores located in our District generally were stronger than nationally A note of caution, however A large national trucking firm reported that large discounters were significantly slower in    11/15/95  taking holiday shipments this year as compared with previous years The housing sector in our District is very strong New and used home sales in the Midwest led the United States in September and October Builders in Chicago and western Michigan are struggling to keep up with demand  Labor markets remain tight Unemployment rates in our District range between 33 and 48 percent We are now receiving more reports of rising wage pressures, especially for low skill entry-level jobs But these increases do not yet appear in the data, as a third- quarter employment cost index for the Midwest was roughly in line with the nation We have received an advanced copy of Manpower Incorporated's first-quarter 1996 hiring plans survey results, which will not be publicly available until early December The national results indicate that business hiring plans for the first quarter of 1996 will remain at the high levels reported for both the third quarter and the fourth quarter of this year Hiring plans for Midwest firms continue to be stronger than the national survey results Our contacts at that they feel the first-quarter results generally tend to be a good indicator for the full year They also indicated that wage pressures were very low, but firms they service are expecting increases to become larger next year  One of the major developments in the agricultural area, of course, has been the sharp increase in grain prices Wheat prices are the highest in twenty-one years and corn prices are the highest in eleven years; a year ago, corn prices hit a seven-year low While it is not entirely clear how much food prices will be affected, the farm price increases this year have been bullish for suppliers of farm equipment More generally, price patterns in our District do not seem to have changed much since our last meeting Nonagricultural commodity prices continue to be soft Paper board, gypsum, and steel scrap prices have all edged down  Turning to the national picture, our outlook is broadly in line with the Greenbook We generally agree with the Greenbook's assessment for fourth-quarter GDP growth in inventories, although the anecdotal information we are receiving points to further inventory correction early next year Our overall forecast is for a bit more economic growth next year than the Greenbook, and we are slightly more optimistic on inflation, but the differences are not really large  Mr Chairman, our inflation forecast remains encouraging We expect inflation over the period to be a little lower than that forecast in the Greenbook But despite appearing benign at this point, I think the inflation picture requires careful and continuing monitoring I certainly don't want the Committee to give up the gains that we have made against inflation in previous years  -49-    11/15/95  However, if there are further improvements in inflation that exceed our expectations, I think a modest reduction in the federal funds rate would be called for But given the rapid growth of GDP in the third quarter, it would be very premature to reduce the funds rate at this meeting; I don't think there is any urgency Thus, it seems appropriate for the Committee to take no policy action at this time, and I agree with your recommendation of ""no change"" in the funds rate With respect to the directive, although I personally agree the risks on the outlook are on the down side at this point, I would still support a symmetric directive "
5675,1995-12-19," Mike, this is a question on the Greenbook On Page 1-12, your report projected an increase of 100,000 payroll employment jobs per month over the next two years, the 1996-1997 period This is keeping in mind that we are dealing with a forecast of close to potential output during this period I was wondering about this 100,000 job figure It seems low compared to figures that we have looked at I was wondering whether you would expect that if we get to higher levels of payroll employment gains--125,000 or 150,000 new jobs per month--this would strain the economy's capacity during the forecast period  Mr Chairman, the level of economic activity in the Seventh District continues to be somewhat higher on balance than that for the nation, but the recent pattern of slowing growth seems to parallel what is happening nationally I should note that our directors at their meeting last week expressed somewhat more concern about the District and national economies than they had in recent months Mr Chairman, you heard those comments firsthand by telephone  Reports from District retailers have been mixed, with national chains continuing to report that sales at their stores located in the District generally are slightly stronger than their sales nationally Several retailers reported that price-conscious consumers have been hesitant during this holiday shopping season, hoping to get even better deals as the season draws to a close Promotional activity and discounting have been intense this year, as Ed Boehne mentioned, not only because consumer spending growth has slowed but also because of overcapacity in the industry, as Gary Stern mentioned But there is one piece of good news Some of this excess capacity in the Chicago area has been taken up by a dramatic surge in sales of anything with the name Northwestern University on it [Laughter], particularly when it has roses on it, to celebrate Northwestern's first trip to the Rose Bowl since 1949  In the District's housing sector, which has been quite strong, home sales and starts have softened recently, in part due to the adverse weather In contrast to a decline nationally, housing permits in our region actually moved up in October So, our regional market may not be as soft as the October sales and starts data suggested In terms of autos and light trucks, the situation has not changed significantly since our last meeting This is still an area of concern While it's too early to get a good fix on December sales, industry contacts report that the current pace is in line with or slightly higher than the November level Despite some improvement in sales rates since October, production plans for light vehicles through the first quarter have been pared back gradually as inventories have climbed this quarter For manufacturing generally, the momentum that was developing this fall appears to have dissipated somewhat in November Purchasing manager surveys from around the District, for example, indicate that overall activity in the region's manufacturing sector flattened out in November after having expanded in October However, we do have advance information on the Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index that will be released to the public at the end of December That indicates a rebound from 499 in November to 576 in December Again, a word of caution; that information won't be released until the end of this month Steel shipments continue at high levels in the fourth quarter, led by demand in construction- related markets Overall demand growth, however, has slowed in recent months I have been talking to people in the steel industry recently and, of course, their main concern is that prices are soft in their industry, in part due to the slower growth and in part due to the new capacity that is coming on stream Another reason that steel prices are expected to continue to be soft is that the integrated producers  -19-    12/19/95  now have labor contracts that prevent them from laying off employees regardless of production levels So, even if they close down blast furnaces, they still have these employees on the payroll and, of course, this encourages them to continue producing at very high levels That contract provision was negotiated in 1993 Labor markets in the District remain tight, with unemployment rates still well below the national average, and we are still receiving some reports of rising wage pressures, especially for low-skill, entry- level jobs Price patterns in the District do not seem to have changed much since our last meeting Natural gas prices increased sharply with the cold weather in November and early December, but this is viewed as a short-term phenomenon  Turning to the national picture, we see the economy growing near its potential over the next year but perhaps slightly below the Greenbook path CPI inflation should continue around 2-3/4 percent, which is basically similar to the Greenbook assessment This view of the economy is shared by other economists in our District who attended our ninth annual economic outlook symposium earlier this month The median forecast of this group of 33 economists was for real GDP to increase 24 percent over the four quarters of 1996, the CPI to rise 28 percent over the same period, and unemployment to average 58 percent in the fourth quarter of next year  Mr Chairman, I really appreciated your discussion of longer-term trends You discussed some of them in your talk when you were out in Chicago, and I think that has been very helpful My preference actually is to wait at this meeting and not to move today To quote Mike Prell, growth is not steady and we had a very strong third quarter and it could be that the sogginess we see in the economy now is just some slowing down from that quarter I don't see any urgency to move today as opposed to the next meeting, and I think the 25 basis points symbolically is extremely important, even though it's not 50 basis points I should add, however, that I don't feel strongly enough to dissent I think, as Larry Lindsey said, that there will be some linkage to the budget discussions that are going on now, although that was not even mentioned in any of our discussion earlier today I agree that it is very important in the press release you are suggesting to relate our action to receding inflation and declining inflationary expectations I certainly would not want to change the discount rate I agree with the symmetric language proposal as well "
5698,1996-01-30," I want to add something on autos; I will be saying more later We had conversations with one of the Big Three yesterday, and a couple of things came out on the picture for January One is that they view the sales that they lost due to bad weather as just temporary They expect to make those up If somebody is going to buy a car, they are still going to buy it a week later or two weeks later when the weather clears up Second, they did seem to detect a slight uptick in sales during the last couple weeks of the month-- nothing to writehome about, but sales did seem to be moving in the right direction  No Sales of light trucks have been strong all along Obviously, cars sales are the area where there has been real weakness  Right  Mr Chairman, economic activity in the Seventh District continues to expand but at a moderating rate, as I mentioned at our last meeting I sense that we are outperforming the rest of the country, with some sectors experiencing weakness and others strength Fairly strong business activity was reported for farm and heavy equipment manufacturers, the light truck segment of the auto industry, the professional services sector, and the food segment of the retail services sector The farm equipment manufacturers are benefitting from the high grain prices of last year  The sectors that display some weakness include cars and heavy trucks as well as some retail segments On balance, the reports from our retailers were mixed, indicating that January sales were coming in at or somewhat below expectations Those expectations seem to be quite modest, with a couple of retail chains looking for January same- store sales to be about unchanged or up only 1 or 2 percent from last year Our contacts among national retailers said that their Seventh District store sales were holding up better than elsewhere in the country, in part because our District weather has been relatively more favorable to date Reports on retail inventories also were mixed; several larger retail chains were in good shape, while other retailers were still trying to trim their inventories The effects of lackluster Christmas sales and excess capacity continue to have an adverse impact on District specialty retailers Store closings continue to be reported in this sector Seventh District respondents to the Senior Loan Officer Survey expressed concerns about retail trade lending, both for working capital and for real estate based loans Housing activity is still fairly strong in most parts of the District, as shown by our data after adjusting them as best as we can for the weather  -17-    1/30-31/96  In the motor vehicle industry, demand for light trucks remains fairly strong, but that is not true for cars and heavy trucks, as Jerry Jordan and I mentioned earlier In terms of the orders for light trucks, the sales figures for January are particularly difficult to interpret because of the shifting of a few days' sales from early January back into December and, of course, the subsequent weather disruptions To elaborate on what I mentioned earlier, January is not going to be a good month overall for auto sales, though sales improved slightly as the month proceeded Our contacts suggest that auto sales nationwide will be in the low 14 million range in January If we average that with December, the number will exceed 15 million units, which is a relatively healthy pace Sales for the entire year in 1995 were 148 million units Of course, there are incentives in place to boost sales, and those incentives have either been increased or they will be in response to inventory imbalances and the need to remain competitive Mike Prell mentioned that first-quarter production plans for cars have been cut back further to adjust for high inventories To give you some examples of the ripple effect of these production cuts, weakening order rates in January have been reported by our auto suppliers for mufflers, brakes, bearings, piston rings, and related products So far, there has been no reduction in purchase orders for steel by the auto companies As Jerry mentioned before, steel prices are down significantly Two increases are scheduled and there is, of course, some uncertainty as to whether those increases will hold Turning to the heavy truck industry, production will be down significantly from 1995, but output in 1996 should be closer to the normal trend This is in line with what we talked about last fall when the orders were dropping significantly, but manufacturers were maintaining their production levels Obviously, they had to catch up at some point In 1994 and much of last year, it was orders from the large haulers that supported the market More recently, the order rate has reflected demand from the small- and medium-sized shippers, with cancellations by the large haulers compensating for over-ordering last year  District manufacturing activity outside the motor vehicle industry continues to expand, although at a more modest pace The purchasing managers' surveys for Chicago, Detroit, and Milwaukee indicated expanding orders and production in December In contrast, Detroit's auto component in the purchasing managers' survey showed contracting activity in western Michigan In January, the Chicago purchasing managers' index, which should be coming out tomorrow and is confidential until then, is at 509, down from 548 in December This is an indication of a continuing but more modest expansion in the early part of the year  Economic activity in the agricultural sector has been mixed Corn and soybean producers enjoyed a very good year, but livestock producers found 1995 particularly tough due in part to the high cost of feed grain A growing shortage of corn combined with its high price may force livestock producers to liquidate significant portions of their stock in early 1996, increasing the volatility of meat prices However, there is little evidence as yet that such a liquidation is starting There is a great deal of uncertainty about acreage planning decisions for 1996 since Congress has not yet passed new farm legislation, which is particularly important for that industry  -18-    1/30-31/96  Business loan growth at District banks has started to moderate in line with the general slowdown in fourth-quarter business activity Credit quality generally remains quite good on the commercial side On the consumer side, consumer debt burdens appear to be stabilizing and the rate of increase in consumer loan delinquencies appears to be moderating  Labor markets generally continue to be tight throughout the District, especially in Indiana, Iowa, and parts of Wisconsin Price patterns in the District do not seem to have changed much since our last meeting Reports generally point to little upward pressure on prices In January, the pricing component of the Chicago purchasing managers' survey was 538, down more than 2 points from December  Turning to the national picture, we don't have any serious disagreements with the Greenbook outlook We are still a bit more optimistic on both growth and inflation, but the differences are not large We see the economy expanding near its potential growth rate this year We do seem to be at the mature stage of the expansion, as Governor Yellen mentioned at the last meeting The accelerator effects are dying out now So, while I am sympathetic to the notion that the risks to the outlook are probably concentrated on the down side, I don't see any compelling evidence in the data that would suggest the economy will not grow at its potential rate this year  Mr Chairman, I favor Alternative I When we adopted this alternative on a tentative basis back in July, we indicated that the M2 range was going to serve as a benchmark for the rate of M2 growth that would be expected under conditions of reasonable price stability and historical velocity behavior So, if we repeat that statement or words similar to it, I think we will be communicating honestly to the Congress and telling them what our intention is To do anything else, no matter how articulate you are in explaining our reasons to Congress, Mr Chairman, would be read by others as implying that this Committee is placing more weight on the aggregates in our policy decisions I don't think we are at that point by any means, and I would not want the Congress or the public to think that we are In my view a lot of messages would inadvertently be communicated if we were to change these ranges Clearly, I would favor Alternative I at this point  Mr Chairman, I have been here only a year and five months, but I think we have discussed this question at least four or five times [Laughter] in that period Some of the discussions have been very good, and this one clearly is in that category Al's suggestion has some very attractive aspects to it in my view A number of people have pointed out some implementation problems, potential operational problems, and some measurement issues What are the costs, what are the benefits and, as Gary Stern mentioned, can we really identify what the benefits of increased credibility would be? Given the discussions of the Mack Bill, I think this clearly would be an inappropriate time for us to do anything on this But the bigger question is what do we do over the longer term Like Governor Phillips, I think it would be helpful to have some staff work done to flesh out some of these longer-term issues to see if we can measure in a better way some of the costs and benefits and whether we can get a little more specific about what we are trying to communicate and how that might differ from what we are communicating now We clearly are doing a lot of communicating now Some of it, as President McDonough said, is very useful So, I think it certainly would help us as a Committee to have some focused staff work done on this for our next discussion so that we could understand some of the issues a lot better before we make a decision  Mr Chairman, I would wait It's interesting that the three M's on this side of the table who voted at the last meeting would all come out the other way this time  My reason is that we are forecasting the economy to be at potential output There is a lot of uncertainty A lot of questions are being raised about the short-term outlook, and we have talked about these I don't think anyone knows for sure why the expansion has slowed, whether it is the Federal government shutdown or concern about Bosnia or the weather The business friends that I talk to are all trying to figure out how to operate in this new, low-growth environment I think Governor Phillips mentioned this factor yesterday This is a real problem for people trying to operate businesses today because their environment is so competitive My feeling is that the sogginess we are seeing now in the economy could be a short-term fluctuation that could correct itself I don't see any urgency to move at this point  On the opportunistic strategy issue, obviously some of us view this differently in terms of which side of the opportunistic strategy we are looking at Cathy's presentation was near my view I would view the current situation as an opportunity to make a little further progress toward price stability at this point, since there is some considerable uncertainty now  Finally on the discount rate, I think that Tom Melzer had a very interesting suggestion I remember a footnote in the Bluebook that said there really was no problem in having both the discount rate and the fed funds rate at the same level So, I too would support that idea If we are going to lower the fed funds rate, which it seems we are, the Board should give consideration to that idea  Mr Chairman, I had a question Are you going to share with us the press statement that you will be making?  -62-    1/30-31/96 "
5722,1996-03-26," Mr Chairman, economic activity in the Midwest remains at high levels, with some sectors relatively strong and others showing signs of moderate weakening In general, housing and retail sales continue to perform well; manufacturing is growing slowly; and labor markets remain tight A major concern has been the Dayton brake plant strike against General Motors The strike has had a disproportionately large impact on the Seventh District where half of GM's laid-off assembly workers in the United States are located Moreover, reports have been increasing of related layoffs at District suppliers of auto parts such as engines, transmissions, brake systems, exhaust systems, and electrical systems Steel workers in Wisconsin and Indiana also have been affected First-quarter production has, of course, been depressed by the strike and the layoffs While some of the lost production will be made up now that the strike has been settled, GM will use the strike to reduce inventories of 1996 model cars and may wait for their new 1997 models to rebuild their car stocks For light trucks, GM plants were already running at close to capacity, so it is not clear that light truck production in the second quarter will be much higher than it otherwise would have been The strike does not appear to have affected sales of light vehicles because inventories of most GM car models were above what the industry considers desirable, and we understand that light truck dealers in the District have already sold out their first-quarter allotment Preliminary reports indicate that sales of light vehicles so far this month are running at about a 15 million unit annual pace or a bit better, which implies a 149 or 15 million unit rate for the first quarter, slightly above the latest 12-month moving average  District retailers indicate that sales have improved from the weak results reported for January Sales in February were somewhat stronger than in January but the bounceback was not as noticeable as it appears to have been elsewhere in the nation I would note that the Midwest was hit by bad weather in February rather than January and that was a factor Retailers report that sales so far in March show about the same increases from last year as they had in February Contacts said it was too early to discern any noticeable impact on sales in communities with a large GM presence and actually none was expected Reports indicate that Midwest consumers are less in debt and delinquency rates are generally lower than those in other parts of the country Therefore, consumers are better able to take on additional debt  On balance, it appears that the level of housing activity is still fairly strong in most parts of the District Housing starts in the Midwest fell in February, but that appears primarily to reflect colder-than-usual weather Permits have held up and homebuilders remain optimistic The District does not seem to have an overabundance of either new or existing homes for sale  In labor markets, the issue of job security continues to be a factor mentioned whenever we try to reconcile reports of tight labor markets with continued subdued upward pressure on wages Labor markets remain tight throughout the District, and the unemployment rate in our states is still averaging about 1 full percentage point below the national average Both total and manufacturing payroll employment increased in January, in contrast to what was posted nationally for that month Reports indicate that the use of temporary  -11-    3/26/96  workers by manufacturing firms has picked up since the end of 1995 as well  After taking weather differences into account, it appears that manufacturing activity in the District continues to do better than in the nation as a whole, although less so than in the past as we observe Midwest manufacturing activity converging to the national experience For many of our major durable goods producers, activity has been flattening or edging down from the record or near-record levels of last year Purchasing managers' surveys from Detroit and Milwaukee indicated expanding activity in both January and February However, the Chicago survey moved from indicating expansion in January to contraction in February Confidential information we have received indicates that the Chicago Purchasing Managers' report to be released this Friday, March 29, will show the index increasing from 449 in February to 473 in March, suggesting that manufacturing activity has continued to contract in March but at a somewhat reduced pace The weakness evident in the Chicago report for March does not appear related to the GM strike because relatively few workers were laid off in Illinois and the survey was taken before the strike had gained much momentum  Farmers in the Midwest are gearing for a sizable increase in spring plantings, especially corn Analysts expect combined corn and soybean acreage to be the largest in over a decade, up 7 to 8 percent from last year Crop input prices are up, especially for fertilizers, but supplies are reported to be adequate to accommodate the increased acreage More generally, however, most reports on prices still seem to point to little upward pressure or declines for a broad range of items such as aluminum, copper, paper, steel scrap, and steel mill products The price component of the Chicago Purchasing Managers' survey for March continued on a downward trend and actually indicated declining rather than moderating increases in prices for the second straight month  Turning to the national picture, we do not have any serious disagreements with the Greenbook, although we still are slightly more optimistic on inflation One reason for our marginally greater optimism is that real GDP is estimated to have grown only 14 percent last year Obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding that estimate, but our analysis indicates that the output gap was about nil prior to 1995 and if our estimate of potential output is accurate, some slack has built up in the aggregate economy, which should reduce the likelihood that inflation will accelerate this year  I agree with your recommendation "
5744,1996-05-21," Mike, I want to go back to grain prices One trend of which we are aware is that the percentage of processed food costs that stem from their grain content has come down--quite markedly, actually, over the last twenty years I was wondering whether the econometric models that we use take that into account and also what the sensitivity of food prices is to changes in grain prices  -3-    5/21/96  as we look ahead to this period when the grain price increases are expected to pass through to consumers?  I just wanted to make sure that the econometric model did take into consideration the reduction in the percentage of processed food costs that is accounted for by grain costs  Thank you  Mr Chairman, the available information on the Seventh District economy is consistent with moderate growth in the region In general, manufacturing is still our strongest-performing sector with growth somewhat faster than the national average Housing and retail sales have continued to perform reasonably well despite higher mortgage interest rates and inclement weather Labor markets remain tight with few signs of significant upward pressure on wage rates Our purchasing managers' surveys around the District all signal expanding output in April Durable goods producers generally are less concerned than they were earlier in 1996, although they still expect growth to slow in the second half of this year The Big Three automakers have raised their 1996 light vehicle sales forecasts slightly They also have raised their second-quarter production schedules, mostly to build inventories but also to support slightly stronger-than-expected sales arising from the incentives that they have in place Gross orders for heavy duty trucks in March were strong enough so that some producers have delayed their decisions on major cutbacks to ""build plans"" that had been expected in the first quarter The cutbacks have now been delayed until the scheduled summer plant closings Several other industries reported doing better than they expected earlier this year including producers of machine tools, appliances, and small construction equipment Retailers generally indicate that sales in the District rose moderately in April and early May, although inclement weather this spring slowed sales of some seasonal items, such as lawn and garden merchandise and motor boats Housing activity still appears to be fairly strong in most parts of our District Sales of new and existing homes increased in March, housing starts and permits were up again in April, and recent surveys showed Midwest home builders to be the most optimistic of any in the nation in both April and May District respondents to the senior loan officer survey reported strong increases in mortgage loan demand over the past three months  Labor markets remain tight throughout the District In fact, economic growth in parts of the District, such as Indiana, is    5/21/96  reportedly being restrained currently by labor shortages The unemployment rate in District states is more than a full percentage point below the national average In March, total payrolls increased slightly more rapidly in the District than in the rest of the nation despite the relatively larger drop in manufacturing employment related to the GM strike These workers, of course, are back on the payroll now Despite the tight labor markets, we still have few reports of mounting wage pressures In fact, over the past year, total employment costs increased less in the Midwest than nationally Job security concerns are identified as the key issue that will be emphasized in the upcoming labor negotiations In the steel industry, however, management is now offering a wage increase of about 5 percent over the next three years, while labor unions are asking about 7-1/2 percent Either increase would be the most significant that these unions have had in 10 years but would still average under 2-1/2 percent annually The current labor contract has a no-strike clause with binding arbitration so that the negotiations will be settled without a strike I spoke with a CEO of one steel company He said that he could clearly offset such wage increases with productivity gains  Turning to the agricultural sector, the major story for us has been the surge in grain prices that others have mentioned These higher prices have led to some scaling back in livestock and poultry production With respect to the spring planting season, which is so important, cool temperatures and wet conditions slowed progress considerably in Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin, with Illinois close to average and Iowa well ahead of normal It is still too early for us to know how much food prices will rise That will depend largely on whether the harvest eases or exacerbates the critically tight grain supplies On the other hand, the higher grain prices have accelerated the uptrend in land values and have strengthened the balance sheets of many farmers in our District  More generally, however, most reports still seem to point to little upward pressure on prices Contacts indicate that price increases remain in check both on the input side and the output side Auto industry suppliers report significant pressures to cut prices, and long-term purchase contracts for steel are now renegotiated with smaller price increases However, price components in both the Chicago and Detroit purchasing managers surveys did move from signal- ing a decline in prices of parts in March to an increase in April  Turning to the national picture, we are in general agreement with the Greenbook The outlook is for growth at or above potential for the remainder of this year The key issue, of course, is the outlook for inflation The Greenbook projects that energy and food price increases are likely to push the CPI up a little faster than we would like At the same time, the extent to which the underlying rate of inflation is inching up is still unclear Certainly, the risks of higher inflation are greater today than at the time of our last meeting, and this is a matter of concern  It's a very close call, Mr Chairman I was in the group that did not favor a reduction in January, but I don't necessarily conclude that that means we should reverse that move today I think the risks are clearly on the up side for output relative to potential We all have expressed concerns about the inflation outlook That outlook boils down in my judgment to two things One is food prices and the other is wages and unit labor costs On the food-price side, I think the outlook is uncertain It is not clear how much of the increases in grain prices will be moving forward into food prices I thought the analysis in the Greenbook was particularly helpful in showing that if food prices do increase, they will seep into the overall price level As I think back, my experience in the 1970s is that increases in food prices tend to have a much greater impact on the overall price level than people expect It just seemed then that everything started to go wrong and kept going wrong If food prices do increase, I suspect that we will relive that experience and have more of a problem than people expect That conclusion is not based on any econometric model; it's just based on my personal instincts In fact, our econometric model at the Chicago Bank is slightly more optimistic than the Greenbook on the inflation outlook  I think developments on the wage and unit labor cost side will be extremely important for policy It would be helpful to have more information there, but I am not sure we ever have enough  -38-    5/21/96  information Something obviously different is going on I think there are some faint indications that wages may be rising more rapidly, but as you said, Mr Chairman, we clearly do not have enough evidence to reach a firm conclusion On balance, I come down in favor of no change, but I would prefer an asymmetrical directive  I agree that we have to clarify the difference between a forecast and a goal, and for that reason I agree with Governor Yellen that the further out we go in time, probably the better because I think it will be clearer that we are talking about a goal But Mike Kelley also made the point, which obviously is a very important one, that people set goals in different ways That is one of the things that would come out in a discussion about what assumptions people made when they set the goal, whether it really involved a stretch or whether it was something that they felt was achievable I realize this could be a difficult exercise We have 19 different people coming at it, but I believe we may learn something in the process I think a discussion would be useful "
5769,1996-07-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman Like the Greenbook, we are close to the consensus forecast that sees real GDP growth moderating over the balance of 1996 and into 1997 We, too, see the risks on the up side  Our forecast for auto and light truck sales this year and next is quite similar to that in the Greenbook, and that forecast implies some slowing in sales from the pace we have seen in the first half of 1996 We have not seen much slowing yet Dealer orders remain quite strong Reports from our contacts indicate that light vehicle sales in June were coming in near the average pace of 152 million units recorded in the first five months of this year The final tally will depend on foreign-nameplate sales in the days around month-end  Like the auto industry, other durable goods producers in our District generally have seen somewhat stronger-than-expected demand for their products in the first half of the year, and they have raised their forecasts for the year to reflect this In most cases, however, they still expect sales to soften in the second half of 1996 For example, home appliance shipments rose to a record high in April, a record that was broken in May The industry does not expect this strength to continue, however, and revised forecasts for 1996 are consistent with slower shipments in the second half Other industries projecting weaker shipments in the second half include heavy duty trucks, construction equipment, and machine tools We have already seen production cutbacks in heavy-duty trucks The story for steel is a bit different because there is likely to be some inventory building even if demand slackens in the second half  Reports from District retailers were mixed but generally consistent with some moderation in the growth of consumer spending in June Inclement weather again was cited as a contributing factor Our directors continue to express concern about increases in credit card delinquencies and personal bankruptcies  The level of housing activity is still fairly strong in most parts of the Seventh District, but we are beginning to get reports that higher mortgage interest rates are having an impact Contrary to the national data, permits in the Midwest declined more than starts in May While weather was cited as a contributing factor, District realtors noted a definite slowing in contracts that were signed in May for sales of existing homes These will show up as decreases in existing home sales over the next few months But new home sales continue to be quite strong in some parts of the District, with shortages of homes in the mid-price range being reported  -18-    7/2-3/96  Labor markets remain tight throughout the District The unemployment rate in our states is still about a percentage point below the national average, but we continue to have very few reports of mounting wage pressures Two weeks ago, I met with six chief executive officers of firms and banks based in Wisconsin, where the unemployment rate is now 36 percent Only one of them expected an acceleration of wage increases, and that was for a specialized group of employees working on oil rigs in Louisiana The other five CEOs expected wage and benefit increases for their employees to be about the same in 1996 as in 1995 On the other hand, we have had several recently signed labor contracts for building trade workers in Chicago that feature wage increases averaging 1 to 1-1/2 percent more per year than the contracts that they replaced As I mentioned at the last meeting, wage increases in the steel industry will be higher than those in the contracts they are replacing, and that is now in binding arbitration There also is a definite trend to longer-term collective bargaining agreements, with a number of four-year contracts replacing three-year contracts who comes from  believes that this is an indication that workers are less concerned about inflation now  On the price front, most reports seem to point to little upward pressure on prices Energy prices in the District are expected to continue moderating as supplies of natural gas accumulate Competitive pressures also are keeping District businesses from raising prices, particularly in retailing However, the steel price increase announced for July is expected to stick, as there is very little excess capacity in the steel industry and the order books are full through the third quarter In agriculture, corn stocks obviously remain critically low Record-high prices have not generated the cuts in usage needed to stretch available supplies through to the new crop harvest Pressure on corn prices probably will not ease soon especially if, as seems increasingly likely, temporary shortages occur in the summer prior to harvest  In summary, the Seventh District economy continues to expand, with the pace of growth expected to moderate as we move into the second half of the year Price pressures generally seem contained, although some recent labor contracts have included higher wage increases than the agreements they replaced  Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation and with the way Gary Stern phrased it I think there is a serious risk that increasing the ranges would be misinterpreted, primarily because of what we have done in the past Since we have not changed them in the past under similar circumstances, why would we suddenly want to do so now? Another point is that, after our very important discussion yesterday about longer-term objectives for core inflation, the time to change these ranges, if we are going to do that, is when we have a better idea of what policy we are going to propose in terms of our longer-term objectives on inflation We may want to go to the Congress, as was suggested yesterday, for that type of discussion, and I personally think we should It just seems to me that the appropriate time to change these ranges would be when we have a better idea of what our longer-term objectives on inflation are going to be and how we are going to present that to the American people  Mr Chairman, I think the risks are clearly on the up side, as we all have said The issue is whether the rate of economic growth will slow in the second half of this year I think that it will based on the evidence we have seen The business people with whom I have been in contact also sense that the economy is slowing The question is whether it is going to slow enough to have the effect that we will need Obviously, the people with whom I come into contact are not a random sample You mentioned the issue of inventory accumulation, which I think is very important as we look through the rest of the year The Greenbook assumes that appreciable inventory rebuilding will occur over the second and third quarters and that subsequent inventory accumulation will be relatively modest Of course, that was not the pattern that we saw last year when sizable accumulation continued for a number of quarters If such accumulation does spill over into the fourth quarter, we will not see the second- half deceleration in economic growth that will be necessary So, I support the asymmetrical directive I think it is crucial that we watch carefully I also support having a phone call before making any decision between meetings I think the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony that you are going to be giving is very important at this particular stage of the expansion and policy formulation It would be an excellent opportunity to alert the Congress and the American people to our concerns regarding the risks in the economy at this time  It seems obvious that the original purpose for establishing the swap arrangements is no longer as relevant as it once was I do not think this necessarily means that we should unilaterally dismantle the swap lines They are reciprocal arrangements If our counterparts sense that we no longer have any need for the swap lines, then it might be appropriate to begin the discussions on how best to proceed with disassembling them without unnecessary adverse reactions Mr Chairman, I think your suggestion of the informal discussions that you and the Vice Chairman would have with other central bankers at Basle and elsewhere is a very good initial step In the process as we are thinking this through, we certainly should explore alternative arrangements to see if they are needed to better reflect the current state of the international exchange markets, the role we should play, and whether the swaps are needed at all There are many issues involved, and I agree with Governor Yellen that we should send the staff back to do some more work on this, including the private market aspect that Governor Kelley mentioned I think this should be included in the broader study of  -108-    7/2-3/96  intervention and the types of tools that we would use if intervention is called for in the future I agree with President Boehne that the odds are pretty high that we will be called on to do something sometime in the coming years  On the EMU point, I do not think we should wait to see if EMU becomes a reality before we begin this effort, although we clearly would have an opportunity at that time for implementing any change and adjustments that we need I also think this is an area where close cooperation is going to be needed between the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and other affected central banks and governments It may be, as someone said, that this is more of a political decision than an economic decision in some respects Our independence may be better enhanced if we take a leadership role on this issue rather than just unilaterally terminating these swap arrangements We certainly do not want to add to the concern that the United States is no longer exercising leadership in the international community "
5794,1996-08-20," Just getting back to the potential for a strike, someone in the auto industry described this period to me as the calm before the storm since nothing really happens until later this week when a target is selected The key issue, of course, is outsourcing for General Motors They manufacture a lot more parts themselves, as we all know, and they need to get more flexibility in outsourcing these parts Of course, the selection of the target is important because if GM is not selected, Chrysler will be Chrysler could agree to some provisions that would not hurt Chrysler but would hurt GM in terms of this outsourcing issue because Chrysler does so much outsourcing Compensation increases do not appear to be an issue here The unions already have a cost-of-living escalator in their agreements; no one is really talking about changing that They have profit sharing already The profit sharing agreement for Chrysler workers has paid them very high benefits recently Of course, the last time they negotiated, they won a lump sum payment and there is a high probability they will get that again But that does not go into the base of the compensation  That is a hard act to follow! [Laughter] The Seventh District economy is still operating at very high levels, but it is expanding at a slower pace than in the first half of the year Housing starts and permits increased rather sharply in the Midwest in July and partly made up for weather-related delays that we experienced in June Manufacturing activity in the District continues to be strong and light vehicle production reached an expansion high in July Growth in consumer spending slowed considerably in July, but information from retailers points to some pickup in early August One of our directors said the Olympics had a very real retarding effect on retail sales, especially during the first week He indicated that sales have picked up since the Olympics ended, though the tempo is down from earlier this year While reports were mixed, other retailers generally noted some sales improvement since July Reported auto and light truck sales for July were down sharply from June, but July's 142 million pace exaggerates the degree of slowing in demand for light vehicles for reasons that were discussed in the Greenbook So far in August, our reports suggest that sales have moved up to the 148 to 15 million unit range, assuming no special factors will distort the numbers this month This is consistent with the modest slowing in sales that we have been expecting for the second half of 1996  -15-    8/20/96  On employment conditions more generally, the news is the same Labor markets remain tight in the Seventh District and we continue to experience unemployment rates below the national average Future hiring plans seem robust We have an advance copy of Manpower's latest national survey, which will not be publicly released until next Monday, August 26, that shows stronger fourth-quarter hiring plans relative to a year ago The strength is fairly widespread across industries and across regions of the nation The survey indicates the best holiday job gains seen in 13 years for wholesale and retail employment Recent reports from our contacts continue to show an uptick in wage rates Wages in the paper industry are up 2-1/2 to 3 percent this year compared to 2 to 2-1/2 percent last year Wage settlements in the steel industry are under 3 percent, but these replace contracts with no wage increases at all As discussed in the Greenbook, the upcoming increase in the minimum wage will affect entry-level and near entry-level wages The Greenbook analysis assumes that hourly workers earning over $6 an hour will not be affected However, one major retailer indicated that their employees with wages of $850 an hour would be receiving wage increases as a result of the minimum wage hike So I think the Greenbook is understating the impact for those employees earning over $6 an hour  More generally, on the price front most reports still indicate that inflationary pressures are contained, but we have had some scattered reports of more rapidly rising prices In agriculture, this year's harvest may not significantly ease the tight supplies in grain markets, but very high grain prices are cutting demand from abroad and from domestic users The related cuts in livestock, milk, and poultry production will extend the recent upward pressure on retail food prices well into next year  Turning to the national outlook, our assessment is similar to the Greenbook's with economic growth over the next year and a half returning to a pace near the growth in potential output We expect real GDP growth in the second half of 1996 to be in the range of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent But even this moderation in growth will likely leave the economy's resource utilization at a rate high enough to increase inflation, as Mike Prell and Al Broaddus mentioned in the discussion In other words, aggregate demand will exceed potential output We are already beginning to see some of these resource strains reflected in recent compensation data In addition to the anecdotal reports that I mentioned, second-quarter ECI data suggest rising wage and cost pressures, and I am concerned that the recently favorable trends in benefit costs will not be sustained and that growth in total compensation will increase even further As we discussed last time, the risks to inflation are on the up side I think the information that has become available since our last meeting suggests that these risks remain on the up side and may even be slightly higher than they were six weeks ago  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for a ""B"" asymmetric directive, but as I mentioned in my comments, I am concerned about the labor cost pressures exceeding productivity I also am concerned about the potential for allowing some upcreep in inflation to be built into the economy late this year and in 1997 Of course, waiting makes the September and the November meetings very crucial decision points "
5818,1996-09-24," Mr Chairman, economic conditions in the Seventh District are quite similar to what I reported last time Our regional economy is still operating at a very high level The pace of the expansion has slowed somewhat from the first half of the year, but by less than had been expected The housing sector has held up remarkably well in many areas of the District Housing starts, permits, and home sales in the Midwest were all up sharply in July Housing starts did come down a bit in August, but that retraced only a small part of the 16 percent July surge Manufacturing activity in the District generally remains strong Orders in the second quarter and the early part of the third quarter exceeded expectations in most core industries including light motor vehicles, construction machinery, metal working equipment, appliances, and steel The second half of 1996 is still expected to be softer than the first half for most of these industries, but some of that expected softness seems to have been pushed out a quarter  We have just received the Chicago Purchasing Managers survey for September, which I would caution is confidential until it is released to the public next Monday, September 30 The index will show overall activity expanding at a solid pace of 563 That is slightly slower than the robust pace suggested by the August survey, but the August level was significantly higher than in July The prices-paid component, which has been indicating modest increases, surged in September to 593, and that is its highest level since August of 1995  District retailer reports on sales activity for the first half of September ranged from flat to modest year-over-year gains Sales over the Labor Day weekend were lower than expected, but one major national retailer in our District noted a sharp pickup in the week after Labor Day Auto and light truck sales have been stronger than expected according to our contacts in the industry Sales in the first half of September seemed to be tracking at a 15 to 151 million annual rate This pace is consistent with the Greenbook's upward revised forecast for sales to average 15 million units in the third quarter On the auto negotiations, I do not have much to add; Jerry Jordan already commented on this I would mention that there are, of course, two sets of negotiations going on--those in the United States and those in Canada Our assessment is that there is a much higher probability of a strike by the Canadian GM workers than by the US workers But because of the close relationship between the US and Canadian plants, a strike in Canada, if it occurs, would eventually have a very serious impact on the US economy  On employment conditions generally, the news is still the same Labor markets remain tight in the Seventh District Payroll employment growth, however, has been slower than for the nation, perhaps reflecting some labor supply constraints in our District Similar to what Al Broaddus reported, when our small business and agricultural advisory council met earlier this month, they voiced concern also about the difficulty of finding and keeping qualified workers, and this concern is shared by many in our District It seemed to be most acute for entry-level jobs, particularly in retailing, but construction and factory workers are also reported to  -11-    9/24/96  be harder to find Firms throughout the District have been increasing starting salaries and entry-level wages, often including signing bonuses, and doing more on-the-job training to deal with these labor shortages One manufacturer reported raising its starting wage of $750 an hour to $1000 to attract qualified workers  trucking firm in the United States reported that his firm is now in the process of deciding how to respond to a 33 percent increase in truck driver compensation that was announced by the second largest trucking firm in the industry That increase is scheduled to go into effect in February  More generally on the price front, most firms indicate that it is still extremely difficult to get price increases through despite having to pay higher wages However, we continue to get some scattered reports of rapidly rising prices Building materials prices were reported to be increasing Cement is being rationed and gypsum board is on allocation in some areas Steel prices have increased but are still below a year ago The October price hike may not hold, however, if added capacity comes on stream as expected Trucking firms are imposing a fuel surcharge that translates into about a 2 percent increase in prices paid by their customers  Turning to the national outlook, my assessment has not changed greatly since our last meeting I still expect growth in aggregate demand to slow to a more modest pace late this year or early in 1997 However, I continue to believe that there is a danger that the moderation will have come too late Resource utilization rates are already high enough to suggest gradual acceleration in core inflation, as reflected in the Greenbook after the adjustments for the BLS measurement changes Moreover, growth seems likely to remain relatively strong for another quarter or two, which is likely to exacerbate this situation The recent news on inflation, of course, has been favorable, but I am concerned that this will not continue The further tightening of labor markets revealed by the most recent employment report combined with the anecdotal reports of labor scarcity that we have all heard suggest that we can expect to see wage increases in excess of productivity gains Profit margins may shrink somewhat but ultimately, as Mike Prell said before, more rapid price increases are likely to be the result The risks in the current situation are heavily on the side of increased inflation  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation I was fascinated by your discussion of the productivity trends and the analysis that was done I hope that this will be written up and that you will share it with the members of the Committee I look forward to reading it "
5841,1996-11-13," Mike, I am particularly interested in these methodological changes that BLS is making in the calculation of the CPI You have a table on page 15 of Part I of the Greenbook that shows how these affect the CPI going out through 1998 Could you tell us more about this? I have a couple of questions Is the BLS planning other changes going forward? To what extent have the changes made so far chipped away at the 1/2 to 1-1/2 percent estimate we indicated before in testimony about how much the CPI actually overstates the true underlying inflation rate?  But if it were not for these methodological changes, you would see a gradual updrift in the core rate of CPI inflation?  Mr Chairman, the Seventh District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace It appears that price pressures may have eased somewhat  Overall construction activity remains strong, with recent slowing on the residential side being offset by a pickup in nonresidential activity, both public and private Retail sales improved moderately in both September and October, and the sales gains in the District generally have matched or slightly exceeded the national averages One of our directors characterized the recent pickup as representing steady gains rather than indicating a new trend Sales of apparel and other soft goods have been strong, while sales of big-ticket items such as appliances and, especially, electronic goods have been soft District retailers generally expect a reasonably healthy holiday sales season, and the shorter sales period this year is not expected to be a serious constraint As we had expected, auto and light truck sales recently have been running slightly below a 15-million-unit annual pace October sales were not significantly affected by the various strikes against GM, but November and possibly December sales could be According to GM management, downtime from their new model changeovers presents a significant production challenge in the fourth quarter The new GM-UAW contract    11/13/96  increased compensation costs by just under 5 percent per year and followed a pattern that already had been set with Ford and Chrysler  Manufacturing activity in the District generally remains somewhat stronger than nationally, although conditions vary by industry Purchasing managers' surveys from around our District indicated continued expansion in October at a pace that was somewhat faster than for the nation as a whole We are hearing about strength in the farm equipment industry, while producers of heavy trucks and paper are not reporting improvement Growth in manufacturing employment has slowed in District states, but the number of factory jobs in September was the same as last year This represents a better performance than the rest of the nation  For employment conditions generally, the news is still the same Labor markets remain tight in many parts of the District While we continue to have reports of upward pressure on wages in some sectors, the ECI for the Midwest, like that for the nation, did not indicate a significant acceleration in total compensation costs Confidential information we received from Manpower Incorporated regarding their recent survey indicates that hiring plans for the first quarter of 1997 are slightly more upbeat than normal I would caution everyone that this information will not be publicly released until Monday, November 25  On the price front, most firms continue to report that competitive pressures make raising prices extremely difficult In fact, many of our contacts are quite adamant on this point I get the sense from people I have talked to recently that materials costs are coming down rather than rising Steel prices, for example, are down and supplies have increased, in part because of imports One sign of the impact of imports is that at least two domestic steel companies recently have filed anti-dumping charges under our trade laws  Our latest reports on livestock and crop conditions generally point to larger supplies ahead than were previously expected, and this will result in less upward pressures on retail food prices in 1997 than were previously expected Our latest quarterly survey of agricultural banks indicates that District farmers are in very good financial condition, and we see no signs of ag loan problems in our District  Turning to the national outlook, it seems clear that the long awaited slowing in the growth of aggregate demand has arrived We have no quarrels with the broad outlines of the Greenbook's outlook for 1997, but we expect that real growth and employment gains may be slightly higher in 1997 than the Greenbook forecast I think it is fair to say that the risks to the outlook are more nearly balanced than at our last meeting, but I believe that the upside risks remain more serious The inflation forecasts concern me As the Greenbook notes, the NAIRU may have fallen to 56 percent Still, this is an economy where resource utilization rates are high and slack is limited The outlook is for higher core inflation, as we discussed before, when we adjust for the BLS's methodological changes to the CPI Obviously, there is a good deal of uncertainty about these adjustments in the inflation forecasts, but I think it is important that we avoid getting into the position of validating an incremental upward creep in inflation    11/13/96  Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation for ""B"" asymmetric I think it is important, echoing what some other people have said here, that we not lull ourselves into a sense of complacency If we believe the Greenbook forecast, the core CPI, abstracting from improvements in methodology by the Bureau of Labor Statistics will move up during this forecast period That clearly is not acceptable However, we recognize that there is a lot of uncertainty in the data, and we have not seen signs of compensation increases or of price increases in the latest data The key in terms of the strength of the economy, as you point out Mr Chairman, is the level of consumer spending going forward So, at this point I support the recommendation "
5867,1996-12-17," Mr Chairman, I have a minor suggestion on one of the changes from the preliminary draft of the minutes that we received just last night It's in paragraph 13, and I talked to Mike Prell about this I think that the suggested rewording gives the impression that inflation is projected to come down in a meaningful way, but when we allow for the methodological changes that the BLS is putting into effect, the changed wording may give a somewhat misleading impression This is probably a technical matter that we could work out after the meeting if the Committee is willing to give us that privilege  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Mr Chairman, overall conditions in the Seventh District economy are little changed since our last meeting Our regional economy continues to operate at a high level, with unemployment rates in each of our five states still below the national average and most of our key manufacturing industries producing at or near capacity Although some increase in compensation rates has been reported for selected labor market areas, there does not appear to be any spillover into prices The one major change in the District economy is that the recent evidence shows a definite slowing in housing activity similar to what was reported for the nation earlier Purchasing Manager surveys from around the District still indicate    12/17/96  healthy expansion in the manufacturing sector The December Chicago Purchasing Managers' report, which will not be publicly available until the end of this month, indicates a slight slowing from the November pace, but it is still at 574 percent The supplier deliveries component moved up by 6 percent to 499 percent in December and the prices paid component moved up to 539 percent from 507 percent in November  Retailers generally report that holiday sales have been somewhat better than expected One major national retailer expressed concern that their recent sales have been so strong that they could be borrowing sales from early 1997 Some weakness has been reported in sales of appliances, but that may reflect the housing slowdown more than the holidays  Turning to the steel industry, concern was raised at our last meeting about possible weakness in the early part of 1997, and we have made some special efforts to check with our contacts in the Seventh District They suggest that the demand for steel remains quite strong Order books are full through the first quarter and into the second quarter of next year Mills in the Midwest are reported to be operating at higher levels than elsewhere in the country, likely because of heavy orders from the automobile industry, but our contacts also report strong orders from a broad spectrum of customers The outlook for steel prices is uncertain One contact expects prices to rise early next year as a result of continued firmness in demand but not enough to reach the early 1996 price levels Another indicated that steel prices would remain stable because of increasing imports as well as additional mini-mill capacity coming on stream in 1997 and into 1998  In the automobile industry, light vehicle sales came in at 148 million units in both October and November, and early reports indicate that sales are continuing at about the same pace in December We expect sales in 1997 to decline somewhat from the 15 million units of this year, given the slower economic growth expected next year, fewer price incentives, and a record number of cars coming off lease in 1997 On the production side, we all know that the production of a large number of new models introduced by General Motors has been constrained by strikes Our latest information is that GM model changeovers now are proceeding somewhat better than GM officials had anticipated, but strike-related production losses will not be completely recouped until early next year One problem in making up lost production is the availability of parts for light trucks Several suppliers reported that they will be working over the holidays to catch up on orders, which is unusual for these suppliers  Turning to the national economy, the outlook has not changed much since our last meeting Growth in the economy has decelerated substantially since the first half of the year, and we see output growing at or slightly above potential in 1997, similar to the Greenbook forecast Earlier this month, we hosted our annual economic outlook symposium for business contacts and economists from around the District The consensus of around 30 forecasts submitted for this meeting was for real GDP growth of about 2 percent in 1997 and CPI inflation running a little under 3 percent next year My own view of the risks to our forecast is that they are slightly tilted to the up side The Greenbook forecast for core CPI inflation remains below 3  -13-    12/17/96  percent but only because of the BLS methodological improvements, as Tom Hoenig mentioned At previous meetings, we have talked a lot about the value of low inflation, and although we may have disagreed slightly over the timing and the approach to achieving price stability, I believe that there was broad agreement that we should at least cap inflation at current levels The question is, what are current levels? This is reminiscent of our problem in interpreting the change to a chain-weighted GDP methodology a year ago when we all had to recalibrate our assessment of potential output growth Now, we need to stop thinking about targets like 3 percent for core inflation, if we are to maintain our progress in reducing the core inflation rate I think this will be an issue of increasing importance next year  We did, though they are not located in our District We primarily contacted firms in our District, but we made a special effort to contact and we did not get any sense that there was any slowdown But I think we only asked them about the first quarter, if I recall correctly The firms that I talked to personally were talking about the whole year  Well, we specifically checked because this question had come up at the last meeting, and the word that I got from  that orders for oil-related and tubular steel goods were very strong  Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation for ""B"" asymmetric I think the risks are clearly on the up side  -36-    12/17/96 "
5892,1997-02-04," A question about the timing If you release the minutes at 430 in  the afternoon, isn't that awfully late for the next day's newspapers Don't you want to release  them earlier in the day?  Right, but if we are trying to get more exposure to the minutes as a  document to explain our policy, wouldn't it be better to release them earlier if we could?    2/4-5/97  Thank you, Mr Chairman Overall, 1996 was a very good year for  the Seventh District For most of our key manufacturing industries, shipments exceeded their  early 1996 expectations and housing activity for the year as a whole was much stronger than  anticipated As we move into 1997, expectations are that these sectors will continue to operate at  very high levels, but perhaps not quite as high as last year Specifically, discussions with major  producers in our District indicate that most of them are expecting 1997 sales to post small  declines from 1996 levels These producers include autos, construction equipment, machine  tools, appliances, and steel A major exception is the agricultural equipment industry, which  anticipates a better year than last year Most of our key industries are expecting the first half of  1997 to be stronger than the second half, and current data and anecdotal reports offer very few    2/4-5/97  signs that activity has declined so far Manufacturing activity in the District continued to expand  in early 1997, as indicated by the purchasing managers' reports for Chicago, Detroit, and  Milwaukee There has been some improvement in the heavy truck industry as noted in the  Greenbook  In terms of consumer spending, January looks like a repeat of December The  underlying sales rate for light motor vehicles in January appears to have continued at about the  December pace, although the final aggregate sales number may come in higher for a couple of  reasons Some foreign name plates reportedly are including some December sales in their  January numbers, and those name plates have increased incentives aggressively, aided by the  strengthening of the dollar Reports from retailers have been mixed but suggest on balance that  January post-holiday sales are up from a year ago and about the same as in December For some  retailers that means that January was better than they expected, similar to what Jerry Jordan  mentioned Large District retailers and discount chains entered 1997 with lower inventory  levels than usual, allowing at least some of them to avoid the heavy discounting often associated  with January clearance sales  Labor markets in the District are still very tight Unemployment rates in each of our  five states continue to be below the national average Although there still does not appear to be a  significant spillover into prices, reports of increased pressure on wages have become more  widespread The head of a major temporary help firm indicated to me that he definitely is seeing  wage pressures He expects wages of temporary workers to increase an average of 5 percent this  year in contrast to the 2 to 3 percent gains last year and unchanged wages in 1995  Turning to the national outlook, in December my assessment of 1996 was that GDP  growth in the second half had decelerated from the pace in the first half Even so, I expressed    2/4-5/97  concern that output was still somewhat above potential and, looking forward, that higher  inflation rates were a risk With the fourth-quarter data now available, it appears to me that the  risks are clearly on the upside and they seem higher now than they did in December By the  rules of the game to date, this Committee has focused most of its inflation attention on the CPI  and the core CPI and in the time that I have been here a 3 percent inflation rate was viewed as  progress toward lower inflation With the recent methodological adjustments by BLS, however,  we need to recalibrate that standard now to a lower number, probably about 2-1/2 percent By  this standard the Greenbook outlook for core CPI inflation in 1997 and 1998 has deteriorated  substantially since last month  Mr Chairman, I agree with alternative I If we did change the  ranges, I think that would be interpreted as a change in policy and we really are not making a  change in policy No matter how sophisticated our explanation, I believe it would still be  interpreted as a change in policy  On some of the other topics that have been mentioned here, I do think there are a  couple of topics that it would be useful for us to discuss One, the idea of different measures of  inflation and different targets for inflation using those measures, I would find very useful As I  mentioned yesterday, I am concerned that the CPI and the core CPI are being severely criticized  now as measures We all know there are biases in those measures and in addition BLS is in the  process of making technical adjustments to them All that obfuscates what the real target is I  think looking at a number of different inflation measures would be very useful for this  Committee, and developing our own internal targets on those would be helpful as well At least  we would know within the Committee which direction we wanted to move as a Committee  The second issue that I believe it would be useful for us to discuss is how to get to  price stability We have talked in the past about opportunistic approaches and other types of  approaches That type of discussion has been very helpful because I don't think any of us is  satisfied in staying at the current level of inflation We want to lower inflation, and it is not clear  to me how we are going to accomplish that  Mr Chairman, if we believe the Greenbook forecast, we will see  core inflation accelerate from 26 percent last year to 28 percent this year and to 32 percent next  year If we add in the adjustment for technical changes, the number in 1998 accelerates to 36  percent, which I believe we would all find unacceptable It really comes down to the question, as    2/4-5/97  a number of people have said, of whether we have confidence in this forecast If we believe the  forecast, we should be tightening now, given the lags in monetary policy However, labor costs  and prices have not accelerated as we would have expected on the basis of past experience So,  I think it is understandable that we have some questions about the inflation forecast in the  Greenbook Given the uncertainty, I personally believe that the prudent thing to do is to wait  longer at this point to see if some early signs emerge that inflation is closer to accelerating At  that time I believe we should be prepared to act immediately I am concerned about the inflation  dragon, as you artfully described it, nibbling away at us It involves an insidious buildup of  inflation at 1 percent or 2 percent a year Of course, we have not seen that buildup yet in any of  the core price measures, but it is something that I am very concerned about because once higher  inflation gets built into the structure it may be very difficult to get it out of the structure At this  point, I clearly support ""B"" asymmetric "
5915,1997-03-25," Mike, if you look back at your forecasts of last summer, you  were projecting much lower growth than occurred at the end of 1996 and that you now  anticipate through 1997 When you made your comments this morning, I think you used the  phrase ""entering a boom at this point"" I was just wondering if you could step back and  explain what has happened here Why are you now expecting a boom or ""maybe"" a boom?  What has changed in this period?  Mr Chairman, the Seventh District economy continues to  expand at a modest rate that is somewhat slower than the nation's but its growth is consistent  with a regional economy that is at full resource utilization However, activity in a number of  sectors has been stronger than expected so far in 1997 For example, both the light vehicle  and steel industries have been doing better than anticipated Production of light vehicles and  steel rebounded in the first quarter following declines related to the strike in the fourth  quarter On the demand side, light vehicle sales were stronger than expected in the first  quarter, although the Big Three lost market share to foreign nameplates Orders for steel  have remained strong Incentives have been an important factor supporting light vehicle  sales, which appear to be continuing in March at the higher-than-expected rate of 15-1/4  million units that we saw in January and February In contrast to these price concessions,  several steel producers announced price increases, as Jerry Jordan mentioned before Our  contacts are saying that these increases have about a 50/50 chance of sticking at this point  Steel imports remain high and four new domestic plants will come on stream in the next five  months They will add about 3 to 4 percent to steel capacity in the United States this year  Of course, we do not know if any other plants will be closed as these new plants are  activated Adjusting as best we can for the weather, housing activity seems to have been  slightly stronger than in the nation A large national retailer reported that sales in March  continued in line with recent gains on a year-over-year basis  District labor markets are still very tight The unemployment rate for District  states edged lower in January and averaged 43 percent in early March Initial state  unemployment insurance claims were still running well below a year ago Payroll  employment growth in our District is lagging the nation, and contacts indicate that labor    3/25/97  shortages are constraining both employment and output growth Our small business, labor,  and agricultural advisory council met last Friday, and the members almost unanimously  reaffirmed the difficulty of finding qualified workers A representative of the temporary help  industry mentioned that computer programmers are in extremely short supply, and  programmers who know any of the older languages such as COBOL that are needed to deal  with the year 2000 conversion problem are receiving significant premiums of up to 50  percent over what programmers would normally be getting In addition to the usual reasons  cited as to why wages more generally have not accelerated significantly, a representative of  the United Automobile Workers noted that dramatic increases in gain sharing, tied to either  productivity or profits, were significant for her union negotiations  Turning to agriculture, Taiwan recently announced that they were halting all pork  exports because of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease Some 17 percent of all pork  consumed in Japan is imported from Taiwan, and US exporters are now expected to fill a  large share of this gap US hog prices have increased sharply since the Taiwan  announcement of the ban last week, and with little or no growth projected in US pork  production, this is likely to put more pressure on meat prices this year  We have received an advance copy of the Chicago Purchasing Manager's survey  for March, which is confidential until it is released next Monday, March 31 The overall  index for our area shows a slight acceleration in the rate of expansion, up from 562 in  February to 575 in March, with new orders and production both rising more rapidly The  inflation measures were mixed; the prices-paid component moved further above 50, while the  supplier-deliveries component dropped sharply to below 50    3/25/97  Turning to the national outlook, our assessment of the economy has changed  somewhat since the February meeting We still anticipate that real growth will decelerate  somewhat by the second half of this year to a pace slightly above trend or at trend But we  no longer believe that current conditions in the economy are such as to guarantee that  deceleration Our growth forecast is now conditioned on a higher funds rate path than it was  in February We continue to see a risk that demand pressures will outstrip the growth of  productive capacity The strength of demand has been surprising most of us since at least  last summer Given the maturity of the expansion, one would not expect demand to be  growing so quickly without some stimulus It is, of course, difficult to know for sure, but  that stimulus may stem from a monetary policy that is more expansionary than we had  thought After all, given what we know about the lags associated with monetary policy, the  timing of the pickup in demand corresponds roughly to the expected effects of the actions  that we took a little over a year ago Those actions made sense at the time as insurance  against what might have been an overly weak trend in demand, but clearly conditions have  changed and weak demand is no longer a concern  Finally, on the puzzle of why we have not yet seen appreciable wage or price  pressures, I believe the Chairman's discussion of worker insecurity provides a useful insight  As job insecurity, rising labor force participation rates, and other temporary damping forces  wane, the balance of risks tilts more clearly to the upside In sum, I agree with the overall  picture of the economy depicted in the Greenbook  Mr Chairman, as we all have said, we need to be  forward-looking in our policy, and I think a rate of inflation as high as the forecast we have  seen today is clearly unacceptable Just looking at the Greenbook forecast of a core inflation  rate of 32 percent by 1998, that rate would increase to 36 percent if we added back the BLS  methodological changes Although this forecast has not changed since our last meeting, I    3/25/97  think we are more confident about the forecast today than we were then because of the  persisting strength in the economy and because of other changes in the forecast, as Larry  Meyer pointed out in his comments Therefore, I clearly support your recommendation for  the 25 basis point increase, and I prefer 25 basis points to 50 basis points for the reasons that  you explained I would prefer an asymmetrical directive, but I do not feel strongly enough  about it to dissent on that issue "
5937,1997-05-20," Mr Chairman, the Seventh District economy continues to  expand at a modest rate, and abstracting from the effects of the strike in the automobile  industry, our manufacturing sector still seems to be outperforming the nation Our labor  markets are still very tight The unemployment rate for District states has moved down  again; it was 41 percent in both February and March Payroll employment growth in our  states continues to lag the nation, but many contacts regard this as a labor supply problem  Despite the tight labor markets, we still have not seen much upward pressure on wages, and  District manufacturers and retailers continue to report that competitive pressures inhibit their  ability to raise prices There was an article in this morning's Washington Post about  Milwaukee, Wisconsin that described this phenomenon in great detail It is a phenomenon  that I hear mentioned almost every time I speak to someone in the manufacturing industry  Another indication is that steel price increases of 3 to 5 percent announced for April and May  are not sticking and in some cases are now being publicly rescinded  It is clear from the published data and from our anecdotal information that the  economy in the United States and the Seventh District has slowed from its rapid first-quarter  pace As Bob Parry mentioned before, the key question is the extent of the slowdown and    5/20/97  whether it is sufficient to return the economy to a path of sustainable growth without an  acceleration in inflation  Since we all have seen the published statistics in the Greenbook, let me focus on  some of the anecdotes First, with regard to signs of slower growth in business activity,  retailers generally report that sales were sluggish last month One large national retailer  attributed the noticeable slowing in part to poor weather, and preliminary results from our  survey of Michigan retailers show a moderating sales performance last month and some  inventory buildup As we all know, light vehicle sales in April were well below the  first-quarter level Our contacts report that sales so far this month have been somewhat  stronger than in April but still below the sales pace expected for all of 1997 In the paper  industry, we had reports of slowing in corrugated paper shipments as well as in heavy paper  production A very large telephone company in our area reported a slowdown in the number  of lines installed in small businesses and homes during March and April This is a markedly  different pattern from that of the last two years, and our contacts believe it reflects an  industry-wide slowdown rather than a loss of market share  On the other hand, we also have had reports of strength from a number of our  industry contacts Heavy trucks continue on a strong recovery path from last year's  depressed levels The uptrend in sales and production of farm machinery equipment also is  continuing One national specialty realtor told us that land prices and rental costs for retail  stores, both freestanding and in malls, are moving up rapidly This is similar to some of the  other comments made here today about real estate Contacts at one large airline in our  District reported very strong business, with forward bookings through the summer setting  records for both business and vacation travel, and they believe that the forward bookings at    5/20/97  other airlines are also very strong Next Tuesday, May 27, Manpower Inc will publicly  release the results from its Quarterly Employment Outlook survey; this information is  confidential until May 27 They will report third-quarter hiring intentions in all regions of  the nation, particularly in the Midwest, as the strongest since the boom years of 1988 and  1989 The chairman of Manpower believes that part of the demand is for seasonal workers,  but some of the hiring plans are for jobs that firms have not been able to fill because of  widespread labor shortages So, the anecdotes and the published data paint a mixed picture  of the expected extent of the slowdown in the expansion and the inflation outlook  It is clear that the first-quarter growth rate is unsustainable, but we do not know  whether inflation will continue to be restrained by the temporary damping factors that we  have discussed for some time If growth fails to moderate sufficiently just as these  restraining factors lose their punch, we run the risk of opening up a sizable output gap with  its attendant inflationary consequences As additional data for the second quarter roll in, I  think we must be on the lookout for the moderation needed to avoid accelerating inflation in  the months ahead I am concerned that imbalances may emerge later this year, so I still see  the risk as being on the upside  Mr Chairman, our outlook for the economy in 1997 is very  similar to the Greenbook forecast, but we are a little more optimistic on inflation However,  we are assuming a slightly higher federal funds rate through the end of the year than does the  Greenbook in its baseline forecast I am very pleased that you raised the productivity point  today because it is something that we have been talking about at our Bank, and I think it  deserves a great deal more attention If we look at the productivity improvement in the first  quarter, which we did not talk very much about today, and if that is not the result of a  structural change as you are suggesting in your hypothesis, it follows that the current high  output levels are being achieved at very high resource utilization rates Obviously, in this  situation we will have an output gap that will open up further, and inflation almost certainly  will accelerate I very much hope that a structural change is occurring as you are  hypothesizing Any additional data or information that we can gather to get a better  understanding of this will be of great help to us in our formulation of monetary policy But  regardless of whether this is a structural change or not, I think the risks clearly are on the  upside, as we have all mentioned We have to keep in mind the uncertainty that is caused by  the methodological changes that are now being made in the consumer price index We have    5/20/97  to keep adjusting our thinking to these slight methodological improvements of 1 percent a  year that we are getting in measured inflation  Although I, too, see a need for further tightening this year, I can accept your  recommendation today for the ""B"" asymmetric directive I do want to add one point, though  You will recall that at the March meeting we adopted a symmetric directive that will become  public information on Thursday of this week I think it is going to be important in your  speeches and comments in the coming weeks and months that you once again prepare the  market for what you said was a high probability of a tightening move--you indicated a 50/50  probability for July and a very high probability for August--because I think there is likely to  be some confusion when that symmetric directive becomes public knowledge later this week  I think you carried out this educational effort very effectively earlier in the year, and I am  sure you can do it equally effectively now "
5958,1997-07-01," Mr Chairman, economic conditions in the Midwest remain quite  similar to those I reported at the May meeting Our regional economy is still expanding at a  modest rate, and District manufacturers and retailers continue to report that competitive  pressures inhibit their ability to raise prices Our manufacturing sector is still operating at very  high levels The Chicago Purchasing Managers' Survey results, released on Monday, showed a  sharp increase in the composite index to 615 in June from 568 in May, indicative of a pickup in  the rate of expansion in the manufacturing sector Contacts report strong activity in a number of  industries including steel, heavy trucks, cement, gypsum board, and agricultural and other heavy  equipment However, a large national paper manufacturer headquartered in the District reported  slow growth in shipments of containerboard and noted that they are reducing capacity by  temporarily closing two plants  In terms of consumer spending trends, retailers indicated that the sales slowdown  evident in April and May continued through much of June However, sales improved  significantly in the latter part of June when warm weather finally arrived To illustrate the  adverse impact of the cold weather, one very large national retailer headquartered in our District  noted that on a year-to-date basis, unit sales of air conditioners were down 38 percent compared  to last year This retailer also reported that sales of white goods were flat year-to-date; they are  now taking a more conservative approach to the second half of the year Contacts in the trucking  industry reported that shipments of new merchandise to retailers nationwide had slowed from the  first quarter This probably indicates attempts by retailers to keep inventories in line with the  slower sales pace Information from the auto industry suggests that reports on light vehicle sales    7/1-2/97  to be released this week probably will show June sales at an annual rate of around 148 or 149  million units, which would be consistent with what is implied in the Greenbook forecast  Our labor markets are still very tight The unemployment rate for District states was  41 percent in April for the third straight month and then fell to 38 percent in May Despite tight  labor markets, we still have not seen much upward pressure on wages, although reports are  mixed Contacts at one large national retailer said they still are not having difficulty attracting  workers, and a recent labor settlement with the UAW calls for a 50 percent reduction in wages  and benefits for new hires at a foundry, resulting in a two-tier wage structure In contrast,  another retail chain increased wages 10 percent and is still having trouble getting workers A  large phone company is seeing upward pressure on wages, particularly for marketing and  managerial people In the trucking industry, one firm's 33 percent increase in truck driver wages  that went into effect in February of this year was not enough to attract as many drivers as they  needed, so they have started advertising for drivers Other trucking firms have raised wages  considerably, with the increase in the industry being about 10 to 15 percent  Turning to the national outlook, since we met in May new data have confirmed our  view that growth slowed considerably in the second quarter from its first-quarter pace Further,  we have had more good news on the price front, as the CPI rose only 1 percent in May  However, if anything, labor markets now appear tighter than we previously anticipated, and we  currently have a positive output gap Our forecast of growth near trend over the next few  quarters will only maintain the gap and not shrink it Consequently, we see a significant risk that  the economy is operating beyond its long-term potential and that underlying inflationary  pressures will worsen gradually over the next few quarters, though these pressures may be    7/1-2/97  masked somewhat by the favorable developments in food and energy prices and by continued  BLS implementation of methodological improvements in the CPI Furthermore, though we and  the public may have been pleased with keeping inflation at or under 3 percent in the last few  years, we must ratchet down this threshold to about 2-1/2 percent now just to keep up with the  BLS changes that remove, little by little, some of the measurement bias in the CPI  With the new benchmark in mind, I find the Chicago Bank forecast for inflation and  the Greenbook forecast as well quite troubling both in terms of the projected levels of inflation  and the upward tilt to its future path We all know that a gradual acceleration of inflation is  difficult to detect in real time and that any actions we take today will not affect inflation in the  short run But we also know that an inflation rate that is gradually, even gently, moving up is not  moving us any closer to anyone's definition of price stability The risks in our forecast and in  the Greenbook as well clearly are tilted toward the upside  Mr Chairman, I also thought that the paper was very well done It  is a good step forward in addressing this issue, which is the type of longer-term issue that is  important for this Committee to review from time to time I was intrigued by Ed Boehne's  suggestion of considering a basket of measures at least as one option I was coming at it in a  slightly different way If we are going to choose one measure, I have a slight preference for  continuing our focus on the consumer price index If we are to have a basket of measures, I  would say that the CPI has to be in that basket    7/1-2/97  My preference for the CPI stems not so much from any technical  superiority of that measure but from its familiarity to the public Of all the inflation measures, it  has received the most attention If we were to switch the focus from the CPI to one other single  measure, I think we would risk causing a lot of confusion and divert energy away from more  productive efforts to educate the public on the importance of price stability But as others have  noted, it doesn't matter too much, according to the memo, which broad index we choose if we  are to choose one The reason is that if we stabilize one inflation rate, we tend to stabilize them  all And no matter which index is chosen, the simulations suggest that economic performance  would be enhanced So, the important thing is that we choose some index or basket of indices  and then stick to the goals of first capping inflation and then moving inflation rates down until  we achieve price stability, however we define the latter  Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation As I understand  it, we would describe the money ranges as we did last time, namely as benchmarks for what we  would normally expect under conditions of reasonable price stability and historic velocity  behavior  With regard to the discussion you were having with Al Broaddus, a few of us were  talking about the same issue before the meeting I think the sense of our discussion was to agree  completely with exactly how you phrased the need to communicate the basis for our monetary  policy actions, namely by saying that our objective is to encourage continued recovery, sustained  economic growth, and further increases in employment I realize that this is a very difficult and  complex public relations issue, as you said, but I think that is the right track to go on  I agree with everything you have just said I believe that we need to  spend more time thinking about how we can best communicate that message  I would very much like to clear up the difficult wording, but I would  suggest taking the preamble portion that applies to the second sentence and have it apply to both  sentences with the alternate wording  Mr Chairman, I think the economy is operating beyond its potential  and that we will have to increase interest rates eventually But I also agree that we do not see  any early evidence, certainly no credible evidence, of wage and price acceleration at this point  So, I agree that we should wait for now  Gary Stern stated his concern that we may not be willing to act promptly to address  early signs of rising inflation I certainly hope that we will be willing to act promptly and  preemptively as we did earlier this year My concern is that we are going to start to see a little  inching up of inflation--a tenth here, a tenth there, no really large increases The methodological  changes that the BLS is introducing are going to make it more difficult for people outside to  detect this inching up of inflation, and there will be a lot of pressure for us not to take any action  in those circumstances There may be some reluctance on our part to act as well That is    7/1-2/97  something we have to be very careful about and very concerned about, but for now I agree with  your recommendation of a ""B"" asymmetric directive "
5984,1997-08-19," Mike, I want to ask you about spending for durable equipment,  particularly for technologically oriented durable equipment The Greenbook says that this sector  has become less cyclical, and I have two questions about this One, I assume you mean it has  become less cyclical since the last recession And, second, I was wondering what the implications  are for overall durable equipment spending Does the growth of this category mean that durable  equipment spending is becoming less cyclical more generally?  Thank you, Mr Chairman Our regional economy continues to  expand at a modest rate, though growth in the District seems to be slower than that for the nation  due in part to labor supply constraints As I have been reporting for some time, our labor markets    8/19/97  are very tight, with lower unemployment rates and higher employment-to-population ratios than the  nation's In fact, last year the employment-to-population ratio for our five states averaged 3  percentage points above the nation's 632 percent, and over 70 percent of the working age  population was employed in Iowa and Wisconsin Nonetheless, the employment cost index for the  Midwest has not risen appreciably faster than the nation's, although we have received numerous  anecdotal reports of intensifying wage pressures for entry-level and certain skilled workers Next  Monday, August 25, Manpower will release its latest survey on hiring intentions, so this  information should be treated as confidential until then The survey indicates that the demand for  workers continues to be very strong In fact, the results show the highest fourth-quarter hiring  intentions since 1978, both nationally and in the Midwest  Manufacturing activity in the District continues to expand at a slower pace than in the  nation Strong activity continues to be reported in industries such as cement, gypsum board,  medium- and heavy-duty trucks, agricultural and other heavy equipment, and steel However, there  are a few hints that business is slowing in some industries, though all of my contacts believe that  the slowing is temporary For example, noted that for the first time in several  years there was some softening in demand at his firm's steel distribution subsidiary that caters to  small manufacturers Another contact reported slower growth in orders for a variety of products  including food equipment for restaurants, hotels, and supermarkets as well as for decorative  ceramic tiles in the construction industry in the trucking industry described  activity as slower than normal for this time of year, but he said his customers expect business to  improve significantly in the fall  Manufacturers and retailers in our District continue to report that competitive pressures  inhibit their ability to raise prices One report to the contrary relates to our discussion at the last    8/19/97  meeting when I indicated that a large paper company was reducing capacity by temporarily closing  two plants In July, that company pushed through its first price increase since 1995, which other  firms in the industry followed in August The firm referred to this increase as ""price restoration,""  and it emphasized that the increase still left prices 30 percent below their peak in 1995  In terms of consumer spending trends, retailers indicated that sales over the past month  or so were generally at or slightly above expectations, helped in part by more seasonable weather  and the use of promotions in some cases Incentives apparently also contributed to the sizable  pickup in auto and light truck sales last month Reports suggest that light vehicle sales got off to a  good start in August, although probably not as strong as in July Part of the recent sales strength  may be due to a change in end-of-model-year allowance policies at General Motors Credits to  dealers are now targeted to slow-selling models rather than across the board, and they were initiated  in July of this year rather than October, which had been GM's traditional policy  Turning to the national outlook, our forecasts of real growth and inflation have both  come down a bit since our last meeting However, the big question is still whether we will see the  increase in inflation that most of us are forecasting for 1998 Labor market conditions suggest that  we may Of course, labor markets have been tight for some years now without a major pickup in  labor costs or inflation, but they have become even tighter in the past few quarters Moreover, the  fundamentals appear to be in place for continuing real growth at trend rates at least Consequently,  the labor markets should remain tight for the foreseeable future Fortunately, we have had a great  deal of investment in recent years, and the resulting increase in productive capacity should at least  lessen inflationary pressures We may also be entering an era of significantly faster productivity  growth; I guess that is part of the new paradigm But the most recent official statistics do not  provide much evidence of this Moreover, even if the data become more favorable, it will take    8/19/97  quite some time before we know with any certainty whether the economy has changed in such a  fundamental way Thus, given our current understanding of the economy's growth potential, the  most reasonable forecast is one of rising inflation Of course, the upward tilt to the inflation  forecast is relatively modest, but in my view the risks are still clearly on the upside  Mr Chairman, I accept your recommendation I was very interested in  your analysis of inventories, and I hope you will distribute your comments to the Committee so we  can look at it more carefully "
6007,1997-09-30," I think you answered my question in part, Mike It also relates to the  Greenbook assumptions of a one hundred basis point tightening in 1998 and a 20 percent stock  market correction My specific question was whether you are assuming that same stock market  correction in the ""no change"" scenario More generally, is the stock market correction independent  of the course of monetary policy?  Thank you  Thank you, Mr Chairman Economic conditions in the Seventh  District are quite similar to those on which I reported at our August meeting Our regional    9/30/97  economy continues to expand at a moderate rate that is slower than the nation's, in part due to labor  supply constraints  I met with our Advisory Councils on Agriculture, Labor, and Small Business a couple of  weeks ago The primary focus of discussion in all three groups was labor market conditions  Indeed, for small businesses, labor has become the limiting factor rather than capital, which seems  to be quite plentiful at least according to these people The general sense was that labor markets  had tightened further since these advisory councils previously met last spring, and that is consistent  with the fact that our region's unemployment rate fell below 4 percent and stayed below 4 percent  during this period These tighter conditions seem to be leading to some increases in the growth of  base pay But with a few exceptions, the increases are quite modest and on the order of 2 to 3  percent higher than a year ago More striking are the other measures that firms are taking to secure  qualified labor These include signing bonuses for new employees and staying bonuses for existing  ones These forms of compensation do not show up in the ECI, and they appear to be ever more  common Small businesses are offering more flexible hours, customized benefits, and perks like  tickets to sporting events At the same time, the trend toward greater use of variable pay seems to  have accelerated Even some UAW assembly workers now have their pay tied to productivity  targets Firms seem increasingly willing to move jobs to areas where labor is not as scarce The  most extreme example mentioned at this meeting involved telemarketing firms, which seem to be  able to locate in areas with relatively high unemployment A new facility in such an area can begin  its operations within a month Tight labor markets also are encouraging, and in some cases forcing,  firms to spend more on worker training Similarly, apprenticeship programs are being revitalized in  the building trades and elsewhere Finally, council members reported that conditions remain  favorable for moving people from welfare to work Even here, the constraint appears to be mainly    9/30/97  on the side of the labor supply The individuals who have difficulty moving from welfare to the  workforce often cannot pass a drug test or are not familiar with the mores of the workplace  As I reported before, District manufacturers and retailers continue to tell us that  competitive pressures inhibit their ability to raise prices, although there have been some exceptions  For example, at our last meeting I reported on a large paper company that had pushed through its  first price increase since 1995 That increase has held for the entire industry, and the firm is  planning other price increases this fall Prices of heavy and corrugated paper are up, and there is  talk that newsprint will soon be on allocation Overall, manufacturing activity continues to increase  in the District, although at a slower pace than in the nation Results from the Chicago Purchasing  Managers' Survey were released this morning, and the composite index moved lower, to 612 in  September from 643 in August, a sign that activity continues to increase at a healthy pace but more  slowly than in August The prices-paid component was 59 and the supplier-deliveries component  came in at 581, both above 50 but below their August readings At our August meeting, I  mentioned that there were some hints of slowing in the steel distribution and trucking industries,  which contacts thought might be temporary That seems to have been the case as these contacts  now report that activity has returned to high levels  In terms of consumer spending trends, reports generally point to continued strength in  August and September Our survey showed that August was the best sales month so far this year  for most Michigan retailers Across the District as well as nationally, discounters are now  experiencing strong sales performances, while the high-end or luxury segment is noticeably  sluggish This represents a reversal from the pattern that we saw earlier this year At one large  national retailer headquartered in the District, sales of appliances and home electronics have  increased considerably in recent weeks while sales of apparel have moderated Auto and light truck    9/30/97  sales have been boosted by targeted incentives and the unbundling of option items September  sales will not be quite as strong as the 15-1/2 million unit pace of July and August, but even with  the shortened reporting period, our automobile industry contacts believe September sales will be  higher than the level implied in the Greenbook  Turning to the national outlook, I was slightly optimistic at our August meeting that the  fundamentals were in place for future real growth at trend rates, but the new paradigm dilemma is  now about as large as it gets Second-quarter real GDP growth is substantially higher, while the  inflation data continue to roll in lower than expected The burst of investment in potentially  productivity-enhancing capital equipment is encouraging Nevertheless, although my inflation  outlook has moved lower since the August meeting, it still has a somewhat steeper upward tilt than  the Greenbook On balance, I continue to view the risk to the outlook as being on the upside  I agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman I do think that the  probability is higher that we will have to move in November than I thought it was, say, four or so  weeks ago I agree with President McDonough that it is very important for us to alert the American  people to our thinking I know this is a delicate matter because we are waiting for data to come in  during the next several weeks before we know for sure what the probabilities are going to be But I  do think it is important that you lay the groundwork for any move that you anticipate the  Committee would want to make in the future  I thought you were very effective in sending a message earlier this  year    9/30/97 "
6030,1997-11-12," Mike, in the corporate profit area, I wonder if you could elaborate a  bit on the basis for the Greenbook's assumption that corporate profit growth slows so  significantly by early 1998 The labor costs do not seem to accelerate dramatically in this  period, and, of course, if profits come in higher than you anticipate in 1998 and 1999, that could  lead to higher spending on business fixed investment  Thank you  Mr Chairman, the economic conditions in the Seventh District are  quite similar to what I have been reporting for several meetings Our regional economy  continues to operate at very high levels, but it is expanding at a slower rate than the nation Our  housing and manufacturing sectors are prime examples of this  As I have noted before, labor supply constraints seem to be trimming growth in our  region Labor markets remain very tight The unemployment rate in District states has been  below 4 percent since May One of our directors noted that his firm is paying bonuses to retain  computer-related staff, and salary increases of one-third for these skills are not uncommon now  Many retailers express concern about not having enough staffing for the holiday shopping  season Moreover, based on the unpublished results from the latest Manpower employment  survey, labor demand continues to be quite robust Hiring plans are the strongest for any first  quarter since 1989, with hiring intentions remaining uniformly high in all geographic regions of  the nation This survey is not going to be made public until Monday, November 24, so this  information is confidential until then For some time, I have reported that wage rates in the  Midwest had not risen appreciably faster than in the rest of the nation despite our having the  tightest labor markets in the country However, the latest ECI data show that over the past year,  total compensation costs as well as the wage and salary component were up considerably more in  the Midwest than in any other region in the country    11/12/97 56  In terms of consumer spending trends, retailers report that sales improved over the  month of October as the weather got cooler Reports were mixed concerning whether there has  been any impact from the recent stock market volatility For example, a very large retailer and  one of the Big Three automakers reported that sales actually improved in the last week of  October Another of the Big Three showed no noticeable impact In contrast, the last of the Big  Three attributed a sales decline to the stock market So, on this question, reports of the Big  Three clearly are mixed  Competition in the auto industry is described as brutal, and at least one major  automaker, General Motors, will be doing more discounting in the near term You will recall  that GM starting offering end-of-model-year discounts in July this year rather than in the usual  October time frame This, in our view, was the major reason that GM's October sales were weak  rather than any serious problems associated with Union Pacific People we talk to at GM and  other companies generally said that while the Union Pacific situation posed some temporary  difficulties, it was not having a significant impact on deliveries or sales The trucking industry is  seeing very strong demand, and it is not just a result of the Union Pacific problems, as strength is  apparent in areas of the nation not served by the railroad  The steel industry also faces strong demand, but with new capacity having come on  stream, prices for a wide variety of steel products are expected to drop next year On the other  hand, prices for corrugated and paper products have been increasing and further increases are  expected in November  Turning to the national outlook, despite a good deal of financial market uncertainty,  the economic situation has not changed greatly since our last meeting The news on inflation    11/12/97 57  continues to be good, but the long-awaited slowing in aggregate demand seems to be yet further  out on the horizon Even factoring in a larger trade deficit due to the recent events in Southeast  Asia, our forecast sees above-potential growth this quarter and out into 1998 The most recent  data suggest that labor demand continues to grow more rapidly than the working-age population  and that the increase in participation rates has at least temporarily ended Thus, the tightening in  labor markets that occurred early this year may be further intensified Perhaps the investment  boom has increased our productive capacity enough to avoid a buildup in inflationary pressures,  but still the resource utilization numbers suggest that the increase in demand may have exceeded  the growth in capacity  On balance, I feel that the risks have increased and are still on the upside There is  one other recent event relevant to our economy that I want to mention That is the defeat--or I  guess more accurately the withdrawal--of the fast track trade legislation several days ago Short  term, that prevents the United States from negotiating free trade agreements with Chile, other  Latin American countries, and the APEC nations Longer term, it will inhibit our nation's  progress in expanding trade, which we all know increases our standard of living My overriding  concern is that the United States has been a leader throughout the world in multi and bilateral  negotiations to open markets and expand trade, and we are now taking a major step backward I  understand that there is some chance that the fast track legislation will be reintroduced next year,  possibly in a more limited form But 1998 is an election year, which poses another set of  difficulties in getting this type of legislation enacted Thank you, Mr Chairman  Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation, but I would add  that were it not for the financial volatility stemming from events in Southeast Asia, I think we  would be much more likely to act today based on developments in the real economy "
6054,1997-12-16," I was going to ask Al's question, but I will ask a follow-up Is there  a better case?  When you say it is not symmetrical, do you mean the better case has  a lower probability?    12/16/97  Mr Chairman, economic conditions in the Seventh District are quite  similar for the most part to what I reported at our last meeting, but the Asian situation has left a  sense of greater uncertainty about the outlook In terms of consumer spending, retailers have  used the terms ""sluggish"" and ""soft"" to describe recent sales trends That may be partly due to  what has become a bimodal holiday sales season, with sales relatively stronger around Thanks-  giving and the week before Christmas but weaker in-between While it is possible that we will  see the same pattern this year, at least one large retailer in our District has trimmed expectations  for industry sales from a rise of 4 to 7 percent to one of 2 to 3 percent  Light vehicle sales this month seem to be tracking around the 15 million unit rate  according to our contact at the Big Three who also noted that incentives are a very important  factor in maintaining sales at this level Overall manufacturing output in the District has been  expanding at about the same pace as in the nation, but trends are mixed across industries  Demand for heavy trucks has been very strong, with order books filled through the middle of  next year One truck manufacturer believes that there has been some double ordering, although  cancellation rates have been low thus far A number of District industries including steel,  cement, gypsum board, container board, and housing have not experienced as much strength as  seen nationally  In terms of any impact from the Southeast Asian situation, it is still too soon to know  all the direct effects on the region, let alone the indirect effects On the export side, the Seventh  District is likely to be directly affected less than the nation as a whole because the Southeast  Asian countries account for a smaller share of our export markets, a flip side of the situation in  the Twelfth District that Bob Parry was describing Contacts in the food equipment, paper, and    12/16/97 27  plastic laminate industries already have seen some reduction in export orders to Asia, but they  also note that business has been good in Europe Depreciating foreign currencies and slow  economic growth in several Asian markets may account for part of the sluggishness in our corn  exports, but an increased supply from China, Eastern Europe, and the former Soviet Union may  be a more critical factor there  On the other side of the trade equation, auto and steel imports could rise as Asian  producers attempt to find replacement markets in the United States for their products, and that  would affect our region relatively more than the United States as a whole One of our directors  in the steel industry believes that steel imports will surge and that the quality of selected  categories of imports will be quite high relative to the more common imports from Eastern  Europe Steel and auto industry contacts said that they were moving ahead with plans to  accelerate their cost-cutting measures substantially over the next year, perhaps spurred in part by  prospects of more intense import competition As I have been reporting for some time now,  labor markets are very tight in our District, with the unemployment rate at or below 4 percent  since May, and we continue to hear many anecdotes of various ways that firms are dealing with  worker shortages  Turning to the national outlook, my view at the last several meetings has been similar  to that expressed in past Greenbooks GDP growth and inflation could only be contained by  policy tightening in 1998 The question now is whether the deteriorating international situation  will have the major consequences for the US economy that the current Greenbook envisions  Of course it could, but I don't see the balance of risks pointing in that direction Considering the  strength of the underlying domestic economy, we tend to think that real GDP growth in 1998    12/16/97 28  will be closer to 2-1/2 percent than to the 17 percent rate in the Greenbook Our figure factors  in a substantial degree of pessimism based on the Asian crisis Net exports subtract about 07  percentage point from 1998 GDP growth in our projection Combined with some further  collateral effects on US financial markets, this takes us to the 2-1/2 percent forecast This is not  a worse case scenario; it is our best guess given the information to date Regarding prices, I, too,  am concerned that the favorable inflation shocks that we anticipate from the international  situation in 1998 will be transitory and their reversal will have to be addressed later at a time  when action will be more difficult In summary, I see the upside risks for 1998 to be  substantially greater than the Greenbook portrays  Mr Chairman, the economy is quite strong currently, but I believe  the situation in Asia is likely to be a key restraining factor going forward I agree that no one  knows for sure exactly how severe the Asian problems will be and how they will play out In his  comments, Ted Truman did not rule out the possibility of a better case It was not the best  possible case, but it was a better case So, there is another side to this in that adverse    12/16/97 80  developments in Asia may not be as severe as we now tend to anticipate I agree that we should  be cautious until more of the uncertainty is resolved While I do not favor changing policy at  this time, I do think that the risks are tilted to the upside So, I would personally favor retaining  the asymmetric directive, Mr Chairman, although I could live with your recommendation for  going back to a balanced directive "
6081,1998-02-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Seventh District economy  continues to expand at a moderate pace with only a few reports thus far that Asian  developments have had any measurable impact However, many of our contacts expect  their businesses to be affected as the year progresses In the consumer sector, retailers  generally ended up being pleased with holiday sales, but the bimodal holiday shopping  season that I mentioned at our December meeting was quite evident After a post-  Thanksgiving lull, sales picked up noticeably in the week before Christmas and that  strength then continued into January, benefiting in part from gift-certificate buying as  well as the strong housing market that boosted appliance sales Our survey of Michigan  retailers showed the largest December sales gains since 1994 Light vehicle sales  probably averaged about 15 million units at an annual rate in December and January  combined, but as noted in the Greenbook, the monthly sales numbers for December and  January are distorted by reporting period shifts and efforts by Toyota and Honda to  achieve best selling car status in 1997 Although low interest rates and low gasoline    2/3-4/98  prices have reduced the cost of driving, incentives remain extremely important in  maintaining sales near the 15 million unit pace  Manufacturing activity remains quite strong in the District Purchasing  managers' reports for January indicated that overall activity expanded at about the same  pace as in December in Chicago and at a somewhat faster pace in Detroit and Milwaukee  Contacts noted very strong demand in industries such as aluminum, steel, farm and other  heavy equipment, appliances, chemicals, paper, and publishing  In terms of the Asian situation, the impact on most Seventh District industries is  still more speculation than reality Auto and steel companies are worried about possible  increases in imports from Korea and Japan, although that doesn't seem to have happened  yet Several contacts from a variety of industries reported that Asian manufacturers and  distributors are experiencing significant difficulties in borrowing funds for working  capital and other purposes Our business contacts report dramatically slower business  operations in those Asian countries, and friends of mine who have been to Thailand  indicate that even the traffic in Bangkok is now bearable  For most businesses in the Seventh District, the major problem continues to be  hiring and retaining competent workers In other words, labor markets are still very tight  Help-wanted advertising increased in all our major metropolitan areas over the last three  months of 1997 and that is in contrast to the national index, which in December was  lower than in September The latest survey by Manpower Incorporated indicates that  hiring plans nationally for the second quarter of 1998 are up somewhat from the first  quarter and about the same as for the very strong second quarter of 1997 These results  will not be released until February 23 so they should be treated as confidential until then    2/3-4/98  Manpower's own domestic business apparently is very strong with demand for workers  widespread but especially robust at computer, telecommunications, pharmaceutical, and  food processing firms Other contacts indicate that high salaries for COBOL and  FORTRAN programmers are drawing some retirees back into the labor force, but wage  pressures generally continue to be relatively modest, given the tightness in labor markets  Turning to the national outlook, I think the risks are somewhat more balanced  today than they seemed to be in December The level of real GDP currently appears to be  above potential Labor markets are the tightest in a generation and yet there is still no  hard evidence of accelerating inflation Looking ahead, the key issues are Asia,  inventories, and, of course, inflation Considering the composition of fourth-quarter  growth, our view is that growth this year will slow to its trend rate due to sizable drags  coming from declines in net exports and inventory investment As we discussed earlier,  the biggest sources of uncertainty are the Asian situation and the possible inventory  correction Our outlook is about as pessimistic as the Greenbook regarding Asia and  slightly less so on the outlook for an inventory correction Despite this anticipated  slowing of GDP growth, we expect labor markets to remain tight Without mitigating  factors such as recent exchange rate movements and heightened competition from imports  along with energy price declines, we would be concerned that CPI inflation was poised to  increase  All in all then, we face risks on both the upside and the downside Without  significant slowing in the growth of economic activity, wage and price pressures appear  likely to intensify However, the Asian crisis seems to offer the kind of non-monetary    2/3-4/98  policy restraint that can keep aggregate demand in line with the economy's potential  output  I favor alternative I If we did make a change, it would be  interpreted as our placing increased emphasis on the aggregates, and I don't think we are  even close to being in a position to explain that to the American people  I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
6106,1998-03-31," Mike, you mentioned that oil prices are one of the temporary factors  that are affecting inflation; in fact oil prices are even affecting core CPI The other key factor, of  course, is the dollar I'm wondering if you've done any simulations or have any quantitative  estimates as to what the impact of the stronger dollar has been on the core CPI last year and this  year  Does that include 1998?    3/31/98  Thank you  Thank you, Mr Chairman The pace of economic expansion in the  Seventh District has picked up since the beginning of the year Mild winter weather explains  part, but not all, of the reported strengthening in retail sales and our very robust housing market  In contrast to the slowing seen in the nation, expansion in our manufacturing sector has  accelerated The March results of the Chicago Purchasing Managers' survey released this  morning show an increase in the overall index from 578 in February to 595 in March, paced by  sharp increases in both production and new orders Consumer surveys from Detroit and  Milwaukee had shown a pickup in the pace of retail sales expansion in January and again in  February Output growth in our manufacturing sector has started to exceed that in the nation,  which may reflect the Asian situation since we expect that other areas will be affected more than  our region  Since our last meeting, I have visited several areas of our District In addition, our  academic advisory and our agriculture, labor, and small business advisory councils met recently  and we had meetings of our Chicago and Detroit boards of directors Several common themes  emerged from these meetings first, labor markets remain very tight; second, health insurance  costs are rising; and third, Asian developments have not yet had much of an impact We  continue to hear about new ways that employers are using to deal with tight labor markets For  example, many contacts noted the increased use of apprenticeship programs in the construction  industry We were pleased to hear that apprentice and pre-apprentice programs for electricians    3/31/98  and carpenters are being reestablished in the city of Chicago as opposed to the suburbs These  programs draw on the unemployed in the inner city In Peoria, a high-tech jobs training center is  being built and sponsored jointly by a local university, high schools, employers, and the state  employment service All the sponsors will be located in the new building in order to ensure that  the high-tech training reflects the needs of local employers We even have heard that temporary  help firms are using temporary help [Laughter] One labor union contact told us a real first A  temporary help firm solicited striking workers on a picket line for temporary assignments  elsewhere [Laughter]  In terms of the Asian situation, most of our directors and council members felt that the  Asian impact on net exports would not be large Still, we have heard various anecdotes that  indicate an Asian impact on some types of exports and imports Pork sales to Asia are down  significantly, and we are importing container board from Japan for the first time in our contact's  memory In the auto industry, some domestic light vehicle production has been cut as a result of  softening export sales to Asia Import sales of light vehicles have increased, although mostly  sales of European rather than Asian models Korean imports have doubled their market share of  motor vehicle sales from 7 to 14 percent I guess it's not surprising since they are offering  $2,000 rebates on cars selling for $12,000 All of us have heard that Asian firms are having  difficulty obtaining trade finance, but several auto industry contacts speculate that the Japanese  auto firms have not increased exports to the United States because of political considerations  Turning to the national outlook, I continue to be impressed by the strength of the  domestic economy Consumer fundamentals are strong and firms seem poised to remain big  spenders for high-tech capital goods over the next few quarters As in January, we expect net  exports and inventory investment to be the largest drags on GDP growth this year, though our    3/31/98  outlook for a depressing Asian effect is somewhat less pessimistic now than it was two months  ago All told, we expect to see GDP growth of about 2-1/2 percent this year, with some slight  pickup in inflation over last year's levels  Last week I met with eight economists comprising our academic advisory council  Most council members attributed measured inflation's recent low levels to a variety of special  factors These include the dollar's recent appreciation and the deceleration of medical care costs  as well as the continued methodological changes implemented by the BLS Every council  member expects inflation to accelerate noticeably over the next 12 months, the consequence of  tight labor markets and GDP growth consistently above its trend rate The council was nearly  unanimous in its view that monetary policy should be tightened over the next few months  In summary, I remain concerned that the domestic economy's strength will outweigh  any negative effects arising from the turmoil in Asia At our currently high resource utilization  rates, this strength threatens to generate noticeable price pressures over the forecast horizon  Although in January 1 viewed the risks as somewhat balanced, I now view the risks going  forward as tilted toward the upside  Several were saying the opposite a year ago It was much more of a  mixed picture, with some saying that we should be tightening and others indicating that things  were just fine and we should not change our policy But for the first time at the latest meeting,  they were virtually unanimous in the view that some tightening would be needed It was a  surprise to us  Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation A lot has been  said already, and I don't want to repeat it In my view, the one thing that may well undo this  expansion and all its benefits to society is for inflation to start to accelerate and require us to take  some very severe action So, I think it is absolutely essential that we look ahead and that our  policy be preemptive The last thing we want is to be caught in a situation where we are behind  the curve I do think it is important to lay the foundation for a policy action, and I think the  suggestion of a policy speech that you and Bill McDonough made is an excellent one I also  want to associate myself with Ed Boehne's comments about the nature of the speech I thought  that he had some very good suggestions about how to explain our objectives in terms of the  broad-based benefits from sustainable economic growth that we want to see continued for the  benefit of all segments of our society  I think we should review how we use asymmetric or symmetric directives I believe  we should have a policy for that We should use symmetry in a systematic way, and I would  prepare the markets for any changes that we may make in our disclosure of that aspect of our  policy "
6132,1998-05-19," Mike, I wanted to ask you about one part of the wage side of the  forecast As you point out, you anticipate that workers will accept limited wage increases in the  future because of low inflation and low inflation expectations Of course, we know that wages are  going up now We have seen that in all the measures, and we are all getting anecdotal information  about rising wages You point out that workers have more bargaining power You add in the fact  that we have the technical changes in the consumer price measures, which are getting significant in  the CPI going forward So, when we look at your forecast of the overall CPI going out to 1999, it  shows consumer price inflation rising 21 percent on a measured basis If we add back in the  technical adjustments, we are up to 28 percent in 1999 On the core CPI, if we add in the effect of  these technical changes, we see an acceleration each year as well From the perspective of worker  expectations, how do you plug in these technical changes to the CPI?    5/19/98  Thank you    5/19/98  Mr Chairman, the Seventh District economy is expanding at a  moderate pace, with few signs of slowing growth and increasingly frequent reports of upward  pressures on labor compensation Our robust housing markets have strengthened retail sales and  also have boosted activity in steel, gypsum, cement, and other construction-related industries  April's light vehicle sales were at an annual rate of 154 million units; that is the highest so far this  year Our contacts indicate that sales so far in May are running above the 15 million level Sales  are being sustained by incentives, although relatively more of the Big Three sales are retail rather  than fleet sales compared to a year ago Expansion in overall manufacturing activity declined  slightly from March to April according to the Purchasing Managers' surveys from Chicago,  Detroit, and Milwaukee, but activity remains at high levels in virtually all of the industries  In general, we are not getting many reports of an adverse Asian impact on our  manufacturing sector, although there has been a sharp reduction in demand from Asia in high-tech  electronics Labor markets remain very tight and the unemployment rate in our five states was 38  percent in March Moreover, Manpower's report on hiring intentions for the third quarter shows no  easing in labor demand, as these hiring plans are the highest since 1978 This report will not be  released to the public until May 26, so it should be treated as confidential until then    5/19/98  In their own business, Manpower has seen two different markets a softening in  demand for industrial workers but strong demand for white collar and technical jobs Manpower is  also seeing increases in compensation, and other contacts increasingly are reporting a pickup in  wage growth as we were talking about before One of our directors in the trucking industry  reported a bidding frenzy that has raised the wages of employees, not just for drivers but across the  board in his industry Another director noted that several labor contracts with firms in Iowa were  leading to rising labor costs However, the increases remain relatively modest so far, and more  importantly they are being offset by productivity gains according to our directors and other  business contacts Still, employment costs in the Midwest increased at a faster pace in the last year  than in the nation and that has been the trend for the past four quarters  While regional CPI data can be volatile, consumer price inflation in the Midwest has  been accelerating since December, in contrast to the rest of the nation Similar to trends in the  nation, however, increases in consumer prices are being driven by the prices of services In line  with what Mike Prell mentioned before, all the business people I talk to in the goods producing  sector continue to emphasize that they cannot raise prices because of fierce competition  Turning to the national outlook, we have revised upward our forecast for both real  GDP growth and core CPI inflation The Asian financial crisis seems to be having a significant  effect on the trade-sensitive manufacturing sector, but the direst predictions about its effects seem  increasingly less likely to materialize Moreover, domestic demand remains very strong as  reflected in the unexpected strength we have already seen this year Altogether, we see GDP  growth of about 3 percent for this year This is roughly 1/2 percentage point higher than we were  looking for at the time of our last meeting and above estimates of a sustainable trend    5/19/98  Labor markets are extremely tight by all measures Nothing in the growth forecast  seems likely to change that in the near future Moreover, labor supply may have reached its outer  limits After growing rapidly for two years, the labor force has been increasing more slowly in  recent months, and a period of slower-than-trend labor force growth represents an additional risk to  the forecast  Given these developments and the prospect that benefit costs will increase more  rapidly, employment cost pressures seem very likely to intensify significantly Taking all this into  account, we have raised our forecast for core CPI inflation this year to 2-1/2 percent Given the  changes in methodology, this would be about 1/2 percentage point worse than last year At the time  of the last meeting I thought the risks had shifted to the upside They now seem to be more  decidedly in that direction  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation, but I do think it is  only a matter of time before we will have to tighten policy We all talked about the strength in the  economy and the fact that inflation pressures have been muted I hope you are right about  productivity growth being larger than that reported Perhaps the Greenbook is right that trend  economic growth is in the neighborhood of 2-3/4 percent If all this is true, then obviously  inflationary pressures will remain contained Our best estimate is that the Greenbook inflation  forecast is too optimistic Even if we accept the forecast in the Greenbook, core CPI inflation in  1999 is nearly 3 percent on a consistently measured basis That is a clear and troubling  acceleration I believe we have to be humble about our ability to forecast inflation, given our track  record going back over the last few years Nevertheless, I think the balance of risks strongly  suggest that we will have to tighten policy this year, maybe not today but relatively soon "
6159,1998-06-30," I want to return to Japan briefly I had a question for Peter Fisher  on the recent intervention Can you tell us how market participants viewed this intervention and  also what they see as the outlook for possible future interventions?  Yes, thank you  Thank you, Mr Chairman Apart from the GM strike, conditions in  the Seventh District generally are quite similar to what I reported at the last several meetings  Our region is experiencing continued moderate expansion and very tight labor markets, with  occasional signs of wage increases but very few indications that price inflation is accelerating  Like last year at this time, championship performances by both the Chicago Bulls and the Detroit  Red Wings have boosted local economies Labor shortages continue to be the main concern of  virtually all businesses in the District The unemployment rate for our five states dropped /2  percentage point in April to an average of 33 percent and remained near that level in May One  of our directors, who for months reported that his large national retailing firm had not had to  raise wages to get workers, has for the first time reported labor shortages and higher labor costs  I noted last time that consumer price inflation in the Midwest had accelerated ahead of that for  the nation, and that continues to be the case, with prices for services being the driving factor  While the District economy continues to perform very well, there are a few signs that  activity may be slowing The Chicago Purchasing Managers' survey results released this  morning showed a slower rate of expansion in June, with virtually all of the components lower  than in May Part of that may be due to Asia Anecdotal reports of any serious adverse Asian    6/30-7/1/98  impact have been largely limited to the high-tech electronics and electronics components  industry However, we have heard that Asia may be the reason for slowing in the temporary  help industry While overall business was quite strong in the paper industry, exports were down  sharply In general, retailers noted that there has been some slowing in sales activity in June  from the torrid pace of April and May A large producer of agricultural equipment has reduced  production for the first time in four years The firm anticipates slower sales because of larger  carryover stocks in agricultural commodities, lower farm incomes, and weather problems in  agricultural areas Bob McTeer mentioned drought We have had floods in Iowa; maybe we can  ship some water down to Texas to help them out!  The biggest news, of course, is the GM strike, which is constraining our region's  economy relatively more than the nation's Over 50 percent of GM's laid-off workers at US  assembly and parts plants are in the Seventh District Retail sales in Michigan and other  communities having a sizable GM presence are showing more softness than elsewhere Auto  dealers in the District are concerned about shortages of vehicles as well as parts, which could  affect their service business A survey by our Detroit branch found that spending by business  firms in the Flint area has been particularly affected  In terms of the strike's impact on the national economy, we are in broad agreement  with the Board staff that the strike will reduce real GDP growth about 1/2 percentage point in the  second quarter Much of that effect will show up as a reduction in inventories, as June's light  vehicle sales probably will be in the mid-15 million unit annual rate range That would be a  strong performance though not as robust as in May Some of the strike's lost output will, of  course, be made up the second half of the year, but the key point is to recognize a strike for what    6/30-7/1/98  it is so far, namely a temporary adverse supply shock with temporary negative consequences for  both output and prices  Turning to the national outlook, the incoming data of the last few weeks have  confirmed the underlying strength of domestic demand So far, we see little evidence of slowing  in consumption and fixed investment, and labor markets are still very tight As at the previous  meeting, our forecast of slowing growth hinges on substantial declines in inventory investment  and deterioration in net exports in the near term Certainly, the April business inventory data  show some slowdown in accumulation relative to the first quarter, but we still may see higher  growth in stocks than the Greenbook projects Although we are somewhat more optimistic on  net exports than the Greenbook, we recognize that the risks here are great  My recent trip to Japan only confirmed my growing pessimism over the prospects for  the quick and significant structural reforms needed to improve their economy It was painfully  reminiscent of my days as a trade negotiator back in the early 1990s All told despite these  considerations, we think that real GDP growth is likely to exceed 3 percent, and we forecast  1999 growth at or slightly above trend We are less optimistic about future inflation than the  Greenbook The slight recent deterioration in CPI inflation may not be alarming, but as the  special factors holding down goods price inflation wane, we may see overall inflation moving  higher as the gap between services and goods price inflation closes  In my judgment, the risks we face have increased on both the upside and the downside  since our last meeting Domestic demand has not slowed appreciably, and wage and price data  show some deterioration On the other hand, the situation in Asia and in Japan in particular  seems to be more serious than just a few weeks ago On balance, despite my increased concerns  regarding Asia, I believe the risks we face remain on the upside    6/30-7/1/98  Mr Chairman, I agree with the way you have presented this I do  not think we should change the ranges for the monetary aggregates nor do I think we should go  to alternative III As you said, we backed into a situation where the ranges emphasize our  commitment to price stability and that approach is serving us well at this point Therefore, I  would change the ranges only if for some reason they stop serving us well, or as President Poole  said, if we start using money growth in a serious way for policy purposes Then, I think it would  be desirable for us to increase public awareness of money growth But at this point, I do not  think we should make any change  Mr Chairman, the upside and the downside risks we face are much  the same as those we talked about at our last meeting, but as a number of us have said, they now  seem to be more severe in both directions The domestic economy has continued to show signs  of unsustainable growth, and we now have seen some modest worsening in inflation readings  However, the international situation has grown even more uncertain since our last meeting, and I  saw it firsthand during my recent trip to Japan I think the chances of a more severe than  anticipated reduction in our net exports appear to have increased  I would just add that my experience in dealing with the Japanese government and the  LDP lead me to believe that they will not act quickly and decisively to deal with their problems  Their unique culture and political processes are very powerful, and they are not likely to change  in the short term I believe it will be a very long haul  For now, I think the uncertainties in the international outlook clearly justify waiting  However, I do think that, on balance, the risks remain definitely to the upside and that we are  likely to have to tighten this year So, I agree with your recommendation  Mr Chairman, I actually come out very close to where Tom Hoenig  did but reach that position in a slightly different way This has been a very helpful discussion for  me, including the opportunity to learn the history I have been on the Committee slightly less    6/30-7/1/98  than four years, and I now have a much better understanding of just how complicated this issue  really is I view it as a theory versus practice issue In theory, we all favor more disclosure and  more information to help make the markets operate more efficiently and to help us accomplish  our objectives But in practice, we have a legacy It is the tilt, which is an arcane tool as I view  it I know that in some of my earlier meetings, the tilt was viewed as a directive to you, Mr  Chairman, as to the authority you would have to take some policy action between meetings  People on the Committee would say that they were giving you this authority, but they wanted  you to consult them before you actually used it I guess that was probably part of the later  evolution of this arcane tool In earlier times, I believe the Chairman did not consult the  Committee as to what he would do between meetings It is a tool that we are not using for the  purpose it was originally created  That is, of course, my point To try to explain this to the public and  to use the tilt as a method of educating the public seems fruitless to me  It will confuse the public more if we try to use this tool to educate  them about monetary policy It is the wrong tool to use I certainly favor educating the public  about monetary policy, but let's not try to do it with the tilt I would like to find other ways to do  this I don't have any easy suggestions, given the difficulty that people have pointed out here I  certainly support Alice Rivlin's suggestion, though, of writing the operational paragraph in plain  English I, too, am offended by it every time we go through it I would support giving her three  Nobel prizes on this, but I do not think fixing it is quite that difficult  But I think we can do better "
6183,1998-08-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Seventh District economy suffered a  minor fender bender in June and July The setback was only temporary, and we are back on the  moderate expansion road now that the GM strikes have been settled and recalled employees are  working overtime It will take a few months before the inventory pipeline is completely filled, so  light vehicle sales in August may still be affected by inventory shortages, as was the case in July  when reduced incentives also depressed sales Demand apparently remains solid as automakers  indicate that light vehicle sales in August remain slightly ahead of expectations of about 14-1/2  million units at an annual rate  Abstracting from GM strike effects, it does appear that activity in some manufacturing  industries has slowed over the past few months In particular, Asian developments have adversely    8/18/98  affected producers of paper, chemicals, food equipment, agricultural equipment, and some other  heavy equipment For most of these industries, however, strength in other export markets has  offset at least part of the weakness in Asian demand I spoke to a group of steel executives earlier  this month and, as Ted Truman anticipated, they were quick to express their concerns about steel  imports from Asia and declining prices for steel products  In our District, however, almost all of the recent weakness in steel output has been  related to the GM strikes We have seen some slowing in a few construction-related industries  such as cement and gypsum wallboard Housing activity remains at very high levels, but we are  observing smaller increases than elsewhere in the country and smaller than we experienced earlier  in the year during our unusually mild winter Retailers indicate that consumer spending continues  to surprise them on the upside and recent reports suggest no pullback in consumer demand  Labor markets remain very tight, and the Manpower survey to be released next week  will show strong hiring plans continuing through the fourth quarter, with both the national and  Midwest results after seasonal adjustment at the highest levels in the survey's 22-year history  The only weakness is in durable goods manufacturing where hiring plans have fallen for the  second consecutive quarter The Manpower survey results should be treated as confidential until  they are released next Monday, August 24 Increasingly, we are seeing entire communities  becoming involved in the search for qualified workers For example, 2500 workers are needed for  a new shopping mall opening up this November in a Detroit suburb Recruiting is going on at  high schools, colleges, senior centers, and social agencies like Goodwill industries In addition,  job fairs started to be held in June and will include one at the Pontiac Silver Dome this October  Significantly, the city of Pontiac is adding a bus line to the new shopping center and efforts are  under way to get similar public transportation to and from Detroit    8/18/98  Business contacts in the manufacturing sectors continue to say that competition  constrains their ability to raise prices Furthermore, many of our farmers are caught between a  rock and a hard place as weak Asian demand combines with expected record soybean and  near-record corn harvests to push grain prices lower But we have sighted some upward price  pressures outside of agriculture In the trucking industry, shipping costs are being affected as  empty trucks head to the West Coast to bring back full loads of Asian imports We were told that  several consumer products firms are planning to increase prices this fall One retailer noted that  although prices for new inventory are lower, they plan to raise prices to consumers by 3 to 5  percent largely to offset labor cost increases of 4 to 6 percent  Turning to the national outlook, at our last meeting I indicated that I thought the risks  for the economy had increased both on the upside and the downside News since that meeting has  convinced me that while the international situation has worsened, domestic demand continues to  grow strongly On the one hand, second-quarter export figures reveal a deterioration in the  international situation, which continues to be a substantial risk to the US and the world  economies Although I am a bit more optimistic than the Greenbook about the outlook for foreign  GDP and its effect on our exports, this sector continues to represent a big downside risk On the  other hand, domestic demand continues to grow strongly Consumer confidence is at a high level,  and employment and income gains remain substantial Economic fundamentals for the  consumption and investment sectors continue to look strong We see real GDP growth for 1998  in the 3 percent range Looking to 1999, there is a great deal of uncertainty, but we expect real  GDP growth to decelerate to the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range The 1999 projection gives a good deal of  weight to the deteriorating international situation and that may be overly pessimistic    8/18/98  Consequently, I continue to think the risks are tilted to the upside In any event, they are large on  both sides  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for ""no change"" in  policy On the directive, it is a close call I think that on balance the risks are still marginally on  the upside So, I would have a slight preference for an asymmetric directive but I can support a  symmetric directive "
6225,1998-09-29," Mr Chairman, I tend to agree with President Boehne and also  President McDonough It is hard to argue against transparency Obviously, we all want to  release as much information as possible But if we were to design this system from the start, I  cannot imagine that we would design a system that would require us to make two decisions One  might be a decision to maintain an unchanged policy and the other a decision on whether we  want to tell the world we might be tightening or easing later Alternatively, we might take an  action and announce shortly after the meeting whether our directive includes either of those two  tilts It just does not seem logical to me that as a central bank we would want to do that We  have used the tilt for other purposes, and now we are trying to design some system around that  history We wouldn't design it this way if we were to start afresh and didn't have to take account  of its use in the past  I believe that if we were to agree to announce the tilt at some time before the next  meeting, the practical result would be that we would use it much less Actually, though, the  existing system seems to be working rather well We had unusual circumstances at the August  meeting when we changed to a symmetric directive The July minutes, released shortly after that  meeting, indicated that we had had an upward bias In the interim, between the August meeting    9/29/98  and the September meeting, the Chairman consulted with us at Jackson Hole, and he  subsequently announced that the directive no longer had an upward bias So, I think that, on the  whole, our system for announcing our decisions has worked rather well over the years and I do  not see any need to change it at this point  Thank you, Mr Chairman Since our last meeting, economic  prospects at home and abroad have changed considerably, yet much of the data that we typically  use to gauge the forces at work in our economy have changed only marginally In some respects,  conditions in the Seventh District remain little changed since mid August Growth in the  manufacturing sector has continued to slow though levels of activity remain high Labor markets  are still tight and price pressures remain benign However, the depth and the breadth of actual  and anticipated impacts of international developments in our District economy now seem greater  than they did only a few weeks ago I think it is fair to say that many of my contacts are much  more nervous about the future than they were in August For example, in the manufacturing  sector we increasingly hear reports of weakness even among firms with little direct international  exposure The strength that we do see is limited primarily to housing-related industries  Although the Chicago Purchasing Managers' composite index indicates renewed strength in  September, we believe this largely reflects a rebound from the GM strike Furthermore, the    9/29/98  report shows little rebound in the September new orders index, pointing to future additional  slowing This index is confidential until 900 am tomorrow morning  District steel manufacturers are being adversely affected by increased US capacity,  significantly increased imports, and softening demand in some market segments A major  producer of corrugated boxes reported that demand for boxes from manufacturers has declined  significantly in the last several months Further, several members of our Advisory Council on  Agriculture, Labor, and Small Business reported that among some District manufacturers,  earnings and new orders had declined, overtime shifts were being cut back, and layoffs were  likely if export orders did not recover soon  In contrast, contacts in the auto industry remain upbeat about US sales prospects  After averaging only 141 million units in July and August, light vehicle sales seem to be running  at around 14-3/4 million units in September, with Big Three projections for the fourth quarter  around 15 million units Outside of light vehicles, the retailing picture is somewhat mixed  Michigan retailers surveyed through early to mid-September report no deterioration in current  sales or in expectations about sales three months ahead However, one large national retailer in  our District reports that sales of big ticket items have slowed week by week in August and  September and that the softening trend in electronics and other durable goods has worsened  Sales of this retailer at stores located in small and mid-sized towns where they face little  competition also have softened considerably Similarly, a large trucking firm in our District  reports that shipments to retailers are not as strong as expected for this time of the year Another  weak spot is our ag sector, which continues to be hurt by low commodity prices, large crop  yields, and declining export demand Sales of agricultural equipment have dropped enough to  generate plant shutdowns and layoffs at some District plants    9/29/98  On balance then, I see our District's expansion continuing at a slower pace than I  reported in August, though with little easing of the tight labor markets we have had for some  time Competitive pressures still limit the ability of firms to raise prices Among our business  contacts I also see greater uncertainty about the future and some declines in confidence  Turning to the national economy, at our last meeting I thought that the risks, though  close to balanced, remained greater on the upside Since then, however, virtually all the news  has suggested a weakening in the prospects for real economic growth and less risk of a  significant increase in inflation International financial instability has begun to have significant  effects on the economies of Latin America, as has just been mentioned, which likely will reduce  the demand for our exports even further The continued decline in US equity prices appears to  be showing through to consumer confidence, which threatens growth in consumer spending  Despite the decline in Treasury interest rates, financial turbulence seems to be threatening the  access of at least some firms to capital, and that may take much of the steam out of the great  burst of investment spending we have had in this expansion  Our projections do not show as sharp a deceleration in growth as in the Greenbook,  but we do see a period of growth somewhat below potential next year To be sure, with labor  markets still very tight, the threat of increased inflation has not disappeared Indeed, we still  expect some pickup in core inflation next year, but the balance of risks has shifted noticeably  toward the downside  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for a 25 basis point  reduction in the fed funds rate In my opinion, going beyond that clearly would be seen as an  overreaction and some would view it as panic on our part It is important for us to keep in mind  that we are basing this policy action on projections, as you said, and we have to be somewhat  humble about our record on projections  On the tilt in the directive, I am almost indifferent If we follow the logic of how we  have been using symmetry, I would have a slight preference for asymmetry since I am assuming  that there is a better than 50 percent probability that we will have to lower rates again I hope I  am wrong about that, but that is my assessment of the outlook at this point "
6248,1998-10-15," Mr Chairman, I have just a couple of things to add; my comments are  very similar to those of my colleagues There is no real sense of a fundamental change in  business conditions in our District, but there is clearly a lot of increased concern, a lot of  increased uncertainty  Looking at some District industries, the automobile industry still seems to be going  strong, although operating with very high sales incentives GM seemed to recover better than  expected from its strike The steel industry is in the doldrums at this point We just published    10/15/98  our survey of Midwest manufacturers, which covered developments in August We found  strength in the auto and steel industries, but we think that mostly reflects recovery from the GM  strike On the other hand, the machinery and natural resources areas showed some slowing in  August  Business people we've been talking to are starting to focus on their budgets for next year  The general comment is that they are all planning lower levels of capital spending, hiring, and  expenses for 1999 than they had for 1998 In other words, they went into 1998 with the view that  it would be a very bullish year, whereas they are approaching 1999 with a lot more concern  While we are seeing a lot of concern, the labor markets are still very tight and there are still many  areas of strength in our District economy  Mr Chairman, this is Mike Moskow I, too, would prefer the 25 basis  point reduction in the discount rate I would support the proposed reduction in the fed funds rate  Mr Chairman, just one question Could you give us some idea as to  what the timing would be on an announcement of all this? "
6273,1998-11-17," I agree with the consensus to go with Option 2 I think the  sentence that President McDonough is referring to is redundant and unnecessary I just wonder  if there is some other way to deal with the problem that you raise, Bill, which is a real problem  We might put out a statement when we notify the public about our future use of different  language in which we would say that the rewording does not reflect any change in Federal  Reserve policies It is just an effort to clarify the meaning of our directives That in fact is  exactly what we are trying to do  Just a quick question on Brazil I found this alternative scenario in  the Greenbook very helpful I took note of the US GDP projection of minus 04 in 1999 and  2000, but you were careful to mention that this is by no means the worst case concerning a  potential meltdown in Brazil I was wondering if you could give us some idea of the relative  probabilities of this alternative scenario or even a worse case  Thank you  Thank you, Mr Chairman Since our last meeting and particularly  since our mid-October actions, a degree of calmness seems to have replaced at least some of the    11/17/98  unsettled conditions of late September However, our contacts remain more nervous and  uncertain about the future than they were in mid-summer In many respects, conditions in the  Seventh District are quite similar to what I reported in late September Growth in our  manufacturing sector has slowed further, although activity levels generally remain high  Housing activity remains strong, and consumer spending continues to be relatively healthy  Price pressures remain benign despite tight labor markets The latest Manpower survey of hiring  plans for the first quarter of 1999 suggests little change from the strong plans reported for the  current quarter as well as from a year ago These results will not be made public until next  Monday, November 23, so they should be considered confidential until then The key point from  the survey is that aside from normal seasonal movements, there is no indication that the labor  market is facing significant layoffs or downsizings  We continue to see signs of slowing in our manufacturing sector, but conditions there  are mixed Foreign markets are adversely impacting producers of electronics, steel, and  agricultural equipment In the steel industry, the production decline from a year ago is now  greater in our District than for the nation as a whole Domestic producers continue to be  challenged by steel imports, which doubled their US market share from about 20 percent to 40  percent this past summer The head of one steel company told me that he believes that world  steel prices are bottoming and that firms are more likely to shut down capacity now than to  reduce prices any further In contrast, domestic demand continues to support fairly strong  activity at our heavy and light motor vehicle producers as well as housing-related manufacturers  One contact in the heavy truck industry described business as booming, but he immediately said  his firm was making extensive contingency plans for next year that would be implemented    11/17/98  quickly if necessary Industry sources suggest that auto and light truck sales this month will be  strong, though not as robust as the annual rate of 16-1/2 million units in October  Because of the recent financial market volatility, we made a special effort to contact  some market participants at the Chicago futures and options exchanges Although our contacts  believe they have successfully weathered the extraordinary volatility of late summer and early  fall, many were apprehensive about the market's ability to withstand future shocks One concern  is that market depth may suffer in the months ahead Banks face pressure to get exposure off  their books and consequently they have cancelled lines of credit to some clearing members  Further, year-end redemptions by hedge fund customers may stress the markets The second key  issue is that some over-the-counter swap market participants are apparently concerned about the  condition of some of their large money center bank counterparties As a result, these participants  are increasingly substituting away from over-the-counter contracts into relatively more expensive  futures contracts These contracts reduce the participants' credit risk by substituting the  AAA-rated exchanges as counterparties in place of many of the money center banks  Conditions in the agricultural sector remain weak Our latest survey of agricultural  banks showed third-quarter farmland values down on average for our five District states  Bankers also reported an increase in loan extension requests and expect that loan repayment  difficulties will emerge The inflation picture generally remains quite good The auto industry,  for example, is negotiating a 3 percent reduction in steel prices in next year's supply contracts  However, two different retailers noted to me that construction costs for new stores had risen  considerably in the last year  Turning to the national economy, although somewhat more balanced than at our last  meeting, I still believe that the risks remain greater on the downside Three factors seem    11/17/98  especially important at this time First, although stock market prices have rebounded sharply in  recent weeks, market volatility remains high and that should restrain consumption spending  somewhat in the months ahead Second, although credit spreads have narrowed since our  intermeeting rate cut, financial markets remain jittery and spreads could easily climb again  Finally, the risks of rising inflation appear to be relatively low Although labor markets continue  to be tight and wage growth is rising, productivity growth has been strong enough to largely  offset those gains Moreover, declining profit margins going forward are likely to stiffen the  resolve of many firms to hold the line on wage increases These factors combined with the  continued dismal international outlook--we were talking about Japan and Brazil earlier--lead me  to the view that the risks remain greater on the downside  Mr Chairman, as I mentioned in my comments, I think the risks  clearly are on the downside I agree with others that this is a close call Coming into the meeting  I agonized over this, but I came to the conclusion that we are either going to move now or in  December It is difficult to imagine that real growth in 1999 is going to reignite to any  unsustainable rate, but it is relatively easy to imagine scenarios where growth is going to slow  abruptly So, I felt that we definitely would move at one of these two meetings, and therefore we  might as well do it now I don't see any reason to wait Inflationary pressures appear to be  modest There is an opportunity to balance the risks now by lowering the funds rate by 25 basis  points When I add in the Brazil risk, which I am very concerned about, I agree completely with  your recommendation on both counts, for a 25 basis point reduction and a symmetrical directive "
6296,1998-12-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman Conditions in the Seventh District  generally remain quite similar to what I reported in November, with the major difference being  that the anxiety level among our contacts seems to have come down somewhat Uncertainty  about the domestic and global economies remains high, but the heightened concerns about credit  availability that were so apparent in September and October have eased somewhat as a result of  our actions to lower interest rates as well as similar moves taken by other central banks around  the world  Our District's economy continues to show trends similar to what I mentioned last  time Housing activity remains strong; consumer spending continues to be relatively healthy  Warmer-than-normal weather has helped maintain construction activity at high levels, but it has  hurt sales of winter apparel, auto batteries, and snow removal equipment More generally, sales    12/22/98 24  so far this season have been reasonably good, though mixed by type of retailer Department  stores generally have been disappointed and have stepped up promotional activity In contrast,  the discounters, the specialty apparel chains, and home-oriented stores have reported strong  sales I guess Bloomingdales is not in that category! Light vehicle sales are expected to be  strong again in December, boosted in part by especially intense competition between the Toyota  Camry and the Honda Accord for best selling car of 1998  On balance, manufacturing activity continues at a high level, with strength in some  industries offsetting weakness in others Reflecting these offsetting forces, the Chicago  Purchasing Managers' Composite Index for December shows a slight pickup in overall activity  from 502 percent in November to 509 percent in December This information will not be  released to the public until December 31, so it should be considered confidential until that time  Manufacturing contacts reported strong demand for aluminum, housing-related products, and  both light and heavy motor vehicles But weaknesses in foreign markets and low commodity  prices continue to have an adverse impact on producers of oil-related products, steel, and  agricultural equipment One steel producer indicated that annual contracts now being negotiated  with customers for 1999 are averaging a decline in prices of about 5 percent from 1998 levels  More generally, conditions in the agricultural sector remain weak, particularly among  hog producers, as has been widely publicized especially in our District Hog prices in  mid-December were almost 75 percent below a year ago, although retail prices have not fallen  nearly as much The price declines are largely due to substantial production hikes The large  operators are hoping that existing facilities will be grandfathered under potential legislation that  is likely to limit future expansion due to environmental concerns    12/22/98  Overall, price pressures remain benign District labor markets are still tight, although  the unemployment rate for our five states did edge up slightly last month to 37 percent from 36  percent in October  Turning to the national outlook, our forecast is similar to that of the Greenbook We  hosted our annual economic outlook symposium earlier this month, and the consensus outlook  from that group of 31 Midwest economists was quite similar as well The strength of consumer  demand has been very impressive of late and some slowing seems most likely Despite  heightened media attention to the low personal saving rate, wealth levels and confidence remain  high and interest rates remain low Therefore, we expect consumer spending growth to continue  reasonably strong The deterioration of the profits picture and, as Mike Prell mentioned, the lack  of accelerator effects should cause investment spending growth to slow but only back to more  normal levels  So, overall, we expect aggregate demand to remain strong enough to keep labor  markets quite tight However, except for swings in energy prices, we do not see a noticeable  pickup in inflation Our chief downside concerns remain the poor prospects for growth abroad,  the Brazilian situation that Karen Johnson discussed, and still somewhat fragile financial market  conditions, although our policy actions appear to have helped settle the markets Still, with the  full effects of our recent policy actions yet to be felt, the risks to the outlook seem to be relatively  balanced  Mr Chairman, I support ""B"" symmetric with a little bit of agony  [Laughter] I agree with your description of the risks However, I do want to emphasize, as have  others, that we have made progress against inflation but that our forecast for 1999 shows  inflation edging up a little We all know it's because of energy price increases, but I think it does    12/22/98 67  require careful monitoring since we do not want to give up the underlying gains that we have  made against inflation  I also want to make a brief comment about your description of the earnings forecasts  by Wall Street analysts, with the short-term earnings forecasts coming down but the long-term  forecasts staying where they were before It reminds me of my years when I was in private  industry and looked at many, many business plans, as I am sure you did as well The head of a  business would often come in and say, ""Earnings this first year are going to be down, but wait  until years two, three, four, and five They are going to go right up!"" We called this the hockey  stick approach because we saw it so frequently So, I would be very skeptical about the forecasts  that the Wall Street analysts are making about long-term profits  I will be a purist on this, Mr Chairman Since this is a directive, I  think the phrase ""in coming months"" should come out and the last sentence should come out too  I don't feel as strongly about the last sentence as I do about the phrase ""in coming months""  Yes  Mr Chairman, I think your suggestion is an excellent one In  preparation for this meeting I did go back and read the transcript of the discussion we had on this  issue at the July meeting It really was an excellent discussion, pointing out the different views  that people had on this subject Since I am one of those who were in the minority, with a  strongly held view, I think this is an excellent next step to take We can review it after a year  and see what results we've had with it "
6322,1999-02-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Seventh District economy   generally continues to show trends similar to what I reported in December, namely   strength in consumer spending and housing activity, mixed signals in manufacturing,   tight labor markets, and a few signs that inflation will accelerate in the near future   Consumer spending remains healthy, boosted in part by robust activity in the housing   sector, including refinancing activity   Two of our directors, one a major bank credit card issuer and the other a major   retailer, reported that consumers have been paying down outstanding credit balances, in   part reflecting strong mortgage refinancing activity Most of our retailers experienced   better-than-expected sales during December, and that continued into January Sales have   been particularly strong for big-ticket items such as appliances, consumer electronics, and   cold weather products The blizzard we had in early 1999 forced some merchants to   close stores temporarily, but the impact on sales for the month was said to be minimal   Light vehicle sales were in the stratosphere in December but came back to earth in   January Some early January sales were included in the December figures Inclement     2/2-3/99 47   weather crimped sales a bit in January, but sales continued to be boosted by high   incentives Automakers have revised 1999 sales forecasts upward, although they still are   not quite as high as in the Greenbook   Continued strength in the motor vehicle industry, including heavy trucks where   there is a 13-month order backlog, stands in sharp contrast to the weakness still being   reported in our steel and agricultural equipment industries In the steel industry, two   small firms declared bankruptcy last year Three more may do so in the first quarter of   this year A couple of recently opened mini mills are now up for sale Among the major   steel producers, half were still profitable in the fourth quarter, but all are likely to lose   money in the first quarter This will make it easier for the industry to demonstrate injury   from steel imports Production in the farm equipment industry this year is expected to be   down 25 percent Moreover, since Brazil is a major soy bean producer, the devaluation   of the real will likely put downward pressure on prices and exacerbate conditions for our   soy bean farmers and ag equipment makers   District labor markets generally remain tight, although some easing is reported in   locales affected by weakness in certain manufacturing sectors and in agriculture In   terms of prices, firms continue to report that as a result of intense domestic and foreign   competition they lack the ability to raise prices Firms continue to press suppliers for   lower prices, and we had several reports recently of larger firms, both within the same   industry as well as across different industries, establishing purchasing alliances to   increase their bargaining power with suppliers But some firms have managed to increase   prices Magazine advertising prices have been raised 5 percent Also, several of our   directors expressed concern about higher prices for construction projects   I asked our directors to report on 1999 capital spending plans It appears that a   few of our District firms altered their capital spending plans in response to last fall’s   financial market turmoil Changes that have been made appear to be driven by   prospective business conditions Y2K issues are not driving changes in their current   plans at the moment   Turning to the nation, our outlook for economic activity in 1999 has strengthened   somewhat since our December meeting Our analysis suggests that real GDP growth will   be around 26 percent this year and that CPI inflation will be about 23 percent Our     2/2-3/99 48   forecast is similar to the Greenbook’s, although the Greenbook has traveled a greater   distance to get there than we did   Last week we met with our Academic Advisory Council They continue to look   for a strong economy in 1999, with inflation remaining around 2½ percent Though they   indicated that the current setting of monetary policy is about right for now, they expect   inflation to accelerate somewhat in the year 2000 I share this concern about accelerating   inflation As we have discussed before, the special factors that led to the 1998 CPI   inflation rate of 1½ percent are not likely to recur this year Since we see aggregate   demand decelerating only to the growth rate of potential output, resource imbalances are   unlikely to diminish soon   Last fall there were very real concerns that the financial turmoil could negatively   affect creditworthy borrowers and institutions This Committee’s aggressive actions   were an appropriate response to those shocks But if and when those risks diminish   sufficiently, an appropriate response would be to move toward a more neutral policy   setting The uncertainties about the Brazilian situation probably mean that it is still too   early to tell if its financial crisis has passed, but we may not be too far from knowing   I think Alice’s caution is very well stated In looking at this   though--and this is really the first time I have looked at it carefully--I assume this is the   entire reporting requirement   The section is entitled “Monetary and Credit Aggregates” All   the reporting is under monetary and credit aggregates, which is rather ironic given the     2/2-3/99 87   discussion we just had about the limitations of the aggregates themselves I recognize   that there is some risk in trying to come up with changes to this, but it really is   misleading to the American people to have the reporting requirements in a section   entitled “Monetary and Credit Aggregates” I would hope that we could do something   better than that in terms of how we are going to communicate   Thank you, Mr Chairman It is clear from our discussion that   there is a lot we don’t know I think we all feel this conflict--I certainly do--between   what economic theory and economic models are saying on the one hand and what we   have seen as the reality in recent years We all have been over-forecasting inflation and   under-forecasting growth for at least three years  Someone raised the question as to what   has changed The way I look at it, the longer it goes on, the more it becomes such a   puzzle and the more one questions it So I certainly agree with the thrust of your   comments that we should be questioning our forecasting models with regard to the help   they give us in policymaking   But having said that, I am concerned that our current monetary policy stance may   be too loose because of the actions we took last fall I don’t think the risks are strongly   skewed toward the upside, but I believe they are somewhat skewed to the upside at this   point I agree with the comments that have been made today that we have to be prepared     2/2-3/99 124   to move very quickly when we see some evidence of inflation in the pipeline It doesn’t   have to be in the actual numbers, but we have to be sure that we see some evidence   Clearly, we have not seen any evidence in recent years So, I support your   recommendation at this time But we have to be very, very vigilant  "
6348,1999-03-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman I am beginning to sound like a   broken record, but the story for the Seventh District economy is quite similar to what I   reported in the last two meetings Reports continue to suggest strength in consumer   spending and housing activity, mixed signals in manufacturing, and tight labor markets,   but few signs that inflation will accelerate in the near future Housing remains robust,   although there are signs that activity may have peaked Strong housing markets continue   to support consumer spending for home-related items, and most retailers reported higher-  than-expected sales, with discounters still faring better than general merchandisers Light   vehicle sales were exceptionally strong in February, and industry contacts indicated that   sales so far in March were still running above 15½ million units Earlier this month, the   automakers again revised up their sales forecast for this year Manufacturing activity   continues to be mixed, but the sector overall may be showing some early signs of   improving And that may be a little different from some of the other reports we have   heard this morning The Chicago Purchasing Managers’ survey results for March, to be   released tomorrow morning, will show activity moving higher, from 529 percent in   February to 57 percent in March Perhaps of some concern, however, is that the “prices   paid” component moved above 50 percent for the first time since last April, from 416   percent in February to 525 percent in March That information, of course, should be   treated confidentially until it is released tomorrow morning   The strength in the motor vehicle and construction industries is offsetting   softness in steel and agricultural equipment Heavy-duty trucks appear headed for a   record year Demand for construction equipment and materials remains very strong   Construction equipment producers expect to benefit significantly from the 6-year     3/30/99 23   highway funding program, and one gypsum wallboard firm operated at 101 percent of   capacity last year by working holidays There have been reports of wallboard being   imported, which is a very rare event in our country Price increases for wallboard have   been announced and 25 percent additional capacity will be coming on stream over the   next two years   Steel imports have come down sharply since November and there are signs that   activity in the District steel industry may be bottoming In addition, reports indicate that   steel output between now and the end of July may be boosted by efforts to build   inventories to meet auto industry demand ahead of a possible strike by steelworkers   Their contract expires this summer However, one of our directors who heads a major   steel firm believes that a steelworkers’ strike is unlikely And, of course, we have   automobile labor negotiations later this year as well Farm equipment makers still expect   sales and production to be down sharply this year   Comments made at our Agriculture, Small Business, and Labor Advisory   Council meetings a couple of weeks ago echoed reports we have heard from other   contacts That conditions in parts of the agricultural sector are bleak and that employers   are learning to cope with tight labor markets Also complementing the council member   reports, a contact at a large temporary help firm said that wages were not going up more   rapidly than before Relevant to Bill Poole’s question earlier about manufacturing   workers, this contact also said that there has been some modest pickup in the demand for   blue-collar industrial workers early this year That has been true for several months now   after eleven consecutive months of declines He also saw some softening in demand for   high-tech employees on a national basis   Turning to the national economy, the data since our last meeting have been   surprisingly strong Given the momentum that we’ve seen so far this quarter and the   calmer financial conditions, we have upped our forecast for this year’s real GDP growth   from 26 percent to around 3 percent, which is in the same ballpark as the Greenbook   forecast Of course, the inflation numbers also have continued to come in quite   favorably, suggesting that such high levels of economic activity are not currently     3/30/99 24   straining productive capabilities Given the very heartening productivity growth we’ve   seen lately, the relatively good inflation performance may well continue Indeed, we   have even lowered our core CPI forecast a bit for 1999 However, the prospect of some   upturn in inflation in 2000 from the low rates we’ve been experiencing remains   worrisome I recognize the difficulty we all have had in forecasting inflation, but all of   our statistical models that forecast low inflation for 1999 expect core CPI inflation to   accelerate noticeably next year As economic growth around the world picks up over the   forecast horizon, many of the special factors restraining inflation will dissipate Given   what I still believe are substantial lags in the transmission of monetary policy, we need to   keep in mind the likelihood of accelerating inflation in formulating policy over the   coming months   Mr Chairman, based on our discussion today, the most   serious concern is the inflation outlook for the year 2000 Our current policy stance is   too expansionary relative to the acceleration in inflation projected in the Greenbook and   in our outlook as well I don’t think it is important to shift policy now but if we accept   these inflation forecasts, then it will be important to increase rates later this year The   key, of course, is whether we accept these forecasts, and we have had a lot of discussion   about that Given the fact that we have very low inflation rates now, I agree that we have     3/30/99 62   to see some indication of wage increases or price inflation or inflation in the pipeline   before we would want to take some action In this environment, it is important that we   not become complacent about our current economic good fortune But I agree with your   recommendation on both counts--on maintaining the current funds rate objective and also   the symmetric directive  "
6370,1999-05-18," Mr Chairman, Don is correct that we are doing that The   discount officers are urging both small banks and large banks to have their borrowing   documents up-to-date and their collateral in place ahead of time But given the number   of people involved and the speed with which this is happening, it seems clear that many   banks are not going to have done this in advance So there will be a lot of last minute   scurrying around   Mike, I want to ask you about your statements regarding   productivity That, of course, is something in which we are all very interested I thought   I heard you say in your comments that because of structural improvements and   efficiencies you have added several tenths onto your productivity forecast for 1999 and   2000 Part 1 of the Greenbook on page 13 has a reference to an increase of ½ percentage   point in your forecast of labor productivity gains One question is Are we talking about   the same number here?  My second question relates to your comment that you didn’t   think there was any reason to expect this to fall off in the near term The question is   What is your sense as to what is going to happen beyond 2000 on these structural   improvements?   I agree that it is not radically high in an historical context; but   compared with three or four years ago when we were talking about a 09 percent increase   in productivity on average, it is a very significant difference   I was hoping it was not going to be me! [Laughter] The   Seventh District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace However, we are   starting to see some subtle changes Consumer spending remains healthy and housing   activity is at high levels, but we are now seeing a few signs of moderation in these areas   Conditions in the ag sector generally remain depressed, but results from our recent survey   of agricultural bankers suggest that there has been no further deterioration in farmland   values Despite the continuing problems in steel and farm equipment, our manufacturing   sector is performing well and may be picking up steam As evidence, the Purchasing   Managers’ Surveys from Chicago, Detroit, and Milwaukee indicate that expansion of   overall manufacturing activity has picked up in the past three months Motor vehicle   producers continue to experience strong sales April sales of light vehicles again   surprised us on the upside, and heavy-duty truck backlogs are still quite high In fact, the   automobile industry is doing so well that profits are high, leading one senior official at a   major automaker to mention to me that he expected very difficult labor negotiations later   this year Tensions are high and there is a strong potential for labor disruptions One   major issue in the negotiations, of course, will be the use of outsourcing   More generally, our labor markets remain tight, and the puzzle of slowing   compensation growth is even more pronounced in the Midwest than in the national   numbers Our business contacts are starting to report less customer resistance to price     5/18/99 27   increases than was apparent a year or two ago This is not a sea change, as Mike Prell   discussed, but we are hearing more anecdotes, and I thought I would mention a few   One of our former directors with a large trucking operation noted that his firm   was negotiating contracts with higher prices for the first time in many years A major   printing firm reported that advertising rates are increasing A national specialty retailer   mentioned to me that wholesale prices for furniture were up sharply; he added that costs   for building new stores, including land, had risen 50 percent over the last three years   Last time I noted that the prices paid component from the Chicago Purchasing Managers’   Survey moved above 50 percent in March for the first time since April 1998 That   component moved even higher this April, from 525 to 567 percent And purchasing   managers from Detroit and Milwaukee also reported that prices paid moved above 50   percent in both of those months The Milwaukee report provides evidence that energy   was not the only culprit, as 11 of the 21 commodity prices surveyed were above 50 in   April   This regional pricing news leaves me quite sensitive to the data contained in   Friday’s CPI report As Al Broaddus mentioned, of course, we should not make too   much of a single month’s data, though the increases appear to be broadly based In fact,   my biggest concern remains not inflation this year, but rather the acceleration in core   inflation expected next year, perhaps from a higher level than we forecasted before In   addition, incoming data have remained strong since our last meeting when we raised our   forecast of real GDP growth for both this year and next; if productivity growth remains as   rapid as it has been for the past few quarters, then this projected real growth would be   sustainable But if, as my somewhat pessimistic staff keeps telling me, trend productivity   growth has not picked up as much as the Greenbook asserts, we could face a substantial   increase in inflation by the end of next year Thus, I think the risks have become tilted   decidedly to the upside, and I think the time has come to reevaluate our policy stance   Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendations of an   asymmetric tilt and an immediate announcement I am concerned about the high level of   aggregate demand and the related outlook for inflation It is important that we show we   are concerned about inflation and are ready to take action In my view, this step will help   us to maintain our credibility     5/18/99 66   There were a couple of considerations mentioned by Don Kohn that I thought   were important He said if we change the tilt we should announce it if we think (1) it is a   significant change in our thinking; and (2) if the absence of this step would mislead the   public My assessment is that the current situation fits both of those criteria So, I think   it is important that we change the tilt and announce it right away  "
6394,1999-06-29," Thank you, Mr Chairman Business conditions in the Seventh   District remain quite good Light motor vehicle sales in May matched their 12-year high   reached last December, and industry contacts suggest that June sales will exceed the   strong year-to-date sales pace of 164 million units Net orders for medium and heavy-  duty trucks continue to run above long-run averages   Commercial construction activity in Chicago has gained momentum in recent   months but with few signs of speculative activity Lenders and investors are requiring   that 50 percent of office space be pre-leased, and that is one reason some previously   announced projects are not making it off the drafter’s table   More generally, our manufacturing sector is still performing well For example,   the Chicago Purchasing Managers survey results for June show the overall index moving   further above the 50 percent level, from 579 percent in May to 60 percent in June That   survey is going to be released to the public tomorrow at 1000 am  Even the steel   industry reports a bit of improvement, as capacity utilization rates have risen noticeably   over the past few months, although they remain significantly below typical operating   levels     6/29-30/99 35   Moreover, as Tom Hoenig just mentioned, conditions in the ag sector generally   remain depressed, with no significant improvement likely for some time even with   improving conditions abroad Nonetheless, our District labor markets are still extremely   tight We spoke with contacts at two national temporary service firms headquartered in   our District and both reported continued difficulty in finding workers to satisfy clients’   demands One contact even said that he had shifted all of his marketing expenditures to   finding workers and none to finding clients Both firms also indicated that we have   passed the peak for Y2K-related hiring of technical personnel   On the price side, we increasingly hear reports of price increases that stick, both   for final and intermediate goods Auto dealers and some casual dining establishments   have been able to raise prices modestly, and a few retailers indicated that strong sales   results were not as dependent on promotional activity as before The Chicago Purchasing   Managers Report for June again indicated that relatively more respondents were   experiencing increases in prices paid than declines The prices paid component,   seasonally adjusted, went from 525 percent in May to 572 percent in June That is the   fourth consecutive month above 50 percent, and it is the highest since December of 1997   Before turning to our national outlook, I’d like to summarize some recent   discussions about productivity that we had at our Bank At our most recent board of   directors meeting, which the Chairman attended, we heard some very optimistic   assessments of the prospects for e-commerce to increase productivity in several sectors of   the economy Our directors reported on how advances in computer technology have   affected their particular companies and industries--manufacturing, retailing, banking and   services in particular--and on the potential for these technological advances to   fundamentally change the nature of our economy The reports consistently noted that   technology has enhanced productivity pretty much across the board and that its potential   to yield further productivity improvements seems limitless   On the other hand, at our Academic Advisory Council meeting one participant   presented a paper suggesting that the recent pickup in productivity growth is due only to   (1) measurement changes; (2) the normal cyclical response of productivity; and (3)   acceleration of productivity growth in the computer industry itself--not in industries using   computers but in the information processing and equipment sector alone The analysis     6/29-30/99 36   suggests that productivity gains in the computer manufacturing sector have not spilled   over to the rest of the economy, at least in the data, casting some doubt on how   widespread productivity increases have been Obviously, productivity growth is a key   issue confronting us today   Turning to the national outlook, our views are reasonably similar to those in the   Greenbook Our forecast for core CPI inflation is, however, a couple of tenths higher for   next year More importantly, even with a tightening in policy similar to that assumed in   the Greenbook, we see further acceleration in inflation in 2001 So the upside risks   remain substantial The downside risks, on the other hand, are considerably less than   those we faced when we last adjusted policy Most of the news on the world economy is   suggesting more strength than previously expected Moreover, risk spreads, while still   somewhat elevated, are back to more reasonable levels, and creditworthy borrowers are   finding financing Meanwhile, the same factors that have been propelling the rapid   expansion of domestic demand--high income growth, high wealth levels, and high   consumer confidence--remain in place So it seems to me that it’s the time to begin the   process of tightening policy   Mr Chairman, I agree completely I don’t think it serves any   useful purpose to open this up to a wide range of discussion at this point So, I agree with   your recommendation   Don, I think we all feel that probably the most important thing   this Committee has going for it is our credibility, the credibility of the Chairman I was   wondering about the effects on our credibility if we took the last option that you   presented--if we went up 25 basis points and returned to symmetry--but soon felt that we   had to raise rates further If the inflation numbers in the coming months start to   deteriorate and we feel that we have to increase rates, we would be doing so from a   symmetrical directive not an asymmetrical one Are you concerned at all that a     6/29-30/99 78   symmetrical directive would affect our credibility in the marketplace when right now   they’re assuming that we will have more than one increase this year?   You obviously don’t feel that the very strong reaction to the tilt   announcement at the last meeting changes the historical view of how people look at our   making a move from symmetry   Thank you, Mr Chairman I have just a few comments on the   longer term First, I too was very impressed by the discussion we had at our board   meeting of the Chicago and Detroit directors when they gave their presentations about   electronic commerce We did it a little differently We divided the board ahead of time   into groups on banking, services, retail, and manufacturing--we had done a background   paper for them ahead of time as well--and then they organized the presentations   themselves Many of them did a lot of work preparing for them and I think the   presentations really were very enlightening I came away from that discussion, and from   other things that I have read and heard in talking to people about this, with the feeling   that something profound is clearly happening in electronic commerce and its impact on   firms I just don’t know how significant it is in terms of its impact on the economy It’s   an area where we are all learning and we’re going to continue to learn in the coming   months and years And I look forward to studying in more detail your very helpful   comments at this meeting   As for the decision today, I certainly agree with the 25 basis point increase On   the tilt, I think it’s a very close call I thought the earlier discussion with Don Kohn and   your comments, Mr Chairman, were very helpful I think we are somewhere between   the full tilt and symmetry at this point On balance, I come back to the point I mentioned   before that our credibility--or more specifically, your credibility--is extremely important   and at this point it’s extremely high, too So, I would defer to you on this question But   my preference would be for asymmetry Under the current circumstances I think 25 basis   points and no tilt will be misinterpreted unless accompanied by a very strong statement     6/29-30/99 111   and strong language in your testimony Even then, it still may be misinterpreted as   “that’s it,” as I believe Jack Guynn said So, I prefer the asymmetric directive but I will   defer to you on this   On the question of the tilt itself, I think we clearly have some learning to do   before we know how to use this new tool effectively To quote you, Mr Chairman, this   is one area where we’re engaged in “on-the-job training” It’s a new tool and we’re in a   new environment We have tightened before from symmetrical directives, but this is   new I recall your mentioning at a meeting several years ago that back in 1994 when you   were planning to start a series of tightening moves, you had a great deal of difficulty   signaling that intention to the market at that time Clearly, there’s no difficulty today in   that type of signaling We’ve said that we are going to be more transparent with this tool   If we go with symmetry, I view that as being less transparent  That’s my own personal   view In my mind there are questions about the usefulness of the tilt itself  Just listening   to the discussion around the table today, it’s clear that there are very wide differences   among the members of this Committee as to exactly what the tilt means If we keep the   tool in place, I think we will be using it a lot less than we did before, as was predicted last   year when we discussed this  "
6417,1999-08-24," Mr Chairman, I think this is a very good idea and I’d do it on a   temporary basis I agree with Cathy Minehan that it is an innovative approach and would   show that we are trying to address a very important problem  Three or four years ago I went   to a conference of central bankers and this idea of central banks engaging in options   activities was discussed This was not related to Y2K but was just a discussion of the   general concept, and I actually commented on a paper on it at that time I am just curious as   to whether any other central banks are doing this or even considering it at this time   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Seventh District economy   continues to expand at a moderate pace, with tight labor markets increasingly being cited as   a factor constraining growth Activity in the motor vehicle industry remains a key source of   strength in the District Industry contacts continue to expect 1999 to be a record high year   for sales of both light vehicles and heavy-duty trucks The CEO of a major automaker told   me that one reason is that the affordability of light vehicles is at a 35-year high Elsewhere,   manufacturing conditions are still mixed But based on purchasing managers’ surveys from   across the District, overall activity is expanding For example, the Chicago Purchasing   Managers’ Report for August, which I’ll caution will not be released to the public until a   week from today, will show continued expansion but at a somewhat slower pace than in   July The composite index was 561 in August, down from 605 in July The Chicago   survey for August also showed the prices paid component at above 50 percent for the sixth   consecutive month and at the highest level in more than four years   In terms of specific industries, some gypsum wallboard producers are delaying normal   maintenance in order to keep running overall at 100 percent of capacity The steel industry   continues to show improvement as the import-related inventory overhang is worked down   On the other hand, construction equipment shows a few signs of slowing, and farm   equipment makers have trimmed production plans again For one major farm equipment   producer in our District output this year is expected to be down 30 to 40 percent from last   year, and that seems to be representative of the industry There is no doubt that some   farmers have been adversely impacted by low commodity prices Ironically, it is possible     8/24/99 46   that net cash farm income could be at a record high level this year if the additional farm   subsidy package being considered in Congress is enacted and if funds are disbursed this   year   As all of us have been reporting for a long time, labor markets are very tight The rate   of unemployment for our five-state area fell back to 35 percent in July, after having moved   up to 37 percent in May and June Actually, though, four of our five states were below 35   percent in July The exception was Illinois where we’ve seen a rather sharp increase in the   unemployment rate recently from 39 percent in April to 46 percent in June and July An   economist at the state employment agency did not view the increase as a sign of weakness   but rather attributed it to a surge in the labor force, particularly reentrants who had been out   of the work force for over a year There has been a pickup in demand for temporary   industrial workers, according to my contacts at Manpower In addition, Manpower’s latest   survey results, which won’t be released publicly until next Monday, show hiring plans for   the fourth quarter to be very strong again What is not clear, though, is whether all these   jobs will be filled Increasingly, contacts are reporting that labor shortages are constraining   business activity, either in the form of scaled-back expansion plans or business lost because   of the inability to fully staff current activities This is a widespread phenomenon in our   District, with such reports coming from home builders and other construction firms,   retailers, dining establishments, temporary help firms, and trucking firms just to name a few   Turning to the national economy, our outlook is reasonably similar to that contained   in the Greenbook though we, like Cathy Minehan, remain slightly more pessimistic about   inflation next year Data received since our last meeting continue to suggest that the   economy will gradually return to trend growth rates However, this moderation in growth is   not likely to be enough to alleviate increasing inflationary pressures Indeed, the recent data   on wages, the further increase in oil prices, the rise in other commodity prices, and the   weakness of the dollar all suggest less optimism about cost pressures in the months ahead   Meanwhile, the factors that have been driving the recent rapid expansion of demand--high   levels of wealth, confidence, and income growth--remain with us It appears unlikely that   the policy adjustment we made last time will be enough to significantly lessen the risk of   increasing inflation Without some further adjustments, we risk the kinds of imbalances that   would endanger the economic expansion Thank you, Mr Chairman     8/24/99 47   Mr Chairman, I support your proposal for a 25 basis point increase   and a symmetric directive However, on the directive I just want to associate myself with   what President Poole said about symmetry and asymmetry In my view we should not be   using that tool for the foreseeable future even though I agree with President Stern in that I   personally think the odds are that we are going to be increasing rates again in the not too   distant future In my view we should just make announcements regarding symmetry or   asymmetry if we think they are appropriate The language on the tilt is no longer useful I   think we misunderstood the impact it would have in the financial markets when we used that   tool in May But the fact that we now announce it right after the meeting just confuses the   markets even more So my personal preference is to drop its use completely in the future  "
6439,1999-10-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Seventh District economy, with the   notable exception of the agricultural sector, remains on a moderate growth path with activity in   most sectors at very high levels A key driving force continues to be the strength in demand for   automobiles and light trucks Sales of light vehicles again were quite robust in September, as Mike   Prell mentioned, and automakers have raised their sales forecasts for next year Similarly, many   small and medium sized manufacturing firms surveyed by our directors are forecasting good   economic performance in their sectors for as far as two to three years ahead Producers of   consumer durables, such as appliances and lawn and garden equipment, are benefiting from a   relatively strong regional housing market The District’s share of domestic steel production has   increased significantly in recent months and solid performance continues to be reported by contacts   in the printing and publishing industry Some producers of heavy-duty trucks, paper and   packaging, food equipment, and some housing construction materials reported a recent moderation   in activity, but none voiced concern because activity has remained at very high levels For   example, orders for heavy-duty trucks are still considered to be good, although they have come   down recently in part because order books are being cleared out, which is the normal practice at   this time of the year   The agricultural sector remains weak, though there has been some slight improvement from   what I reported at our last meeting Over the past few weeks I have met with members from the   Illinois Farm Bureau as well as our own Agriculture Advisory Council Council members noted   that dairy farmers are benefiting from low feed costs resulting from unbelievably good hay   production and a good corn crop Members also reported that they were pleased with corn yields     10/5/99 26   except in Indiana where dry summer weather limited yields Of course, with the low grain prices,   grain farmers are still under a great deal of pressure Moreover, egg, poultry, and hog prices are   below the cost of production, which will lead to adjustments over the next 12 to 18 months that will   result in reduced supplies and higher prices In addition, farm equipment manufacturers have   announced further production cuts that will result in layoffs   Labor markets remain tight, with scattered reports of shortages for entry-level workers,   truck drivers, farm laborers, construction workers, and some management positions However,   contacts generally indicate that wage gains remain in the same range seen over the past two years   or so; that is in contrast to the national data on average hourly earnings and employment costs,   which show some moderation The labor contract negotiations in the automobile industry have   proceeded rather smoothly so far My contacts at the major automakers describe the terms of the   Daimler-Chrysler and the GM contracts as definitely more expensive than last time Wage gains   are 3 percent per year plus a cost of living allowance, and signing bonuses and pensions were   improved The new contracts place some restrictions on outsourcing, but they are not as severe as   reported in the press Automakers are required to send a letter to suppliers requesting them to be   neutral on unionizing efforts, but the letter is not expected to have any significant effect The new   contracts are for four years rather than three years Nonetheless, neither the automakers nor the   United Automobile Workers expect the contracts to set a pattern for suppliers or for labor   negotiations in other industries   In terms of price developments, there are some concerns about the future but so far a pickup   in the underlying inflation rate is not evident Several manufacturers noted that higher energy   prices were likely to raise their input costs in the future Sharp increases in health insurance costs,   especially for prescriptions, were also noted I had an interesting conversation with a national   specialty retailer who has stores all over the country He noted that higher construction costs are   significantly increasingly his occupancy costs and resulting in 1 to 2 percent increases in his overall   operating costs for new stores as compared with existing stores For the most part, however, firms   continue to have little pricing power and seek to lower costs through various means or increased   labor productivity, or both As one of the members of our Small Businesses Advisory Council put   it, “We continue to look for more efficiencies since no one is interested in paying us more money   just because our health insurance premium rose 21 percent recently”   Turning to the national economy, our outlook is quite similar to that in the Greenbook The   strength of domestic demand has been very impressive since our last meeting The third quarter     10/5/99 27   appears to have been remarkably strong and some of the momentum should carry forward The   slowing in domestic demand that we continue to expect seems no closer now than at our last   meeting Moreover, while there clearly are downside risks, foreign demand continues to pick up   and we are losing that safety valve Given those trends, the labor market could tighten even a bit   more, raising the risk of accelerating inflation Of course, we’ve been forecasting an acceleration   of inflation for a while and core inflation has continued to edge down But, clearly, some of the   factors that have contributed to that decline have turned around--the value of the dollar, the price of   oil and other commodities, and health insurance premiums One can now even point to at least   some evidence of pipeline inflationary pressures in the PPI data So, even with the policy actions   we have taken to date, in my judgment the risks still seem to be tilted to the upside   Thank you, Mr Chairman I agree with your recommendation of “B”   asymmetric And I certainly agree with your statement that we should be humble about our ability   to forecast the future We’ve talked about this, and it’s a concern that nags us all   I do want to note two points about the forecast that I thought were worth mentioning to this   group even though we have some questions about the forecast  But if we accept the Greenbook   forecast as it is, I thought it was striking that, in the alternative scenarios the staff presented, core   CPI in 2000 varied by only 01 of a point, from 27 to 28 percent There was virtually no   difference in any of the scenarios It’s almost as if that is baked in the cake already in this forecast   Of course, the output varies significantly   The second point is that if we adjust core CPI on a consistent methodological basis going   backward, that 27 percent forecast for the year 2000 will be the highest rate of increase in core CPI   since 1992 when it was 29 percent on that adjusted basis So, those are two points that really   concern me as I look at this forecast Of course, the forecast may be wrong, as we all know, but   these are the points of concern   On the question of how to disclose this to the public, I participated in the discussion   yesterday with Roger Ferguson’s group and I described our effort as looking for the “least worst”   option among the three that you presented None of them is really satisfactory at this point I do   not think we should freeze the use of this tool between now and the time the working group’s   report comes out and we make a decision on what we’re going to do I have a slight preference for   the recommendation you made for using language instead of the tool itself at this point We made   a mistake when we adopted this procedure I just remember the problems we had when we used it   last time So I would have a slight preference for using language instead of the actual tool of   asymmetry  "
6462,1999-11-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Seventh District economy   continues to be quite healthy, but reports from our directors and other business contacts suggest   that activity is moderating somewhat in a number of sectors At the same time, we are also   getting more frequent reports of increasing wages as a result of still very tight labor markets We   have seen some slowing in housing activity, but that sector seems to be holding up better than   elsewhere in the nation Many of our retailers indicate that sales have been running below   expectations recently, but they generally remain quite optimistic about the upcoming holiday   sales season   Nationally, sales of autos and light trucks have come down from the stratospheric   levels reported for the third quarter Of course, the 16½ million light vehicles sold in October     11/16/99 25   still represents a very high sales level Indeed, that base is 1 million above total sales for all of   last year, which the industry considered a very good year In fact, some of the automakers and   suppliers we have talked to welcome some moderation in activity Some suppliers tell us that   they are actually losing money on incremental business when activity is as high as it has been   because of their high marginal input costs   Some potential slowing is also apparent in the heavy truck industry where the backlog   has been whittled down from 9 months to just over 7 months, but that is still higher than the   historical norm One of our former directors noted that shortages of truck drivers have led his   firm to cut back in ordering new trucks Reports also indicate some slowing in cement, paper,   and printing, although business is still considered to be good in these industries In contrast, the   medium-duty truck industry shows no signs of slowing, our steel industry continues to improve,   and gypsum wallboard shipments are still up sharply from a year ago   The District’s farm economy, however, continues to struggle as a result of abundant   supplies and low commodity prices On the other hand, one large farm equipment manufacturer   that I was talking to surprised me by saying that they plan to boost production next year and   rehire workers they laid off even though demand for the firm’s products is going to remain weak   The reason is that the firm significantly reduced dealer inventories this year They took a lot of   products out of the pipeline and they are going to have to restock next year   Our labor markets are still very, very tight However, the latest Manpower survey of   hiring intentions indicates that most industries will continue extensive recruiting efforts into next   year’s first quarter--more of the same This report, of course, should be considered confidential   until it is publicly released next Monday, the 22nd So far actual price increases continue to be   subdued However, our latest survey of Michigan retailers indicates that they plan to raise prices   over the next three months and most purchasing managers around the District continue to report   paying higher prices for their inputs   Y2K, of course, remains a big question mark in the near-term outlook We have   checked with a wide variety of businesses, and the general sense we get is that companies feel   they are prepared, although concerns remain about the readiness of firms abroad We made a   special effort to contact convention and tourism bureaus in our major metropolitan areas, and   they said that they had not heard of any adverse impact on business plans for early next year In   fact, they were all pretty optimistic that Y2K would actually boost business for them     11/16/99 26   Turning to the national economy, the Board’s staff has raised its forecast of output   growth in the next few quarters, as Mike mentioned, but it has raised its estimate of trend growth   even more Thus in the Greenbook scenario, growth slows to below potential, easing some of   the pressures in the labor market Even so, core CPI inflation accelerates markedly by 2001 to a   level that on a methodologically consistent basis would be the worst since 1995 We, too, have   raised our estimates of productivity growth and potential output, although not to the extent of the   Board’s staff But we don’t see actual growth falling below these higher levels of potential over   the forecast period Certainly the higher long-term interest rates that have already impacted the   housing market should act as restraint, but business and consumer confidence remains quite high,   and the stock market, of course, has recovered most of its recent losses More importantly, in   contrast to the last few years, with improved conditions abroad we expect much less drag from   the external sector, similar to the Greenbook Thus we see growth slowing only to about its new   trend and only after labor market conditions have become slightly tighter Not surprisingly, we   are even more pessimistic than the Greenbook about inflation Hard evidence like consumer   price pressures outside the energy sector is still scarce, but the continued increases in the PPI are   worrisome   Thus, I think we need to be especially careful not to sacrifice the progress toward price   stability that has been a cornerstone of this expansion The low inflation environment is clearly   responsible for some of the faster productivity growth that we have experienced, and we all want   to maintain that momentum   Mr Chairman, I agree completely with your recommendation I   think the risks of not moving are much higher I do feel asymmetric, but it would be very   misleading and confusing to the markets for us to come out with an asymmetric directive So I   agree with both parts of your recommendation   Mr Chairman, I understand the difficulty of trying to do something   as a committee, and ultimately I think we do have to defer to you on the language of this But I   do find the first sentence of the third paragraph troublesome I think we could delete the   sentence and just modify the following sentence about the directive and symmetry, and we’d   have it right   I was with the majority on this one I liked alternative I  The   problem I had with alternative II, which is close to where we are today, is that phrase “possible   need for an adjustment in the stance of policy” It just gives the impression that it is more likely   that we’re going to be making an adjustment in policy--that we are going to be changing rates-­  than if we take a step back and talk just about the balance of risks So I like the balance of risks   approach better It appears less likely that we have our finger on the trigger and we’re ready to   pull the trigger and make the move at the next meeting So, I favor alternative I  "
6486,1999-12-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman I want to ask Mike a question about   the outlook for automobile sales next year The Greenbook projection for sales of light   vehicles is 166 million, and I am sure you know that the auto companies are estimating   around 159 million We had a symposium at our Bank a few weeks ago with a group of   forecasters from the region, and they were coming in around that same level--159 or 158   million even I am just curious as to why the Greenbook is so much higher than the   consensus forecast and the forecast of the auto companies themselves at this point   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Seventh District economy   continues to be strong Many of our retailers indicate that sales have been ahead of   expectations since Thanksgiving There are always some retailers who are nervous and, as   one major retailer noted late last week, the play is at the plate  The light vehicles market   continues to boom  We are seeing a modest shift in the composition of sales away from   light trucks back toward passenger cars, and this shift bodes well for our District as we have   a relatively higher concentration in the production of passenger cars than light trucks   The situation in the farm economy is unchanged, with large grain inventories and   low commodity prices Even so, bankers we have talked to in the agricultural areas are   feeling more comfortable because of the government subsidy checks that have recently gone   out to farmers; those checks have added substantially to total farm income   Our directors and other business contacts also continue to cite very tight labor   markets and increasing wage pressures Some restaurant chains that we look at have had   substantial gains in productivity negated at least in part by increases in overtime costs Ed   Boehne mentioned the shortage of truck drivers One of our former directors who runs a   large trucking company noted that the shortage of truck drivers has led his firm to cut back   on new truck orders He maintains that he could use 500 more drivers if he could get them   In a similar vein, a major construction equipment manufacturer observed that his firm   expects no growth in near-term sales because of the labor shortages facing construction   contractors Prices continue to be subdued; still, the pricing environment seems to be   changing Contacts in the steel industry reported some upward movement in prices As   Jerry Jordan mentioned before, not only have steel scrap prices gone up, so have contract   prices for steel deliveries in the year 2000 These contract prices are up about 1 percent     12/21/99 31   relative to a year ago This compares with contract prices that were down 5 percent in 1999   relative to 1998 We are also getting reports that advertising prices are moving up To give   some idea of the high volume of advertising, one large magazine printer mentioned to me   that several major business magazines, including Forbes and Fortune, are now limiting the   amount of advertising pages they can accept because they have reached a binding constraint   on their maximum page count   The Chicago Purchasing Managers’ report indicates that the overall index as well as   the prices paid and the supply and delivery components moved down in December, but all   three components remained well above the 50 percent level I would remind you that these   data should be treated confidentially, as they won’t be released until December 30th   Jerry Jordan, as for basketball tickets, I can assure you that the price of tickets for the   Chicago Bulls games did not go up this year [Laughter] They are still $80   Y2K remains a question mark in the near term Firms in our District indicate that   they have made extensive preparation and they are ready Many have set up centralized   Y2K communication centers In fact, a large temporary help firm in our District indicated   that it has seen a heavy demand for temporary workers to staff these centers   Finally, in response to a question about inventory building, the head of a national   trucking firm observed that there was no need to worry about a buildup in retail inventories   for Y2K Business for his customers was so strong that they couldn’t build inventories if   they wanted to   Turning to the national economy, our views have changed little since we last met   We remain in broad agreement with the general contours of the Greenbook forecast Final   domestic demand continues to run quite strong, as consumers and businesses spend their   way to the end of the year Given this momentum in final demand, labor markets may   tighten slightly more in the next few months even as output growth decelerates to trend   Despite this, incoming labor compensation data have remained benign as productivity   growth has repeatedly exceeded our expectations However, the data now in hand suggest   that the deceleration in our price measures has ended Indeed, it seems likely that price and   wage movements will worsen in the year ahead as we see the lagged effects of previous oil   price hikes and changes in the dollar exchange rate     12/21/99 32   Consequently, as has been true for some time, we are concerned that core   inflationary pressures are likely to increase markedly over the next few quarters Of course,   I recognize that several key aspects of the outlook are quite uncertain First, as we discussed   earlier, we can’t predict with any confidence the future path of stock prices or the wealth   effects that they may induce And I continue to be concerned about high valuation levels for   the stock market, particularly for the Internet stocks Second, we don’t really know whether   productivity growth will slow, remain high, or continue to accelerate Third, although the   futures market points to declining oil prices in the year ahead, the oil market has surprised   us before, and consumer confidence may be quite vulnerable to such shocks Despite these   considerations, I believe the risks to the outlook are on the upside However, given the   uncertainties associated with the upcoming century rollover, this is not the time to be   aggressive   Mr Chairman, I agree it is a close call I think both drafts   accomplish the same objective I happen to prefer the symmetric one First of all, it’s   technically accurate, as you pointed out, whereas the asymmetric one is not technically   accurate If the markets don’t understand it in 15 minutes, clearly they are going to   understand the language as soon as they read it I think it’s very clear And I agree with   Jerry Jordan that, hopefully, we are going to change to a new announcement policy as of the   February meeting, so I just wouldn’t muddy the waters by using an asymmetric directive at   this point   I’ll be very brief I just want to add a couple of points I am in the   majority here; I prefer the language that is in the Ferguson memo I just want to point out   that we discussed this at great length in the Working Group Memos have been exchanged,   e-mails have been exchanged, and I forget the number of meetings we’ve had but it has been   many So we have discussed it at great length already The key here, as I see it, is that we   are trying to educate the public; we are trying to get away from the notion that we are   automatically going to move at the next meeting and that we have our finger on the trigger   and are ready to act That is really, from my standpoint, our key objective And what the   Ferguson language does is to take a step back and put the balance of risks on the table rather   than the possible need for a change in the stance of policy Larry Meyer said that the   markets are going to read right through this to our “true intentions” I’m not sure that is   going to happen because over time they are going to see that it isn’t a good predictor of what   we will do If history is any guide, it predicts what we are going to do only half of the time     12/21/99 66   So, I think we may be able to educate the market over time At least this takes a step back   from the notion that we are automatically going to change our policy at the next meeting   That was driving my thinking on this issue from the beginning and I think the way the   proposed language is phrased now follows through on that point  "
6509,2000-02-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Seventh District economy entered   the New Year with considerable momentum  To date, higher interest rates have had only a   marginal impact on the traditionally interest-sensitive sectors like autos and housing  Auto   producers expect 2000 to be the second best year ever for sales of light vehicles, following last   year’s record-setting pace  Thus far, the automakers see few signs of slowing  And reports from   our District directors indicate that sales at District auto dealers generally were brisk in January    The numbers we heard this morning seem to bear that out                                     attended the   National Automobile Dealers Association meeting in Orlando in January and reported that the   auto dealers were very upbeat and bullish about the outlook for this year   The housing sector in the Midwest continues to outperform the nation for reasons I   don’t fully understand  The head of a distribution company that sells building materials to          58  Chicago-area construction firms told me that his customers who are residential contractors have   seen no slowing thus far and are booked for at least the next six months in the Chicago   metropolitan area     Retailers’ sales of appliances and home furnishings are still quite strong  More   generally, the holiday shopping season was exceptionally good for most District retailers    Inventory levels at the beginning of the year were described as rational, not excessive, thus   requiring little aggressive promotional activity in January  Also, the steel industry in particular is   benefiting from strength in autos, appliances, and other consumer durables, with steel order   books said to be solid and showing little tapering off of demand in January, similar to what Jerry   Jordan said earlier   It is difficult, if not impossible, to find any signs of easing in our very tight labor   markets  In fact, very preliminary results from Manpower’s latest survey of hiring intentions   show net hiring strength near a 22-year high, and that’s both before and after the seasonal   adjustments that they do  These results should be treated confidentially since they won’t be   released until February 28th  Wage gains in the temporary help industry remain in the 3 to 5   percent range of the past few years but recently seem to be concentrated in the higher end of that   range  Our directors report significant or record shortages of nurses for retirement homes,   truckers, and construction workers  And in some cases these shortages are constraining activity    For example, a major heavy-duty truck manufacturer cited the shortage of truck drivers as a   major reason for the recent softness in orders for heavy trucks at his firm     Manufacturers generally continue to face higher prices for some of their inputs such as   energy, steel, copper, and aluminum, but they still say they cannot pass these higher costs on to   their customers  Increasingly, we are hearing that the Internet is helping to hold prices down           59  For example, the head of a major auto company told me that they estimate that 55 percent of car   buyers now use the Internet to get information on pricing before they even enter the showroom   Turning to the nation, despite the surprisingly strong fourth quarter, our outlook for   growth in 2000 is at nearly 4 percent  Unfortunately, like the Greenbook we see core CPI   inflation rising this year to about 2-1/2 percent and core PCE inflation to about 2 percent  There   appear to be few weak sectors in the outlook at this moment  Employment growth continues to   be strong and inventory accumulations seem reasonably balanced on the whole  Consumer   spending in 2000 seems headed for at least moderately strong growth in spite of the restraining   course of higher interest rates that we expect over the period  The high levels of the stock   market continue to propel consumers forward, and this continues to be a risk for the outlook   Last week we convened a meeting of our Academic Advisory Council  A major topic   of discussion was growth in potential GDP  Most participants were skeptical that the growth in   potential output was as high as our estimate of 3-1/2 percent and, of course, questioned whether   the faster productivity increases were sustainable     Our inflation outlook for 2000 envisions a ½ percentage point pickup in core inflation   with a further rise in 2001  So, regardless of which core inflation measure one uses, it’s difficult   to accept that the degree of acceleration forecast for core inflation is consistent with price   stability  And that, of course, is an area of major concern      Thank you, Mr Chairman  This is an interesting discussion, but   from a practical standpoint I come back to exactly the same place I have been the last 11 times I   have been here when we have discussed this  And that is that we should not make any change in   the ranges  I think it would be misleading to the public for us to make a change unless there is a          99  huge education program up front  As others have said, a change would give the impression that   we are placing a lot of weight on these ranges in the formulation of monetary policy and we   aren’t  I think the communications challenges are significant--not insurmountable, but very   significant--because a lot of people don’t accept the premise that the economy’s potential growth   rate is as high as many people around this table think it is these days  So we’d have to explain   that as well; otherwise people are going to think that moving these ranges up indicates that we   are going to be conducting monetary policy in a way that they would view as inflationary     Finally, on the inflation target issue, the question is really whether we should have a   quantitative inflation target  That is a very important issue and I think it is one that should be   discussed, but in my view it should be discussed separately and not in the context of these   monetary policy ranges  It is something on which reasonable people obviously disagree  We   have disagreement around this table  I believe it is important to discuss it, but I really think it   calls for a separate discussion entirely    Thank you, Mr Chairman  There was a table in today’s Wall Street   Journal  I don’t know how many people saw it, but it listed a series of possible Fed actions   today, gave the odds on them and the likely market reaction  It had all the different scenarios   we’ve talk about--an increase in the funds rate of 25 or 50 basis points, with a tilt or without, and   so on  And the last line in the table was a rate cut by the Fed  The odds were “as likely as the   Cubs winning the World Series”  [Laughter]   And the likely market reaction was “holy cow!”    [Laughter]  I found that very upsetting  Obviously, there is no chance we are going to lower   rates today, but Cubs fans are always optimistic!          139  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation very strongly  I think the strategy of   incremental moves is an excellent one, supporting the markets when they are right and helping   confirm their inclinations  It seems clear that if we do not move today, that would not only   jeopardize the expansion but would also jeopardize our credibility as well, which is so important   I should note that our outlook assumes a fed funds path that has a decidedly upward   drift over the forecast horizon  And even with that strong upward tilt, we project a deterioration   in the inflation outlook  Regardless of whether we look at the core PCE or the core CPI or all   those measures that I mentioned yesterday, inflation is still going up  So in my judgment, an   increase of 25 basis points is not going to be enough over the forecast horizon  I believe, as you   said, that we should be thinking of a series of moves to make sure that we correct the imbalance   between aggregate demand and aggregate supply  I think it’s also very important that we say   that the balance of risks is tilted to higher inflation for exactly the reasons that you explained so   articulately  "
6534,2000-03-21,"  I had a question on the inventory-sales ratios, Mike  As we look   back, those ratios have been improving for some time now and I view that as a sort of structural   improvement due to improved management techniques, some improved technologies, and better   communications  In the Greenbook this time you talked about “B2B” Internet connections as   one of the reasons for the improvement  I'm wondering if you see that as something special that   has happened or as just a continuation of this longer-term trend that we've been seeing for some   time    So it's more of the same, a structural change?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our last meeting, the incoming   data for our District have been quite strong  In fact, except for agriculture it is hard to find a   weak sector in our District  For example, as has been true for the better part of a year, our   housing sector has performed better than the nation’s, with both displaying surprising resilience              - 59 -     in the face of higher interest rates  Unlike Philadelphia, we don't have even a hint of a slowing in   our housing sector   Consumer spending has also been very strong, especially on the durable goods side    One of our directors from a major national retailer describes consumer demand for VCRs, DVD   players, TVs, and all sorts of electronic products as insatiable  Light vehicle sales were   unbelievable in February, reaching a 19 million unit pace  On average, the Big Three expect   March sales of about 17½ million units, and their projections for calendar year 2000 average just   under 17 million units now   The District’s core industries are doing well by and large  The Chicago purchasing   managers’ report, which will not be publicly released until March 31, indicates continued solid   gains in our local industrial sector, with the overall index rising slightly and the production and   new orders indexes both remaining well above 50  Orders for medium trucks rose in February,   as wealth effects continued to support spending on RVs, campers, and the like   About ten days ago we had a meeting of our Advisory Council on Agriculture, Labor,   and Small Business  Agricultural representatives were pessimistic about prospects for operating   profits, with low commodity prices and high fuel prices squeezing many farmers, especially   those in hogs and grains  But given the upcoming election year, they were quite optimistic about   the chances of even more Federal subsidies  [Laughter]  This optimism may be inducing some   slight increase in what had been very weak purchases of agricultural machinery  Small business   representatives generally reported that business was strong, with one person summarizing her   view as “two thumbs up!”  Loans are readily available to businesses with reasonable prospects    The District's tight labor market was the major topic of discussion by all three groups, with firms   generally reporting increases in employee turnover or non-wage expenses to attract and keep              - 60 -     workers, or both  The council members generally agreed that it was taking longer to fill   positions, with an executive of one large national temporary services firm reporting that the   average time to fill orders nationally had increased from seven days to ten days over the last six   months  On the productivity side, many members expressed concern about the skill levels of   their job applicants  We hear conflicting stories about wage gains  Some advisory council   members characterized recent wage hikes as being fairly stable and mostly in the 3 to 4 percent   range  However, another national temporary services firm reported that it has been seeing an   acceleration in wages since the beginning of this year, with increases of 6 to 7 percent on a   national basis compared to 4 to 5 percent last year    Turning to the national economy, since our January meeting we have increased our   real GDP forecast for 2000 by 1/2 percentage point and our overall forecast is now very similar   to the Greenbook forecast  Every sector of the economy appears to be stronger today than at the   time of our previous meeting  The current growth in household spending is breathtaking and   seems unlikely to abate any time soon  This is no doubt due in part to the tremendous run-up in   equity prices that we’ve seen   On the inflation front, we continue to envision an acceleration in core PCE inflation of   04 percentage point in both 2000 and 2001  And the outlook for the core CPI includes a   comparable degree of acceleration  Going forward, it is clear to me that without significant   action by this Committee, growth in aggregate demand will continue to outstrip growth in   aggregate supply and inflation will deteriorate    Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation  I, too, am where   I was at the last meeting  I believe the gradual approach is a very wise way for this Committee   to proceed     On the interpretation of the balance of risks, I just want to add one little footnote  In   our discussion of this approach when we adopted it, we made it very clear that we automatically   reexamine our position at each subsequent meeting based on the new data that have come in and   the forecast  So there is nothing we say that is forever, obviously  Everything is automatically   reexamined at the next meeting  I thought we all understood that when we endorsed this policy   strategy  "
6554,2000-05-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Mike, I wanted to ask you about the   wealth effect assumptions in the Greenbook  I am particularly interested in what you are   assuming about the carryover effect of the increases in the stock market that we saw in 1999   and in previous years  You are assuming a flat stock market in the baseline and you indicated   that there would be a small negative in terms of the wealth effect in the second half of this   year and a negative of about 1/2 point in 2001  I'm just wondering how you are factoring in   the impact of the increase in the stock market in earlier years in these assumptions    How powerful are the increases in previous years on this year's   consumption?     Why are they turning negative then?    I understand that, but I would have thought the impact of the   previous years would have had a larger impact this year because I know the effects don’t   occur just within that one year    What was the effect in the first half of this year?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Seventh District economy   continues to perform quite well, but the tone of reports from our contacts has changed   recently, as several noted some slowing in activity  A growing number of firms indicated   increasing cost pressures and some new reports emerged related to tight labor markets   In terms of real activity, our housing sector still seems to be doing well but we are   starting to hear more stories of slowing  Reports on light vehicle sales in the District have   been mixed, with some of our directors reporting continued strength, particularly in luxury   models, but dealers in several metro areas reporting weak sales and reduced showroom traffic    Two of the Big Three auto makers told us late last week that they were sensing some slowing   in light vehicle sales on a national basis, although expected sales levels are still quite high  A   large national retailer headquartered in our District told me his company had seen no signs   that sales were slowing nationally this month  However, some retailers told us that their sales      42  in the Midwest last month were not as strong as elsewhere in the nation, perhaps due to the   weather   Purchasing managers’ survey results from Chicago, Detroit, and Milwaukee all   show continued expansion in April, but at a slightly slower pace than in March  The prices   paid components from the regional PMI reports were down only slightly from five-year highs   reached in March, suggesting that District firms are facing increased cost pressures  Indeed,   several large manufacturing firms who have a history of continuous cost reductions told us   recently that it is becoming more and more difficult to get cost reductions from suppliers and   that they face increasing price pressures on a wide variety of inputs  And our survey of   Michigan retailers suggests that prices to consumers are also moving up, as the number of   respondents raising their prices grew sharply in March     Our labor markets are still tighter than the nation’s  Moreover, there does not seem   to be any let-up in demand for workers  Manpower's latest survey of hiring intentions set a   new record  More firms than ever before in the survey's 24-year history indicated that they   plan to increase employment in the third quarter, with strength across all regions of the nation   as well as across all industries  That information is not going to be released publicly until   May 22nd, so I ask you to please treat it confidentially   The employment cost index for the Midwest has recently been rising faster than   that for the nation as a whole  That is consistent with the findings of some research our staff   has done, which confirms that relative unemployment rates continue to be useful predictors of   regional differences in wage growth  In some cases tight labor markets are holding back   business expansion  For example, one auto supplier recently closed a Michigan plant because   there weren't enough workers available to staff it  And 70 percent of the respondents to our      43  latest survey of Michigan retailers said customer service was suffering because of worker   shortages   On the whole, most firms have been more successful in expanding employment   than the very low unemployment rates would suggest  Increasingly we have been hearing   anecdotal reports that unmeasured immigration may be playing a significant role in this   employment growth, as you have suggested in recent meetings, Mr Chairman  Of course,   immigrants have long had a significant presence in large cities like Chicago, but official   statistics suggest that the immigrant share of the labor force in other parts of the District is   neither high nor increasing  However, I recently visited Columbus, Indiana, a manufacturing   center of about 35,000 people where Cummins Engines is located and where the   unemployment rate is 19 percent  I heard extensive reports that the town has seen a   tremendous increase in immigrants from Latin America in the last few years  It was estimated   that 1,000 to 2,000 immigrants were now working in area firms  The story is similar in other   small-to-medium size towns in our District  Incidentally,                                         told me that   he had contacted the INS because of concerns that many immigrants were undocumented    The INS responded that they lacked the resources to investigate these cases unless they   involved troublemakers  Of course, the city’s employers need the immigrants to staff their   plants and other facilities   Turning to the national outlook, recent data have led us to increase our projections   for growth and for inflation in 2000  Gains in employment and hours continue to be   impressive and the consumption sector remained red-hot through the first quarter  Our real   GDP growth path is slightly stronger than that in the Greenbook  Although consumers will   eventually slow their spending pace, we are expecting less slowing in the second half of this      44  year than the Greenbook  The inflation data are beginning to show signs of deterioration, and   our outlook for PCE inflation is roughly similar to that in the Greenbook over the next 18   months     So, the key question at this juncture is whether the policy actions we have taken to   date are sufficient to put the economy on a sustainable track  Consumer expectations continue   to be quite elevated and the wealth effect from prior years' equity gains has probably not run   its course  We have been waiting for a slowdown in aggregate demand for some time    Although this hope has not been realized, the increased inflationary consequences to date have   been minimal  But I am not as optimistic this time around  In my view the balance of risks is   clearly weighted toward higher inflation       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I strongly support your   recommendation for a 50 basis point increase and for a balance of risks sentence tilted toward   higher inflation  I recognize that there is some uncertainty about how far we will need to go   and I personally think we are going to have

6579,2000-06-27,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our May meeting, the number of   reports suggesting slowing in activity seems to have increased, but our assessment is that the   Seventh District economy is still quite healthy given that the slowing has been from high levels   of activity  Housing industry contacts describe activity as still strong but slowing  Retailers   indicate that sales have been below expectations in part due to unfavorable weather  Contacts           42  report slowing in sales of building materials but also tell us that sales of appliances, electronics,   and home furnishings are still strong, reflecting the typical lags in the housing markets  Light   motor vehicle sales have come down from the first quarter’s record pace but are still at very   high levels, with the auto makers currently estimating that June sales will be in the 16-1/2   million to 17 million unit range     In terms of manufacturing, the latest Chicago Purchasing Managers’ Survey results   show activity picking up in June, with both production and orders moving higher  This   information should be treated confidentially since it won’t be publicly released until this Friday    That report also suggested some modest easing in price pressures from May and indicated that   factory employment declined in June  A national temporary help firm headquartered in our   District reported that demand for temporary manufacturing workers was definitely weaker than   a year ago, particularly in the Midwest, although overall demand for workers was still up  More   generally, our labor markets are still very tight   When giving speeches lately I’m starting to get almost as many questions about high   gasoline prices in the Midwest as I am about interest rates  Special factors seem to have   contributed to large but transitory price increases  Inventories were low to begin with,   particularly for gasoline that met the area’s new reformulated gas requirements, and there were   a couple of pipeline disruptions in the Midwest  And while few seem to mention this, consumer   demand for gasoline seems to be stronger than had been anticipated  Not unexpectedly, the   increase in gas prices has sparked considerable political interest  The State of Indiana has   suspended its 5 percent gasoline sales tax, effective July 1, and the Governor of Illinois has   called a special legislative session to consider doing something similar             43  Last week the Chairman attended our board meeting at which our Chicago and   Detroit branch directors discussed the impact of e-commerce and the Internet on their   companies and their industries  This was a follow-up to a similar discussion that we had at our   June 1999 meeting  And this year we will be compiling and distributing a summary to you, as   some of you requested     The consensus among our directors was that there has been a definite acceleration in   productivity in their industries over the past three years as a result of investment in information   processing equipment and utilization of the Internet  Their firms have shifted their focus toward   B2B and away from B2C applications over the last six to twelve months  In fact, it was   reported that the number of online marketplaces nationwide has increased from 600 to 1800   over the past year  Most firms, especially the small and medium-sized companies, are just   beginning to scratch the surface in terms of realizing the potential of the technology to enhance   productivity and improve operations  One of our directors told us about a new service that his   company offers that would have been unprofitable without the Internet  They now make   available to any used car buyer, whether a consumer or a dealer, a complete report on the   history of any vehicle in the system for a $10 or $20 fee  That report includes information on   major accidents, retitling of the vehicle as a result of its previously having been totaled or been   in a flood, and so forth  There are about 35 million used car transactions in the United States   annually and about 10 percent involve cars that had major mechanical or structural flaws  This   new service is based on information the company already collects, which tracks all motor   vehicle titles and registrations in the country; the data are maintained on line and linked via   unique vehicle identification numbers  The new service has grown rapidly and now has 11,000   participating dealers and 112 other Web partners  So, in summary, our directors agreed that the           44  new technology has allowed them to lower costs and provide new services  Although they   found it difficult to quantify the value of these innovations, they are convinced that they are   very significant      Turning to the national economy, our outlook for real GDP growth and core PCE   inflation is essentially the same as that in the Greenbook, although our assumptions are   somewhat different  The intermeeting data suggest a modest slowing in the pace of economic   activity, but I share the Greenbook’s caution against giving those data too much weight in the   current projections  If the next few months show similar signs of moderation, then that would   be significant     Last week we convened a group of academic and business economists at our Bank to   discuss the current outlook  The academics argued that monetary policy had been overly   expansionary throughout 1999 and even perhaps earlier  In their view, the current stance of   policy is only mildly restraining and is insufficient to remove the previous policy stimulus  On   the other hand, some of the business economists felt that monetary policy is currently quite tight   and is largely responsible for the recent softening in the reported data  A common element in   each group’s discussion was uncertainty about the FOMC’s current inflation goal  They felt   that the Committee’s recent shift in focus to the lower PCE inflation measure instead of the   consumer price index had complicated matters  But regardless of the measure used, our core   inflation forecasts are all tilted upward, and that’s troublesome  My own view is that inflation   should be lower than our current forecast and that we need to articulate that clearly as we   contemplate further actions    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  "
6603,2000-08-22,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with both parts of your   recommendation  I think this is a time to pause and take stock  We have seen slowdowns before that   were just temporary and the expansion picked up again quite rapidly  And there is the question of   whether a slowing in growth that is more sustainable would be enough to cap inflation or whether the   economy really has to grow at rates below trend in order to relieve some of the pressure that has been   built up  Obviously this is an open question  If the inflation data deteriorate due to energy as you          82   discussed, or for other reasons, or if demand expands further beyond potential output, then I think we   have to be prepared to act very quickly  But for now I believe it is appropriate to follow your advice    And I certainly agree that the balance of risks clearly is tilted toward higher inflation  "
6627,2000-10-03,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  On balance, the economic expansion in the   Seventh District continues to show signs of slowing amidst continued tight labor markets and reports   of increasing pressure on profit margins from higher costs, particularly for wages, health care   benefits, and energy  So far competition has kept many firms from passing these costs along in the   form of higher prices to customers, but several contacts felt that we were nearing the point where   prices might have to give  The vast majority of our contacts continue to report a slowing in activity,   with the list of industries now including retailing, housing, motor vehicles--especially heavy trucks--   railcars, steel, aluminum, plastic, cement, wallboard, and paper  One of our directors who serves on   several corporate boards noted that there will be more reports from the truck and heavy equipment   industries of layoffs and downsizing in addition to those that have already been announced by firms   such as Navistar  Another director reported that auto dealers are concerned that it might take even   larger incentives to work down their currently high inventory levels   Having noted the large number of reports of slowing, there are a few caveats I’d like to   mention  First, while the trend seems to suggest a slowing, housing markets have been mixed of   late, perhaps reflecting lower mortgage rates as Dave Stockton and others have mentioned this      49  morning  Second, reports continue to suggest that purchases of home-related items like furniture and   appliances remain strong  And finally, overall manufacturing in our District appears to have   expanded modestly in September  Composite indexes from surveys of purchasing managers in   Chicago, Detroit, and Milwaukee all moved back above the 50 percent level--to the 51 to 52 percent   range--after all three indexes were below 50 percent in August    At our last meeting I said we had seen a few signs of possible easing in labor markets, but   that does not seem to be the case now  Our Advisory Council on Agriculture, Labor, and Small   Business met in September and, like our directors and other business contacts, they spent   considerable time discussing the problems of finding and retaining quality workers  For example,   our agricultural council members noted that cattlemen are ready to build a new packing plant in Iowa   but have been unable to find a community in which to build it in large part due to labor shortages    Small businesses noted that quality-of-life issues such as scholarships for employees’ children, time   off, fitness centers, and so on were coming to the fore in recruitment  And the labor advisory group   reported that employee turnover had increased, so there has been more focus on retention strategies,   often in the form of staying bonuses and more training and development     In terms of an anecdote closer to home, the Chicago Fed recently hosted the System   Leadership Conference  Of the three electives offered--one was on technology, one was on media   relations, and the third was on retaining and attracting people--by far the most popular among the 60   some odd people from the System who attended the conference was the one on retaining and   attracting people   For the most part our contacts continue to say that gains in productivity enable them to   pay higher wages without raising prices  Examples range from redesigned steel mills to Web sites   that bring together buyers and sellers of grain within a 100- to 200-mile radius, bypassing the local      50  grain elevators  Furthermore, council members said that the outlook for productivity gains is good   since most firms have only started to tap the possibilities available through new technologies  On   the other hand, one small business representative cautioned that continued pressure on employees   was beginning to take its toll and he felt that there were some human limits to these increases in   productivity   Turning to the national economy, recent data have tended to confirm the view I mentioned   at our last meeting that the US economy is well positioned for a soft landing  I still think the risks   are tilted somewhat more toward increased inflation  In particular, we expect the economy to slow   to a pace only a little below potential, so labor markets likely will remain tight  Moreover, oil prices   now seem more likely to stay at levels that would lead to more spillover into core inflation than we   expected earlier this year  And given the deceleration in output growth, productivity gains probably   will moderate some  But given the continued pace of capital deepening and the reports we get from   high-tech and other firms about the opportunities for further technological advances, any slowing in   productivity growth should be relatively modest  In addition, higher energy prices should slow real   consumer spending a bit  So, while I believe that the risks remain tilted toward inflation, it will be   important for us to be watchful that signs of slowing in the economy do not become excessive    Mr Chairman, after all the compliments that the staff has received this morning, I feel that   if I don't compliment them they will think that I was disappointed  I do not want to disappoint them,   so I would note that I particularly liked the paper on the outlook for oil demand and supply    I agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
6648,2000-11-15,"  David, I had a question for you about productivity  We all know   that labor markets are very tight now by historical standards and that productivity is increasing at   very high rates by historical standards  We’re in this slowing growth period now and   anticipating some further slowing going forward  I wonder if you’ve given any thought to--or   done any analysis on--whether the cyclical slowdown in productivity will be any different this   time, given that we’re starting at such a low unemployment rate  Also, have you thought about   whether this is going to affect the way we can separate out the structural productivity from   cyclical productivity?    We talk to the people at Manpower on a regular basis, and a   comment our contact made to me this time is that their forecast for job openings, which I’ll   mention later, has set another record  There are a lot of openings that haven’t been filled; they   are just sort of sitting there  This is speculating on his part, but he knows the data very well, and   he’s saying that companies at the lower end may not be filling these openings because they are   not trying that hard to fill them  The openings are there, and at the right wage these firms would   fill them  But they are not raising wages enough to fill them  In fact, Manpower is not seeing   any large increases in compensation  If that’s accurate, it probably would support the second   part of what you’re saying here    Thank you, Mr Chairman  News from the Seventh District is   similar to what I reported last time  We’re continuing to get reports of slower activity from a   large number of industries Although the list of industries reporting a slowing in activity has not   changed much since our early October meeting, economic activity in the Seventh District is still   at high levels Tight labor markets have not led to much pickup in wage gains, although rising   health care costs remain a big concern and competition still prevents firms from passing along   higher energy and higher labor costs   Retailers have been reporting moderating sales gains for several months, and that may   be one reason many are apprehensive about the critical holiday shopping season ahead  Our   latest survey of Michigan retailers, for example, showed that most merchants expect sales to be   higher this season but both the number of retailers projecting sales gains and their expected sales   growth were the lowest since we started this survey six years ago  Other reports indicate that   promotional activity will be heavier and will start earlier in the holiday season than last year               38      Light vehicle sales did slow in October, particularly for light trucks  And our auto   industry contacts indicate that early November sales were relatively soft as well  Big Three   contacts note a desire to pull back somewhat on costly incentive programs, although they are still   being used, particularly on those models where inventories are excessive  Recently this means   that incentives were being offered on light trucks, which for some models was unprecedented    High inventories were also a factor in automakers’ decisions to cut production schedules by   temporarily closing plants, cutting third shifts, and/or reducing overtime   Unemployment insurance claims have risen lately in the Midwest, in part due to the   temporary layoffs in the auto industry we discussed earlier as well as to claims being made by   workers on indefinite layoffs from the Firestone plant in Decatur, Illinois  Despite rising claims   and reports that truck drivers are now easier to find, our labor markets are still very tight  This   anecdote from Iowa, where the unemployment rate is 23 percent, is one example  Circuit City,   the retailer, decided to stop selling appliances  So Amana, one of their suppliers, announced the   layoff of 260 workers  By the end of the day that announcement was made, however, their   human resources people had found new jobs at other nearby firms for all 260 workers at the   same wage rates  Elsewhere, retailers in the Chicago area were offering up to $13 an hour for   holiday season help this year  And as I mentioned earlier, the Manpower survey to be released   next Monday will once again show record high demand for labor throughout the nation  That's   confidential until it is released   Turning to the national outlook, the recent data have been consistent with our   expectations of moderate real growth  We see real GDP growth for next year that is slightly   higher than that in the Greenbook forecast  Moreover, while we, like everyone else, have               39      increased our estimates of potential output growth over the last few years, our current estimate is   not quite as optimistic as that in the Greenbook  Consequently, our outlook is for output growth   to be only slightly below that of potential over the forecast horizon  Thus, we expect that labor   markets will remain tight and that the cyclical slowing in productivity growth will likely put   pressure on unit labor costs  Those pressures, along with continued uncertainty over oil prices   and the likelihood of a weakening dollar, imply that the risks remain tilted somewhat more   heavily toward inflation  Indeed, higher inflation is already more than a risk; as the Greenbook   notes, both core CPI and core PCE inflation are running 1/2 point above their lows for the cycle   Of course, with the economy moving more definitely to a growth rate in the vicinity of   potential, downside risks also necessarily become more pronounced  So we must be alert to the   possibility that the slowing in the interest-sensitive sectors could become excessive  For now,   however, I believe that risk remains less than that of further increases in inflation    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree completely with your   recommendation both on keeping the balance of risks toward higher inflation and the   language that you read  I agree with President McDonough that it is central bankish type   of language, and maybe I've been here too long, but I thought it was very well stated!    [Laughter]   Let me make just a couple of comments  I think your point that we can't act on   the tilt without influencing the financial markets at this time is a very important one                94      Those in the market obviously read our statements carefully; we’ve all seen how they   interpreted our last few statements  We changed the verb, I think, in one sentence a little,   and they read it very, very carefully, and they saw that as a gradual move  Just a bit of a   counter to President Poole’s point, I think the market will read this proposed statement as   a move toward easing, although obviously not as much as our removing the tilt entirely   Also, I want to associate myself with those around the table who earlier   expressed concern about further fiscal stimulus from increased government spending as a   result of gridlock  What has happened this fall is a clear indication to me that we could   be going down that road, and that would lead to further fiscal stimulus    And finally, I just want to say that if there is going to be a recount, I would like   to speak first because those of us in Chicago know how to handle recounts!  [Laughter]    We have many different ways of accomplishing--  "
6674,2000-12-19,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Seventh District   has definitely slowed further over the past month or so, and many contacts indicate that additional   slowing is likely  Labor markets are still tight, but an increasing number of layoffs and plant   shutdowns have been reported  Construction is one of the few areas of continued strength, with one   of our Detroit branch directors noting that workers are still being recruited from out-of-state to work   on projects in Michigan  But our winter storms over the past week or so have probably put many      44  construction projects on hold, even more than seasonally expected, at least temporarily  Signs of   moderating consumer demand are increasingly apparent  While reports from retailers have been   mixed, they generally indicate that holiday sales have been soft since the Thanksgiving weekend   spurt  Despite a fairly high level of promotional activity thus far in December, as in past years   consumers seem to be holding out for even better prices on the days just before and after Christmas,   and reports indicate that retailers will be stepping up their promotional activity further  A former   director told us that there has been a sudden large drop in Asian import shipments trucked from the   West Coast in recent weeks, another sign of softening demand   The auto industry had been boosting growth in our region earlier this year but is now   pulling it down  Light vehicle sales declined considerably in October and November, and the latest   estimates from the Big Three suggest further declines in December, with sales running at an annual   rate in the mid-15 million unit range--still historically high but down significantly nevertheless  As   David Stockton mentioned, production schedules continue to be trimmed to bring inventories into   better alignment with lower sales levels, and most analysts are reducing their forecasts for light   vehicle sales in 2001   Other contacts in our manufacturing sector also report considerable slowing  The Chicago   purchasing managers’ composite index for December, to be publicly released on December 29th,   shows activity contracting again, though not quite as sharply as in November  The index was 447 in   December, up from 417 in November  And related to our discussion earlier, inventories contracted   significantly in December   In terms of specific industries, our steel and heavy-duty truck businesses are still in the   doldrums, similar to Jerry Jordan's comments about his District earlier  Contacts in the printing and   publishing industry report that almost all of their customers are pulling back, and in some cases are      45  pulling back fast--with advertising in magazines off sharply, a dramatic change from six months ago    In addition to automakers and their suppliers, consumer durables manufacturers, including Amana,   Maytag, Electrolux, Motorola, and other firms, are laying off workers, and temporary help firms   report declining demand for industrial workers  But with continued tightness in our labor markets,   other employers are often right there to offer laid off workers new jobs, and temporary positions are   still rising for workers outside of the industrial sector   Needless to say, the competitive environment is fierce and firms have little pricing power    Energy prices, of course, are the exception and particularly high heating bills are now arriving in   consumers’ mailboxes  Businesses, too, face higher energy costs along with softening demand for   their products and services, and they are becoming more pessimistic about the outlook for 2001    What is perhaps of concern is that contacts have used words like ""sharp,"" ""dramatic,"" and   ""tremendous"" to describe the slowdown they’ve experienced in the past few weeks   In early December we hosted our 14th Annual Economic Outlook Symposium for which   over 30 regional economists provided forecasts for 2001  The median of these forecasts, which were   prepared in late November, had real GDP rising 3-1/2 percent next year  If those same forecasters   were polled today, my guess is that the median forecast would be lower  Growth is coming down   from rates that were unsustainable, and that slowing was needed to restore balance between   aggregate demand and potential supply  But as my directors cautioned me last week, we need to   remain alert so that the slowing does not persist to the point of threatening the current expansion   The national economy has clearly entered a period of below-trend growth  As we all   know, in such periods it is more difficult than usual to gauge whether the slowing will be excessive    Although our current assessment for real GDP growth this quarter and next is a bit stronger than the      46  Greenbook's, we are still predicting growth below trend  Thus, we expect that the unemployment   rate will be rising next year as labor markets begin to ease noticeably   Mr Chairman, I agree with your comments earlier this month that this is a time when the   effects of any negative shocks would likely be amplified  With the sharp drop in consumer   confidence recently, the consumer seems wary and perhaps weary after a long run of strong   consumption growth  Tighter credit standards for businesses and slower growth in investment   spending all signal smaller additions to productive capacity in the short term  I'm still concerned   about future inflationary pressures, although they seem less urgent today  If the economy slows as   much as we project, it seems plausible that inflation will level off   In my view the balance of risks has changed since November and I'm sure that we will   want to explain that in our press release    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a slight difference of opinion with   my colleague, Mr Parry, on the Wall Street Journal article  I consider that article very unfortunate   because when leaks like that occur I think it makes us look bad as a central bank  We’ve had this   discussion before  So, I don't see any good side to it   Getting back to the subject at hand, clearly we are in a situation where we're all concerned   that the slowing that we wanted to see and are now seeing is going to be excessive  As you and   others have pointed out, no one knows with certainty whether further weakening will occur because   of the complexity of our economy and the interaction of the financial markets, consumer confidence,   and all the other factors that we discussed  I agree that the anecdotes point to a much lower rate of   growth than do our models at this time  But they are anecdotes, and I think we’d all like to see some   more evidence in the data and other information we receive that would help clarify the situation  In   a period of uncertainty like this, the incremental approach seems appropriate and I agree with your   recommendation for no change in rates but an asymmetric statement that the risks are weighted   toward economic weakness at this time  "
6694,2001-01-03,"  Mr Chairman, this is Michael Moskow  I agree with what Jerry   Jordan just said and also with the comments that Bill McDonough made  I don’t think we should   characterize this as taking back the last increase for the reasons they explained  I do agree with   your recommendation for the 50 basis point cut and for retaining the asymmetrical language on   the balance of risks  I think it’s an aggressive move, but I believe it is called for  If we don’t do   it, we risk falling behind the curve, and we may be a little behind the curve already  Certainly,   the anecdotal evidence that we’ve received supports your analysis both in terms of the auto   industry and on the banking side  As I mentioned in the December meeting, the auto sector   appeared to be coming in very weak and our industry contacts since then have confirmed that    Also our contacts have indicated continuing concern that bankers may be overreacting to the   situation  So I support the move and also the way you explained it  As for what we would say in   the press statement, I understood from your comments that we would talk about the fact that     1/3/01 16  there is no change in the long-term outlook for increases in productivity growth  I think it is very   appropriate for us to mention that because our analysis certainly supports that as well     Mr Chairman, the problem we faced last time was the article that I   believe was in the Wall Street Journal just a day or so before the meeting  That story, of course,   wasn't put together from any speeches that people had given  That was from personal contacts   that that reporter or his associates made  I think that's an area we have to be particularly careful   about   "
6720,2001-01-30,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, let me add my   congratulations to the people who wrote the papers  I thought it was a fine job     Mr Chairman, I think this last point you made is very important  We should   keep this in perspective as we make our comments and as we plan what we’re going to     1/30-31/01 46  do  I don’t have firm views on many of the issues that have been raised, but I do on   some  I’d like to mention both the ones I don’t feel strongly about and the ones I do   Your comment leads me to feel that we should be emphasizing a diversified   approach in what we do going forward, and I think of diversification in two ways  One is   in terms of the percentage of our portfolio and the other relates to our influence in the   market for any individual security  That’s another aspect of diversification  It’s similar, I   think, to the liquidity issue we’ve talked about here  The papers were written from the   standpoint that as we enter a market, we reduce the liquidity of that type of security in the   market  Actually, I believe it cuts the other way as well  If we enter a market for a   specific security, it would encourage others to issue more of those securities because the   central bank is in that market  So I think the liquidity may increase as well, as long as the   supply is elastic     Clearly, I would prefer the use of government securities only, as we all would    When we start going beyond that, I think GNMAs are a good first step  But personally I   would not want to go forward in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issues for the reasons that   have been discussed in the press, relating to giving those agencies preferential treatment   in the marketplace   Of the areas that I’m encouraged about for diversification, one is the broader   use of RPs  We are all familiar with them and I think we know their advantages, so I   won’t list the latter  Second, I believe we should look at the discount window option very   carefully  It does have promise  I believe President McDonough is correct in saying that   we should consider it in a broader perspective, tied in with our supervision and regulation   activities as well  In my view the governance issues are manageable there  And I tend to     1/30-31/01 47  be drawn toward the ACF approach; that clearly seems worth examining much more   carefully  Another area is the foreign securities that Jerry Jordan mentioned  I view that   as a promising area  They are used by other central banks in their open market   operations  We’re not talking about foreign exchange operations, so I think that arena   has promise and is something we should look at more carefully   On private securities, personally I would draw a line in the sand on those  I   would not want the System to be investing in private equities  My concern about this   goes back 25 years when I was in the Labor Department and was co-chairing with the   Treasury Department something called the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation   (PBGC), which insured pensions and the assets coming into the government  The   question when it was being set up was what to do with these investments  Of course, the   staff of the PBGC wanted to invest in private securities to get a higher return for the   insurance fund and, being young and naïve, I thought that sounded like a very good idea    As we got into discussions of this with the Treasury I soon realized that the problems   would be insurmountable  That would inevitably lead to government influence in the   marketplace, and the political pressures would be so enormous that mischief would be   inevitable  So I would draw a line in the sand that would keep the Federal government,   both the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, out of that business   I do want to make a comment about transparency in this process   And I think   this is important  Bill Poole said it would be good to get academic input into this  To me   the issue is more than just getting these papers out in the public domain  I think we   should be very open and transparent about what we’re studying as a central bank  Don   and Peter mentioned that they wanted to consult with selected members of the Congress,     1/30-31/01 48  their staff, and people in the markets  Once we start doing that a lot of rumors are going   to circulate  Those rumors could affect the markets for the categories of securities that   will be discussed, and that would be very unfortunate  So there is a practical reason for   opening up this discussion and I don’t see any reason not to be transparent about what   we’re doing  We are breaking new ground here and we could get a lot of helpful input   from academics and others who are knowledgeable about these areas  And even though   we’re talking about a period of ten years, we do have some time before we need to make   decisions  In my view it would be very desirable to get input from others and I think it   would help our credibility as well     In terms of next steps, I would contemplate asking the people who’ve worked   on these papers to come back with some concrete proposals in the areas we would want   to study in more depth  I’d also want to discuss how we should make the public aware of   what we’re doing and be open to input from people from outside the System as well    I have a question about the projected inventory adjustment   in this first quarter of 2001  It is very sharp, of course  I was just wondering if that’s in   line with historical experience or if you see some change in the structure of the economy   that is causing it to be as sharp as you have projected in this quarter    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Unfortunately, I’m not much   more optimistic than Gary Stern, who spoke before the break       1/30-31/01 147  As you would expect, reports from contacts in the Seventh District indicate   even further slowing in activity, particularly in our manufacturing sector  In fact the   news last week from our directors as well as from our other contacts was downright   gloomy  I’m going to mention several new pieces of information; all are gloomy     The weakness in manufacturing has been widespread  Indeed, the Chicago   Purchasing Managers' Survey results for January that will be released tomorrow show   declines in the construction components of the composite index to levels not seen since   late 1982  The Chicago PMI is down to 402 percent  Production cutbacks in the auto   industry are a major reason for the further weakening in the region’s manufacturing   sector in recent months  Based on reports from our contacts at the Big Three, first-  quarter assembly schedules have been scaled back even more than is indicated in the   Greenbook  And one of our directors with very close ties to the auto industry indicated   that the whisper estimates for first-quarter production are even lower  Estimates of sales   for January by Big Three analysts center around 16 million units, up from sales of 153   million in December  The January increase was due to factors such as fleet sales, better   weather than in December, and higher incentives offered by dealers who are concerned   about the drop in consumer confidence  These factors, of course, may be temporary    Dealers report that they have not seen a sharp decline like the total for the last two   months since the early 1990s     Conditions in the domestic steel industry are bleak, with slowing demand now   exacerbating the impact of import competition and low steel prices contributing to   numerous bankruptcy filings  Some District retailers report a modest sales rebound in   January stemming from heavy discounting and promotional activities which, of course,     1/30-31/01 148  will reduce their profit margins  One piece of good news involves the construction   industry  Our assessment of residential and nonresidential construction is that there has   not been significant overbuilding, at least so far  But for the first time in many years, tax   revenues in District states are coming in below budget  The weakness from the third   quarter to the fourth quarter of 2000 in all sources of state revenues, notably sales tax   collections, was evident across all of our five states, especially Michigan   In part reflecting the slowing in the region’s economy, our labor markets show   further signs of easing  The unemployment rate for the five District states moved up to   38 percent in December; it had been 33 percent in October  Contacts report less   difficulty finding workers  And Manpower’s latest survey results, which will not be   released to the public for quite some time--not until February 26th--are going to show a   very sharp reduction of 20 to 25 percent in hiring plans for the second quarter of this   year  That’s the biggest drop in five years, with the decline sharpest for the Midwest  As   you may recall, this measure had been breaking new records on the up side every quarter   for the last several years  Wage pressures seem to be easing as well  One of our directors   from organized labor noted that recent contracts typically include wage increases of   around 3 percent, down from the previous 5 to 8 percent range     Turning to the national outlook, the economy has slowed rapidly and   dramatically, much more than expected  Despite our weaker outlook for auto production,   our current assessment of real GDP growth for 2001 is not quite as pessimistic as that in   the Greenbook  We expect this quarter’s growth to be slightly positive and overall   growth for the year to be about 2-1/2 percent  Inventories explain much of the difference   in the two forecasts for the first half of the year  We expect a slightly smaller inventory     1/30-31/01 149  correction, spread out over this quarter and next, which is more in line with historical   experience  For the year as a whole, the main reason for the difference in forecasts is that   we expect more monetary policy easing than does the Greenbook, and that easing raises   growth in the second half of the year   In assessing economic conditions and inflationary pressures, our staff has been   computing a monthly index of national economic conditions  This single index   summarizes 85 data series on economic activity and was adapted from research done by   Jim Stock and Mark Watson  With data available through December, the current reading   of our index is minus 056  Historically, an index reading between minus 07 and minus   10 percent is associated with a high probability of the onset of a recession  Of course,   this is not a definitive economic indicator, but it is suggestive  And this reading seems   quite consistent with my view of the situation, which is that the economy is not currently   in a recession, nor inevitably heading into one, but we could be close    Mr Chairman, I support both parts of your recommendation    I believe we’ve all been particularly impressed by the speed of this slowdown and I’m     1/30-31/01 185  hopeful that this action will help us to achieve a quick recovery and to avoid moving into   a recession  "
6743,2001-03-20,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Over the past few weeks I’ve   had more unsolicited calls from concerned business leaders than ever before in my six-  and-one-half years in this job  That’s probably because the Seventh District economy is   undergoing a somewhat more noticeable slowdown than the national economy, in large   part due to our relatively greater concentration of manufacturing industries  Reports from   our manufacturing sector contacts have indicated weakness for some time now, and we’re   starting to hear of some spillover effects in other sectors of the economy as well   Nevertheless, a few anecdotes suggest that we may be near the bottom in   manufacturing, although that assessment is still quite tentative  For example, much of   our District’s slowdown reflects the automobile industry’s efforts to bring inventories   into better alignment with expected sales  As David Stockton mentioned, light vehicle   production was cut sharply over the past few months, and significantly increased   incentives coupled with a large volume of fleet sales boosted light vehicles sales in     3/20/01 44  January and February to levels that were higher than many expected but were clearly not   sustainable  Our Big Three contacts indicate that sales so far in March have been quite   strong, but below the elevated January-February pace  As a result, the industry supply of   light vehicles was brought back down to the usually desired 60 days by the end of   February  Thus, significant progress has been made and the auto industry is probably   close to bottoming out, although there are some important reasons why additional   adjustments may well be needed   First, the 60-day supply figure for February is based on sales of 174 million   units, and the industry is not expecting sales to be maintained at that lofty level  Second,   one of the Big Three recently scaled back its financial support to dealers in a number of   areas, including a significant reduction in inventory financing assistance  And third,   contacts continue to say that they want to cut back on the expensive incentive programs   being offered to consumers  As a result, second-quarter production may not be as high as   published assembly schedules suggest  Still, I think it’s fair to say that most of the   inventory correction is behind us   Reports from contacts in the paper and steel industries also tentatively point to   a bottom in the downturn  I, like Jerry Jordan, had some conversations with a few people   in the paper business  One CEO with 40 years of experience in the industry said he had   never seen a decline like this one, which has persisted for such an extended period of   time  But he did indicate that declines in shipments of corrugated containers seemed to   be leveling off in March   Also, capacity utilization in the steel industry has increased   over the past few weeks, which may suggest some stabilization  On the other hand,     3/20/01 45  reports from industries such as heavy trucks, construction and agricultural equipment,   printing, and high-tech continue to be very negative   In large part reflecting weakness in manufacturing, our labor markets eased   considerably early this year  The unemployment rate for our five states moved above 4   percent for the first time since mid-1997 and we’re expecting that soon it will be above   the national rate for the first time in 7-1/2 years     Manufacturing weakness and job layoffs appear to be having some impact on   demand  Several contacts reported that capital spending plans were being delayed or   postponed  Some also noted that the manufacturing slowdown had affected other   industries such as software services, travel--particularly business air travel--hotels, and   tourism  Retail sales in the Midwest recently have been somewhat softer than in the   nation and the housing sector indicators for the Midwest show less of an uptrend in recent   months than the national figures     Many business people I’ve spoken with recently noted that it has become more   difficult to obtain credit  That’s consistent with the responses from banks in our District   to the special senior loan officer survey, which indicated a further tightening of credit   standards and a widening of spreads in the Midwest   Turning to the national outlook, the downside risks clearly dominate  Wealth   effects are now substantially negative and measures of consumer confidence have fallen   rapidly  Prospects for growth abroad have deteriorated somewhat, as we’ve discussed,   and firms appear to be scaling back plans for capital spending  These current and   prospective cutbacks by households and firms are having effects in sectors of the   economy beyond manufacturing where weakness has been concentrated so far  While     3/20/01 46  this is normal in a period of slower growth, we should keep in mind the risk of further   spillovers  On balance, however, the data released since our last meeting have been   consistent with what still seems the most likely scenario, namely weak growth in the first   half of the year followed by a rebound in the second half  Indeed, data on employment,   retail sales, and especially homebuilding have been stronger than one might have   expected and unlike the behavior of an economy in the early stages of a recession  And   while not yet a major concern, it’s important for us to keep in mind that inflation   measures also have come in on the high side of expectations  Nevertheless, I think a   continuation of our strategy of measured policy easing seems appropriate for today    Or is he using his driver?  [Laughter]    Mr Chairman, as one of the golfers in this group, I thought   the analogy Mike Kelley gave before was excellent  To continue it, I guess I would   describe your proposal as hitting a shot to the green  I'm not sure where it landed but we   are carrying several clubs with us and one of them surely is a sand wedge    I meant toward the green, since that's the way I usually play   golf!   [Laughter]  But, seriously, I thought your statement was excellent  I do think we   need to ease  I believe we should be measured in our actions, as I said in my comments   and as Cathy Minehan mentioned as well  In my view, 50 basis points should be enough   for now  I agree that we need to avoid trying to fulfill the ever more extreme market   expectations  We can't hope to keep up with such expectations, and even if we were to   cut the funds rate more than 50 basis points today, it's not clear that the markets would be   affected in anything but the short run, as you mentioned  Also, I support retaining the   asymmetric language  Even with the 50 basis point easing, the risks remain tilted toward   weakness   I am uneasy about the language regarding an intermeeting move  I'm not sure   exactly what we gain from it or how it helps us in moving forward  Perhaps we could   have more discussion on that    I agree with Tom Hoenig’s comment  I, too, in hearing you,   thought that this statement would be much starker about an intermeeting move, but I’m   comfortable with this wording  I would also agree with Tom, though, on taking out the   word “especially”  "
6761,2001-04-11,"  Mr Chairman, this is Michael Moskow  I agree with your   recommendation not to make a move today  I do believe that the risks clearly are on the   down side, based on reports from contacts I’ve had with people  Let me mention just a   few  There is a lot of concern in Chicago about the situation at Motorola  The company   has been frozen out of the commercial paper market  Its problems are similar to those of   other high-tech firms, but some of its difficulties may reflect internal problems as well    In talking to people who manage mutual funds, I find that they are very concerned about   the cutbacks in capital spending  I had a conversation yesterday with a contact in the   airlines industry and he told me that business travel, especially to the Far East, has been   way down, a pattern that has continued from last month  On the other hand, consumer   travel, which is booked far in advance, is very strong  I would note one outlier to the generally negative tone of the comments I’ve   been hearing  I took a trip to Rockford, Illinois last week, which is a metropolitan area of   about 350,000 people where about 27 percent of the workforce is in manufacturing  I   expected them all to be down in the dumps but they were very upbeat about the situation  Their unemployment rate is 51 percent now  It had been very, very high back in the     4/11/01 15   ’80s  They are heavily oriented to the automotive industry, which may be helping them,   in terms of the pickup they see now  Nevertheless, I was pleasantly surprised when I   spoke to the bankers and community leaders there  During my visit, the town passed two   referendums, both of which involved increases in spending  That certainly didn’t give   me any indication of negative consumer confidence there  That’s possibly just an outlier,   but it was a bit of upbeat news for me last week  "
6781,2001-04-18,"  Mr Chairman, this is Michael Moskow  I support your   recommendation  Clearly, as others have said, our meeting schedule was set up a long   time ago and the interval between our March and May meetings is long  Our outlook is   for a pickup in economic activity later this year and a return to something near trend   growth next year  But that scenario assumes that the nominal fed funds rate will decline   to a level of around 4 percent  To the extent that assumption is correct, it certainly seems   inappropriate to wait at this time when we need to make a policy move  I would also add   to what others have said that this is an important, decisive step and I think it’s vital that   we be prepared to act just as decisively on the up side if and when inflationary pressures   become excessive     We have gotten a little additional information on capital spending since last   week  The sum of it is that everyone is reviewing their capital spending plans  The   manufacturing firms are the most likely to be cutting back  But several retailers we   talked to said that they are making absolutely no changes in their expansion plans  And   some contacts in the casual dining industry said that they had been cutting back around   the middle of last year but currently are not making any changes in the plans developed at   that time    Michael Moskow here  I agree with that, too  And I believe   you have a caveat in the draft, if I heard you correctly, which said that measured   productivity has weakened or is expected to have weakened in the first quarter  So I   think we are covered on that        Right  "
6804,2001-05-15,"  David, I have a question for you  You started out your comments by   saying the economy is very weak, though not in a recession  And then I think you said we are   not far from a recession  Yet when I look at the alternative simulations in the Greenbook, none   of the downside scenarios appears to put us into a recession  In fact the most negative in terms   of an impact is a productivity slowdown where monetary policy has less of a positive effect on   the outcome  So I was just wondering whether you could be a little more specific about what it   would take to push us into a recession?    So the most likely scenario would be higher unemployment that   triggers weaker consumer confidence, which feeds into weaker household demand than is   actually shown here?    So the missing factor is consumer confidence?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Seventh District   remains sluggish  Many reports are quite gloomy  Several contacts even told me that conditions   in their sectors were as bad as they had ever seen  And these weren’t the 25-year-olds at dot-  com firms but people with 30 to 40 years of industry experience  In fact, a recent poll of the   CEOs of Chicago’s 100 largest corporations revealed a very sharp downturn in business   sentiment  Nearly half the respondents expect an outright recession   However, with inventories pared substantially, there are some tentative signs that the   worst may be over for the traditional manufacturing industries whose difficulties have made the   current slowdown especially severe in the Midwest  And consumer spending, though very soft   in several sectors, has shown surprising resilience, providing some grounds for optimism    Unfortunately, there are also signs that the slowdown is having a growing impact on capital   investment and commercial real estate  More-widespread employment cutbacks may be next on   the list of difficulties, leading to a subsequent decline in consumer confidence as we discussed   earlier     On the positive side, the auto industry’s significant inventory reduction and subsequent   production rebound ought to provide some support for the rest of the Midwest economy  Of   course, our Big Three contacts remain concerned about the rest of the year  They have been   losing market share to imports and all expect sales to slow as the year progresses  But relative to   a few months ago, the outlook for autos is much improved  And though published data continue   to show deterioration in some of our other important manufacturing industries, contacts in the     5/15/01     33   steel, heavy truck, construction, and agricultural equipment sectors report at least some signs that   conditions may be near the bottom   The slowdown in consumer spending we’ve seen in recent months has shown up in   many ways, one of which is slimmer periodicals and catalogues  Early last year I reported that   printers just couldn’t squeeze any more pages of advertisements into magazines  But postal   statistics show that times clearly have changed  Total pieces of Class A and periodical mail are   down and the total weight of such mail is down even more, with the difference due to the   shrinking size of catalogues and periodicals  One well-known business publication is down to   about 175 pages from 300 last year  Publishers even have been delaying their printing runs,   hoping to book a few more ads before they go to press  Recently, however, a magazine   executive reported the first glimmer of a pickup in advertising scheduled for fall publication    Though I guess mail carriers won’t be pleased, this is probably a good sign since ads tend to   track consumer spending fairly well  An even more hopeful sign was the improvement we saw   starting in April in District retailers’ reports    Of course, the recent employment trends could still undermine consumer confidence   and spending  We spoke with executives of two large temporary services firms headquartered in   our District  Both confirmed that the recent employment reductions have been concentrated in   manufacturing, especially automotive and electronic assembly; other business lines were holding   steady or actually increasing  One also reported that the pace of contraction in their industrial   business had slowed significantly, though client firms remained deeply cautious about expanding   even temporary workforces  We also learned that the Manpower survey of hiring intentions,   which will be released to the public on May 21, showed another drop  The new figure is the   lowest since 1993 and the two-quarter drop is the largest ever outside a recessionary period      5/15/01     34   Another worrisome sign is that commercial real estate seems to be succumbing to the slowdown    Suburban markets especially have weakened and a lot of new space remains in the pipeline,   which has the industry in our region worried  Hijacking the Boeing corporate headquarters   won’t do much to alleviate these concerns  [Laughter]  Sorry, Bob!    Finally, we made a special effort in our analysis of regional conditions to gauge the   effects of the slowdown on capital spending  We found the picture mixed for retailers, with   many going ahead with expansion plans but others behaving more cautiously  Almost all   manufacturers, on the other hand, were reviewing, freezing, or scaling back capital spending   plans  But even in manufacturing there were exceptions  For instance, one District manufacturer   of agricultural equipment is going ahead with a very ambitious $600 million capital spending   plan for this year despite poor earnings recently  The reason is that investing in new technology   was felt to be vital to the firm’s long-term success   Turning to the national outlook, the economic situation this quarter continues to be   highly uncertain  On the investment side, most manufacturing and high-tech firms are   continuing to scale back their investment plans for the year  In an environment where cost   reductions are imperative, reducing discretionary expenditures is figuring prominently in many   business plans  Internationally, the outlook for foreign economic growth and US exports   continues to deteriorate  Of great concern, the April employment report indicated significantly   more weakness in the labor market than expected  If this continues, income growth will slow   markedly and consumption may falter along with other components of aggregate demand    Admittedly, given our policy actions to date, our best assessment is that aggregate demand will   rebound modestly later this year and approach the growth rate of potential next year  But the     5/15/01     35   risks continue to be skewed toward economic weakness and I think monetary policy should   respond accordingly     Having said that, like Tom Hoenig, I’m also concerned about future inflationary   pressures  Today’s appropriate policy may quickly become overly accommodating once the   economy turns the corner  We will have to be mindful of that  Indeed, the futures markets have   priced in policy firming at the end of this year, once the economy has rebounded  But today the   greater risks are clearly weighted toward the possibility of further economic weakness      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation for a 50   basis point cut and an asymmetric directive toward economic weakness  I do think it’s important   that we start getting the word out, as suggested in the comments by Al Broaddus and Cathy   Minehan  Let me make several points  One is that we should start indicating that 250 basis   points of ease may be enough--that it will take some time for these cuts to have some impact on   the economy  We should make it clear that we may decide not to ease further during that time--  but we will be waiting and watching and monitoring carefully--and also that inflation is a concern   longer term  We could put this in the statement today  Or, your recommendation to start talking   about it in your speech on May 24th and then put it in our statement in June is fine with me  I   think that’s a reasonable way to proceed going forward  "
6829,2001-06-26,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, want to congratulate the authors   of the papers I thought they were all very good and I believe it was an excellent idea to have this   as a topic for our session today I just wanted to make a couple of comments about the so-called   “organizational  improvement” portion of multifactor productivity  The paper defined   multifactor productivity as a catchall for technological or organizational improvements  We   often talk about the technological side but we rarely talk about the organizational side, at least in   this forum  Having spent some time in private industry, I think the organizational side is     6/26-27/01 46   extremely important  I know that some research studies have been done on this, but I would   encourage us to do more work in that area  Also, the analysis that we’ve done--going back five   or six years now--at the Chicago Fed about the resurgence in the Midwest economy shows that it   was due largely to the reengineering and restructuring of firms, in part relating to information   technology but by no means solely A lot of it just resulted from better management--figuring   out how to get things done in a more efficient way     Also, I think the term “multifactor productivity” is a very difficult one for a non-  economist to understand  I’ve had conversations about this topic with lay people a number of   times and I personally think that the term “innovation” is a better characterization of what we’re   talking about here Again, I’m using innovation in a broad sense, not just in terms of technology   but innovation in management and other areas as well  I simply wanted to make that comment   because I found that terminology helpful, at least in my conversations with non-economists    Thank you     6/26-27/01 47    Mr Chairman, I too thought the capital overhang paper was a very   good paper I was particularly impressed with the fact that the staff did the econometric analysis   and then went out and spoke to people in the industry, and essentially those conversations   verified the findings in the econometric analysis    Well, I was wondering if you had any thoughts as to whether the   financial markets actually are reflecting this overhang now, and whether you can relate that in   any way to one of the alternative simulations in the Greenbook--the “earnings disappointment”   one Is this already built into market prices or is this an indication that we’re going to see a big   earnings disappointment relating to that simulation?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Seventh   District is much the same as I reported last time--sluggish  Most industry contacts in traditional   manufacturing characterize their industries as bumping along the bottom, similar to what Jerry   Jordan said about his District There is a little difference from the situation he described in that   some of our contacts report that conditions are still getting worse  Reports from high-tech firms   were uniformly dismal  At our last meeting, I noted that an increasing number of firms were   delaying investment expenditures, and that trend has continued  Some firms are simply refusing   to buy any more computer equipment until conditions improve   On a more positive note, the latest Chicago Purchasing Managers’ Report, to be   released this Friday, shows the composite index moving up from 387 in May to 444 in June    That's its highest level for the year  All components indicated less weakness in June except for   inventories, where a sharper decline probably should be reviewed as good news  The report   generally suggested both better prospects for growth and lower inflationary pressures  This   information, of course, should be kept confidential until Friday morning   We held our eighth annual Auto Outlook Symposium in Detroit earlier this month  It   drew over 100 participants  Like the Greenbook, the consensus of 30 forecasts submitted by that   group was that light vehicle sales would be about 163 million this year  Those forecasters were   more optimistic than the Greenbook for next year, however, in that they saw a slight increase to   164 million units versus the Greenbook forecast of 157 million  We also had some reports that   the steel industry may be nearing bottom Meanwhile, consumer spending and housing activity     6/26-27/01 88   still are holding up reasonably well in our District  As is often the case, reports from retailers   have been mixed, with weather being an important factor influencing sales of apparel and   seasonal items  Furniture sales have been weak, while sales of other home-related items were   still said to be relatively strong  Jewelry sales have softened slightly but have not shown the   sharp declines that are normally associated with a recession  Housing starts, permits, and sales of   existing and new homes in the Midwest all increased from April to May and contacts throughout   the District indicate that there has been no noticeable slowing in housing activity in June     There was an interesting dichotomy in how firms were reacting to looser labor market   conditions On the one hand, many firms employing higher skilled workers appeared to be trying   even harder than usual to avoid layoffs  Consulting and law firms were encouraging new hires to   take time off before starting and were asking current employees to work part-time or take   vacations sooner rather than later  But they generally were not letting people go  We had similar   reports about skilled jobs in manufacturing and in certain segments of the building trades  On the   other hand, lower skilled workers were being let go at a faster-than-expected pace  One senior   executive with many years of experience in the temporary services industry characterized the   current period as the worst drop for his industry that he'd seen in his career  Outside the high-  tech area, however, he has seen real evidence of lessened wage pressures   We also held our Academic Advisory Council meeting last week  We had a larger   than usual turnout--leading academics plus four business economists  There was a good deal of   pessimism about the near-term outlook for investment, especially from the business economists    No one, however, thought the economy would slip into a recession  Participants raised many of   the issues covered in yesterday's discussion of the productivity acceleration  The common   opinion was that we should be cautious in basing our forecast of productivity trends too heavily     6/26-27/01 89   on the last several years of excellent performance  The key message, however, was that the Fed   should not become complacent about inflation  Many thought we were giving too little attention   to inflation, and the academics generally thought we had either adjusted policy enough or had   already gone too far   Turning to the national economy, a great deal of uncertainty remains about the outlook    Clearly, economic growth stalled in the second quarter and significant signs of weakness   continue The high-tech overhang will persist for some time and will be a substantial drag on   future investment spending  More generally, the manufacturing sector continues to contract and   low rates of capacity utilization will limit further capital investment  As unemployment   continues to increase, slower income growth will likely begin to weigh on consumption growth    In the absence of further downward economic shocks, the third and fourth quarters should show   improvement over the current quarter, but the downward risks to economic growth this year   remain high   Having said that, there are clearly limits to how effectively the real-side risks facing   the US economy today can be addressed by lower short-term interest rates  And I think we're   getting close to those limits  So far the core inflation outlook remains reasonably contained    However, with the real fed funds rate well below its equilibrium level, the inflation risks become   greater as time passes  We always have to be alert to that danger   As we said at our last meeting, there is already a lot of stimulus in the pipeline  The   aggressive policy actions taken by this Committee earlier this year should soon be having   noticeable effects and the tax cut will provide additional stimulus later this year  If the economic   turnaround proceeds as quickly as our forecast suggests, the Committee will need to quickly   return policy to a less expansionary setting of the funds rate     6/26-27/01 90    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with your recommendation for   the 25 basis point cut and for the balance of risks toward weaker economic growth and I, too,   hope this is our last move  I do have two major concerns and they are on both sides of this issue    One is that I, too, am concerned, as you are, that there may be a second phase to this down cycle    I think it is a low probability but in my view this action gives us some flexibility and keeps our   options open going forward My second concern relates to the long-term impact on inflation and   inflation expectations And I think this is a somewhat higher probability  In light of the   discussion we had, as you said, we must be willing to move rates up when appropriate, when this   downturn stabilizes As someone said in our discussion--I forget who it was--the markets are   expecting us to move promptly and forcibly when that time comes  "
6855,2001-08-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman On balance the Seventh District   economy has not changed significantly since my report in June, but most reports now seem   somewhat more pessimistic than before, at least about the near future  Overall activity has   remained quite sluggish and that has been disappointing for many businesses that had expected,   or at least hoped, that some evidence of an upturn would be visible by now  The expected   improvement in the economy seems further in the future than when we met in June  In fact, most   business people we talk to do not expect a significant recovery in manufacturing before next   spring There are few signs that capital spending is about to pick up and there’s growing concern   about how long consumers can continue to prop up the economy     Manufacturing has been our weakest link for about a year now  While some key   manufacturing industries have made substantial progress in working down excess inventories,   overall production remains very weak  The light vehicle industry is somewhat of an exception;   on average inventories are now in good shape  Production nationally has been trending up   somewhat since January and capacity utilization is up to 88 percent, about as good as it gets in   the auto industry Of course, even this industry is not out of the woods, as David Wilcox   mentioned earlier  So far this year, substantial incentives have been needed to keep light vehicle   sales at high levels, and industry contacts indicate that sales have been soft so far in August    And more generally, they expect sales to be lower in the second half than in the first half of the   year In addition, incentive spending is not expected to change much, and that means profits will   continue to be squeezed     8/21/01 18   Most firms are still attempting to reduce costs and are being very cautious about   capital spending Indeed, the outlook for capital spending is poor in a large number of industries    For example, no recovery is in sight for heavy truck sales  The steel industry has little incentive   to increase capital spending, given the significant excess capacity and the lack of pricing power    The gypsum wallboard industry is also plagued with over-capacity despite the fact that the robust   housing market has helped keep shipments strong  And high-tech remains an area of special   weakness, with most observers indicating that it will be some time before the overhang can be   worked off   One piece of good news came from the paper industry where demand for cardboard   boxes improved in the last few weeks  But our contacts emphasized that the improvement really   has not lasted long enough to discern a turn Consumer spending and housing activity are still   holding up reasonably well in our District, although many retailers have become less optimistic   about the future Reports indicate softer consumer spending in the Midwest than elsewhere in   the country, amid signs that individuals are becoming more price conscious  Discounters and   value-oriented retailers seem to be the most aggressive in trying to capture the tax refund   business While sales results are still rather sketchy, it appears that those retailers are the ones   that are benefiting the most  Even as the tax rebate checks trickle into the economy, many   retailers continue to lower their sales expectations for the fall and for the winter    Our housing markets remain relatively robust, although some contacts are skeptical   about how long such resilience will continue We’ve had scattered reports of reductions in   asking prices for some higher priced homes in Chicago, although these prices are still above   year-ago levels And I’ve become increasingly concerned about potential overbuilding in this   sector, given the tremendous amount of residential construction near and around downtown     8/21/01 19   Chicago So far, however, the housing numbers have remained at high levels and homes that are   priced right continue to sell quickly, often with multiple bidders     Things are not quite so rosy on the nonresidential construction side  Office vacancy   rates have continued to increase in many areas as demand has slowed  The REITs tell us that   large firms with leases coming up for renewal are consistently cutting back their office space   requirements  With these trends visible nationwide as well, there has been a significant adverse   impact on the office furniture industry that is concentrated in western Michigan  This industry   expects to see the sharpest drop in shipments since records were first tallied in the early ’70s     Since the slowdown began, our labor markets have eased somewhat more than they   have in the nation as a whole District employers are still reporting that it’s less difficult to hire   and retain workers in most areas and that wage pressures have subsided further  Total payroll   employment in our five-state area has been below year-ago levels for two months now,   something we haven’t experienced since the end of 1991  However, the latest Manpower   Survey, which will be released publicly next Monday, August 27th, shows a small pickup in the   hiring intentions of Midwestern employers for the fourth quarter, which may indicate that the   worst is over for our region The national index declined slightly further, however, taking it to   its lowest level since the end of 1993   Turning to the national outlook, like many of our business contacts we think the   pickup in economic growth will be delayed further  We still believe the second quarter will be   the worst of this cycle, but growth this quarter looks to be quite anemic as well  In particular,   another substantial decline in capital spending should largely offset the positive effects of the tax   rebate and consumer spending  We continue to think the most likely scenario has growth   returning to its potential by the second half of next year but we certainly can’t rule out a worse     8/21/01 20   scenario As our business contacts keep repeating, consumer spending and housing activity may   falter before the inventory and capital spending adjustments are completed  The outlook for   world growth has deteriorated, signs of economic instability are evident in parts of Latin   America and Asia, and the international situation could erode further  For the long term, I   remain somewhat concerned about inflation, but for now the risks still seem tilted decidedly to   the downside    Mr Chairman, I agree with both parts of your recommendation, for   a 25 basis point cut and the balance of risks toward economic weakness  You mentioned that if   we did a 50 basis point cut, it would scare people  I would add that if we did zero, I think it   would have the same impact  In my view this is a time when consumer confidence and business   confidence are extremely important to the economy  "
6872,2001-09-13,"  Mr Chairman, let me mention first that in the events leading   up to this Tuesday, our assessment in the Seventh District was that the manufacturing   sector was clearly weak but was not getting worse  That view was generally confirmed   by conversations with some of our business contacts who had been much more   pessimistic two, three, four weeks earlier  But it seemed clear to us that consumer   spending was soft and getting softer, and a number of people seemed to feel that way    Small and mid-size businesses also appeared to be slowing down   We had a conference call with our directors today and let me report some one-   or two-day numbers they provided  Sears reported that its sales were down 50 percent on   Tuesday from the same day last year but were down only 10 percent on Wednesday,   which surprised them  On the other hand, one of the major catalogue retailers, Lands   End, said that their calls were off 75 percent on Tuesday and 60 percent on Wednesday,   which is obviously not surprising One of our directors whose firm is a major supplier to   the auto industry indicated that the number of plants he is supplying goes up and down   because of the shortages of parts, as you noted earlier     In terms of what we should be doing going forward, obviously this is an   unprecedented situation and my instincts would be to move sooner rather than later   I   also think that 50 basis points is the appropriate magnitude     9/13/01 15  "
6892,2001-09-17,"  This is Michael Moskow, Mr Chairman  I agree completely   with what you’re recommending  I think it’s the right amount and the right timing  I   have one request If you haven’t thought of doing it already, I would suggest that in our     9/17/01 4   statement we include the fact that we did have a moment of silence this morning at our   meeting    I think it’s very good, Mr Chairman, but once again I would   ask if people would agree with my suggestion to put in a sentence indicating that we   started our meeting this morning with a moment of silence    That’s fine  "
6915,2001-10-02,"  I wanted to ask you, David, about the psychology question,   to use your term  One of the keys to the forecast obviously is consumer sentiment and   consumer spending  I realize it’s very hard to judge, but I would have thought that   consumer sentiment now would be as bad if not worse than in the 1990-91 period   following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait  Then we had a fear of terrorism on our soil; now   obviously it’s a reality Of course, you’ve dealt with a collapse in consumer and business   sentiment in one of the alternative Greenbook scenarios, but I wondered why you didn’t   use that as the baseline Do you have any other comments on how to compare these two   periods in terms of consumer sentiment?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman The tragic events of September   11th have had a profound impact on the Seventh District’s people, businesses, and   economy  The response in terms of the giving of time, money, and blood has been   inspiring   As for our District economy, overall activity was sluggish before the terrorist   attacks Our weak manufacturing sector appeared to be nearing the bottom of its   adjustment but contacts indicated that consumer spending had softened  The District   economy has clearly deteriorated since the attacks  We’ve seen some improvement from   the near standstill conditions experienced around September 11th, but overall activity is   still significantly lower than it was in August and early September  The impact on travel   and tourism has been particularly dramatic  Downturns are evident not only in airline   travel but across a large number of related industries such as hotels, restaurants, car rental   agencies, taxi cabs, and airport concessions  Contacts at Boeing told me that many   airlines now expect double-digit declines in passenger traffic during the calendar year   compared with a 2 percent decline in 1991 following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait  As a     10/2/01 29   result, Boeing expects aircraft production cuts to be roughly four times as large as the   cuts in the early 1990s   Tighter security procedures are evident everywhere, not just at airports  They   are affecting business activity and likely will continue to do so for some time  For   example, we heard of 12- to 18-hour delays at the US/Canadian entry points, which   effectively reduced cross border trucking capacity by a third in the week following the   attacks If such delays continue, obviously they would have a significant impact on many   of our businesses, particularly the automobile industry  But as of late last week, waiting   times were reported to be very close to normal  That was one of the few good pieces of   news I’ve heard recently   Consumer spending has definitely slowed  The sharp 50 to 70 percent sales   declines retailers experienced on the 11th have narrowed significantly on average But   some retailers continue to report double-digit declines  Controlling inventories is a major   concern and order cancellations are occurring more frequently, especially for apparel    Expectations for the upcoming holiday sales season have been lowered even further and   are described as poor   Sales of autos and light trucks have also slowed considerably and the weakness   in car rentals is adversely affecting fleet sales  Automakers have responded by offering   interest-free financing Reports indicate that traffic in auto showrooms has been   improving only slowly since September 11th and that automakers will need to cut   production schedules substantially  One contact indicated a need to eliminate three to   four weeks of production     10/2/01 30   More generally, reports from our directors and other contacts from a broad   range of industries have been decidedly gloomy  Many cite anxiety and wait-and-see   attitudes as restraining factors  Most are planning for the worst and hoping for the better    As a result, firms are becoming even more cautious about capital spending, and many   have taken or are seriously considering taking additional steps to reduce costs and trim   their workforces   Turning to the national outlook, at our August meeting it seemed possible that   the economy could avoid a recession  Consumer spending seemed to be holding up   relatively well in the face of the investment-led slowdown  But a major concern was that   a further drop in consumer confidence would set off a second wave of economic slowing    In view of the layoff announcements and the stock market declines following the terrorist   attacks, it seems certain now that consumer spending will decelerate further  Increasing   unemployment will likely diminish confidence further  Reductions in household wealth   will also be a restraining factor     The outlook for business investment continues to be poor  Reductions in   business confidence and declining corporate profits will be a drag on new capital   investment decisions  This may lead businesses to believe they have an even larger   capital overhang than they had previously perceived  The rest of the world will not be a   stimulus for US growth at this point, as we’ve discussed  Instead, our domestic slowing   will continue to be a drag on the global economy  One positive note is the lack of   inflationary pressures in today’s economy     Following the events of September 11th, the environment for formulating   monetary policy is much more complex  There is a series of new unknowns on which we     10/2/01 31   must make judgments, including the impact on consumer confidence and spending,   adverse disruptions to the physical and financial operations of businesses, prospective   fiscal stimulus, and the reaction of the financial markets  In addition, military action by   the United States and any further terrorist attacks will undoubtedly have significant   impacts on the economy  It will take several months just to begin assessing these   challenges In the meantime, I believe there continues to be a substantial downside risk   that the current economic slowdown will unravel further    I agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I don’t    think today is the time to take a risk of adversely affecting business confidence   "
6939,2001-11-06,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a question for David You   mentioned in your comments the possibility of weaker household spending and, of course, that was   one of the alternative scenarios that you had in the Greenbook as well  The Greenbook analysis   indicated that under this alternative scenario households would react more adversely than you   anticipate in the baseline forecast  I was wondering if you could elaborate on what you’re   anticipating in that case, particularly in terms of external shocks such as terrorist attacks and anthrax   scares that are so important to household spending and consumer confidence  Could you provide   some more detail about what you are assuming in each of these alternatives?    In your “weaker household spending” alternative, as you look forward   do you envision a more or less stable environment in terms of the terrorist threat that we’re facing?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  On balance the Seventh District economy   has slowed further since we met in early October  We’re in an unprecedented situation and   uncertainty is very high Many business firms and households are essentially in a wait-and-see mode   regarding capital spending plans and consumption expenditures  Both businesses and consumers are   described by the people we talk to as hunkering down       11/6/01 39   The major exception, as discussed before, is the recent surge in light vehicle sales  They   are rising in response to the zero percent financing programs far more than the automakers had   anticipated Our Big Three contacts expect sales to drop once these programs expire later this month   but not as much as indicated in the Greenbook  The sense we get from automakers and from UAW   contacts, given that labor costs are relatively fixed under their collective bargaining contracts, is that   various incentive plans will continue to be offered this year and next year to try to prevent light   vehicle sales from falling below an annual rate of 15 million units    In the hard-hit travel and tourism sectors, there are few signs of any significant   improvement  Airlines have cut fares and hotels are offering special deals  Airline load factors,   however, are a bit more sensitive to developments in the war on terrorism than the fare cuts  Our   contact at  said that after cutting capacity 20 percent their load factors were good in   the first week of October but plummeted once the bombing in Afghanistan started, dropped more on   news of anthrax cases, and fell again when government officials issued warnings about additional   terrorist threats   Our manufacturing sector continues to bear the brunt of the District’s slowdown but   economic weakness is spreading more rapidly into other sectors, especially retailing  Consumers   seem more focused on family and home, so sales of home improvement items are doing okay but   sales of luxury items are not  One contact, with over 140 shopping malls in 39 states, reported that   mall traffic returned to pre-September 11th levels in mid-October, but consumer spending at the   malls was still noticeably lower than prior to the attacks  Retailers generally are bracing for what   they think could be the worst holiday shopping season in a decade  Many have canceled orders and   refused delivery of goods in order to keep their inventories under control       11/6/01 40   How consumer spending fares in coming months will hinge importantly on labor market   conditions, which are deteriorating rapidly  The latest Manpower survey of hiring intentions for the   first quarter of 2002 shows the largest year-over-year drop since 1980  These results won’t be   released publicly until November 21st, so they should be treated confidentially until then   Boeing is one of several firms we know of that are pulling forward layoffs they had   planned for later this year and 2002 Small businesses that last year were desperately trying to retain   workers are now reporting a dramatic drop in worker turnover  Wage demands of employees are   abating A special survey showed that 35 percent of firms had reduced the size of planned salary   increases since September 11th However, a frequently mentioned concern is the double-digit   increases in insurance premiums for employee health care   In our banking sector, reports on credit availability are mixed  However, the risk of loss   in C&I loan portfolios at small and large banks with significant exposure to middle market auto   suppliers has increased dramatically as a result of the financial difficulties of these firms     Turning to the national outlook, it’s now quite clear that we are in a recession, as defined   by the National Bureau of Economic Research  What is not clear yet is how severe it will be  The   data in hand are still consistent with a relatively mild downturn as in the Greenbook and our staff   forecasts But as I’ve already noted, business sentiment is very weak and I am increasingly   concerned about the fragility of consumer sentiment in this very uncertain environment  Given all   I’ve heard from contacts, we could be facing a worse downturn than the staff anticipates and, of   course, that assessment does not include any additional negative shocks from further terrorist   attacks   To be sure, there are some positives going forward  We have put a lot of monetary   stimulus in place and we suspect that significant additional fiscal stimulus is coming as well  Also,     11/6/01 41   energy prices have fallen  And once final demand stabilizes, we will get some big contributions   from inventory investment  Indeed, when all the positives align themselves sometime next year,   we’ll have to be ready to adjust policy appropriately  For now though, the risks remain weighted   toward economic weakness    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I started out my comments earlier by saying   that this is an uncertain and unprecedented time  That clearly was evident as we went around the   room and heard the comments during the go-around, which I too found very depressing  I expected   it coming into the meeting because all the data and all the anecdotes were so negative  I guess at   some point we are going to get some positive anecdotes  I keep looking for them but I haven’t found   them yet       11/6/01 90   There is clearly a risk that the greater caution we’ve seen by consumers and business firms   could cumulate into a more severe recession  When one looks at the consensus of the forecasts that   are out there, those forecasts seem to discount anything like that  I personally think the economy is   going to be weaker than the Greenbook forecast and weaker than my staff’s forecast too for that   matter  Therefore, I do feel that a 50 basis point cut is safer and I support it  I, too, am concerned   about the interconnectedness of the international economy and the feedback to our economy, which   is the result of globalization--a development that, of course, all of us have supported for many, many   years I think we just have to watch the situation very, very carefully as we move forward  So I   support your recommendation, Mr Chairman    May I just ask a question? In the second paragraph, third line, is the   phrase “for the foreseeable future” new in this statement?     We had it in previous statements?     11/6/01 99    Fine  "
6965,2001-12-11,"  I had a question on the stimulus package  You identified rather clearly   what the short-term benefits are, and you obviously placed a lot of emphasis on that  I was just   wondering if you’ve given any thought to the longer-term impact of this package beyond the forecast   horizon, particularly as it would affect multifactor productivity and capital deepening  Are there any   longer-term costs involved that we should be thinking about?    Have you actually done any analysis on this, David?  Is there anything   written--any papers or studies--on it?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Seventh District economy remains weak   and I must admit I’m having difficulty reconciling the numerous press reports of an imminent   recovery with what I’m hearing from my business contacts  So far, most contacts in the Seventh   District are not seeing signs of a bottom, let alone a recovery  As we all know, airline travel has been   significantly below last year’s levels  And according to one major carrier, bookings for the Christmas   holidays show no improvement from Thanksgiving relative to last year  The CEO of Boeing indicated   that they are not expecting air travel to return to pre-9/11 levels for another 28 to 42 months  About   the only positive news I heard from the travel and tourism sector was that people were starting to   respond to price discounts offered on cruises and hotel rooms  But activity in this sector generally   remains very weak     In the steel industry, about half of the current output of the domestic steel industry is being   produced by firms that are either operating under or have filed for bankruptcy protection  Moreover,   one major steel distributor we talked to is expecting another down year in 2002     Construction activity in our District definitely has slowed  On the residential side, softening   has been reported around the District In particular, demand in the Chicago apartment and   condominium market, which has been booming for several years, is down sharply  Vacancy rates are   likely to rise further as many additional units will be coming on the market over the next year from   projects that are already under construction  Despite these negative developments, we have not seen   any adverse spillover to the banking sector, as bankers have limited the excess use of leverage by   developers and have better diversified their loan portfolios relative to previous cycles  Nonresidential   construction activity has slowed in virtually all areas  Office vacancy rates have risen, particularly in   Indianapolis where one-fifth of downtown office space is now empty       12/11/01 30    On the other hand, there were a few positive reports about demand picking up for medical   instruments, defense-related parts and components, and security equipment  And according to one   manufacturer, customer stocks of machine tools have fallen to such a low point that orders for tools   are starting to pick up Incentive programs continued to boost light vehicle sales more than expected   last month, and October and November are now in the record books as the highest back-to-back   months for such sales ever A year ago inventories were well above desired levels; now they’re very   lean Indeed for some models, dealers are lucky to have even one in their showrooms  But dealers are   being cautious about restocking, and automakers have not boosted production significantly because   they know that the recent sales pace cannot be sustained  In fact, one of the Big Three firms indicated   that sales weakened considerably in late November and early December   The experience in the light vehicle industry clearly illustrates that consumers are very price   conscious, and as a result many retailers are offering sizable price discounts  Sales so far in the   holiday shopping season, however, have been disappointing for most retailers we’ve talked with, and   as I noted last time their sales expectations were fairly low to begin with  But as retailers keep   reminding us, sales are often concentrated toward the end of the holiday shopping season, so we really   won’t know until then how good or how bad sales actually were   Reports on labor market conditions generally indicate further slackening  Research by our   staff confirms that a pickup in demand for temporary help tends to precede recovery in the labor   market  We have two very large temporary help supply firms headquartered in our District  They   differed on their assessment of whether there was any bottoming in the demand for manufacturing   workers One thought maybe there was; the other said definitely not     Turning to the national outlook, the economy is clearly in recession and the November   employment report indicates that activity has not bottomed out yet  The breadth of job loss extends     12/11/01 31    beyond manufacturing  The Greenbook forecast has an economic rebound taking hold by the second   quarter of next year Our analysis and most consensus forecasts point toward a qualitatively similar   rebound An important feature of the data so far is that the deterioration in labor markets appears not   to have spilled over into an unraveling of consumer sentiment and household spending  Price   discounting, low interest rates, and low energy prices are clearly positive forces offsetting the weak   employment situation     However, I see three major risks that potentially could weigh on activity for some time    First, despite the favorable experience to date, I think the uncertainty associated with the 9/11 attacks   and income losses from the weakening labor market could result in a sustained period of hunkering   down by households This could dampen growth in consumption and residential investment by more   than assumed in the consensus outlook  Second, I think we may have a good deal further to go in   unwinding the capital overhang that became evident following the bursting of the high-tech bubble    And third, the widespread nature of the slowing in economies throughout the world makes me   concerned that global activity will be weaker than we’re anticipating  So on balance, I see the risk for   growth in the United States as continuing to weigh substantially on the downside    Mr Chairman, I agree with the recommendation for a 25 basis point   reduction in the rate In my view it’s appropriate this time because I think it will help to underpin the   consumer while the inventory cycle completes itself and corporate profits and capital spending slowly   return to more normal levels  I also believe that the balance of risks should be toward weaker   economic growth  And I strongly support the idea of putting a signal in the wording of the press   statement to the effect that the situation is not as bleak as we saw it last time  I don’t want to   encourage people to think that we continue to see only negative news on all fronts        12/11/01 88   "
6990,2002-01-29,"  I just want to ask a question about the orders data, where we’ve seen   some positive news  Of course, this was at a time when there was a strong expectation that a tax           January 29-30, 2002 Page 58 of 194  cut for business would be enacted to encourage orders  My recollection is that it was going to be   retroactive—at least in the bill that was introduced—as well I was just wondering if this is   something that we should be concerned about  Do you think people were ordering in   anticipation of that legislation being enacted whereas obviously, at this point, it is unlikely to be   enacted?    You had done some survey work at that time as to what the impact of   those tax cuts would be Did you get any insights based on that?    Well, it was going to be retroactive    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The tone of reports from contacts in the   Seventh District has improved significantly since our December meeting  At that time I   indicated that most contacts were not seeing signs of a bottom let alone a recovery  Now, reports   of stabilizing, bottoming out, or nearing a bottom are more frequent and people seem less   pessimistic  No one is saying activity is expanding rapidly, but there is a definite sense that   conditions are not getting any worse, particularly in the manufacturing sector  The latest   Chicago Purchasing Managers’ survey results, for example, show that, although the composite   index remained below the 50 percent threshold, it did climb in January to 451 percent  That was   its highest level in thirteen months  The production component rose to a level slightly above   50 percent in January, also the first signal of expanding production in thirteen months  Let me   note that these results should be treated confidentially until they are released tomorrow          January 29-30, 2002 Page 68 of 194  In the auto industry, sales of light vehicles came down from the lofty levels recorded in   October and November but with incentives remaining generous, sales continued to surprise on   the upside in December and, according to our contacts, in January as well  Last week we had a   meeting with auto company representatives and industry analysts and their forecasts for light   vehicle sales in 2002 have been raised  They now range from 155 to 162 million units, with   auto manufacturers being more conservative than the industry analysts  Production has been   picking up somewhat, in part to replenish dealer inventories that were extremely lean at the end   of last year   In the airline industry, although air traffic remains 12 to 15 percent below year-ago   levels, both United and Boeing indicated that they see a slow but steady improvement in travel,   which they expect to continue throughout the year  After being weak in the fourth quarter,   demand for corrugated boxes was described as fairly strong so far in January, and contacts report   that machine tool orders have either bottomed or turned up  Signs of improvement in   manufacturing at this point generally are seen as reflecting efforts by firms to rebuild inventories,   and a concern going forward is whether there will be sufficient final demand to sustain a   recovery On that issue, none of our contacts with markets abroad noted any strengthening in   export demand  More often, concerns were voiced about weakness abroad and particularly about   conditions in Japan In terms of capital spending, we have not heard any reports that suggest   firms are increasing investment or plan to do so soon  Businesses seem to be continuing to delay   even productivity-enhancing capital expenditures as one way of conserving cash and boosting   profits at least in the short term     So, in terms of looking for strength in final demand, we’re back to depending on the   consumer where the story is mixed but seems somewhat more promising than a month or so ago         January 29-30, 2002 Page 69 of 194  Residential housing markets, for example, have held up quite well, perhaps reflecting more-  favorable weather in the Midwest  Overall, total holiday season sales were slightly better than   had been expected, and inventories generally remained in control  After a slow start to the   holiday shopping season, sales improved over the last two weeks of December and have   continued to show relative strength so far in January  As is usually the case, results varied   considerably across different types of retailers and merchandise in a season marked by heavy   discounting and extended shopping hours   One firm headquartered in our District that did very poorly was Kmart, which as you   know filed for Chapter 11 protection last week  Kmart has significant long-term problems that   many people in the retail industry have been talking about for some time  But our contacts   indicated that the speed with which their financing sources dried up largely reflected a spillover   effect from the extensive publicity surrounding Enron     Future strength in consumer spending and housing will hinge in part on employment   prospects On that score, reports suggest that labor markets in our region are still weak    However, the rate of job losses appears to have eased in some areas, and there have been   scattered reports of some new hiring  Contacts at two large national temporary help firms   indicated that, while conditions were basically flat or near bottom in that industry, there were   early signs of improvement in the demand for workers in manufacturing     Turning to the national outlook, the key questions are when the recovery will begin and   how robust it will be once it takes hold  On the first question, the evidence increasingly points to   the economy being near a bottom, and obviously today’s GDP report reinforces that  For some   time I’ve been concerned that rising unemployment would erode incomes and confidence enough   to cause a more significant slide in household spending, which could lead to a wider and deeper     January 29-30, 2002 Page 70 of 194  recession But the recent drop in unemployment insurance claims and the broad-based increase   in the workweek are signaling that the deterioration in labor market conditions may be near an   end To be sure, the signs of a bottoming out are still tentative and not universal  For example,   the demand for temporary workers, usually a leading indicator of labor market conditions,   remains weak as I mentioned earlier  And, of course, we could still get some downside surprises     Regarding the strength of the recovery once it begins, several factors suggest that growth   may be more restrained than is typical in post-recessionary periods  For instance, given the   recent pace of vehicle and new home sales, it’s hard to imagine that there is much pent-up   demand for consumer durables or new homes  Moreover, consumers likely have not yet fully   factored the declines in equity markets into their savings decisions  And with profits and   capacity utilization still low and uncertainty high, businesses are likely to be slow to increase   capital spending On the other hand, given what looks to have been an extraordinary pace of   inventory liquidation last quarter, we should get a fairly good sized pop from inventories, a point   that ties in with the discussion we were just having  And, of course, there is still significant   policy stimulus in the pipeline  Moreover, productivity growth has been very well maintained,   again as evidenced in today’s data, which should provide a foundation for growth in incomes and   household spending   Weighing all the factors, we think that the most likely outcome is for slightly stronger   growth in 2002 than in the Greenbook projection  But the level of uncertainty remains high  In   addition to the risks that I mentioned, there is reason to be concerned about a further   deterioration in the international situation as well as fallout from the Enron debacle  So,   although the situation looks better than it did in December, I still think that the risks remain tilted   to the downside     January 29-30, 2002 Page 71 of 194   We noticed [Laughter]        January 29-30, 2002 Page 79 of 194   Don, also on chart 4, I was curious about the projection of the   unemployment rate in the price stability scenario  I realize, obviously, that these are long-term   projections, but when the forecast is run out to 2006 the unemployment rate is still significantly   above the NAIRU at that point  I was just wondering how this model works  When would you   expect the unemployment rate to start coming down closer to the NAIRU?    So it would happen but beyond the 2006 timeframe?    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  In my statement I   talked about the risks on both sides But I do think the two key risks, which we all talked   about—capital spending and the consumer—are truly weighted to the downside  A lot can   always go wrong on the consumer side  So I support both parts of the recommendation      Roger, when was the last time that we had dissents on a discount rate   action?    So that was before our current practice of releasing a statement—   which does get a lot of attention—that began in 1994    And all the wire services pick up our decision quite promptly    I agree completely that we should delay this decision and study the   options further I would like to know how quickly we could produce minutes of the same quality        January 29-30, 2002 Page 144 of 194  that we put out now And in addition to the criteria you were laying out, Roger, I would suggest   two more  I think we also have to do this in a way that does not have a chilling effect on   people’s willingness to dissent at a meeting and in a way that does not detract from the   consensus-driven nature of the deliberations of this body  That consensus-driven nature is   something that I believe has served us very well over the years and I would certainly like to do   everything we can to maintain it  "
7016,2002-03-19,"  Mr Chairman, I agree with what seems to be an emerging consensus   that we do the contingency planning first and also with what Tony Santomero, Bill McDonough,   and others have said I just want to reiterate the point that Bill McDonough made  If the   Congress designates certain securities as having the full faith and credit of the United States—   whether they are GNMAs or securities issued in another Chrysler-type bailout—it’s not   appropriate for us to distinguish among those securities  Even though we personally may not   like the idea of subsidizing one sector or one firm, it is not our role to make such a distinction  It   really is a congressional decision  So I would favor going in that direction  I also happen to   agree with the point that Ned made about trying to draw a distinction between Fannie and   Freddie on the one hand and GNMA on the other If we ever got to the point where we were   purchasing GNMA securities but we made it very clear that we were not purchasing those of   Fannie and Freddie, I think that might help educate the public a little more on this issue    I have a question for David on the longer-term outlook for inflation,   beyond the actual forecast period I’m looking at the baseline scenario and thinking about where   the economy will be at the end of 2003  We will have had a year of 4 percent real GDP growth;   the economy would be growing beyond potential  The output gap is eliminated at that point, and   the unemployment rate is at 53 percent, which is your estimate of the NAIRU  And you   mentioned that we probably would have to raise rates in 2004 to avoid overstimulation at that   point Do we currently have a forecast for inflation for 2004?  I’m just wondering if by raising   rates in 2004 we will be too late—later than the market expects—to avoid inflationary pressures   at that point        March 19, 2002 Page 35 of 117   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The reports that we’re now receiving   indicate that the Seventh District economy is most likely in the early stages of recovery    Manufacturing in the District is showing clear signs of a turnaround  Our Midwest   manufacturing index was up in January, with gains in three of the four subsectors we measure    So the strength is not just in the automobile industry  In addition, for the first time in over a year   all three of our regional purchasing managers’ indexes—for Chicago, Detroit, and Milwaukee—   indicate expansion in February, with strength coming from new orders and production   Our directors and other contacts report that customers are ordering for inventory   rebuilding, and there are even a few reports of increases in capital spending from some appliance   makers and auto parts suppliers  Nonetheless, many contacts remain cautious  At this time most   businesses are saying that there is significant excess capacity and they are not planning to   increase spending on fixed capital as quickly as they had coming out of previous slowdowns    Our advisory councils that met earlier this month echoed those comments about capital spending   With regard to the labor market, manufacturers still appear hesitant to hire permanent   employees, but two major temporary help firms headquartered in our District are seeing modest   increases nationally in demand from manufacturers  One of them even mentioned receiving   emergency calls from clients who were ramping up production unexpectedly  January data for     March 19, 2002 Page 47 of 117  our District reinforced the impression that labor markets are slightly firmer in our region than in   the nation as a whole, and the pace of layoffs also has slowed  Nonetheless, consumer spending   is not looking as bright as elsewhere in the nation  Reports from our contacts in the retail, travel,   tourism, and entertainment industries were very uneven  Still, by and large, even those reporting   weak sales were not saying that things were getting worse  Furthermore, housing markets   remain strong, and if labor markets continue to improve, that should bolster household sector   spending going forward  Automakers are more bullish; most have raised their 2002 sales   forecast once again—this time by more than 500,000 vehicles compared with the estimates they   had last time we met  However, they expressed concern about increases in steel prices resulting   from the recently imposed tariffs even though their purchase prices are fixed by one- or two-year   contracts   Turning to the national outlook, at our January meeting I was expecting that real GDP   would increase 3 percent this year  Since then the outlook has clearly improved  The household   sector has continued to surprise us on the upside  The positive developments on productivity   should bolster household incomes and business profits, and the economic stimulus package is a   plus for investment  Still, there continue to be downside risks  Inventory rebuilding will boost   production, but whether that increase is sustainable will depend on whether the economy   generates more-fundamental increases in final demand  Even with the stimulus package, I see   investment as a major risk  Our forecast builds in a weaker-than-average cyclical recovery in   business fixed investment  However, I’m concerned that excess capacity may weigh on capital   spending even more than we have assumed  And negative wealth effects could weigh on the   household sector more than our current outlook projects  So in light of these considerations,   while I believe a recovery is under way, I expect that growth in the first year will be slower than        March 19, 2002 Page 48 of 117  in similar periods in past recoveries  Overall though, I see the risks as much more balanced   today than when we met in January    Mr Chairman, I agree with both parts of your recommendation  I   don’t think there’s any urgency to move today I do think we can go from a balanced risk   statement today to an increase in the funds rate in May without any problem at all  And I, too,   like the idea of putting in the statement something about monetary policy being accommodative   now    Roger’s summary was excellent  I would just add that we had a very   thorough discussion of all of the options, and I think it was a consensus that this was the best   route to go  "
7039,2002-05-07,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The story from the Seventh District is very   much the same as in March  Our economy is recovering, but I’m hearing a lot of mixed   messages from my contacts  There’s a good deal of concern as to whether the rebound will have   legs   Manufacturing in the District continues to improve, led by inventory rebuilding  The   Chicago Fed’s Midwest manufacturing index has been rising since November  The underlying   demand for construction materials is strong, and inventory rebuilding is boosting production in   the steel and auto sectors  Indeed, automakers continue to be bullish  Most have raised their         May 7, 2002 24 of 81  2002 forecast once again and are currently looking for a strong year, with sales in the   neighborhood of 167 million to 168 million for light vehicles  Despite these positive   developments, we’re still hearing only a few scattered reports of increases in capital spending    In fact, capital spending plans by firms in the District are best described as weak   In March I reported that consumer spending in our region appeared to be lagging the rest   of the nation Some of our retail sector contacts indicate that since then activity in the Midwest   has outperformed other regions  But readings from our tourism and entertainment sectors are   still mixed  The head of a specialty retail furniture and home furnishing chain who is typically   quite pessimistic reported that over the last two months business was roaring  On the other hand,   apparel and department store sales have been very weak during this period  Construction activity   is holding up well in our region Residential construction is reported to have softened modestly,   but this doesn’t appear to be surprising anyone, given the earlier strength  Nonresidential   vacancy rates appear to be stabilizing, in part because some firms that had been planning to   sublease their space now find that they need it after all     Labor markets are behaving as we would expect at the outset of an economic expansion    Firms are still hesitant to hire new permanent workers; but layoff announcements are slowing,   and some planned layoffs have been put on hold  The two major temporary help firms   headquartered in our District are seeing fairly robust demand, particularly from manufacturers    Moreover, preliminary results from the soon-to-be-released Manpower Survey show a significant   increase in hiring intentions for the third quarter  This is true for the Midwest and for the nation   as a whole That information is confidential until May 13, when the final survey results are   released            May 7, 2002 25 of 81  Turning to the national outlook, we’re still faced with balancing the short-term concern   over how much momentum there is in final demand against the long-run inflationary   consequences of prolonging the current accommodative stance of monetary policy  GDP growth   in the first quarter was faster than we had expected in March  We’re all quite familiar with the   special factors that raised GDP growth, but the good news was the strength in household   spending, as David mentioned in his briefing     However, I still do not feel that the uncertainty regarding the strength of final demand has   been resolved On the upside, the possibility that deteriorating labor markets could spill over and   depress household spending appears to be less of a risk  And the productivity news continues to   be impressive  On the downside, the outlook for capital spending has not improved  In that   regard it still looks like a lackluster year  There appears to be little optimism about demand in   the recent earnings reports from high-tech firms  And, as I mentioned earlier, our business   contacts remain cautious about undertaking new investment  In addition, the run-up in oil prices   is a negative for household purchasing power and business profits     On balance, the most likely outcome is for real GDP growth averaging close to its   potential rate over the remainder of the year, although this is by no means certain  Given this   scenario, the issue of when to become somewhat less accommodative requires particularly   careful thought Although we do not have to move today, the well-known lags of monetary   policy require that we begin moving soon  We know that as the expansion takes hold, businesses   will be turning around at somewhat different rates and different times  Business people are   seeing the recovery from a variety of sectoral perspectives, and that explains the mixed tone of   the messages that I mentioned earlier  Given the mild recession and the moderate expansion that               May 7, 2002 26 of 81  we anticipate, these anecdotes probably will continue to be mixed for some time, even as we start   to raise rates   We put in a good deal of insurance against the potential economic fallout from   September 1l  So in contrast with some earlier interest rate cycles, it may be relatively easy to   explain and undertake the first tranche of rate hikes    I agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
7064,2002-06-25,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  This article that the Minneapolis Fed has   published is obviously a very interesting one, and I think it is a timely reminder to all of us how   difficult it is to forecast inflation  After that research was done, our staff did some further work   on the Minneapolis results, and the results of our research were reported in our Economic   Perspectives publication in the first quarter of this year  So I thought it would be helpful if I   described our findings, which in some respects differ from what the Minneapolis study found   The first point relates to the use of the Phillips curve in policymaking  The Minneapolis   study, of course, talks about the magnitude of inflation—the impact of the Phillips curve in this   type of analysis on the magnitude of inflation  But if we change that and talk about the direction   of inflation, actually the results differ quite significantly because the naïve model obviously   assumes no change in inflation going forward, so it doesn’t help us at all in terms of predicting   the direction for inflation  But if we use the Phillips curve models, they do  At least the analysis   that we’ve done shows that if one goes out over either a twelve-month period or a twenty-four­  month period, the Phillips curve model in seven out of the ten cases, 70 percent of the time, does   accurately predict the direction of inflation going forward  So from a policy standpoint, that’s   not inconsequential; it’s of some benefit   Secondly, the period used in the Minneapolis study, 1984 to 2000, is a period when there   was some structural change, as was pointed out in the Board staff’s study   There really was a   change in the way our central bank approached inflation  We became much more anti-inflation   in the 1980s and the 1990s than we were before, and that is likely to have influenced the   behavior of inflation So to some extent then, the poor performance of these inflation-forecasting   models that are estimated with data going back to the 1960s is not surprising  If we look at the   Phillips curve models in the 1984 to 1992 period, right after the change in monetary policy, they         June 25-26, 2002 13 of 179  don’t do well But if we break the period differently and look at the interval from 1992 to 2000,   they actually do well in forecasting inflation, much as they did in the period prior to 1984   The third and last point I’d mention is that this study looked only at forecasting over a   twelve-month period  When one looks out over a twenty-four-month period, the Phillips curve   models do better than the naïve model  So clearly, there are limitations to these Phillips curve   types of models, but I wouldn’t discard them completely  I think there is some benefit to   policymaking from these types of approaches    I don’t think the science of economics is ever confident in that type of   prediction It’s certainly not at the point where we can confidently predict that  To me it’s a   question of what is helpful to the policymaker  And if in seven out of ten times we are able to   point out the direction of future inflation, I’d view that as helpful    But I think it’s better than 50 percent    My point is that I wouldn’t discard it out of hand  I think it is still   something for us to look at as policymakers; it provides some useful input    This is just a further elaboration on the point Roger Ferguson was   making earlier that the productivity effect will fade but may persist a while longer  And, of   course, your point that the productivity acceleration represents 63 percent of the difference   between the two simulations makes it extremely important  I was wondering if you’ve looked at   this trend in compensation and productivity in relationship to labor’s share of the total income   pie I remember these data very well  As we all know, labor’s share came down from 1990 to   1997 and then started to go up in 1997 and is now near its historical highs  The reason I   remember these data so well is that in 1996, at the request of our Bank’s chairman, who at the   time was the head of the Chicago AFL-CIO, we gave a presentation to our board of directors on   compensation trends  He saw the nonlabor share going up and, of course, got very concerned    After he left our board, that share started to come down  [Laughter] I’ve always been meaning   to bring him up to date on these data So, I was just wondering if you’ve thought about that in   the context of the analyses that you’ve done in this paper    It’s helpful I guess I had thought that the labor share was near its   historical high now, not the average  Am I wrong on that?    To its average?    So, underlying your statement that the growth in productivity may   persist awhile longer is a view that it is getting less and less likely?    So our job gets more difficult going forward    My question is on the alternative simulation with the weaker dollar  I   understand that you had a 20 percent reduction in the dollar, but was it spread out over a year?    Four quarters I was just wondering if you had any thoughts on what   would happen if that weakness occurred sooner—say, in the next several months—in terms of   the impact on output, employment, and also our policy response      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Reports from our contacts in the Seventh   District continue to validate our basic outlook  Our economy is recovering but at a moderate   pace As we discussed last time, some sectors are recovering faster than others, so it’s not   surprising that reports continue to be mixed  We’re still not hearing about any significant   strengthening in capital spending plans; rather, most contacts report that investment plans either   are on hold or are being managed cautiously  In contrast, our housing sector is holding up quite   well   Consumer spending slowed somewhat in May, but our contacts suggest that this was only   temporary  Several retailers reported that sales bounced back in early June, and home-related   products, such as appliances and furnishings, continued to be very strong  Light vehicle sales   also seem to have bounced back in June, to an annual rate reported to be in the mid-16 million   range Moreover, longer-term prospects remain positive  The consensus of participants at our   recent auto outlook symposium was for sales of autos and light trucks to total 16½ million units        June 25-26, 2002 73 of 179  this year and to be at the same level in 2003  Last December the consensus was for sales of   15½ million units this year     Even outside of the auto sector, manufacturing in the region has continued its modest   pickup The Chicago Fed Midwest Manufacturing Index rose in April for the fourth straight   month, and the gains over that period were stronger than for the nation  And while the Chicago   Purchasing Managers’ Index, which will be publicly released on Friday, slipped a bit from 608   in May to 582 in June, that’s still solidly in the expansion range  Although most firms still have   very little pricing power, we’re beginning to hear reports of some attempts to raise prices for   products such as construction materials and packaging  And, of course, steel prices are rising   Labor demand appears to have improved slightly  After trailing for six years, our year-  over-year employment growth is now equal to that in the country as a whole  And District   manufacturing employment, though still soft, shows more significant signs of improvement than   that in the nation Contacts at two large temporary-help firms that are headquartered in our   District report higher orders for workers, particularly from manufacturers  Firms remain   cautious about bringing on new regular employees, which is good news for the temp industry    Our contacts also note that, with each downturn, client firms have increasingly recognized the   flexibility offered by temporary help  So, as after previous recessions, they expect to see another   ratcheting up in the share of temporary workers   Turning to the national outlook, similar to the Greenbook we continue to project that real   GDP growth will run somewhat above potential in the second half of this year and in 2003  We   see core inflation little changed through next year  But there are clearly some downside risks    The improvements in manufacturing production and orders may be only a transitory response to   inventory rebuilding  Moreover, the recently weak retail sales and consumer sentiment reports        June 25-26, 2002 74 of 179  remind us that consumers are unlikely to fuel an acceleration in final demand  Instead, negative   wealth effects in the stock market may make households turn more cautious  Also, the list of   factors weighing on business and consumer confidence seems to be getting longer and longer    Accounting irregularities, corporate nongovernance, the war on terrorism, unrest in the Middle   East, and threats of nuclear war and dirty bombs are all keeping people awake at night  And   yesterday’s WorldCom announcement is another one of these factors     However, on the upside, strong productivity growth should support further gains in wages   while keeping unit labor costs in check, which will be good for profits  Rising home values   should offset some of the stock market declines  And, of course, we still have substantial   monetary and fiscal stimulus in place  So while it’s natural at this stage to be focusing on the   downside, we think the risks to our forecast are reasonably balanced   Finally, let me note that we had a meeting of our Academic and Business Economists   Advisory Committee last week, and they basically agreed with our outlook for real activity    They also agreed that inflation was likely to remain benign in the near term, but most voiced   concern that the Fed may be getting behind the curve in returning to a neutral policy stance,   given the long lags in monetary policy  My personal assessment is that we don’t need to move   today, given the moderate nature of this expansion  However, we will need to begin moving   back toward a neutral stance of monetary policy even while reports on the economy are still   mixed and we are still hearing a lot of negative anecdotes  But we have some time before we   need to make that decision    I support the recommendation, Mr Chairman         June 25-26, 2002 126 of 179 "
7093,2002-08-13,"  I had a question for David on the very large drop in the workweek in   July In the Greenbook you said that you expect that to be reversed  We looked at the historical   data and over the last fifteen years there has only been one time that we’ve seen a drop this   significant where it wasn’t associated with a strike or bad weather or something of that sort  So   I’m just wondering if you had any further insights on that from your deep background contacts at   BLS Or was it just a question of probabilities that you’re expecting this reversal?    The BLS people didn’t have any further insights into this?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  On balance, the general tone of the reports   on business conditions in the Seventh District continues mixed  Most of our contacts are still   waiting to see the light at the end of the tunnel  However, for the first time in a long while, I   started to receive some upbeat reports from several of my regular contacts who are directors,   CEOs, or other senior leaders of businesses with large national operations  It’s still too early to   tell whether these reflect a turning point, but I was encouraged by the unexpected good news     Reports on consumer spending remain mixed both within the District and at the national   level Discount chains still appear to be doing all right  However, a large developer and operator   of retail malls said that traffic slowed in June and weakened further in July and early August    Air travel had been trending back toward pre-September 11 levels but has flattened out since   June For manufacturing, our regional purchasing managers’ indexes in Chicago, Detroit, and   Milwaukee present a picture of anemic growth in the District  But the motor vehicle sector is   relatively strong The return of zero percent financing programs has boosted sales, and we’ve         August 13, 2002 21 of 92  heard that light vehicle production plans for the third and fourth quarters are likely to be raised   again Heavy-duty truck production and shipments will be strong through October but are   expected to drop off markedly after that, as the new EPA regulations on engines take effect    Some of the positive news that I heard was from our contacts in the railroad and packaging   industries who indicated that shipping volumes were up in June and July  Trucking contacts also   were upbeat, but this may reflect the shakeout of excess trucking capacity during the last year   instead of a pickup in overall demand     Turning to capital spending, we still are not hearing any reports of plans to increase   outlays We asked our directors and our Beige Book contacts whether the recent special tax   depreciation allowances had affected capital spending decisions, and only a very few indicated   that they had moved up the timing of some investments  Of course, it’s still early, and there was   a sense that spending might pick up closer to the time when the provisions are set to expire   The vast majority of our contacts continue to say that they have little pricing power    There were, however, a few reports of price increases—for example, in steel, plastic resins, and   tuition costs  Within the District, employers remain reluctant to take on new permanent hires    At the national level, Manpower’s latest survey, which will be publicly released on August 26,   shows hiring plans for the fourth quarter remaining at the improved third-quarter level  Our   Manpower contact also said that he did not think that the decline in temporary employment in the   July payroll numbers was indicative of conditions in the help-supply industry, which he   continues to view as being better than in previous recoveries Our Kelly Services contact was   less optimistic   Turning to the national outlook, we appear to have hit quite a rough patch in the recovery    The incoming data have been disappointing though not uniformly so  We must make a judgment            August 13, 2002 22 of 92  on whether the economy is currently experiencing a temporary slowdown in activity, a prolonged   period of subpar growth that is being generated by special circumstances in this expansion, or the   beginnings of another downturn In doing so we must think about the consequences of the latest   shock to the financial sector, the recent revelations suggesting that failures in corporate   governance extend beyond a handful of black sheep firms  These revelations have added a great   deal of skittishness to an already uncertain business climate  They also have broadened the   perception that during the late 1990s markets had been overestimating the returns and   underestimating the risks associated with many investment projects  So, what is the fallout of   this on economic activity?  One impact may be the recent disappointing readings on orders    Indeed, when I combine all of this with what I’m hearing from my contacts I’m concerned that   we may be in for further weakness in business spending     There are negatives for the household sector as well  Confidence is down, and the drop   in equity prices since our May meeting has made a substantial dent in households’ balance   sheets However, the strong response to the latest set of auto incentives reminds us not to give   up on the consumer  Furthermore, even after the NIPA revisions, the underlying trend in   productivity still appears to be positive  This suggests that some of the recent disappointing   news regarding real activity reflects transitory movements in volatile data as opposed to a more   persistent weakening in activity  And we have to remind ourselves that, given the typical lags,   we are now entering the period when last fall’s rate cuts should have their strongest effects   So balancing these factors we, too, have marked down our forecast for growth, but our   best guess is that the softness we’re currently seeing will not cascade further either into an actual   double-dip or a prolonged period of growth well below potential  Similar to the Greenbook, we   now are thinking that real GDP growth will average closer to 3 percent in 2002 and 3½ percent         August 13, 2002 23 of 92  in 2003, down from the projected rate of 3¾ percent for both years in our previous forecast  This   outlook is conditioned on our prolonging a period of accommodative monetary policy  So, I   think maintaining our current stance is appropriate  But it will be important for us to   acknowledge in our statement the current rough patch in the expansion      Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation not to move rates at   this time  The accommodative stance of monetary policy that we have in place is intended in   part to protect us against the hopefully short-term slowdown that we’ve seen over the last month   or six weeks  So with that insurance built in, I think the current level of the funds rate should   hold us in good stead going forward I agree very strongly with your point that if we do move,   we should make a move of 50 basis points, not 25 basis points, because the catalyst would be   some significant weakness in the economy, some sudden shock, or some risk of a deflationary   environment    On the tilt, I think it’s a very close call Good arguments have been made on both sides    On balance, I have a slight preference for conveying the message in the language of the press   release rather than by shifting the tilt, but I certainly can live with the approach that you   recommended  I do think that the markets will view this as at least a short-term increase in the   probability that we will move the fed funds rate down at the next meeting  But as you said, with               August 13, 2002 86 of 92  other data coming in they could clearly move in the other direction as well  So as I indicated, I   have a slight preference for the other approach, but I can live with your recommendation  "
7119,2002-09-24,"  I have a question for you, David, about the discussion on productivity   in your remarks today and also the alternative scenario with faster productivity growth included   in the Greenbook You talked about two possible explanations for this extraordinary growth in   productivity One is that structural productivity has increased, and you deal with that in the   alternative scenario The second is that employers have employees working harder, and I think   you added organizational efficiencies to that as well  Some research we’ve done in Chicago   would suggest that if employers are having employees work harder, employees also are going to   be working longer hours But, of course, as you said, the hours worked have been drifting down,   and overtime hasn’t increased significantly  So I’m just wondering how you reconcile those   facts with this favored explanation of the higher increase in productivity growth?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  On balance, the recovery in the Seventh   District economy appears to be continuing but at a slow and uneven pace  At the last meeting I   mentioned that I had started to receive some upbeat reports from a number of highly placed   contacts Unfortunately, the optimism has not spread, and in some cases it has waned rather     September 24, 2002 28 of 115  suddenly over the past few weeks  For instance, a national retailer specializing in home    furnishings and a large appliance manufacturer both reported that, after a very strong first half of   the year, sales growth slowed significantly starting in mid-August  And a large manufacturer of   high-tech equipment indicated that industry demand had slowed suddenly over the past four   weeks These anecdotal reports are consistent with the drop in the Chicago Purchasing   Managers’ Index from 549 in August to 481 in September  That will be the first reading below   50 since January, and this information is confidential until September 30  On the other hand, as   we all know, light vehicle sales have been strong  Our contacts expect September sales of about   17 million, and they are now predicting that sales in 2002 will be within striking distance of last   year’s very high levels  The industry seems quite willing to respond to any slowing in demand   with even higher sales incentives   In the District’s other manufacturing industries, conditions vary widely  We’ve heard   positive reports from manufacturers supplying homebuilders  And the pickup in the demand for   paper packaging materials that I mentioned last time has continued  But producers of heavy   construction equipment and Class A trucks remain gloomy, and the drought is a negative for   farm equipment, at least in the short run  Capital spending, of course, continues to be a big   question mark  One reading came from the international manufacturing and technology show   that was held in Chicago this month, which is the big trade show for manufacturing equipment    Attendees generally indicated that sales in their industry are still quite poor but are no longer   getting any worse Our Advisory Council on Agriculture, Labor, and Small Business met two   weeks ago, and representatives indicated that while many laid-off workers are being recalled,   most employers remain reluctant to hire new permanent workers given the still somewhat cloudy   future Perhaps for this reason, both our Manpower and our Kelly Services contacts reported that        September 24, 2002 29 of 115  national demand for temporary workers has been rising rapidly since August  That is good news   It is the first time during this recovery that both were so positive  Moreover, the pickup was not   limited to manufacturing, but orders were strong across the board   Our contacts report that wage pressures are minimal  However, businesses are struggling   with higher health care and other insurance costs  Manufacturers say that the steel tariffs have   raised prices, increased delivery times, and reduced the quality of the steel that they buy    Moreover, we had a fascinating exchange at our recent advisory council meeting between the   steel workers’ union leader and one of the country’s leading duck farmers  The issue was how   retaliation to the steel tariffs by some of our trading partners is hurting other subsidized   industries [Laughter]      Well, I haven’t had so much fun since I was deputy trade   representative! Turning to the national outlook, the economy still seems to be on a bumpy road    We have absorbed an extraordinary number of shocks over the past year  September 11, the war   on terrorism, international trade disputes, the failures in corporate governance, and now the   prospect of war with Iraq To date the economy has shown a good deal of resiliency, but these   shocks have taken a toll on confidence and have substantially raised uncertainty, as David   mentioned   Continued sluggish job growth is a concern  Employment growth is looking more and   more as it did following the 1990-91 recession  Of course, the unemployment rate was much   higher then, and overall labor markets are in better shape now  Looking forward, I am   encouraged by the reports of solid demand that I’m hearing, as I mentioned, from the temporary   help industry And people continue to buy homes and spend on big-ticket items  Low interest              September 24, 2002 30 of 115  rates clearly have helped, but this activity also indicates households’ confidence, at least for now,   in their long-term employment and income prospects  In my view this revealed preference is   probably a better gauge of consumer confidence than the survey-based measures that have been   weak recently    So why aren’t businesses showing some more confidence?  I wish I knew for sure Given   the continued strong fundamental pace of technological change, current capital spending   probably is not being held back by further deterioration in perceptions of the ultimate return to   investment  More likely we’re seeing some delays in capital spending because firms at this time   are reluctant to make large, often irreversible commitments in this environment of elevated   uncertainty   But balancing these various factors, we think the most likely scenario continues to be one   of moderate economic expansion with low inflation  Nevertheless, given the sluggish job growth   and skittish business sentiment, I am concerned that the economy doesn’t have a lot of room to   absorb new shocks or any intensification of the old ones  Consequently, the risks remain   weighted toward economic weakness      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support both parts of your   recommendation  I just want to make two comments  One relates to the point you mentioned   about the credibility of the Federal Reserve and the Federal Open Market Committee, which I   think is extremely important  I support fully your suggestion that we describe any easing move        September 24, 2002 94 of 115  as a form of insurance, because the situation could change quickly  If we lower rates, we may   find that we will have to move in the other direction very quickly as well  We have to be   prepared to do that So describing it as insurance or putting it in that context I think helps the   credibility of this Committee  The second point is on whether we should move before the next   meeting if appropriate or at the meeting because of the election  I think we must let the data   decide If it’s appropriate to move, we should move       I didn’t think you did imply anything other than that, but I just—    Absolutely And we all want to keep it that way    I don’t think you should ever be restricted from talking about monetary   policy after a meeting for some artificial time period that we’ve predetermined  I think your   commenting as you suggest would be good    But, Mr Chairman, you’ll be speaking in a foreign language there!  "
7145,2002-11-06,"  I have a question for David about table A in the extension of the   Greenbook forecast On prices, you have the core PCE declining through 2007 and then ticking   up only slightly after that It’s really an extraordinary performance—if we were concerned about   inflation at any point over that period  I was wondering if you had run any scenarios to see what   it would take for us to be concerned about inflation again over this extended period of time    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  On balance, economic activity in the   Seventh District appears to have softened further in September and October  Although our   housing sector remains vibrant, consumer spending has weakened  With a few exceptions, such   as the entertainment and recreational vehicle sectors, retail sales were reported to be weak             November 6, 2002 28 of 122  Given the sharp declines in consumer confidence measures, many retailers worry that holiday   sales will be disappointing Such concerns appear to be making retailers more cautious than   usual about ordering merchandise  In fact, a major appliance manufacturer told us that   inventories at the wholesale and retail levels were lower than he had ever seen  Relating to what   Bob Parry just talked about, the West Coast longshoreman issue, we’re hearing from retailers   that they are still waiting for substantial amounts of inventory to reach the store shelves  They   know they’ll get the merchandise eventually, but they’re not sure they’ll get it in time for the   holiday and then, obviously, they’ll have to sell it at a lower price  They’ll sell it but at lower   prices   As for the automobile industry, light vehicle sales in October fell further below the lofty   levels seen in July and August Auto dealers and the press are reporting that consumers have   become less responsive to incentives, suggesting that the consumer might be faltering  But this   probably overstates the case  Average incentives were scaled back in October in part because   incentives were higher on the 2002 models  Now in response to the weaker sales, automakers   are boosting incentives on the 2003 models GM in particular has already rolled out new   programs and appears to be considering others as well  Thus, there could well be some rebound   in sales in coming months   With regard to capital spending, most businesses are still hesitant to commit to large   projects Several believe that credit rating agencies have become tougher, leading firms to   conserve cash to avoid downgrades In some cases, firms that had ordered capital goods are   postponing delivery or just canceling their orders  Firms that are investing are doing so to   improve productivity or replace depreciated equipment rather than to expand capacity  Sales of   heavy trucks, of course, will be weak because of the disarray caused by the new engine         November 6, 2002 29 of 122  standards One large nationwide trucking company is purchasing only a few of these new   engines, just enough to test their reliability   In manufacturing more generally, the list of contacts reporting weak or volatile demand is   getting longer For instance, the corrugated box industry, which had been showing signs of   strength, now has flattened out, you could say  Or you could say that those manufacturers now   view the box as half empty rather than half full  [Laughter] I’d better stop!  A major high-tech   manufacturer reported further slowing in demand from the wide array of firms that they supply    Labor markets remain slack  A large national retailer said that the number of applications for   $8 an hour part-time holiday season jobs was up threefold from last year  All the jobs have now   been filled in a much earlier time frame   One of the two major national temporary help firms headquartered in our District,   Manpower, noted a resumption of seasonal hiring that was absent in 2001  But the other one,   Kelly, said that they were not seeing the typical seasonal surge in demand from retailers  Both   thought the hiring environment remained sluggish, though not falling off as it would in a double-  dip recession Manpower’s latest national survey shows that, after adjusting for normal seasonal   movements, hiring plans for the first quarter of 2003 picked up slightly from this year’s fourth   quarter  So at least this is consistent with labor markets not deteriorating further  I should   mention that this survey is confidential until November 18    Turning to the national outlook, incoming news since our last meeting has mainly been   disappointing Job growth has been minimal; businesses remain hesitant to invest; and the   trajectory of consumer spending has moderated, with the latest readings on consumer confidence   disturbingly low Of course, there have been some bright spots  Housing remains very strong,   and equity markets have improved somewhat since our last meeting  More importantly, in terms         November 6, 2002 30 of 122  of the longer-term fundamentals, productivity looks very good  Given its strength over the past   year, we can have more confidence that the underlying trends in productivity remain robust    And the banking system is in better shape than it was after the last recession     So why can’t the expansion gain more momentum?  We do not see any glaring structural   impediments that are causing sluggishness  Maybe it’s the animal spirits  For all of the reasons   we’re painfully aware of, uncertainty appears to be the main factor holding back the economy,   and the passage of time has done little to resolve it  This persistent overhang of uncertainty   concerns me, as it could lead to a prolonged period of subpar growth and a large resource gap  I   suspect this will be a major topic during our policy discussion    Mr Chairman, I agree with both parts of your recommendation  I   believe it is a good insurance policy against downside risks  On the risk statement, it’s a close   call, but on balance I think it is better to go the way you suggested in order to reduce the   unintended negative consequences if we were to keep the tilt toward weaker economic growth  I            November 6, 2002 93 of 122  agree with Bill McDonough in that I don’t think this precludes us in any way from doing   anything in the future if we had to  I certainly agree with that     I do want to pick up on one point that Bill Poole talked about, and that is the issue you   raised that this economy may turn around more quickly than we might anticipate  We all   certainly hope it does  What that means is that we do have to be careful because, if the economy   does turn around quickly, we have to be willing to raise rates at the appropriate time  We all   know it’s a lot easier to cut rates than to raise them    I tend to think we should focus on the Ginnie Maes  I’d have the staff   do that study and bring it back to this Committee and then we can decide whether that’s   sufficient to address the problem or not     I have some questions about whether we need an ACF  Given resource constraints—and   since we have plenty of time here as we all know—my preference would be to start with the   Ginnie Maes, get that done and assess that, and then decide whether any further work is   necessary Also, let me note that our Bank does have some technical comments on the ACF,   which we can send in, just to put a marker down for future use  And on the contingency ACF, I   have some questions, too, as to whether we really need it at this point, given everything else   we’ve done  "
7170,2002-12-10,"  I had a question about the deflation scenario that you showed in the   Greenbook, David As I understand the scenario, deflation was caused by two factors  One was   the downward adjustment to prices, and an unexpected weakness in aggregate demand was   added to it I have two questions about this First, if we didn’t have the aggregate demand shock   but had only the downward shock in prices, what would the deflation scenario look like in terms   of its impact on output?  Also, one channel of influence on output, of course, would be higher   real interest rates as a result of deflation  But are there other channels through which deflation   would have effects on output as well?    Let me make sure I understand the first part of your answer  If we had   only the shock from lower prices and lower wages, that would not have a sufficient impact to   produce the effect on output shown in the Greenbook simulation         December 10, 2002 20 of 87   And there are no other channels that you see deflation working through   to output besides the higher real interest rate?    Okay, thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Seventh District   generally appears to have remained soft in November and early December  Our retailing   contacts were pleased with Thanksgiving weekend sales, but those sales didn’t make up for an   otherwise soft November  And retailers remain cautious about the rest of the holiday season   As we know, nationwide sales of light vehicles recovered modestly in November but   remained below the pace of the first nine months of the year  We pressed our contacts for their   interpretation of the recent light vehicle sales numbers, and we heard quite a variety of views    Most believe that a good portion of the recent softness reflected a payback from the   exceptionally high sales pace of July and August, when incentives were particularly high  One   camp, including many auto dealers, also thought that there had been a more fundamental   softening in demand  They also attributed the November increase in light vehicle sales to the   late Thanksgiving because consumers tend to shift their interest away from automobile purchases   and toward holiday shopping after Thanksgiving   In contrast, the more sizable camp, including many contacts at automakers, thought that   sophisticated consumers were just staying on the sidelines waiting for bigger incentives  The         December 10, 2002 40 of 87  producers’ failure to persuade consumers that high incentives are gone is one reason to expect   them to reappear  Another is the desire by General Motors to recover market share even at the   expense of current profits GM announced new incentives late last week, and contacts there have   told us that they are contemplating other packages since the zero percent financing may have lost   some of its novelty  Other industry contacts also seem resigned to a further sweetening of   incentives In fact, Ford this week has increased its incentive packages   Despite the diverse interpretations, there is widespread agreement that 2003 will be   another good year for light vehicle sales The Big Three are all looking for a number around   164 million units, slightly above their view of the long-term trend  A sales pace of 164 million   is also the consensus forecast of the thirty-three survey respondents who participate in our annual   Economic Outlook Symposium that will be held this Friday though it’s a bit lower than the   Greenbook forecast   Outside of autos, District manufacturing does not appear to have changed much since my   last report In particular, producers of capital goods are still suffering  With regard to future   capital spending, we asked a lot of questions about firms’ plans, and we received a lot of the   same old answers  Businesses in the Midwest remain very cautious, and they appear to be taking   a wait-and-see attitude as the new year approaches  However, many contacts say their firms are   flexible and would be willing to increase capital spending should demand conditions warrant   District labor markets remain slack, with most businesses reluctant to hire  One of the   two temporary help firms headquartered in our District reported that year-over-year growth in   demand for temps, while still positive, has been trending down for three months  However, the   other firm noted a solid increase in demand for manufacturing workers after the survey week for   the November employment report  So perhaps that’s a little piece of good news              December 10, 2002 41 of 87  Turning to the national outlook, the recent news, of course, has been mixed  On the   negative side, the industrial sector in general remains weak  We still haven’t seen a major   turnaround in manufacturers’ orders, and last Friday’s labor market report was disappointing    But the other incoming information has been more positive  Motor vehicle sales and measures of   consumer confidence have recovered some from the low readings we had in hand at last month’s   meeting  Financial markets appear to be improving  Notably, the decline in risk spreads may be   a sign that markets have digested some of the shocks that they had to swallow over the previous   several months  And we all hope that the decline in unemployment insurance claims, even after   taking seasonality issues into account, is signaling that we may soon see some better news on job   growth   On balance, I think the weight of the evidence is telling us that the recent sluggishness in   the economy is most likely a temporary soft spot and that growth should pick up during 2003  It   remains to be seen how fast the recovery will proceed  Of course, strong productivity growth   and an accommodative monetary policy could cause output to grow faster than the Greenbook   forecast But I also see some risk that the recovery could be painfully slow  First, no one knows   how the situation in Iraq and the Middle East will play out  Second, I continue to be surprised   how many business people I talk to are backing off from risk-taking because of the ongoing   consequences of corporate governance scandals and the ensuing reforms  Hopefully, this will be   a temporary phenomenon    Is that an oxymoron?    I agree with your comments, Mr Chairman  I hope the General   Counsel doesn’t object to your change in procedure at this meeting  "
7195,2003-01-28,"  I want to ask about this financial fragility point a bit more, too  You   mentioned that in transcripts of FOMC meetings some Committee members have cited concerns   about financial fragility as a reason for smaller interest rate changes than they might otherwise   have wanted  I just wondered whether there is any evidence on this  Has any research been   done?  Or do you have any suspicions about what the relationship is of these up-and-down rate   movements to financial fragility?    It gets back to the risk-aversion point    See if there are any volunteers!      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Seventh District   generally appears to have remained soft in December and January  Our contacts’ expectations   for 2003 are mixed, although perhaps a little better than a month ago  So let me start with the   good news   The automobile industry ended another very strong sales year with a flurry of activity in   December  While light vehicle sales apparently slowed in January, our contacts at each of the   Big Three have told us that the decline has been in line with their expectations, reflecting the   expiration of incentives and sales pulled ahead into December  The major issue for 2003 is the   contract negotiations with the UAW   Key issues of contention are likely to be capacity   reductions and health care costs   In the Chicago purchasing managers’ report for January, which won’t be released to the   public until Friday, the overall index moved up from 517 to 56, which is above the consensus   January 28-29, 2003 114 of 195    estimate of 53  Orders and production in particular increased  The employment component,   however, still remained very weak  In heavy-equipment industries, some of our contacts are   expecting a pickup in production in the near term  They believe that final users will want new   equipment soon—at a minimum for replacement purposes—and they know their distributors’   inventories are very lean  We’ve also heard from producers of machine tools and heavy trucks   that they are receiving more requests for price quotes  Still, apart from the new Chicago PMI   that I mentioned, we’ve seen few tangible signs of a broad-based sustainable recovery in our   manufacturing sector     In terms of the not-so-good news, most retailers were disappointed with holiday sales,   and it appears that little has changed so far this year  Retailers remain cautious about ordering   and continue to be aggressive in discounting merchandise  In addition, both of the major   temporary-help firms headquartered in our District, Kelley and Manpower, were less optimistic   than a month ago  One, who last month saw a few signs of strengthening labor demand in   manufacturing, is now characterizing his business as “inching forward”  The other, who last   month was already pessimistic, thinks the recovery actually has stalled  Neither thought they   were close to seeing the robust growth their industry experienced following the 1990-91   recession  With regard to the overall employment picture, Manpower’s national index of hiring   intentions for the second quarter will be somewhat lower than for the first quarter  That index   figure is preliminary at this point and won’t be released for quite some time—not until   February 24   Turning to the national outlook, as we all know, the news since our last meeting has been   mixed  We’ve been in a slow period, and it’s always difficult to be upbeat when we’re receiving   negative employment reports and the like  Nevertheless, as I just noted, the anecdotes from most   January 28-29, 2003 115 of 195    of our manufacturing contacts—while still not rosy—are not as full of doom and gloom as they   were last fall  I hope that this is a sign that businesses are working through some of the   uncertainties they faced over the past year and that this process will soon show through as   increases in payrolls or solid gains in investment  Such a turnaround by the business sector is   important because the recent labor market weakness certainly increases one’s concerns about the   ability of the household sector to continue leading the expansion, which we discussed earlier     As was noted, further declines in employment can make households more cautious about   spending  To be sure, the ongoing strength in motor vehicle sales and housing activity indicates   that, at least for now, households feel confident enough about job security to take on   commitments associated with the big ticket purchases  But I wonder how long this confidence   and spending will be maintained if job growth doesn’t resume soon  Still, like the Greenbook, I   see the retrenchment of the household sector as more of a risk to the forecast than a factor to   build into our baseline assumptions  Importantly, the expansion continues to be supported by the   things we’ve talked about—our accommodative monetary policy and productivity gains, which   provide the underpinning for profits and real income  And, of course, although the legislative   debate has a long way to go, I think it is likely that we will get a boost to aggregate demand from   fiscal policy     Taking all these factors into consideration, our forecast for 2003 is that real GDP growth   will be in the range of 3 to 3½ percent, somewhat lower than in the Greenbook, and that inflation   will edge down    I support it  "
7224,2003-03-18,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I had a question for David also on the risks   to the forecast  I notice that in your forecast the personal saving rate increases and then flattens   out during 2004  Historically, the saving rate is a couple of percentage points higher than that   rate  I had two questions on this  First, is that where you would expect it to settle on a longer-  term basis?  Second, how serious is the risk to the forecast that the saving rate will actually be   higher during this period?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Seventh District   has softened  Many of our contacts indicate that they saw some signs of improvement beginning   around the turn of the year and extending into the first half of February  However, activity has   deteriorated abruptly over the past few weeks  Clearly, consumers and businesses have become   increasingly cautious as international tensions have mounted  But a number of our contacts   doubt that the economy will grow robustly even after the situation in Iraq is resolved  Their   concerns seem to result from lackluster demand, excess capacity, and rising operating costs in   the context of little or no pricing power  But when we press them, they often have not been able   to identify any root cause for the weakness in demand other than the international situation  This   is somewhat similar to Bill McDonough’s comments earlier   March 18, 2003 37 of 101    Housing is the only major sector in the District that still seems to be robust  Consumer   spending has generally remained weak  As we all know, light vehicle sales fell in February;   early reports in March suggest little improvement and, in the case of one of the Big Three,   further weakening  Automakers and dealers told us that they were expecting some sales   volatility from month to month, but they clearly were surprised by how soft sales were in late   February  The higher incentives were not working for the first time in quite a while Some   portion of this decrease can be attributed to severe weather, which I’m happy to say did not find   its way into the Seventh Federal Reserve District  But many reported that they were seeing the   influence of heightened uncertainty, weak labor markets, and higher fuel costs on consumer   demand  Despite higher incentives, light vehicle inventories have risen above desired levels, and   firms are being forced to cut production in order to keep their inventories in line   Outside of autos, District manufacturing has also slowed since our last meeting, with   most businesses continuing to take a wait-and-see attitude  Contacts both inside and outside   manufacturing have become increasingly concerned about rising input costs  Several of our   directors in Chicago and Detroit reported that increasing prices for energy, property and casualty   insurance, employee health care, and materials have boosted production costs significantly  The   combination of flat-to-declining demand, significantly higher costs, and fierce competition is   pressuring profit margins  In this environment, many businesses continue to delay hiring  The   phrase we keep hearing is “hiring paralysis”  We’ve also heard reports that a number of large   companies, in addition to the ones that Bob Parry just mentioned, are planning another round of   layoffs  Both Kelley and Manpower reported that their year-over-year growth rates have trailed   off significantly in recent months  One firm did see a pickup in temporary hires in areas where   military reservists were called up, but the effect was small   March 18, 2003 38 of 101    Turning to the national outlook, the macroeconomic picture is even more uncertain than it   was at our last meeting  Given the uncertainty about Iraq in recent weeks, many businesses no   doubt delayed major spending decisions  Why not wait another few weeks to see how events   turn out?  It’s likely that such thinking contributed to the weak hiring we saw in February  As I   noted earlier, our contacts say that activity has slowed even more since the labor market   reference week  In addition, although oil prices have not yet reached extremely disruptive levels,   the prospect of further increases is an important downside risk to the economy  As I mentioned   earlier, many of our contacts say that demand is being held back by factors other than   geopolitical risks, and this raises the possibility that even if the situation in Iraq is resolved   quickly, we could be in for a period of prolonged sluggishness  However, at this point there is   not much evidence that the weakness goes beyond Iraq  Although our contacts are very   concerned, they’ve offered few other specific rationales for the continuing sluggishness  As   David said, they’re having difficulty disentangling the reasons for the weakness  Moreover, the   foundation appears in place for a pickup in growth—for example, accommodative monetary   policy, lean inventories, and of course strong productivity growth   Accordingly, if the Iraq situation is resolved quickly, we expect to see activity accelerate   later this year, although growth for the year will still fall short of potential  Of course, as pointed   out in the Greenbook simulations, which I thought were excellent, businesses and households   could respond in a variety of ways as geopolitical events unfold  So I guess it would be an   understatement to say that the degree of near-term uncertainty surrounding the outlook is   unusually high    No thanks!    I don’t think I’m going to mention the weather again!   March 18, 2003 51 of 101     Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation, too, and I’m delighted to   hear that this contingency planning is already under way  I certainly hope we never have to use   it, but I think it is important that we do the planning now  I have just one comment regarding the   phrase “heightened surveillance”  I hope we’re going to use that phrase or something like it in   the press statement because I know that market analysts have discovered that every time we’ve   used the words “monitor carefully” in the past we have had a move between meetings    I’m delighted  "
7237,2003-03-25,"  Mr Chairman, Michael Moskow  I wanted to mention quickly two   pieces of information, both of which are confidential  One is the Chicago Purchasing Managers’   report, which will come out next Monday and will show a decline in the overall index from   549 in February to 484 in March  Of course, that survey was taken in early March  The key   changes are in the production component, which declined from 624 to 491, and in the prices   paid, which increased from 549 to 628  The other measures were generally unchanged  The   other point I wanted to mention, also confidential, is that one of the Big Three told us very   March 25, 2003 8 of 29    recently that they have reduced their forecast for light vehicle sales for the year from 165 to 162   million units  That is an internal projection; they have not announced that publicly    "
7276,2003-04-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in our District does not   appear to have changed much in recent weeks, a situation that is similar to what my colleagues   have said about their Districts  A few of our contacts saw some further softening when the war   April 16, 2003 17 of 47    began, but no one noted a significant deterioration in activity  Neither do they expect sharp   increases with the conclusion of the war  Many of our contacts continue to be pessimistic about   the outlook for investment  They do not see enough projects that are far enough along in the   planning process to produce a major increase in capital spending in the second half of the year   Labor demand is still soft but does not appear to be eroding further  For example, both of   the large temporary help supply companies headquartered in our District reported that year-over-  year growth rates in billable hours had been falling since the beginning of the year but had   stabilized in recent weeks  One firm reported that some big customers currently are making   plans for projects that would require hiring a significant number of temporary workers, but those   firms are waiting to see how the economy evolves before committing to the deals  He thought   they would be sitting on the fence for another two to six weeks    Consumer spending still seems to be moving forward, though at a relatively sluggish   pace  Sales figures for March generally were in line with expectations according to our retail   contacts  Similar to what David Wilcox said, we also are receiving mixed signals about   consumers’ responses to the latest rounds of auto sales incentives, though it’s too early to judge   on that     Overall, our information since the last meeting is consistent with the economy still   moving forward, albeit at a disappointing pace  Looking ahead, even though our contacts do not   see any underlying catalysts that will rekindle robust growth, the collective mindset seems to be   that the economy will grind on through these rough times  This attitude suggests that even if we   saw a few more bad numbers or were hit by some modest adverse shock, business confidence   would be resilient enough to absorb them  That concludes my comments, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, this is Michael Moskow  I agree completely  I don’t   see any reason to have weekly phone calls  I certainly think the current stance of monetary   policy is fine until May 6, and we can reconsider it at that point  "
7300,2003-05-06,"  One of the shocks that hit the economy, of course, was the spate of   corporate governance scandals  When we look at current risk spreads and credit spreads, they   have narrowed relative to their early 2002 levels  I have two questions on this, David  One, do   you think we are past the major part of the fallout in financial markets from these corporate   governance scandals?  Second, do you think we are still seeing an impact from them on the real   economy, or are we past that now?    We continue to hear some of those same stories    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Seventh District   remains sluggish  Although the overall business view is negative, I’m hearing marginally better   reports than I did in March  At least part of this change in tone reflects the fact that many of our   contacts were expecting greater war-related destruction than actually materialized   Airline ticket sales did fall sharply because of the war and the SARS outbreak  However,   United Airlines reports that demand has rebounded in the last few weeks, and they expect the   trend to continue  Their domestic and transatlantic bookings have returned to early March levels    Bookings for Asia also have improved, after declining nearly 60 percent following the SARS   outbreak  We polled our directors and other contacts regarding SARS, and with the exception of   the airlines most expected a minimal and manageable effect in the near term  But if SARS is not   contained, they thought it could harm new business and product development down the road     Our retail and casual dining contacts feel that consumers have become more upbeat  That   has yet to show through, however, to actual spending  As we know, light vehicle sales   rebounded in March and held up in April  On the one hand, the Big Three were relieved that the   war didn’t overly depress demand  On the other hand, their April results were weaker than they   expected given the sweetened incentives  Interestingly, and a sign that the market has become   even more competitive, some of the big foreign nameplates have begun offering zero percent   financing for the first time     May 6, 2003 26 of 115    Outside of autos, District manufacturing remains weak  But here again reports tend to be   slightly—and I emphasize slightly—more upbeat than before the war  One industry analyst told   us that rebuilding Iraq will help to absorb the glut of used heavy equipment  Some equipment   producers have already seen a jump in price quotes from the Middle East  A major producer of   airport equipment— ramps, carts, generators, and so forth—noted that orders, primarily from   international airlines, had increased last quarter  That was the first improvement in over a year   Our contacts report that more firms are finally deciding to replace older equipment  But   in terms of capital expansion, firms continue to delay moving forward even though many have   spending plans in place with contracts negotiated and cash on hand  Apparently they are still   concerned about cost containment  A project that used to require three signatures now requires   six  Businesses also remain reluctant to hire  Both of the national temporary help firms that we   speak with remain disappointed about their billing hours  Their business is clearly weaker than   during the recovery period following the 1990-91 recession  We received the preliminary   calculations for Manpower’s third-quarter hiring plan survey, and the index fell from 11 to 6,   which is the lowest level since 1991  However, the survey was completed just before the   beginning of the war so that was obviously a period of great uncertainty  These data are   confidential and the company has told us it won’t be releasing them until June 17, which is later   than normal     Turning to the national outlook, the sparse data on the postwar economy are mixed  The   April employment report, unemployment insurance claims, and the information from our   temporary help contacts indicate that labor demand remains weak  On the plus side, consumer   confidence has rebounded despite the weak job market, oil prices are down, stock prices are up,   and equity price volatility and credit spreads have fallen  Of course the big question remains   May 6, 2003 27 of 115    whether business spending will finally pick up now that the burden of geopolitical uncertainty is   substantially reduced     It’s hard to be optimistic about the near term  Hiring plans are still on hold, and excess   capacity continues to top the list of concerns in many firms  Nevertheless, it’s certainly plausible   to expect the business sector to generate more growth as we move through the year  The   anecdotal reports provide at least modest support for the scenario in which capital spending and   hiring gradually strengthen  Moreover the fundamentals, particularly the underlying trend in   productivity, are strong enough to support the eventual pickup in growth     In general we agree with the Greenbook that the projections for this year, if realized,   would still leave the economy with large gaps in resource use as we enter 2004, which is a   concern  Furthermore, core inflation, which is now low, will probably head lower  Of course,   lower inflation would raise the real fed funds rate  That would not be a problem for the economy   if it were solidly in recovery, but higher real rates would be a concern if the current weakness is   expected to continue into the second half of this year  In the latter scenario we would probably   want to ease policy  I can see either of the two scenarios unfolding  At this point I think it’s too   early to know  We should have a better reading of the postwar economy by our next meeting    Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, I definitely agree with the policy   recommendation not to make a change today  That’s in essence what I said in my statement,   May 6, 2003 101 of 115    namely that we should wait  On the balance of risks issue, I do a mea culpa here  I was on the   committee, Roger    I certainly was, along with Bob Parry and Bill McDonough     I think the language is obsolete now  There’s no question that it needs   to be changed  We need to eliminate the wording on the risks  I would have preferred to do the   surgery on the swan—or whatever the analogy is—outside of this group  I’d suggest that another   subcommittee be appointed to do that and to come back to the Committee with a   recommendation  For many of the reasons that people have mentioned around the table, I think   there will be other iterations of this and we are setting some precedent here, and I think it’s   something we should consider very carefully before changing     I actually would propose another option  I don’t feel strongly enough to dissent on the   statement, but I want to suggest another option because I do have concerns about this statement    My concerns tie in with some of the comments made by Jack Guynn and others  First, I think   this statement will surprise the market and will increase the market expectation of a cut in rates    In my view, it comes close to risking the effect on market sentiment that we wish to avoid here    Second, I think it elevates the concern about disinflation significantly  So my preference would   be—and to my mind this option would have the least risk of influencing the markets—to go back   to our usual format and to say that the risks are balanced  However, I would add the sentence   that you put in regarding the unwelcome risk of disinflation  I’d put what you said in your   testimony in the statement itself to show that we are concerned about it  But I still would prefer   May 6, 2003 102 of 115    to have the risks balanced  As I said, I don’t feel strongly enough to dissent on it, but that would   be my preference  "
7326,2003-06-24,"  Thank you, Bob!    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, want to congratulate the authors of   these papers  I think they did some very fine work, and I believe it has been extremely helpful   for all of us who are trying to think through these very difficult issues  I just have a few   comments  I would at this point clearly stay away from targeting interest rates at other than the   June 24-25, 2003 36 of 211    short-term fed funds rate that we now target  I would avoid targeting longer-term interest rates   for a lot of the reasons that have been mentioned already  Of course, that brings us to the   quantity side, which we’ve been talking about, of trying to inject reserves into the system  There   is a lot about that that I don’t understand, and I would like to know more about it before we ever   have to go down that path, though I certainly agree that it is a very unlikely possibility at this   point  But I think we should have some sense as to how we would go about doing it and how we   would address some of the very important issues that Al Broaddus raised     There is one question that immediately came to my mind in the course of Vincent’s   presentation, and I think Dino talked about it, too  On page 12 of Vincent’s material he talked   about targeting the short-term rate at 1 percent, say, but lowering other rates  So we’d have to   add reserves in one segment of the Treasury market and drain them out of the other  I was just   wondering if we could do that without undermining the effectiveness of what we were really   trying to accomplish, given the way that the arbitrage operates and people move along the curve,   substituting assets all the time  Could we really implement this without adversely affecting our   objective which, of course, is to add liquidity to the system?    Yes, we couldn’t target just the five-year note  It would involve the   six-year and the four-year notes and so forth; it would have to be a smooth curve, I assume      Just on this point, Mr Chairman  I agree that it should be done in the   context of a larger discussion of transparency because there may be some other things we want to   announce at the same time  Also on this particular point, you do give the Reserve Bank   Presidents and Board members a chance to change their forecasts after hearing the discussion at   the FOMC meeting    So we’d have to change that policy, too      I had a quick question about the survey on capital spending plans    Obviously, capital spending is the key to the forecast for the near-term future  I was wondering   if we had ever done this type of survey before  If so, what level of confidence do we have in it,   and has it helped us in the past to predict future actual spending by business firms?    So we haven’t done it quantitatively before  I’m just wondering about   the percentages you cited—that 35 percent are going to increase spending and 20 percent plan to   reduce spending  You also said that two-thirds of those who plan to increase spending indicated   that they actually have started to place the orders  Our District went the other way on that, which   is rather interesting    Okay, thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Seventh District   remains sluggish  Our contacts are still cautious, but the pessimism that was so pervasive earlier   in the year has eased  Much of the improvement in attitudes came on the business side  For   example, in response to the Board’s special survey on capital spending, substantially more of our   District contacts reported plans to increase outlays than to scale them back, and this is a   significant improvement over what we were hearing earlier in the year  However, as I mentioned   before, in our District the increases we hear about for the most part are still plans; the outlays   haven’t started yet, and the CEOs I speak with remain cautious about spending   Several of our commercial real estate contacts said that they had seen a pickup in   inquiries and property showings but that this had not yet led to an increase in actual leasing    More generally, we hear reports of increasing merger-and-acquisition activity from lawyers and   June 24-25, 2003 88 of 211    from investment bankers and other intermediaries  Business travel continues to recover, leading   at least one major air carrier to restore some previously canceled flights  Moreover, we’ve heard   reports that many firms are easing travel restrictions, as concerns surrounding the war in Iraq and   the SARS epidemic wane  Despite the modest improvement in business attitudes, firms remain   reluctant to hire  Although the BLS in its last survey reported an increase in temporary help,   both Manpower and Kelly Services said that orders remained flat through May  Kelly indicated,   however, that orders edged up in each of the first two weeks in June  On the household side,   sales of both new and existing homes remain robust  But retailers continue to tell us that their   sales are disappointing, especially given that they’re offering steeper discounts and more   promotions     In terms of autos, our contacts report little if any improvement in sales so far in June  At   our recent auto outlook symposium held in Detroit, the consensus forecast called for light vehicle   sales to average about 165 million units for the remainder of this year and 167 million units for   next year  That pace will not be sufficient to reduce inventories  Some of these stocks are likely   a buffer for the upcoming UAW negotiations and will be drawn down if there is a strike    Otherwise, automakers will have to cut back production later unless sales increase to a pace   significantly above their forecasts  Weaker prices for used cars also point to overcapacity in the   industry  Automakers are beginning to express concern that these weak prices are pushing their   dealers’ profit margins to very low levels   Outside of autos, District manufacturing generally remains sluggish  “Bouncing along   the bottom” is a phrase that we continue to hear quite often  However, there have been some   pieces of good news  A few manufacturers reported that a weaker dollar had helped boost orders   in May  A major national distributor of computer hardware and software reported that the past   June 24-25, 2003 89 of 211    three and a half weeks have been the strongest since last October  The Chicago Purchasing   Managers’ survey for June will again be above 50; the index will be 525, up slightly from   522 in May  These survey results are confidential until they’re released next Monday   Turning to the national outlook, the data indicate a slight pickup in growth as we moved   through the spring  In real terms, the national retail sales numbers show some strength outside of   autos  Housing markets are still robust, and financial indicators are positive  Still, the increase   in activity appears to be fairly modest  The lack of hiring is very troublesome, and CEO   caution—perhaps due to corporate governance concerns—continues to restrain the recovery in   capital spending  While our contacts certainly have become less concerned that another   downturn is imminent, few are optimistic that a significant step-up in activity is just around the   corner     In terms of our forecast, a number of factors point to more-solid increases in economic   growth  We’ve talked about many of them  accommodative monetary policy, improved equity   markets, fiscal stimulus, a lower dollar, and the capital replacement cycle  To date, however, we   haven’t seen enough improvement in the numbers or in our contacts’ attitudes to convince us that   a pickup is in train  Of course, the longer we remain in this slow growth spot, the more questions   are raised about the strength of the underlying fundamentals  For now, we’re still betting that the   fundamentals are strong  We project that real GDP growth will average somewhat above   potential in the second half of this year and that output will rise more substantially in 2004, but   we’re roughly a percentage point below the Greenbook projection of 53 percent for 2004    Under either forecast, resource gaps will not close much until we move into next year  Persistent   resource gaps and the possibility of hitting the zero bound are legitimate concerns  It’s unlikely   that the overall price level will actually fall, but inflation could nevertheless head to levels that   June 24-25, 2003 90 of 211    would be uncomfortably low in the current economic environment  So, the cost of taking out   insurance in the form of reducing rates is low    I want to follow up on Governor Bies’s question, just so I understand   this  In the Bluebook, the risk assessment language indicates that we’re going to say one of three   things about inflation  The risks to the outlook for inflation over the next several quarters are   weighted to the downside, are balanced, or are weighted to the upside  So will that be in the   statement that comes out?    So the risk assessment paragraph will not be in the statement?    But it will be in the transcript?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with the way that Roger Ferguson   phrased the issue—that the threshold of evidence provided by the data since our last meeting was   not sufficient for us not to change rates today  So I do agree with the 25 basis point cut and the   way you phrased the balance of risks  But of course the data we talk about are always looking   backward, and the key is the forecast going forward  As we’ve often said in these meetings,   sometimes the last cut or the last increase in the funds rate target is the one that’s not needed   because we didn’t have perfect information at the time we made that cut or increase  I certainly   hope that’s true this time, and I hope we won’t have to move forward with any nontraditional   forms of monetary policy   I do want to say a word about the risks statement, though  In my view Vincent has done   an admirable job in trying to take the wording of our statement from the last meeting and to put it   into this old framework that we had for the balance of risks  On an interim basis, I think that’s   fine  But I believe—and I’m going to sound like a broken record here because I recommended   this at the last meeting—that a subcommittee of this Committee should be appointed to look at   this in more detail, as was done in past  The most recent such subcommittee was the one that   Roger chaired, and there were several presidents and several members of the Board on it  This is   a very tricky area  A couple of points have been mentioned here today  Governor Bies has   concerns about the phrase “downside risks” with regard to inflation, and Bob Parry is worried   about the word “sustainable”  Don Kohn made a very good point that down the road, when   we’re looking for sustainable economic growth, we may not want to say that the risk is weighted   toward the upside  So I think a group of us should look at this in more detail and come back with   a recommendation to this Committee regarding how to deal with this on a longer-term basis   June 24-25, 2003 153 of 211     No, I’m talking about the longer term  "
7353,2003-08-12,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I had a question for David on the ten-year   rates looking ahead  The assumption you’re making, which you explained very thoroughly, is   that we will get a 60 basis point decline in ten-year rates next year  Well, suppose it is now next   spring and we’ve seen real GDP growth of over 4 percent for several quarters in a row  Some   people think that long-term rates actually will be turning in the other direction and going up at   that point  I don’t think that’s a completely implausible scenario  So I was wondering how you   would interpret such a development next year if it did occur  And what would the effect be on   the forecast if ten-year rates did trend up and hit, say, 5 percent by the end of next year?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Seventh District economy is still   sluggish  Many of our contacts, as well as the available data, indicate that the Midwest has been   underperforming the rest of the nation  Nevertheless, we are seeing a few signs of improvement    We’re hearing that more firms are releasing funds for capital expenditure, mainly for   maintenance, repair, and replacement of existing equipment  Indeed, some producers of   agricultural and construction equipment are now seeing orders picking up and prices firming    However, many businesses seem to be focused on meeting near-term goals  Their planning   horizons are short, and their expansion plans remain cautious   August 12, 2003 23 of 110    We surveyed some of our contacts regarding the impact of rising interest rates, and the   results were mixed  Many homebuilders and realtors indicated that potential homebuyers moved   quickly to close deals before rates went higher  In contrast, refinancing activity has plunged   according to many of our bank contacts   Automakers have yet to see much effect from higher   rates  As you know, light vehicle sales rose sharply in July, with a surge at the end of the month,   when the incentives were increased  One manufacturer told us that the industry has now fallen   into a pattern of incrementally boosting or layering incentives as the month progresses  While   the automakers continue to lament their reliance on discounts, they are encouraged that   consumers are once again responding to these incentives     The automakers and other contacts remain concerned about the sustainability of   consumer demand, given the stubbornly weak job growth  While labor markets in the Seventh   District did not deteriorate, there are few if any signs that hiring is picking up  Both of the large   temporary-help firms that we contact indicate that orders remained flat through July, and these   firms continue to believe that the BLS data significantly overstate the gains in temporary-help   jobs  The BLS has changed its sampling procedure in a way that gives less weight to the large   temporary-help firms, and at least one of the companies headquartered in our region plans to   meet with the bureau to discuss the discrepancies  We recently received the results from   Manpower’s fourth-quarter survey of hiring plans  The survey shows a modest improvement in   hiring expectations from the third quarter but they are still below those of a year ago  These data   are confidential and will not be released until September 16, which coincidentally is the day of   our next FOMC meeting     Turning to the national outlook, since our last meeting we’ve seen that household   spending is holding up, capital expenditures are showing more life, and inventories are so low   August 12, 2003 24 of 110    that we should soon get a boost to production as firms restock  Furthermore, tax cuts are   showing up in people’s pockets, and there is plenty of liquidity out there to support higher   spending  To be sure, the July employment report was weak  However, the fall in initial claims   over the past few weeks is somewhat encouraging  The increase in long-term rates is a concern,   but our feeling is that the current level of interest rates will still support a pickup in real   economic activity  So, while we’ve yet to see the strong growth needed to close resource gaps,   recent developments on balance are broadly consistent with the solid second half that we forecast   in June  Therefore, I view this as a time for us to wait and watch    Mr Chairman, I support both parts of your recommendation  In   particular, I would not want to change the format of the statement that we’ve been using for the   last two meetings; today would not be the appropriate time to do it  I look forward to the   discussion at our next meeting of how we’re going to communicate in the future    I think the wording of the last paragraph is a real improvement  The   only question I have is in the second paragraph where the term “mixed” is used to describe the   labor market indicators  I tend to view them as less positive    But those involve seasonal issues and—    I just hope it doesn’t give too optimistic a view of the labor market at   this point, which I view as a real question    So that means the discussion on communications next time would not   affect our statement after the September meeting  Is that right?  "
7375,2003-09-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with the thrust of Jamie’s and   Cathy’s comments  I certainly wouldn’t suggest any significant change, though I would suggest   some tinkering—some improvement in the processes that we follow and the language we use    On the big question about releasing the minutes early and just announcing our policy decision   without commentary, after thinking about it a lot, I believe the market would view that as a   major step backward on transparency  That’s because, if we were to do that, all we’d announce   on the day of the meeting is what we decided to do and there would be gap of, let’s say, two   weeks before we issued our minutes  What would happen during those two weeks?  Right now   we have a blackout period that goes until the end of the first week after the meeting  Would we   extend the blackout period another week and not give speeches during that time?  With no other   information from us, market participants would look at those speeches very, very carefully  So I   think announcing only our decision and then releasing the minutes earlier could lead to a lot of   complications, and I would not go down that road at this point    September 15, 2003 50 of 78    Actually, the sense of this conversation, as I see it, is that we seem to be going in the   direction of Vincent’s option 4 in his table  That involves putting language in the Bluebook that   matches exactly the wording we would be voting on at the meeting, which I certainly agree with    I think the current Bluebook already takes some useful steps in that direction, which will be   helpful in our preparation for tomorrow’s meeting  Also standardizing the language of the risk   assessment is, as Roger phrased it, a very good direction to go in  However, I would look very   carefully at the language  I think we should make some changes in the language that we’re now   using and we should stress-test that language against a whole series of different economic   contingencies and see what we would really say if X happened or if Y happened  I’d go back   and look at some historical events, too  Maybe that has already been done; I don’t know  But in   my view, it would be a very useful exercise for all of us   Let me mention a few problems that I have with the language after thinking about it   carefully  First, there’s the point about economic growth  The way the Bluebook is now worded   it says, “   the Committee believes the risks to its outlook for sustainable economic growth over   the next few quarters are weighted toward the downside, are balanced, or are weighted toward   the upside”  I would have serious concerns about our saying “weighted toward the upside” with   regard to sustainable economic growth  We ought to explain that type of situation in a much   more useful way, and I think there are ways to do that  I just don’t particularly like that phrase   “weighted toward the upside”   Before we get to a situation—sometime in the future, I hope—  that would call for a risk assessment of that sort, I’d like to find some better wording  Also,   when we talk about our risk assessment we say, “against the background of its long-term goals of   price stability and sustainable economic growth,” and then we describe the risks to sustainable   economic growth  But then we don’t use the words “price stability”; we shift to the term   September 15, 2003 51 of 78    “inflation”  We should think carefully about that—whether we really want to talk about the risks   to price stability as opposed to the risks to the outlook for inflation  I think that’s a question we   should discuss as a group   The other part of option 4 was that, when a substantive change is contemplated, this   would be communicated to the Committee before the meeting so we would have some time to   think about it  I think that’s in line with the conversation you were having about the wording in   the Bluebook, and I agree with that very strongly  From a process standpoint, that will be much   better for this Committee in terms of our operations   The final point I would make is on the term “foreseeable future”  We did actually define   it very specifically in the year 2000  We said that although the “foreseeable future” is “intended   to cover an interval extending beyond the next FOMC meeting,” the concept is necessarily   elastic  [Laughter]    It clearly refers to an elastic period that goes beyond the next FOMC   meeting  "
7398,2003-09-16,"  Just on that point, Mr Chairman  Another way of phrasing that   sentence would be not to commit to anything but to say that on an ongoing basis we would   September 16, 2003 6 of 106    consider changes  That way it doesn’t appear as if there’s one distinct time when we’re going to   be recommending some changes      Say it again    That’s a good solution    Mr Chairman, Ned Gramlich asked a good portion of my question, so   I’ll pass now    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Although our Seventh District contacts   remain cautious, many more of them now say that business is improving compared with just five   weeks ago  Business spending appears to be firming  Our manufacturing contacts still aren’t   planning much capacity expansion, but they are reporting a pickup in orders for items such as   construction equipment, airline equipment, and intermediate production materials  And   businesses may be loosening the purse strings on travel  United Airlines reports that rising   September 16, 2003 48 of 106    business travel has contributed to a 30 percent increase in their average fare since April, and they   think there is still more pent-up demand for business travel   Household spending also strengthened somewhat  Home sales were again very strong   and retailers reported that consumer spending picked up from earlier in the summer  Auto sales   have been improving since February and have come in well above automakers’ expectations    The 189 million sales rate for light vehicles in August was described by one Big Three   executive as astonishing  He reported that September sales should exceed 17 million units,   which is a bit higher than the number he had mentioned before  In general, automakers see a   more profitable mix of sales, with a larger percentage accounted for by luxury cars and SUVs    Even though the auto companies built up inventories in anticipation of contract negotiations,   strong sales have pushed stocks slightly below desired levels     The strengthening demand in manufacturing appears to be leading to some firming of   output prices  Examples include steel, wallboard, plywood, and construction machinery  The   District’s labor market is still soft, but we’ve heard some glimmers of good news  Most of our   contacts remain very reluctant to make permanent hires  However, one major retailer indicated   that he would like to add programmers and systems analysts but they are hard to find in the   Chicago area  It has been a long time since we’ve heard such a concern   With regard to temporary employment, last time I mentioned that our contacts at Kelly   and Manpower were reporting that their businesses were only so-so  They were very suspicious   of the Bureau of Labor Statistics report that indicated strong employment growth in temporary   help  This time I have two additional pieces of information  First, the president of one of these   companies put considerable effort into understanding this discrepancy with the BLS  He found   among other things that data from his own firm’s establishments were not getting to the BLS in a   September 16, 2003 49 of 106    timely fashion—something he suspects was also true of the other large temporary help firms  So   he got his numbers in and encouraged his colleagues to do the same and, possibly as a result,   there was a significant downward revision to the BLS figures  They now line up much more   closely with what industry analysts were seeing  The second piece of news is that contacts at one   temporary help firm report that they have now had three consecutive weeks of strong growth in   worker assignments  They’re not ready to say that they are out of the woods but they are quite   encouraged     Turning to the national outlook, the incoming data suggest that output is rising a good   deal faster than we had forecast in both June and August  Most notably, consumption and   business investment appear to be on track for strong growth over the second half of the year  So   far, this increase in demand has been satisfied with outsized gains in productivity, so we still   haven’t seen a recovery in labor markets  Our projection is that the current pace of demand   growth is sufficient to begin to narrow the resource gaps by early next year  However, there is a   good deal of uncertainty about how to interpret the strong productivity performance over the past   two quarters  In his comments or answers to questions, Dave called it the productivity puzzle    That, of course, translates into more uncertainty about the outlook for employment and output   growth     With regard to inflation, we see it changing little over the forecast period  We think the   odds of unwelcome disinflation have diminished  However, the probability still is high enough   so that it cannot be ignored  Accordingly, I continue to favor our “steady as she goes” stance on   policy    Mr Chairman, I support no change in the funds rate, and I support the   balance of risks recommendation  On the last sentence, I do think we need an exit strategy, and   in my view this is a reasonable one  But I don’t see the urgency to do it today that Governor   Kohn does and others may  I would be very comfortable just leaving the sentence as it was    Right, that’s what I thought you said  But what I’m saying is that I   would leave the sentence as it was last time; that would be my preference at this point  I think   this kind of wording might provide the exit strategy we will want to use, but I don’t see any   urgency to adopt it at this meeting  I would prefer to wait and think a little more carefully about   the best way to phrase this  That’s my personal preference   I would like to make a comment on your remarks about the pace of globalization and the   possibility that it might be slowing down  I toiled in these vineyards for a bit in another   position—and I have a lot of scars on my back from it, too!  I come out with a little more   optimistic view of the situation than you do  First, I would say that I believe protectionism does   become more prevalent when the economy is weak or sluggish  As the economy improves, I   hope that some of these protectionist sentiments will subside  Second, on the breakdown in the   trade talks, this breakdown was different from those in previous trade talks—which often occur,   by the way—and that’s because the developing countries were playing a larger role this time  In   any event, these global talks are always difficult  In my view the ’05 deadline was very   optimistic when it was set up, and I think the parties probably will not meet it now  Certainly, if   they did meet the ’05 deadline, it would be counter to all of our experience in previous global   trade talks  So I guess I’m a bit more optimistic than you are on that side  "
7423,2003-10-28,"  I had a question for David  In comparing the consensus forecast to the   Greenbook forecast, the Blue Chip forecast is much higher on inflation than you are and in fact   than we are in Chicago The Blue Chip has a much higher expected path for the nominal fed   funds rate, too  First of all, why do you think it is that the Blue Chip forecast is higher on   inflation than we are?  Second, you put two alternative scenarios into the Greenbook—one with   rising inflation expectations and one with the market-based funds path  When I look at these two   scenarios, intuitively I want to add them together or look at them at the same time  I was   wondering if there was some interaction here that I should be thinking of when I look at those   two scenarios    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Seventh District   continued to improve in September and October, although we still appear to be lagging national   trends  Our business contacts, including those attending our recent advisory council meeting, are   increasingly optimistic, though they’re not breaking out the champagne just yet  Once again,   October 28, 2003 31 of 126    much of the region’s strength derives from household spending  Home sales remain very robust,   and retail sales picked up further in recent weeks  Retailers also are more optimistic about the   holiday season  We’re hearing mixed signals regarding inventories  Some retailers are   concerned that they may lose sales unless they replenish inventories, but many are still cautious   and say that they plan to keep their stocks lean   As you know, light vehicle sales have softened since August but were still running above   year-ago levels in September and October  Our Big Three contacts expect fourth-quarter light   vehicle sales to be around 16¾ million units—that’s above their estimate of just a few months   ago—and they forecast similar sales for 2004  So to use David’s terminology, the outlook for   sales is somewhere between spectacular and really good  One of the Big Three firms has raised   its fourth-quarter production plans a bit; roughly half the increase, however, is a catch-up from   output lost during the August power blackout  Sales incentives are still very high, but they’ve   leveled off     Business spending also picked up modestly  Our contacts suggest that retailers are   spending more on remodeling and renovating their stores this year than last year  Manufacturers   report a more broad-based improvement in demand for capital goods, though much of the   spending is still for repair, maintenance, and replacement of existing equipment  We’ll see   another strong Chicago Purchasing Managers’ index when the data are released this Friday  The   index moved up from 512 in September to 55 in October, marking the sixth consecutive month   that it was above 50  Moreover, the employment component was also above 50 for the second   time in three months  Obviously these numbers are confidential until Friday, when they are   made public   October 28, 2003 32 of 126    On the temporary help front, both of the large firms we speak to are now seeing strong   growth in orders—beyond the typical seasonal pickup  Average hours per assignment in one   firm are at a record high, and that company is seeing some forward-looking orders for the first   time in many months  Both firms are now confident that a robust recovery in temporary help is   under way and that we should start to see a pickup in permanent hiring soon  That said, most   firms in our District remain cautious about hiring, but that is a long-running story  Employment   in our District is down 4 percent since its peak, compared with a decline of 2 percent for the total   economy     Turning to the national outlook, the data received since our last meeting have been quite   encouraging on balance, as we’ve discussed before  No doubt tax cuts explain most of the   improvement in real disposable income last quarter, which in turn helped to produce the strong   growth in consumer spending  But tax cuts are not the whole story  Underlying household   demand appears solid  With business confidence improving, we should see some inventory   rebuilding and further gains in capital spending  So output growth is likely to remain above   potential until next year  This should finally translate into a meaningful recovery in labor   markets  We hope that the pickup in temporary help is a sign that we’re in the early stages of   such a recovery  In the meantime, the odds are that core inflation will come down a bit further,   but the chances of a really unwelcome disinflation are becoming more remote    I agree with the recommendation, with the understanding that we’ll   have a thorough discussion of this issue in the future    I’ll make a different negative comment then, Mr Chairman  I am   concerned about having a maximum sustainable employment objective  I don’t really mean that   it’s not an objective—obviously we all agree that it’s in the statute—but I would not put it in the   statement  I find it difficult to envision a circumstance in which we would ever want to say   publicly that economic growth will proceed over the next few quarters at a rate above that   consistent with the attainment of maximum sustainable employment if the latter is falling short   of our objective  I don’t think we’re ever going to want to say we’re against more employment    It puts us in a very awkward position, quite frankly  I think the term “growth” has served us well   over many years, and I personally like the term “growth” better here  Also, I used to work in the   Labor Department, so I’m very sensitive to the employment and unemployment part of our   mandate     Let me turn to the process side, which is the subject I really wanted to make most of my   comments on  I think we’ve had some very good suggestions today  As I view this going   forward, it is worth looking carefully to see if we can craft language that we’re comfortable with   that would be a formulaic approach, which is essentially what we have now  I’d prefer a formula   where there are a certain number of options and we pick one at each meeting  I think we want to   change the language, although it’s going to be difficult to do given the differences of opinion    But it would make our decision on the language a lot easier at each meeting if we could find a   formulaic approach  I think it’s worth the effort, and I like the idea of having a task force that   will come back to us with some options or recommendations  I also agree that the other option   October 28, 2003 106 of 126    that we discussed before and rejected, namely the earlier release of the minutes, is another   approach that we should consider      That’s right; and we could just drop this language completely  I think   it’s worth seeing what the logistics of an early release of the minutes really are  We talked about   that possibility, and I know it would put a lot of pressure on the Board staff to draft the document   and on all of us to review it  But I think it’s worth going through a timeline in detail to see what   would be involved, and we can determine if we are willing to commit to getting the minutes out   in two weeks or three weeks or whatever the appropriate interval would happen to be  I don’t   think we can do what we need to do on these communication issues around this table with   nineteen people  In my view, we ought to have a separate group work on it and come back with   recommendations  I think that group has to get input from everyone on the Committee so that   each of us has a chance to convey our views  We’re probably going to have to have several   discussions as a Committee once that group reports to us    I would drop the balance of risk part and have the statement be only   this first paragraph regarding what we’ve done    There will be an explanation but not a balance of risks statement  "
7450,2003-12-09,"  We even believe the Cubs are going to win the World Series!    [Laughter]    I want to get back to the discussion of inflation expectations in this   alternative scenario that you said is a risk  I think it’s a risk that we have to take very seriously   because it would be a great shame if inflation expectations did in fact increase significantly  I’m   certainly hearing a lot of comments about inflation from people I talk to, particularly because of   concerns about the size of the budget deficit and the long-term problems of Social Security and   Medicare, which we all know about   The TIPS spread was mentioned in the staff briefing yesterday, and in your comments   today you said that for the period over the next five years there has been a bit of up-and-down   movement but that the five-to-ten-year period has shown a quite dramatic increase in inflation   expectations  In the staff briefing yesterday part of the explanation was the increased liquidity in   the market  But it was clearly noted that that was not the only reason  I was wondering if you   could talk about some of the other reasons for the increase in the TIPS spread—which is really   inflation compensation—in that five-to-ten-year period  Is this a warning sign for us that a   significant number of people in the financial markets are concerned that we’re losing control   over inflation?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Seventh District economy continues to   improve  Much of the uncertainty that was pervasive earlier in the year has dissipated, but many   of our business contacts suggest that economic growth in the region is still somewhat less robust   than what they see in the national numbers    The holiday shopping season got off to a reasonably good start  Most retailers said that   sales in the days following Thanksgiving met their expectations  Even the old line department   stores were said to have fared well during the period  Several contacts noted that inventories   were lean and that retailers were trying to cut back on discounting  But consumers still seem to   be very price sensitive  Many retailers reported to us that the strong post-Thanksgiving sales   largely reflected purchases of deeply discounted merchandise  One national specialty retailer   who sharply cut back his discounting noted that sales at his company slowed considerably and   unexpectedly in the last few weeks   As you know, nationally light vehicle sales picked up in November and were slightly   higher than automakers’ expectations  With the generally improving economy, automakers have   raised their sales forecasts for next year  This Friday the Chicago Fed will be hosting its annual   economic outlook symposium, and the auto industry participants are forecasting light vehicle   sales between 166 and 169 million units in 2004, which is at least 300,000 units below the   Greenbook projection  More broadly, 35 individuals submitted forecasts for 2004 for the overall   economy, and the consensus among them was generally similar to the December Blue Chip   consensus     December 9, 2003 38 of 133    At our last meeting I mentioned that we were waiting for manufacturers to shift from   being cautiously optimistic to just plain optimistic  That now seems to be happening  We’re   hearing more and more reports of strong orders, increasing backlogs, and in some cases even   firmer prices  For example, the vast majority of participants at the fab tech trade show held in   Chicago last month said that new orders for fabricating equipment are up  This was especially   encouraging given the low capacity utilization rates  In addition, producers of heavy equipment   in a variety of sectors noted strengthening demand; examples include construction, agricultural   food processing, drilling, and airline service equipment     Labor markets continue to improve  Our contacts at two large temporary help firms said   that the number of workers on assignment continues to rise steadily, but they also indicated that   the increases were below their expectations given the strong GDP growth we’ve seen  We’ve   received preliminary results of Manpower’s first-quarter hiring plan survey, and the index   improved moderately from the fourth quarter of 2003 to the first quarter of 2004, but was slightly   below the year-ago level  Let me note that this information will not be released publicly until   December 16     Turning to the national outlook, most of the recent data have been encouraging    Employment and hours continue to improve, although Friday’s report was somewhat weaker   than expected  Household sector demand remains solid, and at last corporate decisionmakers   have become more optimistic  This confidence appears to be translating into the broad-based   increase in spending that we’ve been waiting for  Firms seem to be shifting from inventory   liquidation to restocking, and the orders data point to further robust gains in expenditures for   equipment and software  Of course, resource gaps remain  But given that the expansion finally   seems to have gained traction, I feel more confident that the gaps will narrow a good deal over   December 9, 2003 39 of 133    the next year  In my view this puts the risks regarding inflation outcomes into closer balance    So I think we need to start preparing markets for inevitable rate increases  My preference is to   start doing that today, perhaps with some minor changes in the wording of our statement     Mr Chairman, I think your proposal is an excellent one  I very much   like the fact that you’ve narrowed the balance of risks on unwelcome disinflation versus   inflation  I think that’s desirable  I like dropping the overall balance of risks statement, and I   particularly like conditioning the “considerable period” of time phrase at the end of the   statement  I think putting in the additional words, “with inflation quite low and resource use   slack,” is an excellent way to condition it  I assume, although you didn’t mention it, that you   will also be suggesting some changes in the rationale paragraph in terms of what we say about   the labor market   December 9, 2003 94 of 133     I think that’s very good  I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how   we were going to get out of this dilemma we have with the language and what the wording   should be  I think you’ve captured our assessment of the situation very, very well  "
7475,2004-01-27,"  I, too, was in the working group and, as you can see, there was   obviously not a consensus among the group on how to move forward  I was attracted to the   formulaic language, though I recognize that there are some difficulties with it  It doesn’t apply   to every specific circumstance, but it does provide a very good framework for the Committee to   express its views, recognizing that we can always amplify those views in earlier paragraphs of   the statement  The formulaic language doesn’t prevent us from doing that, and we would clearly   have to do that in some cases  But obviously there’s no consensus in going forward on a   formulaic approach today  So I won’t push it   Just to be on the record, I favor the levels B alternative  I found some problems with the   levels A alternative  The phrase “the path to” I found very confusing  There are many different   paths that would enable us to reach our ultimate objectives for output and inflation, and I think   that phrase would be very hard to explain to the public  So I have serious questions about   whether levels A would be helpful to us, and I thought levels B was easier to understand   In terms of the gradual evolution approach, which we seem to be evolving to gradually   [laughter]—or maybe rapidly—I would just say this  I think putting the statement in the   Bluebook is a very constructive step  I believe it is very important for everyone on the   Committee to see the draft wording ahead of time  If there are last minute changes to the draft   statement, which I think was a possibility mentioned by Vincent, those addenda should be sent   out as rapidly as possible to the members of the Committee  I do think this process will require   more of our time as a Committee, which I’m sure is fine with all of us, and I think we should   January 27-28, 2004 39 of 238    recognize that prospect, in terms of the discussion of the specifics of the statement at our   meetings    In terms of the nature of the forward look at policy, I agree with what Don Kohn said, but   I’d add another point  I think there’s a practical issue here in that it’s very difficult for us as a   Committee to back away from providing that forward-looking insight into policy  I think it   would be viewed by the markets and by the public as a big step backwards no matter what we do   with the minutes or even with our individual forecasts  When we get to the discussion of the   minutes and the other communication issues, I think we can formulate a package  So I’ll hold   off on the rest of my comments until then    This is a very important issue, and on balance I come out favoring   early release of the minutes  It might make us a little uncomfortable at times; but I think, as the   document said, it will also make us more accountable, and in my view that’s a plus  It’s a real   positive in that it improves our transparency  Quite frankly, in this age of rapid communication   it’s hard to justify holding off for six to eight weeks before we release them  It’s a red face test   that I find difficult  I know we can always say that we have to approve them at the next meeting,   but again in this era of communication I find that hard to justify  I think the minutes are a   supplement to the statement that we release shortly after the meeting  I don’t view them as a   January 27-28, 2004 60 of 238    substitute for that in any way  So to me it’s an additional bit of transparency  I think Tony’s   suggestion of a dry run is a good one; we need to work out the mechanics and to set the rules for   processing the minutes  I don’t think a full year is necessary, but it would be helpful to have a   dry run    Let me touch on the two points that Roger made, which are both very important  One is   that it may affect the Committee’s discussion  On balance I really don’t think it would affect the   comments at the meeting all that much  The only time it might have an impact is when we make   conditional statements—for example, that if certain developments occur, we may need to have   an intermeeting telephone call  I think we’d have to work out some way to deal with those types   of circumstances  I don’t know exactly what that should be, but we do have to address that    Other than that, I just don’t see it affecting the discussion at the meeting any more than the   release of the minutes after the subsequent meeting does  As for the other point about speaking   once in our post-meeting statement and then letting the markets interpret the data, I think Susan   Bies put it very well  We are all individually speaking at various times, and in the process we   generate a lot of news events  The press is covering us more than we would like  That’s just part   of the process, and if we release the minutes earlier, the markets and the press will become   accustomed to it   On the blackout, I agree completely with Bob McTeer that the blackout period after the   meeting is obsolete  I think it could be shortened quite considerably  We did shorten it about   eight years ago as I recall  It used to go through the weekend, and we pushed it back to the close   of business on the Friday after the meeting  In my view, we could easily move it back earlier    As for Bill Poole’s comments about the timing of interim meetings,  I think these are important   issues to think through ahead of time, but on balance I believe they’re manageable   January 27-28, 2004 61 of 238     I agree, Mr Chairman, with the way you characterized this  I don’t   think the forecasts serve a useful purpose here  Also, though people have very good ideas for   minor tinkering that will improve them—the core PCE, maybe lengthening the time period, and   things of that sort—quite frankly, I think there’s a danger in doing that  If we do that, we draw   January 27-28, 2004 82 of 238    more attention to these forecasts  And we give the impression that we’re putting more emphasis   on them, and to that extent I think we elevate them  That would be counterproductive  I’d leave   it the way it is and not make any changes whatsoever  Discussing core inflation is obviously   important, and you do that in your testimony, which I think is a very appropriate place to do it    But I would not change the way we present the forecasts one bit      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have what I hope is a quick question on   chart 3 about the saving rate, which is clearly very important to the forecast  In the middle panel,   you say, “The current saving rate is still well below the level that many observers often think of   as a more normal rate”  But below that in one of the bullets you say that the current settings now   January 27-28, 2004 120 of 238    “point to a target saving rate for the next year or two in the neighborhood of 3 percent”  Is the   target the same as what most observers often think of as normal?    But as you see this expansion, what are we targeting on?    But we could see a sharper upward movement in the saving rate    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Seventh District   continues to pick up, and our business contacts are clearly more optimistic than they have been   in years  On Friday, the Chicago purchasing managers will release their January report  The   index will be at 659, the highest level in nearly twenty years; everything was strong except for   inventories and employment  Of course this is confidential until Friday   From our contact calls, we have heard three interesting themes regarding capital   expenditures, labor markets, and prices  First, plans to increase capital spending have become   more broad-based  And we were encouraged by our District’s results from the Board’s recent   survey  62 percent of respondents in our District plan to increase their capital outlays over the   next twelve months, up from 37 percent last June  The survey and our other contacts suggest   that, for firms in our region, replacement demand is still the driving factor rather than capacity   expansion  Spending continues to be for equipment rather than structures  The survey also   indicated that tax incentives are more important in our District than elsewhere, perhaps reflecting   the longer lead time for our mix of industries    January 27-28, 2004 124 of 238    We continue to hear good reports from producers of telecom equipment and heavy   machinery, and orders for medium and heavy-duty trucks jumped dramatically as shipment load   factors have improved  One automaker said that fleet sales to rental car agencies, which have   been sluggish since September 11, 2001, finally picked up in the fourth quarter  For January,   automakers expect light vehicle sales of 16½ million to 17 million units  As a cautionary note,   there is still a good deal of uncertainty about the how the month will play out even though we are   almost at the end of January  Our contact at General Motors pointed out that half of their   monthly sales during 2003 took place in the last six days of each month   The second theme that we are hearing is that labor markets are improving, with fewer   reports of layoffs and more plans for permanent hires  Both of the large temporary-help firms   that we contact have continued to see steady growth in workers on assignment  One of them   noted that transitions from temporary to permanent positions have increased recently, and we are   hearing some other reports of permanent hiring, but much of it involves replacing departing   workers  In my District this is happening at all levels, including the highest ones  In fact, I am   looking to replace four of my contacts who are among the ranks of the recently departed CEOs   [Laughter]    The third theme is that, despite robust demand, we are hearing mixed stories about the   ability of businesses to increase prices  Several firms have been unable to push through modest   price hikes  A large printer told us that paper suppliers tried several times to raise prices but   none of the increases stuck  A specialty retailer reported that consumers are buying only if the   product is on sale  And a major airline added a fuel surcharge to ticket prices but abandoned it   eighteen hours later  A few firms, however, have been able to raise prices or reduce discounts    Last quarter one of the Big Three automakers increased their average net price—that is, the   January 27-28, 2004 125 of 238    average sticker price minus incentives—for the first time in five years  In heavy equipment, one   manufacturer pushed through a price increase, and more generally we are hearing of fewer price   concessions  And, of course, strong demand internationally, especially from China, has boosted   steel prices     Turning to the national outlook, on balance the numbers have been strong  The strength   in capital spending now extends beyond high-tech goods and into more traditional equipment    Consumer spending has held up well, and residential investment remains robust  The obvious   exception to the recent positive news, as we were discussing earlier, is the payroll employment   series  December’s data were particularly disappointing, especially in light of the encouraging   claims numbers  Given the statistical uncertainties, we probably don’t want to place too much   weight on the employment figures at least until we see January’s report   More generally, our GDP outlook is close to the Greenbook’s  Over the near term the   risks regarding inflation appear to be nearly balanced, as we said in December  I do not see any   urgency for changing the funds rate target, but the key question is what to do about the phrase   “considerable period” in our post-meeting statement  My preference would be to remove it at the   earliest practical date  Our previous statement conditioned the phrase on low inflation and   resource slack, so given this conditioning we probably should retain it until we see some more   positive signs on employment, which I hope will be by our next meeting      Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for the rate  My   preference on the sentence would be somewhat different from what you’re recommending  I   would prefer to have you explain “considerable period” in more detail in your testimony  It will   be delivered after the jobs report comes out, so you will have the flexibility of giving a clearer   signal  If the jobs report is very strong, as I think it will be, you would be in a position to give a   very clear signal that the “considerable period” will not last for long  We have conditioned it   already, and my preference would be to get rid of the concept completely and not have it phased   January 27-28, 2004 181 of 238    out by a reference to “patience”  If we have a sentence in our statement that says the Committee   believes that it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation, we will still have the   problem of removing that sentence sometime in the future  So my preference would be to have   you do the explaining during your testimony and to get rid of the time reference completely in   the March statement    This is not an objection but a question  What about the role of   projections?  That issue has been in the press  "
7502,2004-03-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I wanted to ask a question about the labor   markets  The labor force participation rate has been declining, as has been widely described in   the press  Some of us were talking about this earlier, noting that a significant part of the decline   is due to a reduction in the teenage labor force participation rate  There has been a big increase   in school enrollment rates for teenagers as well  I was wondering if you had any thoughts on   these developments and their implications for the tightness or weakness of labor markets and   also for inflationary pressures    So the increase in school enrollment is something that we’ll see   washing out as the labor market tightens?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Seventh District economy continues to   improve  In general our contacts are still upbeat, but even as they tell us the good news about   current conditions, scattered signs of nervousness about the future are creeping into the   conversations, and we’re not completely sure why they’ve become more nervous  Household   spending generally remains robust  Many retailers tell us that sales are strong for a wide variety   of merchandise  This strength has led some merchants to increase inventories and to cut back on   discounts  In contrast, automakers are disappointed with sales so far this year, though they   remain confident that sales will pick up later in the year, partly in response to higher   incentives—which they expect to have to offer   March 16, 2004 25 of 107    It is notable that this strength in household spending is occurring despite weak job   growth  Many of our business contacts remain hesitant to hire even though they expect demand   for their products to continue to improve  To this point they seem to think that they can meet   improved demand through some combination of further process improvements, stretching their   current workforce, using temps, and just-in-time hiring  Some still are concerned that the   expansion will stall  They do not, however, give us very specific answers when we ask them to   identify the downside risks and explain why they are weighing them so heavily    On the other hand, the new CEO of Caterpillar reported that, because of strong demand   for their products, they plan to hire 1,000 net additional employees in the United States this year    This is one of the few large firms that we are aware of in our District that has specific plans to   hire a significant number of additional workers  Also, one positive category in the payroll   survey was temporary workers  The large temporary-help firms we speak with are happy to have   growth in billable hours, but the gains fall short of what they would have expected, given the   strength in the overall economy  And I’m sure we’ve all seen the Manpower survey of   permanent hiring intentions for the second quarter, which just came out early this morning; it   showed for the headline numbers the strongest reading since before the recession   Business investment continues to improve, albeit modestly  Much of the capital spending   we’re hearing about is geared to productivity enhancement, system integration, and automation   expansion activities, which of course need not directly lead to new hiring  Also, we’ve been   hearing recently about a different kind of capital overhang, which has to do with financial   capital  This relates to the discussion that Cathy and Dino had earlier today regarding risk and   liquidity  We continue to hear about investment firms that are awash with liquidity and straining   March 16, 2004 26 of 107    to place it  This money is chasing deals and reportedly bidding up prices of higher-risk   investments   Something else our contacts are talking about is the impact of the international economy   on their business  Several manufacturers indicate that foreign demand and a weaker dollar have   boosted orders and shipments  Demand from overseas, particularly China, has pushed import   prices up sharply for products such as energy, paper fiber, and most metals including, of course,   steel  It also has shown through in much higher shipping costs  Some firms have had success in   passing these cost increases on to their customers   On the labor front, a number of contacts said that the rhetoric surrounding the “off-  shoring” of American jobs is overblown  For example, one temporary-help contact said that his   orders for domestic call center jobs continue to increase despite reports of these types of jobs   moving overseas  He added that the call center jobs being created here are more sophisticated   and require more-nuanced language skills than the routine types of jobs that are leaving  Indeed,   he reported that some companies that tried moving their more sophisticated calling operations   abroad are now moving them back to the United States   Turning to the national outlook, the most recent jobs data are obviously a big   disappointment  Layoffs are down, but firms are still very reluctant to hire new workers  I wish   we understood this better  Is it nervousness about the outlook, as a few of my contacts   mentioned, or is it something else?  In any case, the weak job market has not depressed spending   by consumers, and the fundamentals still suggest that we’ll see decent job gains  As usual, it’s   just around the corner  Unfortunately, we’re not sure which corner!  [Laughter]  So our outlook   hasn’t changed much  We still expect output growth to remain above potential, eliminating   resource slack sometime next year  Obviously, we’ll eventually need to adjust rates up fairly   March 16, 2004 27 of 107    substantially  But given the softness in the labor market and the low level of inflation, we don’t   need to be in a hurry to start that adjustment    Mr Chairman, I think it’s a close call on whether to balance our   inflation concerns  But after hearing your comments, with which I tend to agree completely, I   March 16, 2004 79 of 107    have a slight preference for staying where we are  I think we’re in a situation today where the   fewer changes in the operative paragraphs, the better  "
7527,2004-05-04,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I just wanted to ask Karen a question about   China  You mentioned that China’s growth had been 15 percent and you expected it to slow to   7½ percent but not collapse, as you put it  There has been a lot of speculation about the risks and   potential difficulties associated with a slowing Chinese economy  I was wondering if you could talk   about that a bit in this context  We all are familiar with the Asian financial crisis of the late ’90s,   and I was wondering what magnitudes we would have to see in China in order to come close to   what we saw in the late ’90s and what kind of spillover effects would stem from that      Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The pickup in the Seventh District economy   has become more broad-based  Moreover, our contacts seem much less nervous than they were in   March  Many report increased bookings, growing backlogs, and low inventories, suggesting that   momentum will continue  Household spending has been robust for some time, and now we are   hearing widespread reports of increases in business spending  With regard to the latter, demand is   strong for machine tools and for heavy equipment such as agricultural and construction machinery    Reports from all of our shipping contacts have been strong, from trucking to warehousing to   cardboard boxes  As for air travel, both United and Boeing emphasized that traffic is finally above   September 11, 2001, levels and that load factors are high  Boeing publicly announced increases in   production schedules last week and told us privately that they hoped to be able to raise plans even   further  A publishing executive told us that advertising is picking up, so the magazine business may   finally be emerging from what he described as a “pageless” recovery  [Laughter]  Increases in   demand are showing through to labor markets  Both of the national temporary-help firms we speak   with have seen stronger growth in billable hours in recent weeks  Permanent placements and   forward-looking orders have increased, and these firms also are starting to get big orders from large   companies   May 4, 2004 21 of 112       We’ve heard a lot of comments about rising prices  First, more firms appear to be passing   on input cost increases to their customers  Airlines have now successfully added fuel surcharges to   their ticket prices, something they were unable to do a month or two ago  Tool and dye makers and   heavy equipment manufacturers are adding surcharges to cover higher steel costs, and these price   increases are sticking  Second, we’re hearing that strong demand and low inventories are boosting   pricing power even outside of steel  For example, one fiberboard container manufacturer told us   that the industry’s inventories are at the lowest level since at least 1994, allowing him to raise prices   some 8 percent from a year earlier  Third, in retailing, one contact indicated that his foreign   suppliers were no longer willing to absorb the impact of the lower dollar and have begun to raise   prices  In many cases, however, retailers have been able to offset those cost increases by raising   their own prices  In the auto industry, a striking feature is the high level of inventories  Not all   manufacturers are uncomfortable with these levels, in part because some of the inventories will help   cover planned production shutdowns  The industry’s forecasts for light vehicle sales for the year are   running at or just below 17 million, similar to the Greenbook projection     Turning to the national outlook, the data on real economic activity since our last meeting   have been encouraging  Household spending and business spending have been robust, and firms   appear to have gained enough confidence in the sustainability of the expansion to begin hiring in   earnest  So, although we’d like to see another month or two of strong numbers before declaring   victory, we think we’ve turned the corner on employment growth  Looking ahead, spending and   production seem to be evolving pretty much as anticipated, even with the lower-than-expected   numbers for first-quarter GDP  So we’re still looking for 2004 growth to be well above potential     The latest readings on inflation were surprising  We continue to believe that there’s a   sizable output gap and that some temporary factors are primarily responsible for the recent numbers,   May 4, 2004 22 of 112       but we can’t dismiss the possibility that the output gap is smaller than we’ve been thinking  We all   know how difficult it is to quantify precisely the size of the output gap  The Greenbook indicated   that the underlying inflation rate is somewhat higher than forecast at our last meeting  We agree   with that assessment, and we believe that the risks on inflation have definitely moved at least into   balance  We all will be looking at the data in coming weeks to see if inflation is much more of a   concern than we now believe  Depending on the data, we may want to move quickly and more   aggressively in tightening than the path laid out in the Greenbook, where we start to raise rates in   the fourth quarter of this year    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Vincent, I just had a question about the word   “measured”  I guess there are three options here  We have been using the word “patient,” and that   gives a certain message to the financial markets  So as you’ve outlined in the Bluebook, we could   retain the word “patient,” substitute the word “measured” for it, or we could take it out completely    May 4, 2004 73 of 112       As I read the Bluebook, it said that if we put in the word “measured,” interest rates would still go   up  If we take out the word “patient” and put nothing in its stead, interest rates would go up further    I was wondering if you could give us some idea of the magnitude of those differences  [Laughter]    Whatever you decide!    But does your market sense align with his?    Thank you   May 4, 2004 74 of 112        Right  But basically you’re talking about a small number of basis points   from the difference in the wording?    May I ask just one other question?  Do you see a time when we would   take this word out?    So while we have a series of 25 basis point increases it would stay in?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I wasn’t here in February 1994, but I’m   certainly going to go back and read the transcript to see when you went berserk!  [Laughter]     As for your proposal, I agree with your recommendation on the rate  On   the language, I find it hard to disagree with language that people I respect call “brilliant” or   “extremely good,” but I must say that I’d prefer a different path  I would prefer to drop the word   “patience” and not substitute the word “measured”  I just don’t like putting another word into the   lexicon now  I think it is going to pose problems for us down the road whenever we try to take it   out  I realize that this wording is going to be approved, but I’d like to make a couple of comments   so that the next time this issue comes up my views will at least be in the record   First of all, on the point that we conditioned it four times, I remember that at the Jackson   Hole conference there was a lot of discussion about whether the markets can understand central   banks’ conditioned statements, and the clear consensus was “no”  The view was that the   conditioning in a statement by a central bank doesn’t mean anything to the markets  They just read   it as unconditioned   Second, on Cathy’s and Don’s point about line 8, the part of the sentence that I think is   important—namely, “with inflation low and resource use slack,” which I agree should be   May 4, 2004 95 of 112       somewhere in the statement—could be moved up to line 3 and incorporated in the rationale section    I think that would describe the situation as it is now without having to provide a forward-looking   element—in other words, without adding “measured”  So, on balance, I would prefer to take that   word out  "
7554,2004-06-29,"  Mr Chairman, my question was asked already, so I’m going to pass    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I just wanted to compliment the staff on the   work in the chart show on inflation  I thought it was quite thorough and shed a lot of light on an   obviously very important area of concern for this Committee  I was hoping that you would shed a   little more light on the expectations side, which you didn’t talk a great deal about here  We’re going   through a period now when final price increases have accelerated  Some of the increases are being   passed through to the core measure, which is going up in part because of temporary factors that   hopefully will phase out so that the core rate will be going up at a somewhat slower pace but still at   a rate higher than we’ve seen in the immediate past  I was wondering if you’ve thought at all about   how this affects expectations for inflation The upward shift is explained now in terms of temporary   factors, but when we get past this—if we’re correct about these temporary factors and they are   indeed transitory and cease—what impact will this have on inflation expectations?    We’ll be watching this very carefully    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The expansion in the Seventh District now   appears extremely broad-based  Very few sectors are weak, and some are booming  This may be   hyperbole, but several of our contacts said that the business climate was as strong as they can   remember  One of our directors, whose private S corporation shows about forty different   businesses, said that he can’t recall when so many companies in so many different industries were   doing so well  Similarly, the national temporary-help firms headquartered in our District report that   their business is finally following a classic recovery growth path  And the Chicago Purchasing   Managers’ report, which is being released this morning, continued to show expansion, albeit with a   sharp decline from 68 in May to 564 in June  We recently held our annual automotive outlook   symposium, and the overall mood was upbeat  Thirty-five industry experts submitted forecasts, and   their consensus was for light motor vehicle sales to increase to 17 million units in the second half of   June 29-30, 2004 92 of 203          this year and be at about the same pace in 2005  These numbers are lower than the Greenbook   forecast, especially for ’05  And a truck industry analyst forecasted that production in medium- and   heavy-duty trucks would rise from about 300,000 last year to 370,000 in 2004 and to 460,000 in   2005   So, given that the expansion in real activity seems to be on such a solid footing, I’d like to   focus on what we’ve heard about emerging inflationary pressures  Certainly, more firms are   reporting price increases  Euphemisms like “price restoration” and “fuller pricing” are common    Some price increases are related to higher energy costs and strengthening worldwide demand for   steel and other commodities  We know that prices for many commodities have come down of late,   as was mentioned before, but it is still too early to know whether they’ve peaked  Many other   reports suggest bottlenecks in sectors where sales have increased rapidly, such as construction   equipment, agricultural equipment, and fiberboard packaging  In some cases, inventories of raw   materials and parts were low; in others, supply chain bottlenecks led firms to use higher-cost   alternatives like air freight to avoid parts shortages and production delays  So will these price   increases become permanent?  We obviously don’t know yet  One good sign we’ve heard is that,   while a number of our contacts said they were willing to accept recently imposed price surcharges   from their suppliers, they were still resisting base price increases  This may be a distinction without   a difference, but many of our contacts seem determined to keep pressure on their suppliers  As soon   as commodity prices fall, they expect the surcharges to come off  And their plans still assume lower   input costs  Most contacts report that their profit margins are good, so they may have quite a bit of   room to absorb cost increases without raising prices  Indeed, I get the feeling that many of them do   not expect their hefty profit margins to continue indefinitely   June 29-30, 2004 93 of 203          Turning to the national outlook, with labor markets firming, the expansion appears to be on   a solid self-sustaining track  Our own outlook for economic growth is a bit weaker than the   Greenbook’s for ’04 and a bit stronger for ’05, but the differences are small  We now see core PCE   inflation rising this year and settling down to around 1½ percent next year  We interpret the recent   increases in inflation as largely reflecting temporary effects rather than more-sustained price   pressures  And this view seems consistent with comments from our regional contacts, which   suggest that the economy is not running into fundamental capacity constraints     With regard to unit labor costs, we expect to see a sustained pickup as labor markets tighten,   but I don’t think that the bulk of these increases will be passed on to prices  Rather, as I mentioned   earlier, I expect that most will come out of currently elevated markups as labor’s share of income   moves back up toward more normal levels  Of course, there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding this   scenario  I am hearing increasing concerns that the Federal Reserve might be behind the curve  I   personally think our credibility is solid, but if higher inflationary expectations become entrenched,   that would obviously make our job much more difficult   If inflation remains on the moderate path that I expect, then a measured pace of policy   moves would likely be appropriate  However, the Committee must have the flexibility to act more   aggressively if inflationary pressures intensify  We think financial markets as well as the   nonfinancial sectors could handle aggressive moves, if needed  This was also the view of academic   and business economists we met with last week  So the policy statement should reiterate what   we’ve all been saying in public—that we will do whatever is necessary to maintain price stability    The statement should not give the appearance of constraining the Committee’s freedom of action at   subsequent meetings   "
7582,2004-08-10,"  I also wanted to follow on this discussion about oil prices  It seems that   every time I’ve looked at this futures market for oil—and I don’t look at it on a regular basis—when   the spot price is in the 30s or 40s, the price of oil is always shown as coming down in the future    Now it is projected to be coming down, but not by very much—only about $4 or $5 a barrel—by   the end of 2005  I was just wondering if you view this market now as typical  Does it look the way   August 10, 2004 18 of 103          it always does, or has it changed because of terrorism in Russia and all the other things that are   going on?  And does it change at different levels, as the level of the spot price varies?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The two big questions facing us are whether   the recent soft patch in economic activity is temporary and to what degree underlying inflation has   picked up  On the first question, we get a sense from our Seventh District contacts that their   business is good but apparently not robust enough to generate substantial hiring  We have received   August 10, 2004 23 of 103          mixed reports on employment  Our contacts at temporary-help firms say that they are placing   temporary workers across a wide range of industries  In addition, they are increasing their   placement of workers in permanent jobs  Some of our more general business contacts even report   scattered labor shortages in a few specialized areas  Nevertheless, few say that they are   permanently increasing their head counts even though business is pretty good   In terms of spending, some sectors that had weak activity in June showed improvement in   July  In particular, retailers told us that they saw something of a bounceback; and looking ahead,   merchants sound quite bullish about the upcoming holiday season and are planning to build their   inventories accordingly  As you know, light vehicle sales also bounced back in July  So far, reports   suggest that sales in the first week of August continued to be strong  One manufacturer even told us   that they are looking for sales in the month to be about 18½ million units      Light  Automakers will need a good August and September to clear   dealer lots of their ’04 model year cars; otherwise, they will need to reduce production schedules for   their ’05 models  Other sectors never really experienced much of a slowdown in June, and their   activity remains strong  This pattern has been evident in new orders for construction, agricultural,   mining, and some IT equipment as well as in demand for advertising  Air travel has continued to   move higher during the summer, with bookings solid for the fall  In contrast, information we have   heard about IT services suggests weakness     On the second question, the outlook for inflation, our District contacts continue to talk about   cost pressures, but there are few indications of pass-through to prices so far  There’s not much news   on wages, but rising health care costs remain a major concern  And costs for some material inputs,   notably construction materials, steel, and energy remain elevated  Our contacts still expect these   August 10, 2004 24 of 103          costs to ease, but it is taking longer than they had anticipated  Similarly, the supply chain   bottlenecks that I discussed last time are also taking longer to resolve  Capacity constraints are   particularly severe in transportation, and there are concerns that these could persist and cause   substantial problems during the peak fall shipping season  As I noted, despite all these cost   pressures, we’re hearing only limited reports of price increases downstream     Turning to the national outlook, we think that the economy’s soft patch is temporary  The   July employment report makes us nervous but doesn’t change this assessment  Assuming that the   recent payroll data are not spurious, what risks do they suggest?  One possibility is that we’re back   to an environment similar to last year, when uncertainty held back hiring even though growth   continued  Of course, there are reasons to think that uncertainty might have risen; we’ve just talked   about the oil prices, terrorist threats, and so on  However, our business contacts have not talked   explicitly about increased uncertainty holding back their hiring, and we know that indications of   spending showed activity picking up again in July  Moreover, we think the fundamentals continue   to be strong  Real income growth has been maintained despite the weak employment growth and   higher energy prices, we still have strong underlying productivity growth, and monetary policy   remains very accommodative  We are concerned about the persistently high oil prices  Their   movements seem to be driven largely by geopolitical concerns, as Karen was discussing, so oil is a   wild card both for growth and for inflation  We all know that these sorts of supply shocks make for   difficult policy decisions  Still, with regard to prices, the data suggest that core inflation remains   well contained  So at this time continuing to remove policy accommodation at a measured pace   seems appropriate    Mr Chairman, I agree completely with your recommendation  I think the   sooner we get back to neutral, the better off we are, and I agree that we should have a high hurdle   for not raising rates at meetings while we’re in this period of removing accommodation at a   measured pace  And I think it’s important not to leave gaps in the timing of our policy moves    Also, I believe it’s important for us to mention energy prices in this statement   There is one point that I just want to mention  I agree with the statement as written, but in   section 3 of Brian’s table, the rationale sentence says, “The economy nevertheless appears poised to   resume a stronger pace of expansion going forward”  That is a little different from what we’ve done   before  I agree with the sentence, but it is forward-looking, and I don’t think we’ve had forward-  looking sentences before in the rationale section of the statement  I don’t disagree with it, but I   think we should recognize that    As I said, I don’t disagree with it, but I think it is different from what we   have been saying in the past  "
7606,2004-09-21,"  My question actually relates to this last discussion  I want to ask about   the alternative simulation on the international side—the 30 percent decline in the real value of   the broad dollar index  When I saw the results, I was a little surprised that they weren’t more   serious in that 30 percent depreciation scenario  But then I saw the sentence you had there   indicating that the shock did not incorporate any of the potential impact on the US economy   through the confidence of business or consumers or through higher risk premiums on private   domestic asset prices  So I was wondering if you could give us the benefit of your thinking on   that as to what magnitudes we should expect here     If we had this sharp drop in the dollar, you point out that it would   affect confidence of US business firms and US consumers  How would you see that playing   through?    Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Maybe I should speak faster!  In this   round, the reports from our Seventh District contacts were unusually varied  Many were quite   upbeat; others were reminiscent of last year, when uncertainty over the strength of the expansion   caused firms to delay investment and hiring  Hence, while I think we’ve moved out of the soft   patch, we do not yet have a clear sense of how robust conditions are going to be  On the upside,   some industries continue to do very well  These include printing, magazine advertising, paper   packaging, and a wide variety of heavy machinery producers  Indeed, industry reps at this   month’s International Manufacturing Technology Show in Chicago said that business was as   good as it has been since 1998  In contrast, producers of consumer goods were more subdued    As you know, automakers are now less bullish and are increasingly concerned about their   inventories  They plan to offer even higher incentives and to be very conservative about   production  Reports on consumer spending were also mixed   Reports on hiring reflected the varied levels of optimism across sectors  Many   manufacturers outside the automobile sector are adding hourly workers to their payrolls  But in   line with Dave Stockton’s comments, we’re once again hearing from our directors and other   contacts that some businesses are uncertain enough about the strength of demand that they’re   reluctant to add workers  The large temporary-help firms we spoke with said that year-over-year   growth in billable hours had eased slightly, but they attributed at least part of the softness to   transitory factors such as the hurricanes  Furthermore, one of them reported that wage gains had   moved a bit higher across the board    Nonetheless, the inflation outlook remains subdued  Of course, some input costs are still   quite high  In response, some of our contacts are changing their purchasing strategies  Many   users of steel, for example, think prices will come down substantially, so they’re not building   September 21, 2004 38 of 100          inventories at the current high prices  And many are switching from long-term fixed-priced   contracts to ones that guarantee future supply but with the cost linked to the price prevailing at   the time of delivery  Downstream, most firms have been unable to pass higher costs on to   consumers   Turning to the national outlook, last time the two big questions facing us were whether   inflation had picked up and whether the soft patch was temporary  We now feel better about   inflation, and as I noted at the outset, we seem to have emerged from the soft patch, but we don’t   have a clear picture of how big the improvement will be  Job growth has not yet shown the   kinds of gains that one would expect if growth were running above potential, and I am concerned   that during the intermeeting period we heard renewed talk about increased uncertainty making   businesses hesitant to hire and to spend  There’s a chance that this risk aversion will become   embedded and take us into a more extended period of subpar growth  But there are reasons to be   optimistic  Financial markets are not pricing in heightened risk, productivity trends and   accommodative monetary policy are supporting growth, and quite a few of my contacts are very   upbeat about their businesses   On balance, we think that the mixed signals mean that the economy is growing only   modestly faster than potential  Our forecast is for the output gap to remain sizable for some time   and for inflation to stay under control  The question going forward is, How quickly should we   remove the current high degree of policy accommodation?  We still have a long way to go before   the funds rate reaches neutral, so I don’t see any reason to deviate at this meeting from our plan   to remove policy accommodation at a measured pace  But if we see signs of persistent   sluggishness in the economy, then we might want to pause at some time in the future    I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
7631,2004-11-10,"  I had a question on the auto outlook  The people that we talk to in the   industry are rather conservative about the outlook for next year  They’re expecting relatively flat   sales  Now, they’re not always right, of course  But the Greenbook has sales going up 4 percent   next year to a record level and then going up another 3 percent in 2006  I was wondering if you   could comment on the rationale for that and how it compares with the more-conservative forecasts   that we’re hearing from those in the auto industry     It is a tough forecast to make, and of course, the automakers may also be   running out of room to provide incentives or price cuts and still be viable    That’s another constraint    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Seventh District economy has firmed   since our last meeting  Many of our manufacturing contacts outside the auto industry report strong   orders and sales as well as a growing backlog  The improvements have been broad-based, with   particular strength in heavy equipment  Engine producers cannot keep up with strong demands and   have put truck manufacturers on allocation  And Caterpillar’s CEO told me that business is the best   he has seen in his thirty-two years in the industry  In contrast, both Ford and GM were disappointed   in their October results and reduced next year’s outlook for light vehicle sales slightly, to around   16½ million units  On a positive note, one automaker was pleased that they were able to lock in   steel prices for next year below current spot prices    With regard to the labor markets, businesspeople in our area report more hiring  Our   contacts at Kelly, the temporary staffing firm, note that orders are rising more rapidly and that   permanent placement fees continue to increase  And they say that it is no longer as easy to find   qualified workers We also hear from other contacts that skilled tradespeople in manufacturing and   November 10, 2004 27 of 107    even part-time retail help for the holiday season are harder to find  All of this is consistent with the   stories that we’ve heard around this table for several meetings now    Although growth is more solid, we do not see the kinds of upward pressures on wages and   prices that would indicate that we’ve fully closed the output gap  There are some exceptions    Several contacts do note that wages are rising somewhat faster  Some even say that, for the first   time in several years, they occasionally have to pay bonuses to hire and to retain workers    Nonetheless, overall growth in wages remains modest, especially in light of the strength that we’ve   seen in productivity growth   In terms of pricing, suppliers are finding it somewhat easier to pass higher costs along to   their business customers  We’re hearing about this in construction materials and heavy equipment    In addition, the weaker dollar is raising the wholesale prices of imported goods, as a large specialty   retailer reported to us  However, there is little evidence of a general pass-through of higher input   costs to consumer prices  So on balance, we think the economy has a way to go before the output   gap is fully closed   Turning to the national outlook, clearly the economy has emerged from the midyear soft   patch  Consumer spending has rebounded  The October jobs figure certainly was long-overdue   good news, and our contacts are less skittish about the outlook for demand  But the data and the   anecdotes don’t seem to point to a widespread surge in growth  It feels more like growth that is   only modestly faster than potential, despite the substantial degree of monetary accommodation   Two factors seem to be holding back growth  The first is higher energy prices, which we’ve   talked about a lot—and we’ve seen quantitative estimates of their impact—and the second is   business caution  Even though businesses seem more sanguine, there continues to be an underlying   hesitancy to take on large-scale investment or hiring commitments   November 10, 2004 28 of 107    Roger Ferguson discussed business caution in our last meeting, and I’d like to elaborate on   one aspect of that phenomenon  I think in part this caution in investing and hiring is related to a   continued and even increased level of concern about Sarbanes–Oxley, especially its provisions on   internal controls  The more I hear from CEOs and people who sit on corporate boards, the clearer it   is that Sarbanes–Oxley is leading to significant, and I think still evolving, changes in   decisionmaking  Corporations seem more risk averse  They operate under a veil of caution  I hear   repeated stories of companies making decisions much more slowly  In addition, they’re discarding   projects that they might otherwise have undertaken  Now, quantifying these factors is hard    Statistical models can give us an idea of how higher energy prices are holding back activity, but   they give us little guidance on how to calibrate the influence of higher risk aversion  Nevertheless, I   believe that it’s likely to be significant  So in the context of policy, this uncertainty makes it   appropriate to continue being measured in how we remove policy accommodation  Of course, if   we see energy prices raising long-run inflation expectations or if we see business caution and   resource slack dissipating substantially, then we may need to move more aggressively    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation to increase the fed funds   rate by 25 basis points  On the language question, I think it is time to start moving away from the   term “measured”  It has worked well—quite frankly, better than I thought it would  I was   concerned about it when we started using a series of forward-looking statements  So I would like to   move away from the forward-looking statements—obviously not at this meeting, but possibly at the   December meeting  At the same time, however, we should also seriously consider the balance of   risk statement that we had previously  After two task forces working on this with Roger Ferguson,   I’m not going to suggest a third task force  But the balance of risk language has evolved over the   ten years that I’ve been here  It has been useful at times, but I think it is getting increasingly   difficult to craft a balance of risk statement, given the complexity of the economy  "
7657,2004-12-14,"  Mr Chairman?  I congratulate you, too, Vincent, but may I make one   minor suggestion?  "
7658,2004-12-14,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since we’re making history today, the   Seventh District’s economy continued to firm, and the strength appears broad-based  Our business   contacts again report increasing production, strong new orders, and growing backlogs  Labor   market conditions are improving, although they’re still not robust  Our temporary-help firms report   that orders are strong for professional and technical help, but growth is a bit less rapid in the light   industrial and clerical sectors   We recently held our eighteenth Annual Economic Outlook Symposium  Twenty-six   economists submitted forecasts this year, and they were a bit more pessimistic than the Blue Chip   forecast  The consensus outlook is for GDP growth of 31 percent in 2005 and for the CPI to rise   December 14, 2004 16 of 118           24 percent next year  Not surprisingly, a number of the participants in the symposium make a   living in the auto industry  Their outlook for light vehicle sales in 2005 is 168 million units, a pace   virtually unchanged from 2004  If the Big Three continue to lose market share, this pace would   imply declines in their sales, and such declines would be a challenge for our District, given the   heavy presence of Big Three production  Two of our directors, who are major parts suppliers, are   working off the assumption that Big Three production in the first quarter will be 7 percent below   that of a year ago but said they wouldn’t be surprised if the actual cuts were as much as 10 percent   Turning to the national outlook, on balance the data we have received during the past few   weeks haven’t materially changed our views about the economy  We continue to expect that   growth will average a bit above potential over the forecast period  Our best guess is that there is still   some meaningful resource slack in the economy, so our outlook for inflation is relatively benign    The fact that higher prices for energy and other inputs did not markedly boost core inflation is   certainly consistent with this view    With regard to risks, I’m still concerned that factors such as high energy prices and business   caution could continue to hold back growth in job creation  However, I’m also concerned about   some inflation risk  We know that there is a great deal of uncertainty about the size of resource   gaps  What if they’re not as large as we think?  After all, we’ve been expecting big increases in   employment as the gaps in labor markets shrink  But it has been three years since the recession   ended, and even in the years since employment began to head up, payrolls have increased only a bit   faster than the working-age population, and labor force participation has been flat during this period    It’s possible that this is as good as it gets  The participation rates simply may have overshot trend in   the late ’90s by more than we thought and, therefore, the rate may not rise much above its current   level  The answer to this question regarding resource gaps is not obvious at this time, as David   December 14, 2004 17 of 118           mentioned in his comments  But we cannot rule out the possibility that there is less resource slack   in the economy than we think and that we’ve been reading the inflation data with too much   complacency  Whether inflation picks up during the next eight quarters or after the next eight   quarters, either scenario would be of concern  Of course, even if we discount this risk, policy is still   highly accommodative, so at this meeting my view is that we should continue on our current course    It’s still too early to signal an imminent pause; that will be a key question for next year    I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, I think that the experiment was very helpful  My own   feeling is that releasing the minutes early will provide useful information to the markets  I think it   will help us communicate better  I agree, as others have said, that it will be very helpful in our   speeches and interviews  And other central banks are doing it  Also, strictly from the standpoint of   logic, we are producing minutes, and we are going to release them at some point  We now know   that we have the technical ability to release them earlier than we have been  It’s rather difficult to   argue that we should delay releasing them because we think people are going to misuse the   information  That just doesn’t hang together from a logical standpoint  I don’t know that we could   pass the “red face” test in making that argument in public   I agree with Cathy in that I would also very much like to take out the forward-looking   statements in our announcements  But as for the idea of packaging these two changes together, I   think it would be very difficult to accomplish just in terms of trying to get agreement among the   Committee  It’s difficult enough to get agreement on one piece of this let alone two pieces at the   same time  So I just don’t know if it’s practical to try to do that  If we decide to go this route, I do   have one minor suggestion on the announcement  But why don’t I hold off on that until we decide   whether we’re going to do this or not   December 14, 2004 88 of 118            Instead of waiting to announce this in the minutes that will come out right   after the February meeting, I would announce it early in January for several reasons  One, I think it   would give more time to the markets to be aware of this change  If we put it in the minutes of this   meeting, which would be released after our February meeting, that would give market participants   about twelve trading days before a new set of minutes—those for the February meeting—will be   released  Second—and I hate to say this—there’s always a chance of a leak  I would hate to see   this come out before we announce it    I would strongly support that, if you can do it  I would do it as soon as   possible  I thought you’d want to draft some wording and have the Committee look at it first    Fine  That’s excellent  "
7683,2005-02-01,"  Mr Chairman, I think the leak of the topic for today’s discussion, which   was the subject of an article that appeared in The Wall Street Journal, was very disappointing and                                                    February 1-2, 2005 6 of 177  troubling I’ve been with the Federal Reserve for10 years, and we pride ourselves on being an   organization with very high integrity When we have a leak like that, I think it’s really an   embarrassment to the Federal Reserve and to each of us individually  Leaks such as this have   happened on rare occasions in the period that I’ve been here But I think it is important that we   emphasize every year, in line with the integrity of this organization, how crucial it is to maintain the   confidentiality of what we discuss    Thank you, Mr Chairman  On your specific question about low and   stable inflation, I, too, believe it is very important  I had similar experiences to those Susan Bies had   in private industry in the late ’70s and the ’80s, and I share her views completely   I also had some experiences in government in the late ’60s and early ’70s  In 1971, when we   had wage and price controls, I headed a little group called the Council on Wage and Price Stability,   which was monitoring inflation after controls were put in place  This was a terrible period It was   bad in private industry, and it was bad in government, too  We want to do everything we can to   avoid going through another period like that or having to face those problems again   In answer to Vincent’s questions, I come out for alternative 1  Let me explain how I got   there, but first I would add my compliments on the staff’s work  The papers the staff prepared were   excellent   In terms of defining price stability, in principle I think behavior does reveal the costs   associated with inflation In the definition that we’ve all been using, we look at the way people are   behaving in terms of devoting resources to dealing with inflation costs and risks  If behavior   suggests that the costs are low, then that is price stability That’s the definition we’ve all been using    This means, of course, that inflation not only needs to be low, it also needs to be stable   So, would it be helpful to define that as a number or a range, beyond the behavioral side?  I   guess, in practice, it would be useful within this Committee to have an explicit number to judge   where we are and where we’re going And to answer Vincent’s questions, if we were to do that, I   think we ought to use what is technically the best index, which is the PCE It’s less familiar to the   public than the CPI, but the more we use it publicly, the more people will catch on to it, and   certainly people would learn a lot more about it if it became the focal point of our discussions about   inflation I tend to focus on the core inflation number, and I personally think that 1½ percent is a   reasonable assessment of what might be best  But I would say that anything between 1 and 2   percent would be about the same for economic performance  Anything lower and the zero bound   becomes an issue           February 1-2, 2005 44 of 177  I did want to make a couple of comments about the discussion of a range versus a point   estimate for our objective  We’ve heard arguments on both sides, and I guess I would put in a caveat   about a wide range People have talked about 1 to 3 percent  I think we would need some greater   clarification about the acceptable outcomes within that range  For example, let’s say the range was 1   to 3 percent and we had 2¾ percent inflation for four or five years in a row I don’t think any of us   would really feel comfortable saying that’s price stability  Janet mentioned that having any range   gives the impression of a zone of indifference, and I think that’s an important point  I share some of   her concerns about that, so I think it would be an important issue to address if we ever were to set a   range   In terms of the role of the price objective in the policy process, as I said, at this time I prefer   alternative 1, the status quo I would augment it with some of the steps that Vincent mentioned in   his memo to give more information to the public  In a sense, this is a further evolution of our efforts   to improve transparency  We’ve taken an incremental approach to improving transparency, and I   think it has served us very well Going further than those incremental steps I don’t think is   necessary   Now, the staff paper discussed the international experience, which I found very interesting   But our situation is really quite different from the two groups of countries that were mentioned  As   Cathy noted, we don’t have a crisis to deal with, as was the situation in Brazil or in Mexico We   have low inflation and a good deal of credibility We’re also the largest economy in the world, so   the formation of inflation expectations here is likely to proceed differently than it does in smaller   economies and ones that are much more open than ours that appear to have benefited from inflation   targeting   So, I don’t think we’re ready to proceed on this yet I believe it would be best to take small   steps I can see a number of possible problems that could arise  I think we have to be very careful in   discussions with the Congress and with the public over how to address this issue in view of our dual              February 1-2, 2005 45 of 177  mandate  As Don Kohn suggested, we ought to move very carefully here  That concludes my   comments, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The story from the Seventh District is much   the same as last time  We’re seeing a broad-based improvement in business conditions  I would   characterize it as solid growth, but not spectacular Most of the sectors that were strong last year   continue to do very well and expect good results for 2005 These include steel, heavy trucks,                             February 1-2, 2005 84 of 177  construction machinery, and commercial printing  A number of firms in these industries have been   able to raise prices without seeing a reduction in their order backlogs We’ve also heard some   upbeat forward-looking reports on commercial aircraft And agriculture has been very strong Farm   incomes were up sharply last year, and that has been supporting big gains in the sale of agricultural   equipment  We also saw the largest annual increase in District farmland values in 15 years   On the other hand, the outlook for the Big Three automakers, whose operations and those of   their suppliers are heavily concentrated in our District, is not so good  Most analysts expect light   vehicle sales to be similar to last year, but the Big Three are concerned about losing even more   market share  And their profit outlook is not good; we continue to hear that they have significant   cost disadvantages relative to the transplants Moreover, foreign nameplates have built out their   product lines to the point where the Big Three face stiff competition in just about every market   segment  One result of the relatively poor performance of the Big Three is that Michigan now has   the highest unemployment rate in the nation    Actually, Illinois is leading the Big Ten in basketball  [Laughter] They   are undefeated so far   On the price front, there’s more talk that higher costs for plastics and other energy-related   inputs are working their way downstream, but we’re certainly not hearing widespread reports of   major price increases   With regard to labor markets, the two large temporary staffing firms that we speak with   regularly continue to report roughly 10 percent overall growth relative to a year ago, with demand   for skilled workers rising fastest Like us, they have been expecting a period of more robust   employment growth  But the further we get from the recession, the more they are becoming   resigned to the idea that the growth rates we’ve seen over the last year may be as high as we’ll get in   this cycle The president of one of the temp firms made an interesting observation about the   reluctance of businesses to hire He said “Everybody still has a reason to be cautious, but lately the                    February 1-2, 2005 85 of 177  reasons are industry-specific” This is an improvement from a year or so ago when many firms   reported being worried about the strength of the overall economy  His observations pretty much   match my impressions  Things aren’t exactly roaring, but few businesses regard the expansion as   fragile   Turning to the national outlook, once again the data we’ve received since the last meeting   have not materially changed our outlook for 2005  We continue to expect that output will expand at   a rate somewhat above potential and that there will be little change in core inflation  I think the   alternative simulations in the Greenbook did a good job of laying out a number of the risks to the   forecast Overall, I think these risks are balanced   The “higher long-term interest rates” simulation did give me some pause, especially because   of the talk that foreign investors may be revising their thinking about US securities  But I remain   concerned about another risk that we talked about last time, namely, that, instead of some   appreciable slack remaining in the economy, we may already be essentially at potential or   approaching potential This view was raised by some of the participants, albeit a minority, in the   meeting we had last week of our academic advisors and Chicago-area business economists  When   asked about the course of policy going forward, there was a roughly even split between those who   thought that the path implicit in futures markets was about right and those who thought we should be   raising rates at a faster pace My own view is that we will probably have to raise rates this year to   levels that are higher than those expected by futures markets  As we all know, we will face   communication challenges as the year proceeds  It’s probably not critical today, but it will become   more so as we move through the year    Vincent, have you drafted a sentence to see what alternative 2 would look   like on exhibit 3 using probability?    I support your recommendation, but I do want to make a couple of brief   comments  While we’re sitting around enjoying this, as you put it, I think it would be helpful to   flesh out these three alternatives—probably within the Bluebook I think that would be the   appropriate way to start looking at this    So, fleshing them out in the Bluebook would be my suggestion  Also,   with regard to the Microsoft dividend, I do want to assure Governor Ferguson that we’re hoping to   move it to Michigan  [Laughter]  "
7708,2005-03-22,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Activity continues to firm in the Seventh   District In general, my contacts are more upbeat than they were a couple of months ago, and there   is much more confidence that the expansion is on a solid, self-sustaining footing  And we’re hearing   more news about price increases and price pressures  Nevertheless, activity has not yet heated up to   the point that there is broad-based pressure on capacity The positive news is fairly widespread    Demand continues to be robust for heavy trucks and for equipment used in construction, agriculture,   and oil and gas industries Our contacts in retail trade, including shopping mall operators, and in   consumer advertising also tell us that business is good    The news on hiring, however, is more subdued  Notably, the two major temporary-help   firms headquartered in our District reported that their growth has slowed since our last meeting    Also, there is an important downside risk for our District’s economy  The well-publicized woes of   General Motors and Ford could develop into an even larger drag than we have seen to date It’s not   clear how the auto market will evolve in 2005  Year-to-date sales have been weak, as automakers   appear to be testing the market with lower incentives  Still, the Big Three have not yet backed off   their earlier projections that light vehicle sales will run about 16¾ million units this year  They are   hoping that sales will increase as the year proceeds, similar to the pattern in 2004 after they raised   incentives But based on our conversations, it is unclear whether the automakers will be willing to   do the same this year                                  March 22, 2005 26 of 116  Given the increasing momentum in the District economy, we took a hard look at resource   constraints and price pressures Heavy vehicle production continues to be constrained by shortages   of engines, axles, and especially tires And Caterpillar expects production to be straining capacity at   least through 2005   On the price front, the environment has clearly changed  For example, the head of a large   bank told me that, for the first time in many years, suppliers are telling customers to buy now or pay   higher prices in 30 days Manufacturers’ long-term contracts for materials are running out, and   several report paying premiums in order to ensure supply and keep production running at full tilt    As more of these long-term contracts expire, cost pressures and pass-through could intensify  Even   auto suppliers are digging in their heels and resisting further price reductions   In contrast, the steel price picture looks better, as you mentioned earlier  As one contact   noted, this is perhaps due in part to increased production in China Also, on the international scene,   a major retailer told us that his European suppliers recently boosted prices between 8 and 12 percent   after holding the line last year In response, the retailer shifted some business to suppliers in the Far   East   Turning to the national economy, it’s clear that growth is on firm, self-sustaining ground  So   our focus should shift more to assessing inflationary pressures, and there are indications that   inflation risks may have increased  Recent price data and, as I just mentioned, comments from our   business contacts, do have a firmer tone  Oil prices continue to surprise us on the upside, the   declining dollar is showing through to higher import prices, TIPS measures of inflation   compensation have moved up, and resource slack could be smaller than we thought  In particular,   work done by our Bank’s economists—and by the Board staff, as Dave discussed—suggests that   labor force participation rates may settle out at a lower level than we had been thinking                                     March 22, 2005 27 of 116  These developments have increased our inflation forecast, but quantifying the extent of the   inflation risk is difficult When we run our models using data back to the 1960s, the models forecast   higher PCE inflation—nearly 2 percent this year and next year But the economy has changed a lot,   particularly starting in the early 1980s When we limit the data to the last 20 years, the uptick is   diminished  Furthermore, I do not get the impression that a 1970s-type inflationary mentality is   creeping into my contacts’ decisionmaking processes     So, on balance, taking everything into consideration, I think we can continue our pattern of   measured rate increases, and I don’t think we need major changes in the wording of our statement at   this meeting  Futures markets expect us to move the funds rate to 3¾ percent by year-end  But if a   more aggressive tightening is warranted, we could easily get to 4¼ percent just by increasing the   funds rate 25 basis points at each meeting  This would be perfectly consistent with our “measured   pace” language But we may need to move more aggressively after this meeting; some warning   clouds have clearly developed We often say we need to be data-dependent  I think it’s particularly   important now  We’ll get two months of price data before our May meeting and, of course, a lot of   other data And we’ll want to look carefully at those data in assessing our next steps    I wanted to express concern about the phrase “appropriate policy action,”   too, for the reasons that have been discussed here I don’t think we need it I realize that it does   show that some effort is required to have the risks balanced and that it is somewhat of a signal that   we’re ready to do more, if necessary  But if we have the references in here to inflation, which I   believe are very important, I don’t think we need that phrase at this point  And it does open the   Pandora’s box that Vincent has described so carefully So my preference is not to use that phrase                                               March 22, 2005 78 of 116   I would just drop it    I would say they “remain roughly equal”    We’d have to recognize it’s very short-lived    Can you read that?    Just two comments, Mr Chairman  I agree with your recommendation on   the rate increase and on alternative B after this extensive discussion I found the discussion very   helpful and, though it may have been a little long, in my view it was useful to have it  As for   forward-looking statements, I personally think that the balance-of-risk statement has outlived its   usefulness Whether we should include some other kind of forward-looking comment is something   that at this point I’m agnostic about  I’d like to hear more discussion and comment about that, and   hopefully we’ll have an opportunity to talk about it at the May meeting   On a process point, I think getting the draft statement out to the Committee before the   Bluebook is a constructive step I don’t want to build this into a bureaucratic procedure, but I think   it would be helpful to have a chance to see the comments made by other members of the Committee   on that initial draft I, too, expressed concern about the phrase “appropriate policy action”—I   believe it was last Friday—but there was little time for looking further at possible revisions  So I   just think it would be helpful if we had a chance to see what other people had to say about the initial   draft of the statement  "
7734,2005-05-03,"  Is that defensive or offensive?    You now have higher energy prices built into the forecast—significantly   higher energy prices—and the futures market does, too  I’m just wondering if you could talk about   how that factors into your thinking about potential output going forward    If we had significantly higher energy prices than we have now, what   would the sensitivity be?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In our calls this round, we tried to get a sense   of the depth and the breadth of the current soft patch and how much of it might be associated with   higher energy prices My contacts report that growth has moderated somewhat in the Seventh                                       May 3, 2005 26 of 116  District While the manufacturing sector is still quite robust, there are some hints of slowing orders   and the Big Three auto manufacturers are still hurting   Our retail contacts note that business is a bit softer, but they don’t seem alarmed  Retailers   say that higher gasoline prices are affecting sales  Middle-income consumers are switching from   specialty stores to discounters, and lower-income consumers are cutting back more noticeably     Gasoline prices are depressing the demand for large SUVs, as David mentioned  I’d add that orders   for recreational vehicles are down significantly as well  But air travel continues to be strong despite   higher fares   Business spending continues to be solid The heavy equipment market is the strongest in   years One manufacturer in this sector said that he was increasing capital expenditures 40 percent   this year to alleviate production bottlenecks in existing facilities, though not to build new plants In   contrast, a large diversified manufacturer has started to see some softening in orders in the last few   weeks, although business overall remains good   On the price front, the big story continues to be energy There is now a more pervasive   sense that higher energy prices are here to stay We’re hearing this from the auto industry, from   retailers, and from firms in the energy sector  Nonetheless, a major oil company told us that they   remain cautious in their investment planning  Despite significantly higher spot prices and elevated   long-term futures, they’re still using an assumption of $20 a barrel when evaluating new production   projects So it seems that oil prices will have to remain elevated for a longer period of time before   the industry becomes willing to expand supply through aggressive long-term investments   In addition to energy, we’re still hearing about cost pressures elsewhere, notably for   construction materials, rubber, and plastics  Some of these pressures may be creeping into   expectations For example, a manufacturing firm told us that entering 2004 they budgeted for a 1                                 May 3, 2005 27 of 116  percent decline in material costs, but their actual costs ended up 3 percent higher, and this year   they’re budgeting for another 3 percent increase Looking downstream, many manufacturers have   been able to pass through cost increases, and, in a few particularly strong sectors, firms have even   been able to increase margins   With regard to labor costs, a major retailer reported that for the first time in two years they   had to offer higher starting salaries for sales associates  However, our contacts at temporary help   firms see wages increasing at the same rate or perhaps a little more slowly than earlier in the year    And union contracts have been restrained Union wages are flat or coming down, more contracts   include lower pay for new hires, and health care costs continue to be shifted to workers   Turning to the national outlook, our best assessment is that price pressures remain a concern   and that the current soft patch is not the beginning of a major slowdown in the economy  With   regard to growth, most of the fundamentals remain strong  Monetary accommodation and the   underlying trend in productivity continue to support solid growth  The claims data suggest a firmer   labor market than we saw in March, and I don’t get the sense from my contacts that consumers or   businesses are retrenching in a significant fashion Accordingly, growth should pick up at a pace   above potential in the second half of the year   With regard to prices, we expect that higher costs will continue to pass through to the   consumer level, boosting core inflation to around 2 percent this year  But we expect core inflation to   stabilize or edge off a touch in 2006, mainly because we don’t think there are broad-based resource   constraints Still, these assessments are uncertain  We’re not really sure which shocks are most   responsible for the soft spot and what their ultimate impact might be on the output gap  If factors   such as increased caution or reduced policy stimulus are the main culprits, then there may be a   persistent widening in the gap, as in the Greenbook forecast To the extent that is the case, it may be                                 May 3, 2005 28 of 116  appropriate to remove policy accommodation very gradually, say, along the path that’s embedded in   futures prices right now But we need to do more than that if the weakness largely reflects a   reduction in potential output due to higher energy prices Otherwise we would be accommodating   an adverse supply shock and would risk unhinging inflationary pressures   So far, long-term expectations appear to be fairly well anchored, although some measures   have crept up slightly in recent months  If we have a few more months of bad price data, we’ll need   a more aggressive policy response to avoid a pickup in long-term inflationary expectations  For   today’s meeting, I think we should continue on our current pace of rate adjustments  However, the   statement should avoid giving the impression that the recent softness in economic activity   diminishes the underlying inflation risk    That’s unfair [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with your recommendation on both   counts—the 25 basis points and alternative B   I know we always say that we will know a lot more at the next meeting, but this time we   really will [Laughter] We’re going to have two sets of price data and two sets of employment data,   so I think we will have a much better sense as to whether this is a soft patch or not and how serious   the inflation risks are at that point                                    May 3, 2005 93 of 116  I think the statement actually does a good job of pointing out the slowing in the solid pace of   spending growth on the one hand and that inflation pressures also have picked up  So, I think that   balance is very good   Going forward, I would just say that I, too, would like to get out of the forward-looking   statements if we possibly can  I’d like a shorter statement in the near future  I’d like to drop the   balance-of-risk statement, which I don’t think adds anything now  I agree that it has outlived its   usefulness, as Governor Ferguson said I just don’t think now is the time to do it   I do think the chances are that this statement really will require major changes at our June   meeting  I don’t know what those are going to be at this point; it will depend on the data, of course   But I do think it will require major changes, and that’s probably the time to look at all of this   Now, I am not going to respond to Governor Olson’s very unfair comment about the   Chicago Bulls except to say that we will see how the Washington Wizards do when they lose their   home court advantage in the next game and have to face the Chicago Bulls in the friendly confines   of the United Center [Laughter]    Touché    Yes  "
7762,2005-06-29,"  Agricultural land, yes   Yes, we collect the data                                               June 29-30, 2005 24 of 234  I agree, Mr Chairman  Those data are being influenced in part by the   expansion of residential areas out into what used to be farms or agricultural land  There are some   interesting dynamics taking place because, in the Chicago metropolitan area, a lot of this land is   now being used for residential purposes  However the sellers, for tax purposes, want to use the   proceeds to buy agricultural land right away  So they then go downstate in Illinois and bid up the   prices there  They are not as concerned about the price as long as they can make this tax-free   exchange  So, that’s one dynamic  The other interesting dynamic, of course, is that as agricultural   subsidies have increased so rapidly—they are now about 50 percent of net farm income—there’s   less concern about the value of land coming down    Clearly   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I wanted to make a few comments and then   ask a question  First, I’d say that with all of the concerns about froth in housing markets, I found   these presentations to be very informative, and I want to congratulate the people who spent a lot of   time preparing them  I thought they were all very good presentations  But I also found the   information comforting  We’ve all talked about the possibility of local housing bubbles and   regional housing bubbles, and clearly there are some in the United States  But we never really   looked at it on a national basis before  The net result for me was that I come away from the analysis   not feeling any worse than I did before and probably a little better   First, I thought it was very helpful to see quantified—I think this was in Josh’s memo—the   size of the potential bubble  He talked about a 20 percent drop in housing prices  But that was   equal to only about 30 percent of GDP as compared to the drop in equity prices we had, which was   more than twice that  Also, I had the feeling that appropriate monetary policy, as John said, could   mitigate much of the distress that might occur  Moreover, the credit risk associated with home   mortgages seems to be spread out across many institutions  Governor Bies said that a lot of analysis   is being done now, and we’ll want to see the results of the analysis that the Board and the   Comptroller are doing  But on the whole, the financial institutions seem to be in pretty good shape   The role of securitizing mortgages is to lay off risks to parties who are willing and able to bear the   risks Capital levels of the financial institutions are relatively high, so it appears that these markets   are performing their roles well  And in the event of a sharp drop in housing prices, the odds of a   spillover to financial institutions seem limited  And as I mentioned, it was helpful to hear the   suggestion that monetary policy can be effective in responding to a sharp drop—if there is one—in                                         June 29-30, 2005 48 of 234  housing prices  So I come away somewhat less concerned about the size and consequences of a   housing bubble than I was before   The question I had relates to what Governor Yellen was asking about—financial innovation   I was going to make a similar point  The fact is that there has been a great deal of financial   innovation in housing markets in the United States  The average person can borrow very easily on   his home these days  And I was wondering if there have been—or if it is possible to do—any   international comparisons on this  I wondered whether the price-rent ratios in other countries that   may not have had the same degree of financial innovation we’ve had differ substantially from ours    Yes    But you can’t really associate it with the degree of financial innovation   that we’ve had in the United States because of this great variability?  Is that what you’re saying,   Karen?    Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  In recent weeks we’ve heard a wide variety of   views about business conditions in the Seventh District  Most sectors have good news as well as   some bad news but, overall, conditions are positive and seem consistent with an economy growing   near trend Evidently, accommodative policy is offsetting the drags from energy and the   international sector   Within manufacturing, heavy equipment producers continue to report strong sales growth    For example, all 21 of Caterpillar’s business units are above plan  This year some of their product   lines have sold out for 2006, and they have begun taking orders for 2007  In contrast, one of our   directors who is the CEO of a large diversified manufacturing company reports a surprisingly sharp   slowdown in orders, although he concedes that business had been growing at an unsustainably high   rate The Chicago Purchasing Managers’ Index, which will be released today, edged down from   541 in May to 536 in June   In retail, apparel sales are generally strong and mall traffic seems good, but a retailer in   home furnishings reported a marked slowdown in sales during the past six to eight weeks  In motor   vehicles, GM noted strong sales in response to its new marketing program  GM and Ford both   continue to forecast light vehicle sales of about 168 million units in 2005—the consensus forecast   from our recent auto outlook symposium had similar numbers for 2005—and they expect sales to   remain near this pace in 2006   Labor markets continue to improve  Temporary-help firms report that growth is moderate,   not spectacular They say demand is soft for low-skilled workers, but it is stronger for professional,   technical, and clerical workers  And average temp wage and benefit increases have held steady in   recent weeks                                            June 29-30, 2005 110 of 234  The news on the price front is similar to what we’ve seen in the last few meetings, with   increases for plastics, rubber, and heavy machinery—and, of course, energy  Integrated steel   producers are burdened by high coke and iron ore prices  In contrast, steel scrap prices have fallen   35 percent from their peak in November of last year, which reduced the costs for the mini mills   Turning to the national outlook, since our last meeting we’ve learned that the soft patch was   temporary, as many of us expected  Furthermore, the core inflation numbers improved but energy   prices moved up even further, as we’ve just been discussing   Looking forward, our outlook is very similar to the forecast in the Greenbook, with growth   slowing in the current quarter but picking up somewhat in the second half of the year  On balance,   we project that GDP will increase at a rate near 3½ percent both this year and next  The story   underlying this forecast is a familiar one  Accommodative monetary policy and the trend in   underlying productivity appear sufficient to offset the current drag from higher energy prices   On the inflation front, we don’t see broad-based resource constraints pushing up prices  The   pass-through of cost pressures to consumer prices has been modest  In fact, Mr Chairman, after   you left our board meeting two weeks ago, my directors gave me a hard time regarding the   suggestion that businesses had any pricing power at all  In addition, inflation expectations remain   contained, even with the most recent increase in energy prices  So we see core PCE price inflation   peaking at 2 percent this year and edging off a touch next year   Of course, we should not be too sanguine  It would be unfortunate if underlying core   inflation drifted above 2 percent, and there is some risk of that happening  Resource slack has   narrowed, as Dave Wilcox pointed out earlier  And given our uncertainty as to the true level of   potential output, we may already have closed most meaningful resource gaps  With oil prices   reaching $60 a barrel, we have to be very careful that inflation expectations do not increase  This                            June 29-30, 2005 111 of 234  could happen if we are perceived to be improperly monetizing the higher oil prices  Therefore, it   will be important for us to continue to remove policy accommodation in order to contain   inflationary pressures and inflationary expectations   So at this meeting, we should increase rates by 25 basis points  For the remainder of 2005,   we may need to increase rates more than currently expected by the futures markets  I agree with the   view expressed by some people during the chart show Risk management suggests that a path with   higher interest rates would be a better course for our policy than the one outlined in the futures   market  And given the risks to the inflation outlook, a flat federal funds rate of 3¾ percent   throughout 2006, as the markets expect, is simply too low   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation on both the language and   the increase in rates  I would just add two points  One, in the go-round there was a clear concern   that core inflation forecasts have gone up, and a number of people said that the forecasts were now   in a range that was at the upper end of their comfort zone  I’d be delighted if the forecasts come   down, but I think that’s a low probability  Second, to Ned’s point about the tautology, I can assure   him of one thing At some point the balance of risk statement will come out  [Laughter]  "
7790,2005-08-09,"  Could I add just one other point to that question?  The output gap is   smaller, essentially shrinking to almost nothing by the end of the year, and there’s less slack in   the economy  Does that factor into your answer to Tony’s question?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  There haven’t been many changes in our   region since the last meeting, so I’ll keep my comments about our region brief   Business conditions around the Seventh District are generally good, although we still lag   the nation Labor markets continue to improve gradually, and inflationary pressures remain   moderate Many of our contacts remarked that growth has come down from last year’s pace, but   they’ve also acknowledged that last year was unsustainably strong and that the current moderate   pace is more in line with long-run trends   Finally, Michigan is still struggling, due to its heavy reliance on the Big Three   automakers  The Big Three indicated that the reaction to their latest incentives, which succeeded   in pulling down inventory significantly, as David mentioned, was larger than they had expected    Nonetheless, they told us they were only raising their sales outlook for the year as a whole by   100,000 or 200,000 units They also said that they would be fairly conservative about increasing   production; this gets to the payback we talked about before   Turning to the national outlook, the recent data confirmed that the economy is on solid   footing We expect growth to be somewhat above potential over the rest of this year  This   represents a modest strengthening of our forecast since June  And with the unemployment rate at   5 percent, it is likely that the current degree of resource slack is small  The moderation in the   recent monthly core inflation data is a positive development  However, the upward revisions to   core PCE inflation are a serious concern  Apparently, inflationary pressures were higher than we   thought when we introduced our “measured pace” language                   August 9, 2005 33 of 110  At our last meeting, I was concerned about the possibility of core inflation running above   2 percent sometime over the next couple of years  Now it turns out that we’ve already been   having inflation at that pace  This, of course, includes both market and nonmarket inflation but I   don’t think you can discount the nonmarket inflation  As Janet said, we now have additional   data And I think the point is, in reference to Tom’s question, that the forecast for core inflation   has changed now It used to be that inflation in 2006 was coming down from the rate in 2005,   and now, of course, it’s going up   Looking ahead, given the policy assumption in the Greenbook, we think the inflation   forecast is reasonable and that the risks to the outlook are balanced  But I am uncomfortable   with the outlook I’d like to see inflation stabilizing below 2 percent much sooner  I agreed   strongly with the Chairman’s arguments at the last meeting about the asymmetric policy costs   surrounding the inflation forecast And at the higher rates now built into the Greenbook, we   could face an even greater risk of a disappointing increase in inflationary expectations  In that   case, reestablishing price stability would require much tighter policy than markets currently   expect   I’m also concerned about the large amount of liquidity chasing financial deals  In the   early stages of our accommodative policy, businesses were extremely cautious and many capital   investments were deferred  Liquidity flowed into mortgages and into housing  Now   corporations are flush with cash, competition among lenders is intense, money is flowing rapidly   into private equity funds, and banks continue to relax lending terms  I think we may be   approaching the point in the lending cycle where investors tend to overreach and make bad   investments  We can help counter this by removing policy accommodation at a sufficient pace                                   August 9, 2005 34 of 110  And given firms’ buffers of cash, I don’t see much risk of choking off productive investment   projects if we raise rates to levels somewhat higher than markets currently expect   So how does this all add up?  Given the good prospects for growth, but with some   asymmetric policy risks, I continue to think that we should raise rates until we are comfortably in   the middle of the neutral range  To me, this means reaching a fed funds rate of about 4½ percent   before we pause Of course, we will continue to watch the incoming data  If either inflation or   growth comes in much lower than expected, we can stop earlier—or we can do more if   necessary Finally, it’s pretty safe to say that this is not the meeting for us to change our policy   strategy So I favor a 25 basis point increase today, and I’ll hold off my comments on the   language until later      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation  On the   word “gradual,” I actually would like to see it come out, too, but I don’t feel that strongly about   it My logic was this  My recollection is that we put the word “gradual” in after a very weak   May employment report that was originally 73,000 in payroll jobs and was revised up to   117,000 In June we had an increase of 164,000 after the revisions  In July the number was   181,000 And if you look at the private payrolls, something close to 181,000 has been a constant   for a long period of time, with all of the revisions that have taken place  So I, too, think we   could drop the word “gradually,” though I suppose we could wait for one more employment   report to see if that number is strong and take the word out next month  But I’d prefer to take it   out today if possible  "
7813,2005-09-20,"  I wanted to ask you a question about inflation expectations, which is a   key part of the forecast, as you described In the Greenbook, you say that you assume “surging   energy costs and other factors have caused inflation expectations to drift up since 2003”  And   then you have the alternative scenario in which inflation expectations deteriorate more sharply   than in the baseline forecast Could you just elaborate on this a bit?  What are the other factors?   And what’s the time horizon you’re talking about for these expectations to play out?  Also, how   does this work its way into the wage and price dynamics in the economy?    So you have core inflation actually going up next year, in 2006, and   then it comes down a bit in 2007    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall, the fundamentals in the Seventh   District continue to improve, although we are still underperforming the national economy  Prior   to Katrina, most of our contacts thought that their businesses were expanding at rates consistent   with the long-run trends in their industries One exception was the motor vehicle sector  The   size of the drop in sales in August was a disappointment to automakers, but not a surprise  They   also complained about the effect of gasoline prices on demand, particularly the shift in sales   away from big SUVs toward more fuel-efficient but less profitable models    When we asked our contacts about the impact of Hurricane Katrina, they reported several   different kinds of effects Some noted increased activity in response to the storm  A number of   firms in our District received orders for items such as RVs, construction materials, heavy   equipment, and appliances  And Ford said that they were looking at increasing their fourth-  quarter production schedules to replace vehicles destroyed by the hurricane  But we also heard   some concerns that Katrina was depressing demand  For instance, two of our national retail                September 20, 2005 35 of 117  contacts noted some decline in activity, which they attributed to higher energy prices,   uncertainty, and a CNN effect High- and low-end stores were reported to be doing okay, but   specialty retailers were taking a hit   Katrina also has led to some cost increases in our District  Grain elevators are paying   more to work through transportation disruptions and to dry crops in storage  We also heard   concerns that the diversion of resources to the Gulf Coast will drive up the cost of construction   materials and skilled tradesmen throughout the country  And several contacts noted increases in   costs for fuels, fertilizer, and shipping Of course, not all of the cost increases we have been   hearing about are related to Katrina  Indeed, a major retailer and one of our temporary help   contacts commented that wage pressures had increased notably at the national level     Turning to the national outlook, the data we had in hand prior to Hurricane Katrina   pointed to a solid expansion in activity  We all know how devastating Katrina was in terms of   the misery it caused the people of the Gulf Coast  Nonetheless, although the uncertainty is great,   the hurricane’s effects on the national economy likely will be short-lived  Even in the near term,   the Greenbook baseline projection doesn’t have Katrina reducing GDP growth below trend; and   certainly by early next year the hurricane should have a net positive effect for growth, given the   large federal spending coming on line   With regard to inflation, the July and August readings on core prices were good, but even   so the Greenbook forecast for core PCE inflation next year has been raised to 2¼ percent  Last   time many of us were concerned that core inflation was running at the upper end of the range   consistent with price stability, and now the outlook has deteriorated  As discussed in the                      September 20, 2005 36 of 117  Greenbook, and as we were talking about earlier, one major reason for this increase in the   inflation forecast is the expected pass-through of higher energy and distribution costs   Another important risk is faster compensation growth  Both compensation per hour and   the ECI are projected to increase significantly next year, and this seems consistent with the   anecdotes I noted earlier about wage pressures  These pressures are of particular concern at this   stage of the cycle because we can’t expect continued outsized gains in productivity to hold down   unit labor costs Some cost increases may be absorbed by lower profit margins, but there is a   risk that they may show up in higher prices as well   With the outlook for inflation already higher, and with so much liquidity in the financial   system, the cost of excessive policy accommodation could be significant  So at this point, we   should continue to increase rates until they are safely in the neutral zone    I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  And having lived   through the ’70s and played some part in economic policy in those days, I just remember that it   was not pretty  "
7835,2005-11-01," David, I had a question for you about the forecast that activity is going to   slow in the second half of ’06 and ’07  You talked about the reasons for the slowdown, which were   tighter monetary policy, a slowing in house price appreciation, and diminishing fiscal stimulus  In   the Monday morning briefing, you threw in the stock market as well—waning impetus from   household wealth in terms of both the stock market and the housing components  I thought the   Greenbook had an assumption of 6 percent growth in the stock market per year  I wonder if you   could talk about that   So when you look at those two factors, which is more important?   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Seventh District economy expanded at a   somewhat better pace since the last meeting, though it is still lagging the rest of the country    However, for the Chicago economy, particularly the South Side [laughter], it was the best October   in 88 years! President Fisher and I had a side wager, but I’ll let him fill you in on the details of that   In our contact calls for this round, energy prices were a pervasive concern    So far they’ve had a limited effect on consumer spending, but our contacts worry that high heating   bills will take a bigger bite out of sales in the coming months  In contrast, we’re seeing the impact   on costs right now Nearly every contact reported pressures from higher energy prices  There are   many examples, but here’s one that seemed a bit more surprising than others  A large specialty   retailer noted that the wholesale cost of furniture had increased due to higher prices for polyfoam,                                        November 1, 2005 29 of 114  which is a petroleum derivative  He said that in 30 years in the furniture business, this is the first   time that the stuffing cost more than the fabric or the frame  [Laughter]   Labor markets are also starting to generate cost pressures  For example, both Manpower and   Kelly report signs of tighter labor markets  These contacts say that many firms, after having been   very cautious about hiring, now feel they have pushed productivity growth as far as it can go and,   accordingly, finally feel they need to hire more permanent employees, particularly in office jobs    Our contacts see this as a further sign that firms are more confident about demand  One of the   staffing services firms said that they are paying higher wages and also spending more on recruiting   and retention bonuses  And several of our directors report that they’re budgeting larger salary   increases for 2006, in the range of one-half to a full percentage point higher than this year   The consensus among our contacts was that only a portion of these higher costs has been   passed through to prices, at least so far  Several reported that labor costs are mostly eating into   margins, which is what we’ve been expecting  But more price increases may be coming  A home   goods retailer noted that they had set their current list prices last spring  When they decide how to   price their products for next year, they’ll take into account the fuel cost outlook at that time   There has been no let-up in the auto industry’s woes  Our contacts say that higher oil prices   seem to have frozen consumers, and showroom traffic is down  There have been some interesting   developments with regard to labor costs in the auto industry  GM’s recent renegotiation of its health   care liabilities, if ratified, would be the UAW’s [United Auto Workers] first major mid-contract   give-back in history Ford and DaimlerChrysler will be demanding similar concessions  Indeed, it   might be that the Delphi bankruptcy has helped the industry at least get the ball rolling on some   meaningful restructuring of labor contracts  However, these are very contentious issues, and there’s                                   November 1, 2005 30 of 114  a clear possibility of a strike at Delphi that could seriously disrupt the auto industry, particularly   General Motors   For the national outlook, the last six weeks of data have confirmed that the dislocations from   Katrina and Rita have had a limited impact on aggregate economic activity  Outside the areas   affected by the hurricanes, labor markets are improving at a pace similar to earlier in the year  And   I’m getting favorable impressions of business sentiment from my contacts, which is a good sign for   hiring and capital spending  However, there is a risk that the recent sluggishness in consumer   expenditures and low levels of confidence may be foreshadowing a period of somewhat softer   growth in consumption  Households have further run down savings to maintain spending in the   face of higher energy prices, and it’s very difficult to gauge how this might influence consumption   going forward   With regard to inflation, the readings on core prices in the last quarter were good  Given all   that I’ve heard in recent weeks, though, it seems likely that past increases in energy and material   costs will soon begin to show through more clearly in prices downstream, as is forecast in the   Greenbook  Furthermore, labor markets have tightened  As I noted, many of my business contacts   are planning for larger increases in wages and benefits next year  They can only absorb these higher   costs in margins for so long  Finally, there’s a chance that increases in costs and prices will result in   a meaningful rise in longer-run inflation expectations, which would be a risk to the longer-run   Greenbook forecast     All of these risks add up to increasing the funds rate by 25 basis points again today  Looking   ahead, I think we should continue tightening  At least we are comfortably in the middle of a neutral   range, and there’s a possibility we’re going to have to go further  There’s a good deal of uncertainty   about how to quantify the equilibrium funds rate and the degree of policy accommodation  The                                     November 1, 2005 31 of 114  Bluebook suggests that a 4 percent nominal funds rate might be the midpoint of the range, but I’m   personally skeptical that the rate is that low  This is going to be an important issue for us to   consider going forward  I’m glad that we at least started the discussion earlier today, and I hope   we’ll continue it later in the meeting   Don’t underestimate it  [Laughter]    Vincent, I had a question on a different part of this  You raised the issue of   whether you should use the inflation projection in your calculation of the equilibrium federal funds   rate instead of the backward-looking inflation numbers that you use  I was wondering if you could   elaborate on that a bit I certainly would think that the forecast would be a better measure to put in   here than the backward-looking figures  What is the argument or the logic for putting the   backward-looking inflation numbers in there?   Maybe I misstated my question  I’m not talking about an inflation   expectations forecast but the inflation forecast you have  Why not put that in the model?   You probably did  Thank you   Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation on the rates and I support   your plan to review the language, as we’ve all talked about here or, as you put it, to continue our   ongoing discussion of the language going forward   Just a comment on the point—I forget who said this but I think it was Tim—that the statement   speaks for itself and the minutes speak for themselves  I agree completely with that And I think it   is important, as we give talks and answer questions, that we make it clear that our comments   represent our own personal views  They are not interpretations of the minutes  They are to be read   as “In my view, X or Y…”  I think that is a very important distinction to make going forward   Let me add just one final point  I, too, am concerned about inflation, as we all are around this   table  And I must say that I think the costs of inflation coming in above the Greenbook forecast   now outweigh the costs of inflation coming in below the Greenbook forecast going forward  "
7858,2005-12-13,"  We’re a resilient group, Mr Chairman  [Laughter] We don’t get   discouraged easily   Developments in the Seventh District have been mixed  The data released since our last   meeting indicate that manufacturing expanded at a moderate pace, while housing slowed and   employment continued to be weaker than the national economy  That said, our contacts seem to be   more upbeat  We continue to hear reports of labor markets becoming tighter, leading to potential   wage pressure  One of the national temporary help firms in our District mentioned that they are   increasingly unwilling to guarantee their clients an hourly wage rate for the entire year  Another   indicated that entry-level wages are going up 3 to 4 percent but that at the mid- to upper-skill level   wages are rising 5 to 7 percent   So I want to discuss two notable restructuring stories that point to the flexibility of the US   economy, albeit with government presence, notably on the pension front  One is United, which is at   the end game, and the other involves GM and Delphi, which is just beginning  United’s CEO is   optimistic about their prospects, as they expect to exit from bankruptcy in February  Their business   has continued to improve, and forward bookings suggest that strength should persist in the coming   months  United is gaining market share, while the industry overall is reducing capacity  Having   unloaded their pension liabilities on the PBGC and restructured their labor contracts and other   contracts, they expect to be able to compete with the low-cost carriers, such as Southwest                              December 13, 2005 27 of 100  Incidentally, the CEO of United admitted to me that Ned Gramlich was right  He said that Ned’s   position on federal loans forced United to do it the right way and to get the needed concessions from   workers, suppliers, and creditors, and assistance from the PBGC   Turning to the auto industry, as I mentioned last time, Delphi’s bankruptcy could result in   some meaningful restructuring of labor contracts  But there is a significant risk of a strike that could   seriously disrupt the auto industry, particularly General Motors  The negotiations are at a delicate   point with three key players—Delphi, the UAW, and GM  Approximately 15 to 20 percent of GM’s   parts come from Delphi, and GM has provided some guarantees to the Delphi workers for their   pensions and health care benefits  Clearly, the UAW is in a difficult position  A strike could well   cause Delphi to close its US operations and reemerge as an international firm with a far smaller   union workforce  A prolonged strike at Delphi could also hobble GM  In a worst-case scenario, this   could force GM into bankruptcy, which would hurt the UAW workers at both GM and at Delphi  As   a result, all three parties have a strong incentive to avoid a strike   There have been some positive signs  Delphi has postponed the deadline for an agreement   from December 16th to at least January 20th, and GM has given some concessions to Delphi on   prices  In my conversations with Rick Wagoner, the CEO of GM, he felt that while a lot of   antagonistic public statements have been made, the most likely outcome was that sanity would prevail   and a strike would be averted  But to avoid a strike, all three parties must throw something into the   pot  And he could not rule out some wildcat strikes at individual Delphi plants  Of course, a   settlement here does not solve GM’s longer-term problem, which is loss of market share  And, as   Dino mentioned, S&P downgraded GM’s corporate debt—not GMAC, but their corporate debt—   again yesterday by two notches                                   December 13, 2005 28 of 100  In terms of the near-term outlook for auto sales, the consensus of 28 forecasters at our recent   annual economic outlook symposium was for a small decline in sales in 2006 from this year’s   expected pace of 169 million units  GM and DaimlerChrysler’s forecasts were in line with this   expectation, but Ford’s internal forecast is considerably lower, at 16½ million units   Turning to the national outlook, economic activity continues to grow at a solid pace  Like the   Greenbook, we see growth at or slightly above trend over the next two years, and this is also roughly   in line with the consensus from our outlook symposium   The prospects for inflation present greater risks  There are two plausible scenarios going   forward  In the first one, the increased energy costs in 2005 lead to a transitory increase in core   inflation in ’06, but in ’07 core inflation comes back down  This is the Greenbook baseline scenario    In the second scenario, the increase in core inflation is more persistent, in part because there is less   slack in the economy in 2006  Furthermore, monetary policy has been accommodative for a long   time and there has been an accumulation of liquidity which ultimately could show through to higher   nominal spending  For these reasons, both inflationary pressures and inflationary expectations could   remain elevated for longer than envisioned in the first scenario   Our statistical forecasts, based on the Stock-Watson methodology, are more in line with the   second, less optimistic scenario  Both scenarios are plausible, but the costs of the second one are   higher So from a risk management perspective, we need to put adequate weight on the second   scenario This may require more tightening next year than assumed in the Greenbook  But at this   point, we just don’t know  Consequently, we should make sure that the statement does not give a   premature signal that we’re near the end of the tightening cycle  But, as you requested, Mr   Chairman, I’ll hold off further comments on the statement until the second round    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I guess I’m going to be an outlier here  Let me   start by first saying that I agree with the 25 basis point increase  As for the language, I think everyone   in the room agrees that we don’t know at this time what the path of policy is going to be next year    The data and the forecasts are going to determine that  We’ve said this many, many times  So to me   the objective of the statement is to give us maximum flexibility at this point and not lock us into one   course of action or another  It should not give the impression that we’re necessarily very near the end   of the tightening cycle   I agree with your comments in that I think the risks are skewed toward the need for more   tightening, and I think we have to be very careful at this point for the reasons that you mentioned  To   me alternative B in the Bluebook goes much of the way toward accomplishing this  I think it was   artfully put together     Now, to my ear—and I emphasize “to my”—the phrase “some further measured policy   firming” might be interpreted as implying that the sequence of rate hikes is nearly over  There’s a   possibility that it’s nearly over, but I don’t think there’s any assurance that it will be  So my   preference is to just say “further policy firming” without either “some” or “measured”  But of the two   words, if we take out one, I would take out “measured” at this point  “Measured” is now interpreted                                      December 13, 2005 76 of 100  in a way that I think is different from what we originally intended  Now its primary meaning is only a   25 basis point increase at the next meeting, and according to Vincent’s memo, the market seems to   think there’s a very high probability of two more increases  So in my judgment, since we’re now   making major changes in the statement, this is a good opportunity to remove the term “measured”  I   think it has outlived its usefulness   As of today, we will have increased the fed funds target thirteen times in a row by 25 basis   points  So our statement signals further policy tightening, certainly, at the January meeting  And it’s   difficult for me to understand, after we’ve moved the funds rate up thirteen times in a row by 25 basis   points how market participants would expect us to increase it in January by more than 25 basis points,   even without the term “measured” in there  So in my judgment, this is the ideal time to take it out   Well, I’ve thought about both sides of this a great deal, and I understand   that argument I just think we’re at the point where it’s better to get all the changes behind us, so I’d   do it now That’s a judgment call   If I could guarantee that, I wouldn’t be here!  [Laughter]  "
7878,2006-01-31,"  With restraint, Mr Chairman, most of our contacts this round were   positive about current business conditions  However, they were cautious about the prospects for   ’06, largely because they didn’t see any obvious drivers for growth   With regard to current conditions, national labor markets appear to be solid  Both of the   temporary-help firms headquartered in our District reported that their business was very good  Of   course, they mentioned that it was softer in the Midwest, primarily because of the problems of the   Big Three automakers and their spillovers and because of suppliers in the regional economy  One   mentioned that Michigan was the only state in which he had seen a drop in the demand for business   and technical workers  I mentioned last time that things could get worse if the Delphi negotiations   result in a strike, and all three parties—Delphi, UAW, and GM—are talking  Delphi has toned   down its rhetoric, and the deadline has now been pushed back to February 17   January 31, 2006 29 of 106    Turning to cost and price pressures, wages and benefits continued to increase at a moderate   pace  With regard to other costs, I heard the usual concerns about prices for energy and energy-  related inputs in shipping, but the reports about other material costs were mixed  There was one   interesting case in which capacity considerations were showing up in higher prices, and that’s the   airline industry  United reported that the reduced capacity in the industry has made it easier for   them to raise prices, particularly when it comes to passing through fuel costs  And, as you know,   they are scheduled to exit bankruptcy shortly   As I mentioned in the past, I’m concerned about the high amount of liquidity circulating in   financial markets  For example, one of our directors who heads a major private equity firm noted   that such funds were having no trouble attracting investors  He said that the amount of new money   invested in private equity firms is expected to expand 50 percent this year, and there is a slightly   ominous look to some of the new investors, such as underfunded state pension funds that are   “reaching for return,” as he described it  Similarly, early last week we held our semiannual meeting   of academics and local business economists, and I heard comments about unusually high liquidity   levels from several economists who work for investment firms and commercial banks  And as we   all know, risk spreads are quite low by historical standards  So I worry that there’s a lot of money   chasing investments out there, and that this may have driven the price of risk down too far   In the national outlook, even with the weak fourth-quarter numbers we continue to expect   that economic activity will expand at a solid pace similar to that in the Greenbook  We see growth   at or slightly above trend over the next two years and the unemployment rate remaining around   5 percent  Of course, if the fourth-quarter sluggishness spills forward, we would have a more   complicated set of issues to deal with, but I agree with the staff and expect that growth will bounce   back this quarter  With regard to prices, we think that core PCE inflation will average close to   January 31, 2006 30 of 106    2 percent over the forecast period  The outside economists at our meeting last week generally   agreed with this outlook, although a couple predicted that GDP growth would fall somewhat below   3 percent in 2006   Most of these economists thought that we would raise the fed funds rate to 4¾ to 5 percent   and then go on hold  As always, we’re going to have to take a hard look at the data and forecasts   before we decide what to do  Inflation could moderate further  We’ve been pleasantly surprised at   firms’ ability to absorb cost shocks  If they continue to do so, we could be looking at core PCE   inflation rates heading down this spring  In that event, inflation risks would be diminished, and   there would be fewer risks in ending the current rate cycle  But there’s a good chance that recent   cost increases will pass through, and we’ll experience a repeat of last winter’s uptick in core   inflation  Moreover, I can see some plausible outcomes for growth that would pressure resource   utilization  And in that event, we’d be looking at a forecast for core inflation that was stuck above   2 percent  I think this would be a problem  With inflation remaining at such rates, we could begin   to lose credibility if markets mistakenly inferred that our comfort zone had drifted higher  When we   stop raising rates, we ought to be reasonably confident that policy is restrictive enough to bring   inflation back toward the center of our comfort zone, which I believe is 1½ percent  And as I read   the long-run simulation in the Bluebook, it seemed to say that the funds rate needed to rise a bit over   5 percent by late 2006 to bring core inflation down to 1½ percent within a reasonable period  So for   today, we should move forward with an increase of 25 basis points, and we should allow ourselves   enough flexibility so that policy can either stop or continue moving, as the situation warrants    Mr Chairman, during your tenure the FOMC has been successful in   anchoring long-term inflation expectations that are appropriately at low levels, and I think we want   to make sure we maintain that legacy going forward  I continue to be concerned about the   possibility that inflation will move up and run above 2 percent for an extended period of time  So   I’m not certain how long we could experience core inflation of more than 2 percent without having   inflation expectations rise   But I can agree with your recommendation on the statement  I think it does enable us to be   flexible going forward as to what we’re going to do and does allow for the possibility that we might   have to move higher than the Greenbook assumptions  And I agree on postponing the decision on   the broader question of what we vote on at the meetings  Finally, in the spirit of less is more, I just   January 31, 2006 76 of 106    want to thank you for your service to the Fed and thank you for your service to the nation and say it   has been a great privilege to work with you  "
7902,2006-03-27,"  I just want to ask a question related to what Jeff Lacker was asking   before  I focused just on the alternative simulations  I focused on the greater cost pressure   simulation, which had in the second half of ’06 core PCE inflation going up to 26 percent and yet   the fed funds rate was going up only to 51—01 over the baseline  And this just did not seem to   track with my intuition as to what we would be doing as a Committee if, in fact, we had such high   rates of core PCE inflation in the second half of this year  Now, I realize that you said this is based   on history and that this is what the FOMC has done in the past, but I would hope that we wouldn’t   do it in the future  [Laughter]  I was wondering whether there is some other way to specify the   policy response that might be more helpful to us as we consider what we would do in the future    Well, I know we have not specified an inflation goal, but I certainly think   this could be below 26 percent because this actually has real rates coming down, as you point out in   the alternative simulation    Thank you  President Guinea Pig right here  [Laughter]  The two hands   are for comments?    And one hand is just for recognition    Okay  No clarification questions  [Laughter]    Okay  Well, most of my contacts this time were upbeat about current   conditions  Though the Midwest continues to underperform the rest of the nation, the US   economy seems to remain on solid footing  So we tried to assess whether the strength in January   and February was just a transitory bounceback from the fourth quarter or whether it represents some   persistent forward momentum  And while a few contacts expressed concerns about higher energy   prices and softening housing markets—as we were just discussing—most pointed to an economy   with substantial staying power  A bit of good news is that the Chicago purchasing managers’ index,   which will be released on Friday, will show a significant increase—from 549 to 604   The persistent momentum in the economy appears to be creating some pressure on   resources  One example is the airline industry  Business and leisure travel are at very high levels,   with strong bookings for the past few months  Load factors are at near-record highs, in part   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 32 of 167       reflecting a reduced capacity in the industry  There continue to be more reports of fare increases,   and surprisingly the increases are now being led by the low-cost carriers   We’re hearing about tightening labor markets  Manufacturers continue to have difficulty   finding skilled workers  In the temporary-help area, Manpower—headquartered in our District—  said that wage growth is accelerating nationally  Three months ago wages were basically flat on a   year-over-year basis  Now they’re expecting increases of 4 to 5 percent in the second quarter of this   year  Kelly Services, also headquartered in our District, reported steady nationwide increases in the   3 percent to 4 percent range  But both companies noted that labor markets were still nowhere near   as tight as they were in the late ’90s   Speaking of labor markets, to update the GM–Delphi–UAW saga, Rick Wagoner, General   Motors’ CEO, thinks that the GM buyout plan will take the heat off the poor Delphi–UAW   relations, lessening the chance of a strike there  He expects a significant number of GM and Delphi   workers to sign up for the plan  This will allow them to reduce the size of their workforce more   quickly  One aspect of this agreement that parties are not publicizing widely, for obvious reasons, is   that GM and Delphi should have more flexibility in hiring temporary workers and outsourcing in   the future  The temporary workers will have lower wages, and they won’t have the full GM benefit   package   Turning to the outlook, I feel that the near-term risks to the forecast have changed somewhat   since our last meeting  On the growth front, I had previously thought that high energy prices and   sticker shock from heating bills might damp spending substantially  And on the price front, I was   concerned that pass-through of higher energy prices and other costs could boost core inflation and   feed through to inflation expectations  Neither risk has materialized so far  Private domestic   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 33 of 167       demand appears to be growing at a solid pace  The recent price news has been favorable, and   inflation expectations have moved little   So what are the risks now?  I do not see many immediate downside risks to growth; to the   contrary, I personally think that the risk may have tilted to the upside  It’s true that housing appears   to be moderating, but the softening seems to be happening much as we expected it to  In contrast,   consumption growth continues to be quite strong  This may be a signal that households are more   confident about their permanent income prospects, perhaps because of healthy labor markets and the   strong underlying productivity growth  If so, then we could be in for some continued robust   consumer spending  In addition, growth abroad has improved  Notably, Japan and Europe are   showing some life  Thus, we could see more demand emanating from abroad  So in the short term,   growth will likely exceed potential  But given a funds rate path like that in the Greenbook, which I   would characterize as a touch restrictive, my outlook and the Greenbook’s get growth back to   potential by 2007     Despite the recent good readings on inflation, the current strength of the economy is   showing through in our simple indicator-based forecasts of inflation  We run about two dozen   forecasting models that encompass common statistical indicators of future inflation  These are not   structural models  They are simple regression forecasting models that use only current data, and   they have no explicit conditioning assumptions regarding future policy, oil prices, or other such   factors  And this contrasts with a more structural methodology like the FRB/US model  Nearly all   of these indicator models predict some uptick in core inflation over the next two years—not a big   one but to something a bit above 2 percent in 2007  Looking ahead, these projections would   probably move down with a further string of good news about prices and more-balanced prospects   for resource utilization  Nonetheless, given the models’ forecasts and the fact that we currently are   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 34 of 167       operating with very little resource slack in the economy, I see a risk that inflationary pressures will   be somewhat greater than what is currently built into the Greenbook    Well, I think that, on the production side, the Big Three producers have   slowed down somewhat for this quarter and next quarter compared with last year  I think the sales   outlook for the industry is really pretty good  You know, it’s about 165–166 million for light   vehicles  And the big issue, of course, is the shift from the Big Three to foreign producers, which is   shifting output from the northern part of the Midwest to the southern states  So that’s the big, big   news in our District  In terms of the contribution to the overall economy, I don’t see any real   concerns here in ’06  On pricing, they say that they are trying to cut back on the discounts that they   have been giving, and they have cut back somewhat  But I think the proof will be in the pudding as   we get into this year as to whether they can continue that    I just want to ask Vince a question on the word “possible” in the third row   here  Could you elaborate on why you put that word in?  It just says, the way it said before, that   increases in resource utilization have the potential to add to inflationary pressures  I mean, there   have been increases in resource utilization    But capacity utilization is higher  The unemployment rate is lower    Yes  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor the 25 basis point increase and   the language in alternative B  I do not think this is the time to keep our rates at the current level, and   I don’t think it’s the time for us to give a signal that we are about to stop  The likelihood is that we   will probably have to go to 5 percent, but we do not know  As we said all along, it is going to   depend on the data   The second point I would make is that this will make fourteen consecutive 25 basis point   increases in the fed funds rate  So we have known for a long time, as we have gone down this path,   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 130 of 167       that when we wanted to stop or we thought we would want to stop we would have to give a signal to   the market  And I do not think this is the time to do it now  Maybe in May it will be  Again, it will   all depend on the data whether we will want to stop in May, but that is the time that we would give a   clear signal to the market   Now, if the market gets ahead of us, as some have been concerned about here, in the past the   Chairman of this Committee has given a signal of some sort between meetings, and we have always   had that option  The Chairman always has that option  Some people have raised the question about   whether we are hostage to the market  I personally don’t feel we are hostage to the market at all  At   some point the market will have to live with our decision, and if we are going to do something that   is different from what the market expects, so be it  But I certainly do not think that this Committee   is being held hostage to the market   On the statement, I thought Bill Poole’s philosophy of minimum changes until we are ready   to give a different signal is a very good philosophy, and in that regard I would say two things  First,   some people have suggested possibly tweaking number five, and I just do not see the real benefit of   doing that  That this may help change some expectations is a very subtle psychological point, and I   certainly would not want to go to the bank on that  We are much better off staying the way we are    Now, having said that, I bring up the word “possible,” which comes around and bites me in the tail a   bit because we did have “possible” in the January FOMC statement  So I’ll fold my tent on that    [Laughter]  I think we are free to use the word “possible” there in the interest of consistency    Second, on the statement itself  In the earlier version that was circulated to the Committee, some   specific data were referred to, and someone made the comment here that it is important for us to   explain to the public what data we are thinking about  I forget who said that  But I really agree with   Janet’s comment, and then Tom sent a note in too, saying that we want to keep the statement as   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 131 of 167       short as possible and then use the minutes for that purpose  The minutes, again, come out three   weeks after the meeting  We have accelerated them  We also use speeches, but certainly the   minutes are a perfect vehicle for elaborating on the statement itself  And I think that philosophy is a   very good one   Then I just wanted to say a few words about inflation and Fed credibility  We are all very   pleased with the low inflation numbers that we have seen so far, and a number of people have   mentioned the importance of Fed credibility and keeping inflation low  As we know, the   Greenbook forecast has core inflation going up above 2 percent, and I think we don’t know exactly   how long it would stay at that  We do not know if it is going to go above 2 percent, and we don’t   know how long it is going to stay above that level  But I am uncertain myself as to how long it   could stay above 2 percent without having an impact on inflationary expectations  This is just   something we have to take into account and say we want to be vigilant about  There is a lot of   uncertainty here  We just have to keep monitoring it   In terms of the real economy, the best forecast is that growth will be near potential or higher   this year  So I think we definitely want to maintain as much flexibility as possible in our statement   now to allow for the possibility that we may want to move even higher than the Greenbook   assumptions in the future  Again, it is going to depend on the data, as we have all said, and we just   do not know at this point, and I think the language in alternative B gives us this leeway    I agree with the statement  But just on President Poole’s suggestion for   putting those four points in the minutes, I want to say that I don’t think we should do it  I don’t   know what the process here would be  I mean, I don’t think we should say that the accommodation   has been largely removed in the minutes, which will come out three weeks after this meeting and   three weeks before the May meeting  I don’t see any benefit to it    I agree with everything that Cathy Minehan said  I think she captured   the reaction perfectly, that this meeting went very well  This is a point in the cycle when our   policy decisions are particularly difficult, but there have been many times when they have been   no-brainers  So maintaining some flexibility to have one-day meetings when we don’t need the   two-day meetings would be ideal     In terms of starting early, just this morning we had a meeting with Susan on the Basel   issues  We had a breakfast upstairs at 730, and I think we started at 730 and went to 830  You   could easily just have a breakfast right here at 730 for those who want it and start the meeting at   800  And the Presidents are all here anyway, so I don’t think any of us would mind starting that   early in the morning  "
7926,2006-05-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, wanted to ask about the alternative   simulation that President Lacker talked about, the greater pass-through with unanchored expectations  It   seems to give the impression that inflation is pretty controllable, and I have a bit more concern than that    You said in the scenario at the end that, beyond 2007, policy would yield a noticeable rise in the real   federal funds rate  I guess that the action is all after ’07 the way you have phased in this gradual   increase in inflation expectations of 50 basis points  So I guess I’ll start with the question, how does it   play out in ’08 and ’09?  What would be the cost in terms of output and price stability?  Then, of course,   expectations could rise more quickly  The increase wouldn’t necessarily have to be gradual over this   May 10, 2006 22 of 120    year and a half  What happens if inflation expectations rise more quickly, and what would the   implications be for beyond 2006 and 2007?     I found that Bluebook alternative simulation very helpful  I thought it was tied   together with the ones in the Greenbook  I found them together to be very helpful  It’s this inertia that   concerns me  Earlier in my career I was involved in fighting inflation, and once it gets out of control it   is very, very difficult to bring back under control    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Most of my business contacts indicated that   overall economic activity remains on a solid footing and that resource utilization has tightened further    Both of the major temporary-help firms headquartered in our District said that hiring remains strong   nationwide  They continued to say that skilled workers are in short supply  This topic was also on the   minds of our contacts in manufacturing and construction  As I’ve noted previously, we’ve heard a few   reports from manufacturers that labor shortages were causing delays in supplier deliveries  Strengthened   labor demand, however, has not yet spread to lower-skilled workers  So while wages for skilled   individuals continue to increase briskly, pay rates for other workers are up only modestly   May 10, 2006 33 of 120    We’re also seeing signs of pressure on nonlabor resources  Some of our contacts have run into   problems with the costs and availability of trucking and rail shipping capacity, and a manufacturer of   drilling equipment reported supply disruptions because its vendors were heavily backlogged  Several   contacts noted that price pressures have intensified for many commodities, as we’ve discussed before    Of course, everyone was talking about the surge in energy costs  Some retailers noted that sales had   slowed, and they attributed the softness to higher energy prices  Others were concerned about the   impact of energy going forward  In contrast, our manufacturing contacts reported that they generally   have no plans to scale back production in response to the recent increases   There is not much new to report on the Delphi negotiations  The period for Delphi workers to   sign up for early retirement is just starting  Delphi, General Motors, and the UAW hope that many will   accept the buyout  This would leave fewer union workers vulnerable to being laid off as Delphi   downsizes, which would make the negotiations easier for all the parties involved   On a final note, several of my directors continue to be concerned about the amount of liquidity in   financial markets  They say prices and terms for more and more deals are bordering on speculative   Turning to the outlook, we’ve had quite a bit of news since our last meeting  Much of it suggests   increased risks on the inflation front  Of course, the March reading on core inflation was just one   month, but the twelve-month change in core PCE inflation is now back up to 2 percent  And as   President Lacker said, the six-month change is now up to 24 percent  Moreover, energy prices have   jumped again  The dollar has weakened a bit more, and inflation expectations have risen     In response to the latest data, the forecasts from our indicator models of inflation have moved up   some  Currently, these project 2007 core PCE inflation between 2 percent and 24 percent  To be sure,   things are far from getting out of hand  Resource utilization measures currently are only modestly on   the tight side, and we are all well aware of the uncertainty surrounding those measures  Furthermore,   May 10, 2006 34 of 120    the recent ECI data suggest that wage pressures remain muted  That said, other measures of wage   growth have been rising   Looking at the markup of prices over labor costs, one would think that there’s plenty of room for   profit margins to absorb higher wages  But as Bill Poole suggested in the issue we discussed before, the   business people I talked to haven’t gotten that message  Their attempts to maintain margins in the face   of increasing costs represent an upside risk to the inflation outlook  So I agree with the upward nudge to   the Greenbook inflation forecast, but I’d go a bit further  Given the Greenbook path for the funds rate, I   think core inflation of 2¼ percent is a more reasonable point forecast for 2007   In terms of growth, the expansion still appears solid  The softening in housing that we have been   anticipating is more obvious now  There’s a possibility that moderation might turn to something bigger,   but I don’t see this as a large risk  Of course, $3-a-gallon gasoline should restrain demand somewhat,   and we’ll need to keep a close eye on how consumers respond to yet another hit to their purchasing   power  But employment continues to rise at a good pace, generating healthy increases in income, which   should support household demand  Businesses are supporting spending on capital goods, and growth   prospects abroad continue to suggest some optimism on export demand  So I think growth will average   around potential over the course of the projection period    Wait a minute  I have to make a two-handed intervention on that one    [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor the 25 basis point increase, and, generally,   the language of alternative B  But I do have some specific suggestions on it that I’ll mention at the end   of my comments   First, I want to say a few words about a topic that many of us have been speaking about publicly,   which is our price stability goals and our comfort zones for inflation  This talk is getting a lot of   attention, and my current thinking is that the zone is 1 percent to 2 percent on core PCE  The more we   use this language of a comfort zone or—as I think, Mr Chairman, you said in your comments—a zone   of price stability, the more it frames the public’s interpretation of our inflation outlook and our policy   moves  That’s not a bad thing, in general, but I am concerned that many analysts are interpreting this   comfort zone as a range of acceptable outcomes so that it doesn’t matter where we are within that zone   of indifference   I don’t view it that way  My preference is to see inflation moving toward the center of the zone,   like the Bluebook alternative simulation that we talked about before  For me, having our inflation   forecasts consistently run at or above the top end of my comfort zone is a problem  Market participants   will ratchet up their views of the zone, and our credibility is then going to suffer  I would hope that our   policy actions would be aimed at having inflation heading more clearly for the interior of that range—  subject, of course, to the constraints of our dual mandate   With regard to today’s decision, I certainly prefer that markets clearly understand that, if   necessary, we’re ready to move to a rate above 5 percent  I think the language in alternative B does that    I suggest one major change to it, which I think people would consider major, and that is in number 3    May 10, 2006 89 of 120    Number 3 now is, as I understand, exactly the same as it was last time  The phrase in there that really   concerns me is “and inflation expectations remain contained”  Bill Poole talked about the minutes   reflecting accurately the meeting, and I don’t think that statement accurately reflects the discussion at   this meeting  A lot of concern has been expressed here about inflation expectations—different degrees   of concern, but certainly the atmosphere is different from that in the last meeting in which we discussed   it  One way to deal with that is just to delete those five words and end the sentence with the word   “check”  Another would be to go back to the language we had before  I would go either way on that,   but I don’t think we should put that language in the statement    Mr Chairman, I like the change you suggest  The important point is for the   outside world to be aware that we recognize there has been a change in inflation expectations  I mean, if we   May 10, 2006 100 of 120    keep it exactly as we had it before, we look as though we are not aware of what is happening in the   marketplace  So I think your change is a very good one    I just had a question  It is a slight, minor change, but would it make any   difference if you took out the two words “emphasizes that” from number 4?    So it is intentional that those two words are in there  "
7952,2006-06-28,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have two questions  One is just a quick one   on steel since President Fisher mentioned exhibit 12 and you showed this big increase in China’s   steel capacity in ’05—much greater than the annual steel production increase—and I have heard   about this a lot  But steel prices in the United States are staying surprisingly high according to   industry observers, and they are expected to go higher this year  I was just wondering if you could   shed some light on what’s happening to the price of steel   The other question I have is broader  It’s really about the overall forecast  This is one of the   largest midyear revisions to the forecast that I remember seeing since I’ve been here, in the GDP   numbers particularly  Clearly, some of the data that have come in have been softer, but it seems to   be more than just that  There seems to be a change in the tone of the Greenbook that suggests some   reassessment of the underlying strength of the economy  That is the way I read it  But you know,   there is some good news here, too  Productivity growth remains solid  Real interest rates are just in   the middle of the neutral zone  Anecdotes I hear are really quite positive  So I felt a disconnect   when I read the Greenbook, and I was just wondering if you could elaborate on this a bit to help me   understand this change in tone of the Greenbook     Thank you     It is very different from what I am hearing from people     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our last meeting, uncertainty about the   outlook for both growth and inflation has increased  Clearly the inflation data are disappointing, but   let me first focus on economic growth  Here the key question is how much of the second-quarter   weakness is transitory and how much represents a more fundamental softening in activity  So with   regard to the consumer, we share the Greenbook’s assessment that increases in consumer   expenditures will recover somewhere close to a rate of 3 percent in the second half of this year    June 28-29, 2006 42 of 177     Qualitatively, this seems to be the assessment of our contacts as well  One, a major builder   and operator of shopping malls throughout the United States, said that retailers at malls have been   quite pleased with the first five months of the year  Although they are expecting slower growth in   the second half, they did not think that the falloff would be very large  The automakers report that   June sales are relatively soft but better than in May, and they kept their forecast for light vehicles for   the year as a whole around 166 million or 167 million units, which means they expect the second   half of the year to be similar to the first half  This was also the consensus of the twenty-four   industry analysts at our annual Automotive Outlook Symposium that we held last month   Looking at the fundamentals, like the Greenbook we think that growth in real income will   be adequate to support the projected pace of spending  Under the baseline path for oil prices,   energy prices should turn from a negative to a neutral factor for real income growth, though this is   certainly an area of great uncertainty  Also, tight labor markets should eventually generate   somewhat larger increases in wages, which should help offset the effects on overall income growth   of somewhat slower gains in employment  Here I should note that we do not think that the recent   slowdown in job growth is the start of a deterioration in the labor market  Our contact at Manpower   studied this issue recently in response to skeptical Wall Street analysts who thought that the labor   market was softening and that this would be reflected in a weakening temp sector  He studied forty   major markets and found no signs of cutbacks in hiring plans by his customers, and his business   continues to grow at a modest pace  Given our view of the trends in participation rates and other   factors, we think that the 100,000 per month gains in payroll employment that we have seen over   the past couple of months are consistent with an economy growing near potential, hence with little   change in labor market slack   June 28-29, 2006 43 of 177    Of course, housing markets are weakening  At the last meeting we were more pessimistic   than the Greenbook  This time, with its large revision, the Greenbook is slightly more pessimistic   than we are  However, the overall negative tone of the Greenbook seems a bit puzzling to me given   the current conditions that we were discussing earlier  After all, mortgage rates are not that high    The rate of house-price appreciation has not come down more than we expected  Still, current   conditions are softening  A contact from a major national builder, Pulte Homes, told us that their   new orders had dropped sharply and that the current high level of construction is being supported by   working off backlogs  Accordingly, he expected a more marked slowdown in building in 2007   In the business sector, the reports from the manufacturers outside autos were, in general,   very upbeat  Most indicated that orders and backlogs for investment goods were quite high  One of   my directors, who is from a large, diversified manufacturing firm and who has always been cautious   about future capital spending, said that demand for long-lead-time capital goods now is as strong as   he has seen in his thirty years in business  And the pickup in nonresidential construction is partially   offsetting the weaker activity on the residential side   Finally, financial conditions continue to be favorable  Indeed, given the recent increases in   inflation, real short-term interest rates are in the middle of the neutral range, as shown in the   Bluebook  Long-term borrowing costs are relatively low, and we still hear that there’s a lot of   liquidity flowing through the financial system  So we think the outlook for business investment   looks solid and somewhat stronger over the course of ’06 than the Greenbook forecast   To summarize our outlook for real activity, we think that the economy has somewhat   stronger underlying momentum than the Greenbook does, and we are looking for growth at a pace   of around 3 percent in the second half of this year   June 28-29, 2006 44 of 177    With regard to inflationary pressures, many of our contacts expressed concerns about input   costs  We heard numerous reports this round of manufacturers that were passing on material cost   increases to their customers  In the Chicago Purchasing Managers Survey, which will be released   this Friday, the prices-paid component shot up from 769 in May to 890 in June, and the overall   index moved down from 615 to 565   Capacity constraints also appear to be more common  For example, given industry   consolidation, airline load factors are very high, and one major carrier indicated that it had been able   to increase prices more than enough to cover higher fuel costs  We also received some reports that   shortages of skilled labor were holding back production  Still, there were few signs of accelerating   wage pressures   Of course, the incoming data on consumer prices have been disappointing, as Jeff Lacker   just said, and as a result our indicator model’s forecasts of core PCE inflation in ’06 were revised up   about 03 percentage point, to between 24 and 26 percent  The higher projection is from the model   estimated using data since 1967; the lower number is from the estimates using data only since 1984    We think inflation this year will come in closer to the 24 percent figure as some of the cost pass-  through that has already boosted prices runs its course   Looking to ’07, the model’s projections rose a tenth or two from the previous forecasts  The   prediction using the post-1984 sample is 21 percent, whereas the long sample projection is   26 percent  So in the absence of some good news on the energy or materials costs front, I do not   think that inflation will be headed into the bottom half of that range unless growth next year comes   in a good deal below potential  At 3 percent, my forecast for GDP growth in ’07 is a bit below   potential  My forecast for PCE inflation is 23 percent  This outlook is conditioned on my view of   appropriate policy, which is a slightly higher path for the funds rate than currently built into the   June 28-29, 2006 45 of 177    Greenbook because I feel that 24 percent inflation is too high, so I assumed that appropriate policy   should attempt to arrest this acceleration    Well, it’s brutal compared with last year at this time because they had an   employee-incentive pricing program last year, which they’re not going to have this year  It’s an   interesting situation because they say that Chrysler has announced that they’re going to have some   higher incentives  I spoke to the CEO of General Motors  He claims that they’re trying to hold the   line on these incentives and keep them below the very high level they’ve had these past few years;   they are not going to cut prices as they have in previous years  We’ll see whether they’re able to do   this, but that’s their stated position now    Just a factual question  Richard said that the sequence is that you   testify first and then the minutes come out  Is that accurate?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with the 25 basis point increase that   you proposed  Let me make a couple of comments  First, people have used the words “modest   restraint,” and “mildly restrictive”  If we are somewhat restrictive, it’s really not very restrictive    We have increased interest rates 75 basis points since January in nominal terms  If you adjust for   inflation, that’s 30 basis points  Also, if you look at chart 8 in the Bluebook and you look at the   current funds rate, because of the increase in inflation we appear to be a little below the   equilibrium real fed funds rate today  So I take Don’s point that long-term rates have gone up,   but on a historical basis they’re still quite low, as we all know   June 28-29, 2006 121 of 177     The second point is about the long-term targets  I realize that these are simulations and   that they can change, but when you look at the results of the simulations, they are disturbing   because we don’t reach either target  If you have a 2 percent target or a 1½ percent target, you   don’t reach it by 2010  So that certainly was disturbing to me when I looked at the results    I agree with the objective that people have stated  Our objective in the statement should   be to leave open the option for August as to whether we want to increase rates 25 basis points,   whether we want to pause, or whether we want to increase more or have another increase after   that  So we certainly should leave all those options open    In terms of the specific proposals on the table, I thought that Jeff Lacker’s two points   were very interesting  You could do both of them, or you could do one or the other  They both   accomplish the same objective  Gary made the point that he didn’t like the phrase “unwelcome”    You could say, “Readings on core inflation have been elevated in recent months, and that’s   inconsistent with price stability”  We could do something like that or “unwelcome”   One or the   other—Sandy favored the first sentence in number 4—accomplishes the same objective, but I   think including one would add to the statement  Finally, I agree with what everyone has said—  that the Chairman’s testimony, the minutes, and the data that come out are going to have a great   impact on the market’s expectations for what we do in August     Just one final little edit  If you go with alternative B, the first phrase in number 4,   “although the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to limit inflation   pressures,” doesn’t belong there  I don’t disagree with the phrase, but I don’t think it belongs in   number 4  It really belongs in number 3, and there is a way to work it into number 3 if we start   doing that  I just put a marker down that I’d suggest that edit if we get to that point  I think it’s   part of the rationale, not an assessment of risk  Thank you   June 28-29, 2006 122 of 177      I just want to clarify the point that Governor Bies and I were making  We   were suggesting that we move the first half of the sentence in number 4, the clause “although the   June 28-29, 2006 137 of 177    moderation in growth of aggregate demand should help to limit inflation pressures over time,” up to   the rationale part  In the last sentence of section 3, you could remove the word “however” and just   put that phrase right at the beginning of the sentence  I think the result still would have the same   continuity that you want to see in the rationale section, and I think it’s more of a rationale point than   an assessment-of-risk point    Of course, I understand the logic, but if you do put it in section 4, as   President Geithner said, it has a tendency to stay there  We have to see what it would look like in   future meetings as well  If you then take it out, you have to question why you are doing so    When will you announce the fact that we’ll have a two-day meeting in   October and December, and how will you explain it?  "
7978,2006-08-08,"  President Poole asked a significant part of my question, or he presented   a significant part of my question  [Laughter]  But let me ask you about the markup part of this    You know, we have always thought that there was a cushion for compensation to go higher, for   input costs to go higher, and for profit margins to shrink, and therefore we wouldn’t get any   pass-through into price increases  Those markups have remained incredibly high—I mean, profit   margins are very high  I was just wondering whether you think we should put less weight on this   August 8, 2006 13 of 158                                  factor going forward when we’re looking at our forecasts, given what we’ve seen in unit labor   costs, which you mentioned, and other changes in the forecast    And the unit labor cost trend hasn’t caused you to change your outlook   for the future either?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in the Seventh   District moderated in the second quarter in line with our expectations after a very strong first   quarter Most of my directors and business contacts believe that added caution is taking hold in   the economy  Some think that growth will be noticeably slower in the second half of the year,   and some believe that slowing will continue into 2007  However, my contacts are unable to   point to explicit examples, apart from housing, showing that such a marked deceleration   August 8, 2006 21 of 158                             currently is in train Indeed, many of the reports that we get are quite upbeat  For instance, one   of our national temporary help contacts said his indicators were pointing to a bounceback from a   weak second quarter, and he was seeing strong conversions from temporary to permanent status   One reason that some people were more pessimistic was that they believe the current   expansion is a bit, as they say, long in the tooth, and so the economy must be due for a period of   weakness Of course, the economic literature finds that the probability of an expansion’s ending   does not depend on the expansion’s current length  However, these comments could reflect   imbalances in the economy that increase exposure to adverse shocks  But except for housing,   any references to such imbalances are vague at best  Although it is not certain, the mixture of   reports may simply be indicative of the normal process of the economy’s moderating to growth   averaging near or a bit below potential  On the inflation front, we continue to hear reports of   cost pass-through and other price increases similar to those we’ve received in recent months   Turning to the national outlook, although growth moderated in the second quarter, GDP   growth for the first half was a solid 4 percent  The unemployment rate remains below 5 percent,   and the core PCE inflation rate has now been at or above 2 percent for more than two years  It   has to be said, in looking simply at the top-line data that form the basis of most Taylor rules, that   real activity is pretty good and inflation is too high  In this context, three related questions   guided my thinking on the outlook  First, are there important imbalances within particular   sectors that should concern us?  Second, is the list of exogenous downside shocks accumulating   to a point that the risks to growth outweigh those from deteriorating inflation?  Third, are the   current financial conditions restrictive or not?   Regarding sectoral imbalances, for some time we have assumed a marked slowdown in   residential investment, but other sectors do not seem to be outside normal ranges of variation   August 8, 2006 22 of 158                      associated with an economy that is growing close to potential  Business fixed investment last   quarter was weaker than we had thought, but the weakness appeared to largely reflect transitory   developments in volatile categories—communication equipment and transportation    Importantly, we don’t hear any stories of pulling back due to earlier overinvestment  On the   household side, the steady growth in the consumption of nondurables and services indicates that   households do not seem to be overly concerned about their longer-term prospects for income   growth So for now, I do not see any sectoral imbalances that would pile on the housing   adjustment and cause a more fundamental downshift in economic growth over the forecast   period   What about shocks?  Well, the list of downside shocks is troublesome  Energy prices   continue to surprise us on the upside Geopolitical risks have increased, particularly considering   developments in the Middle East  We now have some sense from businesses that animal spirits   may be making them more cautious  Currently, however, I think that this is more rhetoric than   action Still I think that all these factors deserve careful monitoring   Third, what about financial conditions?  When I was preparing for this meeting, I talked   to no one who thought that conditions are restrictive  The modal response continues to be that   financing is readily available and is fueling a lot of dealmaking  Ten-year Treasury rates are   under 5 percent Risk spreads are low If we want to assess the constraining effects of past   increases in the federal funds rate, we need to take into account the level of interest rates  In all   likelihood, the real funds rate has only recently reached neutral  Furthermore, we need to   consider the accommodation that we had put in place in 2003 and 2004  The core PCE inflation   data we now have for that period are about ½ percentage point higher than what we saw in the   real-time initially announced inflation rates that guided our policy decisions back then  So the   August 8, 2006 23 of 158                    unwelcome disinflation of 2003 was not as severe as we had feared at the time, and accordingly,   our policy was more accommodative than we thought at the time, which may have had   inflationary consequences The incoming data make the current inflation situation seem much   more troublesome  First, as we all know, the latest reading on core PCE inflation is 24 percent    That’s pretty high Second, the revised NIPA data indicate that core PCE inflation has been at or   above 2 percent since April 2004, as President Poole mentioned  The combination of these two   facts makes me more concerned that inflation expectations may soon begin to drift up  Finally, I   don’t see the forces in play that would make the policy assumption in the Greenbook restrictive   enough to put core inflation on a downward trajectory over the next 18 months  If the pass-  through was small on the way up, it seems likely to be small on the way down, and output gaps   that might be emerging will not alter inflation’s trajectories very much or very quickly with flat   estimates of Phillips curves    I have one question about the term “resource utilization”  It was in our   statement last time, and we took it out of many of the alternatives  I think David mentioned that   resource utilization was a bit tighter since our last meeting  I was wondering whether there was a   particular reason for taking it out of many of the options that we have to consider here    You do not have a strong view    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The incoming data have heightened my   concerns about inflation I think it’s true, as a number of people have mentioned around the   table, that inflation expectations have not moved up  The markets seem pretty confident that   we’re going to be successful in fighting inflation  But as Kevin Warsh said, the markets can be   pretty fickle We’re going to get some further bad news on inflation in the coming months, and I   hope the markets will maintain their confidence in the Federal Reserve  But their confidence in   us could change as the news continues to be bad in the coming months  Also, I think we have to   ask whether our failure for two years now to keep inflation inside what many of us have said is   our comfort zone—1 to 2 percent—is going to weigh eventually on the assessment of the   markets and their confidence in the Federal Reserve  I’m concerned that the public’s confidence   in us may begin to waver if we don’t express our readiness to tighten if inflation doesn’t head   down soon It’s not clear to me that we’ve put restrictive-enough financial conditions in place to   put inflation on much of a downward path  According to the Bluebook, the fed funds rate is   close to neutral In the Bluebook’s longer-run simulation, the optimum policy requires further   August 8, 2006 101 of 158                               rate increases to put us on the path to 1½ percent  We won’t get there just staying where we are   now   I realize it’s a very close call, and everyone has mentioned that; but on balance, I would   prefer to raise rates 25 basis points at this meeting  I won’t repeat all the comments that Cathy,   Charlie, and Jeff made  I think they were very persuasive  It would surprise the markets, but we   shouldn’t be doing what the markets expect us to do  We should be doing, as someone said,   what’s right for the economy and for the American people  It doesn’t appear that an increase   will be the consensus coming out of this meeting  I’d just add that, if we do pause, it’s not going   to be easy for us to start again  I don’t think we should kid ourselves about that  We’re going to   be accused of whipsawing by the markets, and we’ll take a lot of criticism  So we’re going to   have to take a very tough stand if we decide to raise rates again  It’s not going to be easy, and   we should just be prepared to do that Looking ahead, I’d say that if we determine that factors   are not reducing growth too much and if inflation does not appear to be moderating, then we’re   going to need to increase rates further to coax inflation back toward price stability  We have to   make it clear in our public statements that we’re prepared to do that   If we do go with the pause, then I certainly agree with Don Kohn’s recommendation that   we should use the language from section 3 of alternative C and move it to section 2 of   alternative B  To omit the reference to high levels of resource utilization, when we’ve had it in   our past statements, would be a serious error    I agree with Randy on this It would be very strange to take housing   out now because it was in last time and because it is so important to the future of the economy    The productivity question is a close call On balance, I’d leave it out because it does raise the   whole question about unit labor costs      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll comment on just three areas, in the   spirit of being general here  First, on the goals—I thought the goals that you put into the   document you distributed were very good  They were very well stated and had an appropriate   August 8, 2006 121 of 158                         balance I didn’t think that they constrain open discussion at the meetings  The communication   of uncertainty and conditionality is difficult, but part of our goal should be to do it better     Second, on the quantity of information and the forward-looking content—that whole   series of questions that you asked—I’d divide my comments into two parts  One, if we do go   with some type of quantitative guideline, we will need to release more information  We’d need   something like an inflation report, maybe quarterly, such as other central banks have, just to   explain and elaborate on the guideline and how the economy was doing versus that quantitative   guideline I don’t think we could just stay with the twice-a-year report that we give now in   detail   Third, we should talk about longer-term forecasts than we do now  That’s an important   part of this In fact, if this Committee decides not to go with quantitative guidelines, we could   accomplish many of the objectives by just having longer-term forecasts for the economy  If we   did these longer-term forecasts, we’d have to address many of the issues that are discussed in the   sections here—the policy assumption question, for example  We now do that based on   appropriate policy, but we could do that in different ways  But the longer forecasts would allow   us to convey policy goals, to discuss expected paths to achieving those goals, and to take into   account the range of opinions regarding the paths and goals without necessarily having us agree   to a quantitative guideline At this point, I’m agnostic on the question of whether we should   have a quantitative guideline  I should say that I really haven’t decided yet and that the topic is   for further discussion  In any case, longer-term forecasts would be one option to consider if we   did not go with a quantitative guideline Of course, if we did go with a quantitative guideline,   we could also have longer-term forecasts  But I think the longer-term forecasts would help us   improve our formulation of monetary policy, either with or without a quantitative guideline   August 8, 2006 122 of 158                               I want to mention just one other point about the policy conditioning  I hope someone   could do research on the Bank of England approach  Don, I know you’ve been there They   present a forecast conditioned on the market expectations for policy interest rates  They also do   an alternative based on an unchanged rate path  They’ve given us an example of one case in   which the forecast based on the market showed that inflation would be outside the guideline   when they published it, and the market immediately reversed its view as to what the Bank of   England was able to do on policy without the Bank’s saying anything  Just the publication of   that forecast itself accomplished a lot of their objective  Of course, we’d have to be explicit   about the technical details underlying the market expectations of the forecast, but that’s sort of a   technical part of this   We’re off to a good start, and I particularly like the goals that you set forth  "
8001,2006-09-20," I wanted to ask you about this “less inflation persistence” alternative   scenario, which as you said brings inflation down to 16 percent by 2008  As I read the Greenbook   and then the alternative simulation memo, I saw two things—(1) less persistence and (2) an   expected inflation outcome of 16 percent  It seemed as though that outcome was built into the   scenario; and I was wondering, given that we have had core inflation over 2 percent for more than   September 20, 2006 24 of 132                                   two years now, whether that is a reasonable assumption to put in there  What would the outcome   look like if you had built into that scenario an assumption of 2 percent instead of 16 percent?    So you assume that there is no inflation persistence and that we just go   down to this longer-term average   So it is just based on the assumption, and the key is that assumption of 1½   percent or 2 percent    Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  My contact calls and director reports this   round point to moderate growth in overall economic activity  Both nationally and in our District,   housing is weak  Domestic auto production is slowing from last year, but activity in other sectors   remains on a solid footing   Starting on the downside, one of our Detroit directors from Pulte Homes characterized the   slowdown in housing as broad and deep, and he said that they face a rocky road for the next year or   two With regard to motor vehicles, GM noted that their lower production in the fourth quarter   largely reflected the retooling of five plants for their new truck platform, reduced low-margin sales   to rental fleets, and lowered desired inventory holdings by dealers because of higher interest rates   Both GM and Ford are trying to reduce their reliance on sales to rental fleets   In contrast, a wide array of capital goods manufacturers reported continued strong growth    The two major temporary help firms headquartered in the District pointed to modest but steady   growth in billable hours  Importantly, no contact was worried about a protracted slowdown in the   economy Indeed, my directors were quite optimistic  This is an important change from six weeks   ago, when we were hearing comments that the expansion had become long in the tooth and   concerns that we were headed for a period of sustained weakness  This more upbeat assessment   was in line with the sentiments I heard at the International Manufacturing Technology Show, which   was held in Chicago earlier this month with over 90,000 attendees from more than 100 countries    Now, I did not have a chance to talk to all of them, [laughter] but the ones I did talk to were quite   optimistic about increasing demand for US-made high-tech capital equipment  The most amazing   and impressive new technology that I saw was something that looked like a large ink-jet printer, but   it spit out metal dust to fabricate intricate parts without traditional tools or dies This was really   quite unusual and impressive   September 20, 2006 34 of 132                         Turning to inflation, there was little change in most reports regarding price pressures  Labor   compensation continued to increase at elevated rates  Our contacts from temporary help firms noted   a further step-up in wages for highly skilled workers, whereas our retail contact said he was paying   8 to 10 percent more for entry-level sales personnel  Of course, the energy picture on the cost side   looks better  Several contacts expressed relief at the recent declines and hoped that they would lead   to reductions in fuel surcharges and related costs   Turning to the national outlook, we agree with the Greenbook’s assessment that growth in   the third quarter appears to be somewhat weaker than we anticipated at the time of the August   meeting However, in contrast to the Greenbook, we do not think the sluggishness will persist for   long Current financial conditions do not appear to be a restraint on activity  Labor markets are in   good shape, so growth in jobs and wages should continue to support household spending  We are   getting a welcome boost to real incomes from lower energy prices; and given the increase in   business optimism that I noted earlier, I am less concerned that cautious animal spirits will cause   businesses to pull back on spending  Housing remains the major downside risk, but I get the   impression that thus far the weakness in residential investment is not spilling over to the other   sectors of the economy  Of course, we have talked about this at great length   So our overall assessment is that by early next year growth will be much closer to potential   than the Greenbook projects  Accordingly, we do not think that any meaningful resource gaps will   emerge to restrain inflation  Indeed, our inflation models based on data since 1967 look for core   PCE inflation to be 27 percent in ’07 and 26 percent in ’08  The models that use data only since   1984 come out somewhat lower, at 24 in ’07 and 23 in ’08   In thinking about the differences between these forecasts, I found the background paper that   Dave circulated quite useful, as several others have said  Our models allow for permanent shocks to   September 20, 2006 35 of 132                             the level of inflation, and as the paper noted, such shocks appear to have been much smaller since   1984 But as also discussed in the paper, we have no way of knowing whether these permanent   shocks will be small in the future  I think the most likely interpretation of the reduction in the   volatility of these permanent shocks is that policy has done a better job of anchoring inflation   expectations The public is more convinced than they were in the past that we will maintain low   and stable inflation  But if our actions fail to confirm this belief, we would lose credibility, leading   to higher inflation expectations and imparting more persistence to the current inflation shock  An   inflation shock that is permanent rather than transitory is our responsibility   Our forecasts remind me of this risk  True, so far this is just a risk  We have not yet seen   any broad-based increases in long-run inflation forecasts by private-sector economists or in the   five-year to ten-year TIPS inflation compensation  Indeed, TIPS have even moved down recently    This news is welcome  But even if inflation expectations have not moved up, another concern is the   level of long-run inflation expectations—and I thought Jeff Lacker raised a good point last time in   reminding us about it  Long-run inflation expectations of around 2½ percent for the CPI translate   into a core PCE rate well above the middle of my comfort zone of 1 to 2 percent  Even the   Greenbook expects core PCE inflation to be above 2 percent through ’08  I am concerned that even   now the public could be questioning our resolve to bring inflation into what many of us have said is   our comfort zone  I am already hearing this sentiment from some market analysts  Even without an   increase in expectations, it is not clear to me that inflation will settle back to a level that I view as   being consistent with price stability without further policy action   Yes, and Chrysler announced just yesterday that they, too, are reducing   production in the second half  What intrigued me about GM, which has lowered production plans,   is the changeover for light trucks  They are producing these trucks in five plants, and that is the   largest number of plants that produce one type of vehicle  As a result, when they change these   plants, they do it sequentially; the changeover slows production in that plant  Then they ramp up,   and it takes some time to ramp up  Then they go to the next plant and do the same thing  So they   are going through a series of five plants, and that in itself lowers their production in the fourth   quarter  The other things I mentioned would lower it as well   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I appreciate your passing out this sheet and   talking about it I think the lesson here is that these things do not always go as gradually as forecast,   and once things get going in one direction, there is more momentum than is built into our   longer-term forecasts   In terms of policy, as you know I would have preferred raising rates at our last meeting, and   I think the overall contours of the resource gap and the inflation forecast are pretty much the same   as they were last time  I still think that policy will need to be tightened further to bring inflation   back into my comfort zone within a reasonable period of time  But given our decision to pause last   month, I do not feel that we should move today  We told the public that we paused to assess   incoming data, and I think it requires more than one meeting’s worth of data to assess that  In fact,   if we did move today, it would be a signal that we are just reacting to little snippets of information,   and we are trying to dissuade people from thinking that  But I am concerned about how markets   viewed our last meeting  We talked last time about a hawkish pause  Generally the markets didn’t   interpret it that way They may be more optimistic about inflation, but as we know, the futures   September 20, 2006 96 of 132                                            market is expecting us to cut rates  I share a sense of what President Poole talked about—that   market analysts and others are saying that we are not really serious about this 1 to 2 percent that   many of us have talked about; they think our zone is somewhere higher   So when you look at these options from A to Z—A to C [laughter], there are lots of   options—that Vince has distributed, I am in the B+ category  But I think we should not put that   phrase “policy is more likely to firm than ease going forward” in the statement  However, I think   that it is the sense of this Committee, and I think it should be reflected in the minutes   I would agree with taking it out  It’s a good suggestion because, when   you change the language from the last time, people focus on that, and putting it in will   overemphasize the importance of it  "
8026,2006-10-24,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Dave, I want to ask you a question about   residential housing markets and the effect of this slowdown that we’ve seen on the prices of   October 24-25, 2006 15 of 203    housing  As you mentioned in your comments, we’ve seen the rate of increase slow  In one of   the alternative simulations, you actually plugged in a major reduction in housing prices  Are you   aware of any empirical work that has been done, or have you done any work to show us what the   time lags would be here that we could expect to see from the drop in housing to some effect on   housing prices going forward?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Conditions in the Seventh District appear   to be quite similar to what I reported last time  Except for housing and autos, activity remains on   a solid footing, and most of our contacts are relatively optimistic about the outlook  For   instance, the two large temp firms we talk to regularly both reported that, although billable hours   were roughly flat, their clients were upbeat about the outlook  Furthermore, demand for workers   in light industry—the segment most closely tied to the national business cycle—continued to   grow  In terms of wages, both temp firms noted that compensation increases have been running   much higher than last year at this time  The difficulties of the Big Three automakers continue to   be a problem for our region and are showing through in the national numbers for the third   quarter  These difficulties don’t stem from an overall lack of demand  Light vehicle sales   continue to run at a pretty healthy pace, as the Greenbook notes  To some extent, the Big   Three’s difficulties are a consequence of the energy price shock  Demand has shifted away from   pickups and big SUVs, which have been their bread and butter  Despite the recent gas price   October 24-25, 2006 23 of 203    declines, Ford and GM told us that they do not expect a reversal of this shift anytime soon    Otherwise, the District is doing reasonably well  I heard a lot of optimism  Indeed, a few   contacts explicitly described the current slowdown as similar to the brief pause in the mid-1990s,   which was followed by sustained expansion   Turning to the national outlook, clearly economic activity was soft during the third   quarter, but the fairly solid growth in consumption and business fixed investment indicates that   at least to date we have not seen a spillover of the weakness in housing to other sectors of the   economy  This is consistent with the anecdotes that I’m hearing  Looking ahead, we expect   several quarters of weak residential investment, but activity in other sectors should increase   roughly in line with longer-run sustainable rates  Assuming market expectations for interest   rates, we see GDP growth averaging modestly below potential over the next year and a half  We   think growth will be a bit above potential in ’08  In our view, the underlying fundamentals—  wealth, income, interest rates, and the current level of liquidity in the economy—should support   a higher level of spending than what’s in the Greenbook baseline   Of course, a major risk for our outlook is that there could be more-substantial spillovers   from the housing sector  As has been noted around this table, it could take some time for the   weakness in housing demand to show through to house prices  I was hoping we could get more   information, but it sounds as though the research isn’t there yet  If prices do fall substantially, a   reduction in wealth could have serious ramifications for consumption and spending overall  It’s   hard to say when we’ll have a clearer picture as to how events are unfolding  At some point,   probably before the decline in the broad measures of housing prices, we’ll likely see early   evidence in either anecdotes or risk spreads  Or if the risk is overstated, we may hear of   improvements from our contacts   October 24-25, 2006 24 of 203    Turning to inflation, the projections from our models have not changed much with the   incoming data  They still show core PCE inflation in ’08 coming in between 23 and 26 percent,   depending on the period used to estimate the models  So I continue to have the same questions I   had last time regarding the interplay between such inflation rates, inflation expectations, and Fed   credibility  Will continued high levels of core inflation eventually make the public doubt our   resolve to maintain low and stable inflation?  Even if inflation is less persistent, as some have   suggested, will it settle out at rates like those in the past few years—namely, 2 percent—rather   than the 16 percent in the Greenbook’s less-persistent inflation scenario?  Are the current   long-run core PCE inflation expectations, which are likely above 2 percent, just simply too high?    I’m quite concerned that the answers to these questions might be “yes”  If so, and the housing   spillover risks fade, then we may have to act more forcefully than the Greenbook baseline policy   assumption in order to ensure that inflation is more clearly headed into the range consistent with   price stability    My general assessment has been that this is a market share story  It’s   not a story of aggregate demand for automobiles or light vehicles in that it is a shift from the   domestic, what we used to call the Big Three, to foreign manufacturers, whether they’re   producing here in the United States or exporting more to the United States  Obviously, we know   October 24-25, 2006 25 of 203    there has been a big ramp-up in transplants here, but the import share of light vehicles is going   up, too  So I generally think it’s a market share story and, as you said, there will be a lot of   dislocations if, God forbid, Ford goes out of business  But I think it would just be a shift   Now, in terms of whether what’s happening at Ford is, as you said, a death spiral, I really   wouldn’t know  A new CEO is coming in, and there is the old adage, “When a new CEO comes   in, he’s going to write off as much as he possibly can and get it behind him”  So some of that   may be occurring as well  But the problem with the US firms is both the product they have and   the perception of that product  I think their product has gotten better  I don’t, personally, think   it’s as good as the foreign firms’ product, but I think the perception of it is much worse than the   perception of the foreign firms’ product    Slightly    No, I saw it coming down—oh, you mean in the outer years  Well, I   think several things are going on  There is still the spillover of energy price increases flowing   through the economy, but also there are more resource constraints than are built into the baseline   forecast    Vince, I want to ask you about charts 5 and 6 in the Bluebook  Also, I   want to make a comment and then ask a question  Chart 5, the equilibrium real federal funds rate   chart, shows that the current fed funds rate is slightly above the range of models that close the   output gap within twelve quarters  It doesn’t really speak to inflation tensions in monetary   policy  However, chart 6 deals directly with inflation and monetary policy, and you have the   2 percent target and the 1½ percent target  Neither scenario achieves the target by 2012, though   you do get closer to the 2 percent target if that were, in fact, our target  Both of the charts are   helpful to us as policymakers  My comment is that I recommend that in future Bluebooks you   include them both, as you have done this time and as you have done sometimes but not   consistently in the past  I think they give us a fuller picture of the total outlook, and it’s more   helpful for policymaking  The question is whether chart 5 and chart 6 can be integrated more   closely so that we can understand the implications in chart 5 of the output gap for inflation    So we’re making progress    Well, I know they don’t change very much, but I still think it’s helpful   to have them side by side as we look at them    What do you want to substitute?  [Laughter]    Could you just repeat the change you suggested, Don, in section 2?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Given our decision to pause a couple of   meetings ago, I don’t think that we should move rates today  We’ve made only small changes to the   outlook since our last meeting, and we’re still facing an uncertain policy environment  I’m feeling a   bit more comfortable about the resilience of the real economy, as I mentioned  Still, I recognize it   could be a while before we have a reasonably clear picture of how the correction in the housing   markets is playing out  With regard to inflation, it’s true the past three months of price data were   better than the previous three, but as we have pretty much a consensus here, it’s still way too soon at   this point to say that core inflation has peaked  My basic thinking about inflation has not changed    It’s too high, and I see a significant risk that it will not come down fast enough  I just want to refer   back also to the medium-run scenarios in the Bluebook  Remember we had those two targets, the   1½ percent target and 2 percent target  You recall that, depending on which target you chose, you   had a different series of policy actions early next year  So I think our discussion about   communications later today will have some relevance for our near-term policy decisions as well as   our longer-term communication strategy   In terms of the language, let me go through it section by section  In section 2, I like the   change that Don Kohn suggested, saying that economic growth has slowed over the course of the   year instead of referring specifically to the third quarter  There’s no major benefit in singling out   the third quarter  The substitute sentence accomplishes much of the same thing that pointing to the   third quarter does, and so I like that change  About the second sentence in section 2 and the   October 24-25, 2006 108 of 203    questions as to what the word “moderate” means, I can see there will be some confusion here    Coming into this meeting, I thought “moderate” meant “below potential” not “at potential” because   “moderate” to me means good but not great  That’s the way I interpreted it, and I would assume   that market observers and Fed observers are going to be doing exactly what Vice Chairman   Geithner did—    Professor  [Laughter]  Professor Geithner did, saying, “what’s the   dictionary say?”  They’re going to be rushing to the dictionary to figure out what “moderate” really   means here  So there’s confusion about the definition  Then there’s the confusion that was pointed   out about what the baseline is—from where; from the third quarter; from the average of the first   three quarters?  I think these are valid critiques  I think we can say the same thing for the word   “improved,” though I don’t think that helps us  I guess I’m not happy with the sentence, but I can’t   think of a better way to improve it at this point except to drop it completely  On section 3—I agree   that alternative A is better than alternative B, to take out the reference to energy in that first   sentence  Then in section 4, I like the language of B+, but it’s a close call as to whether or not this   is the time to make that change  I guess I have a slight preference for leaving it the way it is now  I   just don’t think this is the time to make changes in section 4, and we’ll certainly have another   chance to revisit this at our next meeting    Thank you, Mr Chairman  It’s probably best to state at the outset that I   prefer a different approach to quantitative inflation guidelines, and that approach is actually touched   on in Vince’s second question  The approach I would prefer is extending our economic forecast   horizon  I’ll address this consideration first and fill in some of the details requested by Vince and   the subcommittee, and I hope we would consider this option going forward   Moving to an explicit numerical specification of price stability would be a very big step for   the Federal Reserve, for this Committee  Once we do that, as Don said, there’s no turning back  So   this decision is extremely important for the Committee  To date, when we’ve been faced with major   decisions of this type, we have taken an incremental approach, and I think that approach has served   us very well  For example, we have increased transparency step by step over the past twelve years,   and I think that approach has really been quite successful   So I’m attracted to an intermediate step of extending our economic forecast horizons  I   think doing so would be a natural extension of what we already do, and it would give us experience   with many aspects of the quantitative inflation regime  My preference would be to extend the   October 24-25, 2006 130 of 203    economic forecast to a horizon that is at least five years ahead  At five years out, the inflation   forecast should be close to our implicit inflation guideline  Output growth and the unemployment   rate should move around only with regard to structural changes, like demographic changes and total   factor productivity growth, for example   I realize that many details would have to be addressed to extend the forecast horizon, but   figuring them out and getting experience with this approach would help us to learn what’s involved   in moving toward an explicit numerical objective or to learn why not to go that far  First, what is   the policy assumption underlying the forecast?  Second, we currently report GDP growth, the   unemployment rate, and core inflation—so how many variables would we report?  Third, should we   continue with our current approach of using a central tendency or develop an integrated consensus   forecast?  Fourth, should we convey uncertainty bands around that forecast at the longer horizons?   I realize these questions are difficult for us to answer as a Committee, but there are other   tough challenges in moving to an explicit specification of price stability  For me the biggest issue is   the dual mandate responsibility and our relationship to the Congress  Clearly, a persuasive case   must be made that we will continue to fulfill our dual mandate responsibilities  The challenge is   how to make an explicit numerical specification of price stability operationally compliant with the   dual mandate, and to do so, we need to clarify the flexibility of the time period for bringing inflation   back to its target, as Jeff just talked about  The amount of time to do this would depend on the size   of the current inflation deviation and the deviations from maximum sustainable growth and   employment  So I think the intermediate step of explaining longer-term forecasts would help us   learn how to communicate these difficult dual mandate issues more effectively   Let me cycle back to the questions in Vince’s memo  With regard to the first question, I   think that further clarification of our price stability objective would be helpful and that extending the   October 24-25, 2006 131 of 203    forecast horizon is a good first step  Providing more information about our long-term inflation goals   should help us maintain or even reduce the currently low inflation risk premiums in long-term   nominal financial contracts and interest rates  These inflation premiums are risk compensation   against the economic outcomes that we have a lot to say about  The long-term inflation information   will greatly facilitate communication both within the Committee and externally  I have expressed   my views on explicit inflation objectives previously  Just to summarize, economic theory does not   sharply pin down the optimum inflation rate, but my preference is a range of 1 to 2 percent for core   PCE inflation  My preference is for core inflation to be 1½ percent, in the center of that zone    When inflation is outside the zone, policy should be broadly designed to move inflation back to the   center of the zone  However, the time frame for core inflation to return to the center of the zone   depends on a number of factors, like the dual mandate that I mentioned earlier   Finally, an important issue that we should discuss is whether to use core inflation or   headline inflation  Other central banks use headline inflation, and they seem to manage that well    I’m open to a discussion on this, but I think the communication issues are more complicated for   headline inflation when it deviates so much for transitory reasons than for core inflation  To   conclude, I favor taking the intermediate step of extending the forecast horizon to five years, and I’d   like to leave open the question of whether to establish quantitative guidelines until we get more   experience with that approach  "
8050,2006-12-12,"  I have a question for Dave on the first paragraph of the Greenbook,   where you said that labor markets have been stronger than we were expecting  Of course, just   now you also talked about that and about the employment report on Friday  Then you said, “In   constructing our forecast of aggregate activity, we’ve given greater weight to the data on   spending and industrial production”  I was just wondering why you decided to do that  You   pointed to the labor market as an upside risk, but I was wondering why you decided to give   greater weight to the spending and industrial production data     December 12, 2006 15 of 134          Otherwise, you change the forecast     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Business activity in the Seventh District   appears to be expanding at a slightly slower pace than the last time we met  But most of my   contacts were still positive about the outlook, and when we put together our forecast for the national   economy, we did not make any large changes to the projections of either growth or inflation  We   see output recovering as we move into ’07 and core PCE staying near its current rate through the   forecast period     As Janet discussed, we’ve talked about the bimodal nature of the national economy    Housing is weak, and the auto sector is struggling, but the rest of the economy is performing well    We see these sectoral differences, particularly with regard to autos, in our District economy    Michigan’s unemployment rate is about 7 percent, and it was the only state to show a year-over-  year decline in the OFHEO house price measure  In contrast, Illinois and Wisconsin have a more   diversified manufacturing base, and they’re doing well  Furthermore, we continue to hear reports of   growth in demand for manufactured goods outside of autos and residential construction  One   example of this is Caterpillar  They expect revenues from highway construction and mining   equipment to remain strong with some easing in the US market being offset by increased demand   from abroad  Manufacturers of machine tools continue to report solid orders  Of course, such   reports contrast sharply with our conversations with the Big Three automobile makers  General   Motors indicates that they expect ’07 to be another challenging year  Incentives are one issue  GM   thinks that their own incentives are now about the right level, including the Classic, [laughter]   whereas others are still high  Another issue is that the UAW contract will be coming up for renewal   next year in September, and the negotiations are expected to be difficult   December 12, 2006 27 of 134         Turning to labor markets more generally, Kelly and Manpower said that the overall   nationwide placements of temporary workers were unchanged year over year, but placements of   light industrial production workers continue to increase, and conversions from temporary to   permanent remain strong  Moreover, their clients, while cautious, generally do not expect any   prolonged period of weakness  These temp firms said that wage pressures were steady to down a   bit, but a major national specialty retailer indicated that he was having difficulty hiring holiday   workers and permanent workers and that he was planning for an increase of 10 to 12 percent in   wages for entry-level full-time hires  Retailers also told us that they believed strong labor markets   were supporting spending, and they were looking forward to good results for the holiday season   With regard to inflation, even though energy prices have moved off their peaks, there were   few signs of rollbacks in fuel surcharges  Indeed, we even heard of further cost pass-throughs from   petroleum-based inputs  However, we did not get the sense that general cost pressures were   intensifying   Finally, we held our annual economic outlook symposium ten days ago in the midst of the   first major snowstorm of the year  The three dozen hardy forecasters predicted real GDP growth of   28 percent in ’07 and the employment rate to drift up to 49 percent by the second half of the year    They also forecast that total CPI would increase 2½ percent and that sales of light vehicles would be   164 million units   Turning to the national outlook, the data have come in somewhat softer than I expected at   our last meeting  Our uncertainty about the outlook has increased somewhat, but I still think that   there are significant forces supporting activity and that the economy will return to a better growth   path as we move into next year  To be sure, residential construction is quite weak, auto sales are   softer, and the businesses supplying these industries are experiencing some sizable reductions in   December 12, 2006 28 of 134         demand  However, I do not get the sense of a secondary spillover to other sectors of the economy    Importantly, the labor market has remained robust, supporting household spending—as we’ve   talked about  Business confidence appears to be holding up fairly well  Indeed, I’m impressed by   the lack of pessimism among my contacts, even those who are experiencing flattening sales or   sluggish sales  Finally, real interest rates are low across the maturity spectrum, and risk spreads   remain narrow  Given the liquidity in the system, it’s still hard to see current financial conditions as   being that restrictive   In the end, we did not make any large changes to the overall contours of our GDP forecast    We still see the economy growing moderately below potential in ’07 and increasing at a pace   moderately above potential in 2008  Now, we condition our baseline forecast on market   expectations for interest rates  Accordingly, this outlook is boosted by the expected decline in the   funds rate that’s in the market  If, like the Greenbook, we had assumed a flat federal funds rate   path, we would project a recovery only to potential in ’08   Turning to inflation, the recent data have not clarified the trends  The six-month change in   the core PCE price index is down, but the three-month numbers have moved up  In Chicago, we   like to use indicator models, like the ones that Stock and Watson developed, as a way to assess the   implications of incoming data for future inflation  These are time series models, and they forecast   inflation based on more than 80 economic indicators linked to inflationary pressures  The   projections of these models have changed little since our last meeting  Our forecasts continue to   show inflation running too high for my taste  Even our most optimistic models, which are estimated   using data only since 1984, have core PCE inflation flat at 24 percent through 2008  In sum, I am   still concerned that inflation will be too high for too long; and even though the downside risks to   growth have increased, I continue to see inflation as the predominant risk   December 12, 2006 29 of 134          Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, I want to thank the staff for including   chart 6 in the Bluebook  As several of us suggested last time, it’s a good addition to have for every   meeting   Since August, policy has been on hold for us to assess the inflation situation and the growth   outlook, and at this point I think we would continue the period of assessment until the situation is   clarified further or something changes  Today I would go with alternative B  Listening to the   discussion, I still come down for the wording in alternative B  I would go with exhibit 5, which is   the Christmas-colored version, and I would delete “than anticipated”  I think it does read better that   way  Don, in answer to your question, I think the markets would read this as being slightly weaker   December 12, 2006 102 of 134         than history  So I think that’s appropriate  I can see the argument for alternative C  It is much   cleaner, and it relates directly to what we said last time, with a slight modification  However, there   has been a slight weakness in the data, and I think it’s reality, and we should recognize it  In terms   of whether “weaker” is weaker than “subdued”—actually the words are “somewhat more subdued”   and “slightly weaker” [Laughter]  On that basis, I’m comfortable with “slightly weaker”  However,   stepping back during this period, I think it is useful to consider the kind of information that would   lead us to change the policy rate, as several people have talked about here  When we assess the   inflation situation, although members of this Committee may have different views of price stability,   I think there’s a clear consensus that core inflation has been too high  In our decision to pause, too,   there’s a consensus that we can be patient, at least for now, about the time frame for core inflation to   fall  The question is, “How patient?”  We expect that inflation will gradually come down, but the   corollary to this is that core inflation should not noticeably deteriorate over the near term  In the   medium term, we should be more clearly on a path to lower inflation  Of course, steady progress   would be best, but what we all want is at least to be on the path  The implication is that we must be   willing to firm policy if core inflation increases in the near term or the medium term or if it fails to   be on a clear trend toward price stability over the longer term   When we look at the growth side for the longer term, I think the consensus view is that we   want to carefully monitor growth and resource slack, being mindful of the downside economic risk   that we talked about and the Chairman summarized  We talked about the bimodal economy, but we   also must remember that sustainable growth rates are likely lower  The Greenbook talks about   2½ percent, a lower number than what we’ve been accustomed to in recent years, and the   implication is that we could be facing increasing resource pressure at GDP growth rates that were   previously viewed as below potential   December 12, 2006 103 of 134         So the bottom line is no change in policy today  Inflation risk still predominates  I’m   nervous about the expected slow improvement in inflation, but I admit that the jury is still out on   whether it’s a problem  The economic fundamentals still suggest a return to potential growth rates   by the end of ’07, but we have to be mindful of the adverse changes in the growth outlook as well  "
8077,2007-01-30,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I just want to follow up on Vice Chairman   Geithner’s first question—on inflation  It seems to me that most of the factors that are leading to   lower inflation in this forecast period are temporary—energy prices, owners’ equivalent rent, and   import prices  The longer-term factors are the pressures in the labor market that we’ve talked about   and maybe some follow-through from the earlier accommodative financial conditions that we’ve   had  As you said, chart 6 of the Bluebook, when you look past the forecast period, doesn’t show   inflation coming down  Inflation actually goes up a bit with both the 1½ percent target and the   2 percent target  Doesn’t this mean that expectations have moved up a bit when you see inflation go   up in ’09 and beyond?    So that’s a key variable    Thank you    Thank you  Mr Chairman, some of my colleagues have told me they   expected me to brag today because both teams in the Super Bowl are from the Seventh Federal   Reserve District, but I assured them I would not do that  [Laughter]     Some day we’ll have the Super Bowl at the Seventh Federal Reserve   District  But turning to the business at hand, business activity in our District continues to expand at   a somewhat modest pace, but the tone of my business contacts was more positive than at our last   meeting  Manufacturing activity in the District is currently a bit soft  The Chicago purchasing   managers’ index fell from 516 in December to 488 in January, and this number will be released   tomorrow morning   Many of my contacts are expecting a significant pickup in activity in the second half of the   year  We heard this from manufacturers of building materials, agricultural equipment, construction   machinery, autos and steel, temporary-help firms, and even from several retailers  Though a   number of manufacturers thought that the recent softness was temporary and reflected the need to   work off some modest inventory buildups, they said the final demand for their products remains   solid  The steel industry is a good example of this kind of dynamic  Industry production has fallen   sharply since the summer; but when I recently talked to the head of a major steel company, he noted   that demand from end users had remained quite stable, and he expected it to stay that way  The   January 30-31, 2007 38 of 255    production cutbacks were mainly the result of inventory fluctuations at the service centers, which   buy bulk quantities of steel to process and distribute to final customers  The analysts in the industry   are divided on when this inventory correction will be complete, but even the pessimists think that it   will be done by late spring  With the steady demand from end-use customers, my contact thought   that production and prices would definitely be rising by the second half of the year  There was an   article in the paper today that mentioned that Nucor is trying to raise prices by $20 a ton in March    My auto contacts had mixed views about 2007  Last year was especially tough for the Big Three    High gas prices shifted sales from SUVs to cars, and then the mix of sales shifted from retail toward   fleet sales, where their margins are lower  GM thought that gas prices probably have fallen enough   to stabilize the market share of light trucks and that retail sales were now down near their long-term   trend levels  Ford was not as sanguine about either of these developments  Finally, the strength of   foreign demand and the weaker dollar seem to be showing through to increased export demand for a   number of our District’s manufacturers, and this situation supports the comments in the chart show   The national economy is clearly showing more underlying strength than we thought in   December  Moreover, the downside-risk scenarios now seem less likely  The housing markets look   to be nearing the bottom, and the spillover to other sectors now seems likely to be minor or is being   offset by other positive factors  Importantly, tight labor markets and lower energy prices are   boosting consumer spending  We continue to expect that growth will be modestly below potential   in the first half of the year, but like my business contacts, we expect activity to pick up in the second   half and growth to be a touch above potential by 2008  Unlike the Greenbook, this projection is   conditioned on market expectations for interest rates, which impart some degree of accommodation   next year  So currently I see the risks to the growth forecast as being fairly well balanced  On the   January 30-31, 2007 39 of 255    downside, we could be wrong about the stabilization in housing, and on the upside, consumer   spending could remain robust or demand from abroad could accelerate   Overall, the recent data on inflation have been positive  As a result, the forecasts from our   inflation models are lower by a tenth or two  The models estimated using data only since 1984   predict that core PCE inflation will be flat at 23 percent through 2008  So I’m less optimistic about   inflation than the Greenbook  In my mind, there are two key questions concerning the inflation   outlook  First, what happens in 2009 and beyond?  As we were discussing before, in chart 6 in the   Bluebook, for whatever reason, inflation is moving up, and I think that’s a concern  Second, there’s   the issue of longer-run inflation expectations  In the Greenbook forecast, by the end of ’07, inflation   would have been at or above 2¼ percent for a year and a half with no change in the fed funds rate   and a reasonably strong economic environment  I think markets might interpret this inaction as a   signal that we’re satisfied with 2¼ percent inflation, not the 1 percent to 2 percent comfort zone that   many of us have said we prefer  This view was shared by the participants at our recent gathering of   academic and business economists—we have an advisory committee that meets a few times a year    Indeed, several academics thought we were already at this point  In their minds, the current policy   stance and inflation picture revealed that we were satisfied with inflation stabilizing at or a bit above   2 percent  The business economists also were predicting that we would find ourselves in the   position of needing to increase rates some time this year in order to put inflation on a pronounced   downward path    The one with two teams from the Seventh District [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with the sense of the Committee   that we should not be raising rates today  However, I do think that, as we’ve all said, the   inflation risks still dominate and that we’re approaching some very important decision points in   the next couple of meetings  If we look back, of course, the primary risk to our growth forecast   has been housing  We have seen an incredibly sharp decline, and many of us have the sense that   housing is stabilizing now  There’s still some uncertainty about that, but it seems to be   January 30-31, 2007 106 of 255    stabilizing  Once it stabilizes, our attention will shift to the other part of our dual mandate—to   price stability  As I think we have all said, we’re uncomfortable with the current rate of   inflation  There has been some improvement; we’ll take that to the bank  We’re happy with   that  But there is still a lot of uncertainty about the future course of inflation, and the projections   in the Greenbook and the Bluebook are not encouraging to me  My comfort zone is 1 to 2   percent, so I’m in the 1½ percent category  In view of that range, as Vince said, we have work to   do  I agree with Tim and Sandy that we shouldn’t interpret alternative B as saying that each   individual has a target of 2 percent  Our projection for inflation is 2¼ percent in both years, and   that is clearly above that target  We have said we’re concerned about inflation—we said that last   time, and I think it was well put  But we should make even stronger statements in the minutes   about the costs of inflation running above forecast and about the damage it can do to the   economy on a long-term basis  As I said, I don’t think we have the luxury of waiting until   inflation rises before we act  We have to be forward-looking  The next couple of meetings are   going to be important because we’ll know a lot more about whether housing really has stabilized   further and what the inflation numbers will look like  In terms of the language, I’m comfortable   with alternative B as it’s stated  I like the reference to the high level of resource utilization in   section 3, so I would not change the language at this time     I was going to make exactly the same suggestion—to put it on the table   for consideration by President Minehan  [Laughter]     I would just say that I’m comfortable with going back to alternative B,   section 4, but one way to help move this forward would be just to strengthen our concern in the   minutes about inflation and stick with B(4)    I thought, Mr Chairman, that you described a convention a number of   meetings ago, and I thought you expressed it very well  The statement that comes out of the   meeting is a consensus statement of the Committee; the minutes describe the range of views that are   expressed  That’s consistent with the way we’ve been operating, and I think it has served us well    May I ask one other question?    I just was wondering, since we’re focusing on alternative B, how the staff   thinks the markets will react to the current version    I have just a factual question  On the existing Monetary Policy Report,   you described it as the Chairman’s view  I looked at the existing report  It has a table with the   forecast and then a few paragraphs describing that forecast    The Board staff’s?    I have just a quick question about the narrative  Would you see a   narrative significantly different from the narrative that’s now in the Monetary Policy Report, other   than the fan charts or anything else that would be added?  Would you see the same type of thing—a   few paragraphs describing the forecast?   January 30-31, 2007 169 of 255     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I thought about the alternatives before   us for making forecasts, I had an even greater appreciation for the way we’ve done this to date  I   looked at the Monetary Policy Report, of course, and other things that we’ve done, and I think   we’ve been well served by the approach we’ve taken to date—the twice-a-year forecast and the   central tendency descriptions  Some of us were here when Chairman Greenspan told us that he   January 30-31, 2007 197 of 255    didn’t really care for these forecasts very much  He said it was psychologically debilitating for   him to discuss them in his testimony [laughter] three weeks later because they became stale    Well, Chairman Bernanke has done an excellent job, and I don’t think he has been   psychologically debilitated so far that I’m aware of  [Laughter]  But you have woven them into   your testimony, and I think it has been very effective  So if there are important improvements   that can be made, I certainly would favor them  But I don’t have a good sense at the moment, as   some others have expressed, which communication issue we’re trying to address here  The   background memos were first class, and I should compliment the staff  They did an excellent job   of describing how forecasts can play an important communication role for central banks that   have adopted inflation guidelines in one form or another  Of course, we haven’t adopted any yet    Maybe we will  I think that’s still an open question  But depending on the specific mandates of   the central bank, the forecast procedures may depend on those details  In an ideal world, I’d   prefer to know more about how we’re going to address the other communication issues first    Specifically, will we adopt a quantitative inflation guideline?  Will we specify a timeframe for   achieving that objective as well?  How we answer those questions will give us a framework for   deciding what types of forecasts we want to provide  I guess that will be the discussion in   March    In the meantime, we should go slowly in making changes in our current forecast process    Our approach to improving transparency has been incremental  We have taken a step, sometimes   a small step, and then we assess that step before we take another step  Over time we make a   series of steps that has significantly improved our transparency  This approach has served us   well, because, as Gary said, it would be very difficult to reverse a step that provides more   January 30-31, 2007 198 of 255    transparency  It would be viewed as a takeaway  In that context, let me quickly go through the   questions; then just for the record, I’ll make some summary comments    So, one, I would say that we want to have individual forecasts  That’s what the sense of   the Committee seems to be  Two, they should not have common assumptions  I think it’s   important that they should be based on appropriate policy  They should be what we actually   think is going to happen  Otherwise, it would be very confusing  I think that a minutes-style   narrative would be helpful  We actually do it already  It’s a Board of Governors document, but   we do it  I’ll say a little bit more about that later  Should we jointly agree on the narrative?  I   think we should  We have to work out the timeframe, but I think we should  How frequently?  I   could see a case made for starting out doing one more a year in the fall  Doing it would be   difficult, for reasons that Janet gave, given our meeting schedule  But it could be done, and I   think it could be done without a lot of work  I’ll get to that later as well  How many years?  I   would like to go more years, as you know, rather than fewer  I like Sandy’s approach, going out   five years, but I certainly think we should extend the timeframe  How many variables?  I would   drop nominal GDP, as others have said  Then, on the uncertainty question, my initial instinct is   to communicate it in words rather than in fan charts, but that’s something we could learn more   about  I’m open to considering other ways if we find one that is simple and that people can   understand    Let me make a few overall comments  First, I thought that the document that Tim   circulated before the meeting was useful  The major benefit to me in looking at it was to see   what assumptions you’re making, and I think that does help us in communication and in   understanding where people are coming from as they make statements at the meeting  It’s not   something I would want to see made public, but I think it does help us in terms of   January 30-31, 2007 199 of 255    communicating with each other  Second, there was some discussion at one point about actually   putting out a forecast of the fed funds rate  I’d be very cautious about that  I know this is   probably at the top of the list of what private-sector people want; but for obvious reasons—as   Don said, they’d like to know what it is going to be at our next meeting—I would just be very,   very careful about that  Third, I thought Tom Hoenig had an intriguing idea about putting this in   the minutes  From an efficiency standpoint, doing so has a lot of advantages  In the minutes we   actually describe what we think the forecast is, and we all review that description and make   changes, and the process has been fairly efficient so far  I could see doing that without   producing another document, so it would still be a Committee document  Of course, the   narrative would still be the Committee narrative, but we’d just do it as part of the process of   reviewing the minutes  I don’t think you need any side bar disagreements in there because we do   that already  In some cases, we say “many members” or “some members”  I think it is handled   quite well  So I’m intrigued by and attracted to that suggestion from an efficiency standpoint,   and if we were going to do a third forecast, say in October, it doesn’t have to be a separate   document at all  It could just be in the minutes  We could have a little table with the forecast,   the central tendency, and the range, and then a description in the minutes    That brings me to the point that a number of people have made about a dry run, which   obviously is crucial, because we’ll learn more about the process  This gets back to the point   about who does the description  Is it the FOMC?  Right now, the FOMC does the forecast, and   the Board of Governors does the explanation of the forecast  If we put it in the minutes, it would   be an FOMC description, and the narrative would be the FOMC’s narrative  In terms of timing   with the Chairman’s testimony, this time the minutes come out just after you testify  So to fulfill   the accountability issue that the Congress wants, we could have it in the minutes as an FOMC   January 30-31, 2007 200 of 255    narrative, but the Board of Governors could then adopt it if the Congress felt that was important   from an accountability standpoint  But it could be the same document  That way to do it seems   to me to be more efficient, and it would be the Committee’s view    That gets me to Kevin’s point about whether we are constraining the Chairman when he   is testifying or speaking about this forecast or about the economy  Certainly, we don’t want to   constrain the Chairman  His credibility is the Committee’s credibility and the institution’s   credibility, and so it’s crucial that we not constrain him in that way  But if he felt strongly about   a difference between what the central tendency of the Committee forecast was and his own view,   I have great confidence that he could handle that without detracting from his credibility but still   enable us to have a Committee narrative on the forecast  As I said, I think a dry run would help   us understand this better, but I do think we want to do this in as efficient a way as possible before   producing additional documents because it does require a lot of effort, particularly from the staff   here but also from all of us who are involved and our research staffs   "
8102,2007-03-20,"  I just want to get back to the subprime market for a quick question    There have been a lot of newspaper stories about people who default on the first payment in   these mortgages, which is a bit of a puzzle to me, unless it’s just pure fraud  I was just   wondering if you had any information about whether there has been an increase in fraud here or   whether there are other reasons for people defaulting on the very first payment on their   mortgage    Have you seen any data or hard evidence on this?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Conditions in the Seventh District are   similar to what I reported last time  Business activity continues to expand at a modest pace    However, while my contacts expressed some increased uncertainty, most of them maintained a   positive view about the outlook for the second half of the year  As we know, the two sectors that   generated the most uncertainty this round are housing and business investment, and so I want to   concentrate some of my comments on those two areas   On the housing front, my contacts continue to be unsure about how soon the turnaround   will be  A director from Pulte Homes saw hints of a better tone in the market but acknowledged   that signs were still tentative  He did say that the larger builders have reduced their stock of   speculative homes  Another director, who is CEO of US Gypsum, thought it would be a couple   of months before he had a better idea whether the market had hit bottom  Furthermore, he   thought that, even after the market hits bottom, it would be quite a while before building   materials recovered to normal sales levels  As we were discussing, the subprime situation could   March 20-21, 2007 27 of 196    be a serious problem for the macroeconomy in a couple of ways  One would be a major   spillover to house prices—it’s too soon to tell about this now, but new spring listings should shed   some light by our next meeting  The other would be significant fallout to other credit market   segments, and we don’t see this yet either  I contacted both GM and Ford, and they said that the   subprime mortgages held by their credit subsidiaries had deteriorated, but they had not seen   increased defaults in other portions of their portfolios  Notably, they had not seen any unusual   problems in auto loans, and we generally heard this sentiment of a lack of spillover from bankers   as well  On the supply side, given the ample liquidity in financial markets, it seems unlikely that   the subprime problem will cause major changes in overall credit availability or pricing    Turning to business investment, none of my contacts reported any major changes in   capital spending plans one way or the other  That said, I did sense that businesses had become a   bit more cautious, as David mentioned  A CEO of a major bank thought that some of this   caution was due to the news in the subprime market, but he didn’t think that this was impinging   on spending in a meaningful way  As noted by the head of a major private-equity firm, who is   on our board, the recent volatility in financial markets has not significantly altered the   availability or terms for financing, even for riskier projects  Private-equity firms continue to   raise large sums, as Janet discussed  So although I’m more concerned about the outlook, I don’t   see the forces in play that would generate a major retrenchment in capital spending  Inventories   are another factor that has weighed on growth recently  We’ve heard mixed reports from District   contacts about how far along they are in the inventory-adjustment process  In steel, the process   seems to be taking longer than expected, but in motor vehicles, both GM and Ford now are   generally comfortable with their inventory positions and currently are not planning any major   changes in their assembly schedules  Finally, some sectors of the economy appear to be on good   March 20-21, 2007 28 of 196    footing  Healthy labor markets continue to support solid gains in consumer spending, and as   Karen discussed, growth abroad continues to support export demand   After balancing all the factors, we marked down our near-term forecast for GDP a bit but   retained the basic contours of our previous projection  The most important difference between   our forecast and the Greenbook is that we do not see as much short-term weakness, but the   uncertainty surrounding this forecast has increased  By itself, the change to the growth outlook   this round would suggest slightly less inflation risk, but other factors point to continued concern   about inflation  The past couple of readings on consumer prices have been disappointing  Oil   prices are higher than at our last meeting, and unit labor costs accelerated noticeably over the   past year  Furthermore, labor markets remain tight  So while the benefits of some factors,   notably the earlier declines in energy costs, will be transitory, pressures from high labor costs are   likely to persist  Markups remain high enough to absorb some cost increases, but these margins   could evaporate quickly, as they did in the late ’90s   In the end, we did not materially change our outlook for inflation  We continue to project   that core PCE prices will increase about 2¼ percent both this year and next  This inflation rate is   too high for my taste, and I think for many of us, and I’m not confident that inflation will   moderate adequately as we move into 2009  One reason for my concern is highlighted in the   Bluebook—namely, that the private sector seems to be betting that our inflation objective is 2   percent or higher  So I continue to think that over the forecast period as a whole the risks to   price stability exceed the risks to sustainable growth    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I mentioned yesterday, my overall   assessment of the economy calls for growth to average somewhat below potential in ’07 and to   improve in ’08, and I expect labor markets will remain tight with the unemployment rate staying   below 5 percent  Core inflation is higher than I like  I see some forces that will help moderate   inflation toward 2 percent, but I’m concerned that these will not be strong enough to push   inflation below 2 percent within a reasonable time frame  So while I recognize the downside risk   to growth, I still think the inflation situation poses the greater risk; and at this point, the costs of a   policy mistake on inflation are greater than those of a mistake on growth  The weak growth   environment does suggest that the short-term equilibrium real interest rate may be lower now; if   so, then maintaining the fed funds rate at 5¼ percent may provide a bit more policy restraint and   with it somewhat more impetus for reducing inflation  However, the analysis in the Bluebook   suggests that this effect will be minor beyond the near term  So with the increased uncertainty   over the growth outlook since our last meeting, it seems reasonable to continue to hold policy   steady while we gather more information  So I do favor alternative B   Let me make some comments on the language  I agree with Cathy Minehan’s comment   on section 2—of stopping the statement after the phrase “moderate pace over coming quarters”    Just put a period there  I agree with everything she said as reasons for taking out the additional   language, and I would just add that, as now written, it mentions housing again  So housing is   mentioned twice in that section, and I think it’s unnecessary to add those additional phrases at   the end  The statement comes out much more succinct and focused if we stop it after the phrase   “coming quarters”  On the question about “predominant” versus “principal,” I prefer sticking   with “predominant” since it was used before in your testimony  It would be my guess that the   definition is probably the same  I don’t think that’s what should determine the use  I just think   March 20-21, 2007 91 of 196    it’s better if we’re consistent here, so I would have a preference for using the same language that   was used in the testimony   On the “additional firming” question that Tom Hoenig raised, I have some sympathy with   him on this  As the Bluebook said, it’s difficult to know how the markets will react to this   change  It’s always tentative how the markets are going to react, but the Bluebook said that now   the judgment is more tentative than usual as to how they’ll react to this change in the statement    I think it will reinforce the market’s anticipation of future policy ease and probably increase   expectations of ease  But having said that, I think the new version does more accurately reflect   our views and the views around this table  So it’s a close call, but on balance I think we ought to   make the change, and I would support the language in section 4 as written     Well, we’ll see  [Laughter]    I agree with that  If you look at what we said last time, the only reference   to any specifics was to housing  If we stop the statement after the word “quarters,” that’s exactly   what we’ll have this time  Now, I would make a minor suggestion  The word “still” could be   changed back to “overall” and just continue what we had last time  “Overall, the economy seems   likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters”  That wording encompasses   that we’ve looked at all of the information and that’s our assessment    That’s why I think the word “overall” would help    I thought about “however,” but preferred not to use that language    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have two introductory comments  One,   thanks to the staff—that was a great job, as others have said  Second, Mr Chairman, I am assuming   that you’re going to seek a consensus of the participants on this, not just of the voting members    I guess I have the advantage or maybe the disadvantage of going near the   end  I think hearing the discussion is an advantage, though  I’m reminded of the famous term that   Alan Greenspan used—“conundrum”—and I view this as a kind of conundrum  We have the dual   mandate in our legislation of price stability and maximum employment or maximum output, but in   our heart of hearts, we believe that we really can influence only one of those in the long term—the   March 20-21, 2007 165 of 196    price stability objective  We also believe that influencing that objective helps us achieve the longer-  term objective of maximum employment or maximum output as well  So if we set firm quantitative   guidelines for price stability—and I’ll define “firm” later—we’re then going to be pushed inevitably   to have some type of quantitative guidelines for output  That consideration leads you to the position   of “Well, let’s not set too firm a quantitative target for price stability  Let’s make it looser  Let’s   make it flexible”  There’s a sense of that from at least some people who have spoken here today    But then, of course, the looser you make it, the more flexible, the more the claimed benefits   decrease as a result  You have less of an anchor to inflation  You have less accountability and   discipline  You have less transparency and less facilitation of internal and external   communications, which are the claimed benefits of it   So I just want to say that I clearly favor policies consistent with low and stable inflation, and   I think we’ve done a pretty good job of it so far if you look back at the Volcker years, the Greenspan   years, and the Bernanke years  I’m still not convinced that we should have a quantitative goal for   inflation at this time  It’s a huge decision  It sets us down a road that I think you just can’t reverse    I don’t see the overriding reason for it as I’ve listened to this discussion  I’ve heard phrases such as   “it’s difficult to quantify the benefits”; “the benefits are not enormous”; “the benefits are small”;   “it’s a close call”  Some people at least believe it’s a close call, and if policy is working well now,   why do it?  I think it is risky  Tom talked about the unintended consequences  Kevin referred to   avoiding that corner of his grid, which I agree with completely  So I would proceed very cautiously   on this     I, too, started at question 4 because, given our dual mandate, I think the time frame is, in a   sense, more important than the target  Someone said that we need to specify a time horizon to be   held accountable, and I agree with that statement  But then what’s the accountability for the other   March 20-21, 2007 166 of 196    part of our dual mandate?  Wouldn’t someone say that it’s appropriate that we be held accountable   for the other part of our dual mandate?  This thought brings me back to the conundrum I mentioned   before  A two-year time frame inevitably raises the issue about the dual mandate, and that short a   time frame doesn’t give proper respect to the dual mandate either  I’m not comfortable using the   medium term, which other central banks have used  I think that over the business cycle is better  I   prefer to have no time frame, or I’d be comfortable with the terminology that Kevin had, which   would work in that direction as well     Getting back to some of the particular points, what index would I prefer?  I’ve talked   publicly about a comfort zone of 1 to 2 percent core PCE, but a long time frame says let’s go to the   overall measure because the overall and the core should be the same over time  So I would shift to   the overall measure; it is more understandable  I can see arguments for the PCE or the CPI  I think   that’s a second-order question that we can talk about once we decide whether to go overall or core    Whether to take a point goal or a range—again, going to a long time frame pushes me toward a   point, not toward a range  Someone threw out a range of 1 to 3 percent or a range around that  I get   nervous when we have a wider range because it gets into the consideration of whether it is a zone of   indifference  Are we indifferent at any point within that range?  If someone said, “Let’s have a   point,” and then we’d have brackets around it and that would give people the idea that we’re more   comfortable with its being within those brackets  But then, if there’s a shock and we go outside the   brackets—let’s arbitrarily say 2 percent and the brackets are 1 to 3 and then it gets up to 31—are   people going to assume automatically that we will respond more immediately to that shock than if it   were 29?  I think that’s the type of situation you get into  So I would just stick with the point  I   don’t see the benefit of going to the brackets  I am also nervous about starting with a high number    To me, 2½ percent is a high number  I think that number would appear to the outside world as   March 20-21, 2007 167 of 196    opportunistic and as a very high number for this central bank to be setting for its long-term   objective  So I would prefer a number below 2 percent   The time frame I’ve already talked about  On the consensus, we don’t want to change the   number once we set it  But we have a governance procedure, and I think this would be an important   governance issue  We’d be operating in the absence of a legislative mandate, and we have turnover   among Governors and Presidents and some pretty soon  [Laughter]  This would probably require an   annual reaffirming of the decision  I think you’d have to do it, given the turnover that would occur    I think it should be a consensus of all participants, not just the voting members  On the survey   question, I smiled when Rick withdrew his suggestion, which he made last October, about having a   survey  The reason I smiled is that I read the transcript, and it’s absolutely amazing  More than half   the people agreed with the suggestion that you withdrew  So, Rick, I just want to say that you have   enormous influence over this Committee, [laughter] but I agree it should be dropped    Today  [Laughter]  On the experiment, it is worthwhile; I think that we   should proceed with it  It will provide us with more useful information  We have some specific   suggestions on the details of it, but we can give those later  "
8124,2007-05-09,"  Dave, you talked about the slowdown in structural productivity in your   report  You have marked down your estimates for structural multifactor productivity for the   second half of this decade from what you had before  Even before that you had a decline from   the first half of the decade to the second half  So I wonder if you could expand a bit on those   comments    Some work has been done on trying to isolate whether these changes   are in the high-tech area or in areas across the economy in which people are not getting as much   improvement in the use of new high technology as they did in the past  Can you shed any light   on that question?    I have just a footnote  A large group of people working this industry are   self-employed  I do not know to what extent you could separate that out; but it, too, is an important   piece of this puzzle    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Conditions in the Seventh District have   improved modestly since my last report  The overall pace of business activity is still rather   restrained, but we have seen some pickup in our manufacturing sector  The key issues regarding the   national outlook are the same as the ones the last time we met  How will the residential investment   puzzle settle out, and can we explain this puzzling weakness in business fixed investment?   Based on the data that we’ve received since March and my contact calls this round, I’ve   become somewhat more optimistic about investment and somewhat more pessimistic about   housing  At the same time, higher gasoline prices have the potential to weigh on consumer   spending  So on balance our growth projection for ’07 and ’08 is a bit lower than it was in March    We now think that growth will average moderately short of potential over the remainder of ’07 and   then run close to potential in 2008   However, our GDP numbers are a bit higher than the   Greenbook’s, reflecting both a smaller shortfall from potential this year and a somewhat higher   assumption about the rate of potential output growth   Indeed, there has been some good news regarding the near-term outlook  First, the   international outlook continues to improve  Many of our contacts noted exceptionally strong   demand from abroad, particularly for capital goods  Second, although we’ve been actively looking   for spillovers from the problems with subprime mortgages, we have not yet seen major effects on   pricing or the supply of credit in other markets  That is not to say that we have not heard of any   effects  One of our directors, the CFO of a major national homebuilder, noted that tighter   underwriting standards are reducing housing demand somewhat outside the subprime sector    May 9, 2007 26 of 130    Consumers still appear to have ample access to financing  For example, the head of GM noted that   banks were making more auto loans with six- or seven-year maturities in order to lower monthly   payments for liquidity-strapped consumers   Finally, as I noted earlier, we feel a bit more confident in our assumption that the weakness   in BFI will turn out to be relatively transitory  I don’t want to make too much out of one month’s   noisy data, but the latest readings on capital good orders and the PMI (purchasing managers’ index)   were encouraging, and most of the comments from my business contacts have been positive in this   regard  The impression I have from these discussions is that the pause in investment spending is   showing early signs of ending; but this is very early, and we clearly need to keep monitoring   developments carefully   Beyond the near-term cyclical developments, the changes in structural productivity in the   Greenbook highlight an important source of risk to the longer-run outlook for sustainable non-  inflationary growth, as Janet just discussed  There is a lot of uncertainty about the components of   structural productivity  In our view, we haven’t seen enough evidence yet to mark down structural   productivity as much as the Greenbook has  Consequently, our estimate of potential output growth   is a bit higher than that of the Greenbook   With regard to inflation, the incoming information has caused the forecasts from our   indicator models to come down a bit  They now project that core PCE prices will rise 2¼ percent   this year and 21 percent in ’08  But we do not see any progress beyond that  If we carry our   models out to ’09, they have inflation staying at 21 percent, higher than my preferred range    Furthermore, I see some upside risks to this forecast  Neither our GDP projection nor the   Greenbook’s generates any meaningful resource slack over the projection period, and then there are   the higher costs for energy and other commodities and increases in import prices  So we will be   May 9, 2007 27 of 130    relying heavily on stable expectations to keep inflation in check  I believe we are currently   achieving some implicit tightening of policy by keeping rates on hold during this period of sluggish   activity, but this restraint will wane if the real economy returns to potential by early next year as we   expect  So I continue to think that the risks to price stability dominate the risks to sustainable   growth    Can we hire him as a consultant?  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  If you step back from the discussion and   just think about the policy position, we’re in a difficult position because inflation continues to   run higher than most of us think is appropriate but economic activity seems to be in a soft patch,   as you said in your summary of the comments, Mr Chairman  I think alternative B—keeping   the fed funds rate at 5¼ percent and the language—is the appropriate one for today  If we were   to take the suggestion of using the sentence from alternative C about considerable uncertainty   surrounding the inflation judgment, how would the markets interpret this change, regardless of   how we meant it?  I think the markets would immediately interpret it as less emphasis on   inflation from our standpoint  I think they would also say, “Well, there’s now more uncertainty,   or the FOMC sees more uncertainty today about inflation than it did at the last meeting”  I don’t   think either statement is accurate     If we delete the phrase “high level of resource utilization,” they will say that we’re less   concerned about high levels of resource utilization than we were before  We’ve had this phrase   in the statement for a long time  At some point we want to take it out, but when we do the   change to the statement would be very significant  I wouldn’t do it until we felt that, in the   context of looking at the overall statement in a very careful way, making that change had some   May 9, 2007 95 of 130    major benefit  There is a virtue in making few changes in the statement unless we have a   specific objective in mind or a specific message  So I would strongly oppose making that change   in the statement  On the phrase “on balance,” I guess I was persuaded by Vincent’s description   that this helps us give the impression that we’re smoothing through the recent data  So on   balance, I would keep “on balance”  [Laughter]    Just a logistical question, Don  On the survey, I thought I heard you   say that you were going to send it out in the next couple of days?    The only question I had is about the other iteration we’re going to go   through now, commenting on the staff draft over the next two weeks  I think it would be good   for us to go through that experience before you send the survey out  "
8147,2007-06-27,"  Also, on exhibit 8, the net worth chart in the top left-hand   corner—I thought I heard you say that this was high by historical standards  So there are   two things here—the stock market has been strong, and then housing prices have been   very weak  I assume if you run this out into another year, the line is going to keep going   down as well  I was just wondering if you could expand on this  Is this higher than you   expected it to be at this particular time?    On a longer-term trend basis, where would you expect it to   stabilize or to level out?   June 27-28, 2007 30 of 261     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Conditions in the Seventh District   have changed little since my last report  Overall activity in the District is lagging the   nation, mainly because of the continued difficulties of what we now call the Detroit   Three, formerly known as the Big Three, [laughter] and their suppliers  But other sectors   of our region are doing better—notably, a number of manufacturers outside autos—and   consumer spending is moving forward at a moderate rate   Looking at the outlook for the national economy, the Greenbook baseline forecast   has growth recovering to potential and core inflation stabilizing at 2 percent  Our outlook   is not much different  We see growth returning close to potential  Assuming that   monetary policy maintains its slightly restrictive stance, we think inflation will edge a   shade below 2 percent by 2009  That would be a good outcome, and I sure hope we get   it   June 27-28, 2007 39 of 261    The biggest news since the May FOMC meeting is the adjustment in financial   conditions  The change in fed funds futures brings market expectations into better   alignment with what I think will be the appropriate path for monetary policy  I’m not   sure, however, how much restraint we can expect from the increase in long-term interest   rates  As the Chairman heard from our directors last week, the effects can be muted by   ample liquidity in the financial markets  One of our directors, who heads a large private   equity firm, says that he does not see much of a change in the lending environment    Financing for even high-risk projects continues to be readily available at quite favorable   rates and terms  Notably, such loans are being made with few covenants and no   automatic default triggers   Of course, the housing market remains a risk  Like the Greenbook, we continue   to expect large declines in residential investment through the end of this year, and I   remain concerned that builders may need to cut back even more to reduce the high   inventory of unsold homes  Our Detroit Branch director, who is CFO of Pulte Homes,   noted that two-thirds of their sales usually occur between the Super Bowl and Memorial   Day  Sales this year in that period were sluggish and relatively unresponsive to price   discounting  Accordingly, he is not looking for a turnaround in housing markets before   ’08  Another director, the head of US Gypsum, agreed that it would be ’08 before we   could expect a pickup in housing   With regard to consumer spending more generally, some contacts noted the   impact of higher gasoline prices  A developer of malls and shopping centers downgraded   his expectations for the rest of 2007, but he is not overly pessimistic and is expecting   retail sales in the second half to remain near their first-half pace  Both GM and Ford   June 27-28, 2007 40 of 261    believe that the higher gasoline prices are holding down the overall level of motor vehicle   sales in addition to moving the mix of sales away from SUVs and toward cars  At this   point, they believe that higher interest rates are having only a marginal effect on demand    Both are predicting that total light vehicle sales will be about 165 million units in 2007    That is the same as the pace predicted by the participants in our annual outlook   symposium that we held in Detroit earlier this month   But the rest of the manufacturing is doing better than autos  Producers of heavy   machinery and agricultural equipment continue to report strong demand  The Chicago   purchasing managers’ report, which is confidential until its release this Friday, was 602   in June; that reading is down only a bit from its very high one of 617 in May  Some of   this strength reflects strong growth abroad, which is fueling the demand for US   products, as we talked about during the chart show  Indeed, I think that there may be   some upside risks to the GDP forecast from faster-than-expected export growth  Labor   markets continue to be strong, and we heard the usual stories about selected labor   shortages and associated increases in wages  One exception is the soft demand for   temporary workers, but this could be normal for a mature business cycle   Turning to prices, our contacts seem to be a bit more pessimistic about the   prospects for inflation  We heard concerns that higher energy prices would boost   transportation costs and that the demand for food stuffs from abroad and the booming   domestic ethanol market are pushing up food prices  In contrast to the anecdotes, the   incoming data on core inflation were better than expected  Our indicator models revised   down a tenth or two from the last round; they now have core PCE inflation being about   2 percent this year and next and then edging down to 18 or 19 in 2009  Without any   June 27-28, 2007 41 of 261    meaningful resource slack, this improvement would require a comparable adjustment in   inflation expectations, which may be difficult given a prolonged period of core inflation   at or above 2 percent  So I continue to think that the predominant risk remains that   inflation will not moderate as expected    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am very comfortable with the   policy stance—keeping the rate at 5¼ percent  I think policy is in the right place  It is   moderately restrictive but not restrictive enough to cause us any problems, particularly in   the housing area    June 27-28, 2007 106 of 261    In terms of the statement itself, I am comfortable with alternative B, as written or   as modified by Don Kohn  We could talk a bit more about where that word “pressure”   should be when you compare it with the last statement that we had, but that is a very   minor point  The key in this statement is dealing with the fact that core inflation,   according to our forecast, is going to be 14 percent in the second quarter  It was 24 in   the first quarter, 14 in the second, and then it goes back up to 22 and 22  That is really   the key because, when you see inflation improving and then going back up again and   juxtapose that against the longer-term forecast that we have come up with, which shows   some improvement in inflation over time in ’08 and ’09, it is a delicate balance as to how   we present this in the statement  I think the way alternative B has been formulated   captures that  I had suggested a slightly different approach  I don’t feel strongly about   this, but you could also take that first sentence in section 3, which says “readings on core   inflation have improved modestly in recent months” and just add the phrase “but part of   the improvement may be transitory”  But as I said, I am comfortable with either   formulation here  I think it accomplishes the same objective    Could you read that again?    Is the subcommittee making a recommendation on any of these?   June 27-28, 2007 134 of 261     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, want to thank you for putting   this proposal on the table  I think it will help this discussion, and I find myself agreeing with   everything you recommended actually  I’m a little frustrated  I can’t find anything to   disagree with  [Laughter]  But let me mention a few nuances  On the question of whether it   is helpful to do this in the absence of a quantitative inflation objective, I think that on   balance it is  It does move the ball forward  In line with Bill Poole’s question earlier, it’s an   incremental step, but a very significant incremental step forward and one that on balance   will help provide more information  If at some point in the future the Committee decides to   have a quantitative objective, it would be an important part of that process  In any case,   you’d have to do it as well   On the questions that Don Kohn asked us to comment on specifically, I think that,   yes, we should proceed with the enhanced projections and four times a year is a good way to   June 27-28, 2007 156 of 261    do it  I like the total inflation approach, looking at it on a long-term basis, because it   clarifies the confusion between core and total, and over time they should clearly be the   same  Regarding the write-up, my recommendation is to put it as an appendix to the   minutes to keep it as simple as possible  I think that putting it as an appendix simplifies it   because then you can just lift it out and use it those two times a year for the Monetary Policy   Report, and it just eliminates any possibility of confusion between the two  If the timing of   your testimony before the Congress is such that you need an expedited process for that   appendix, it’s easier to do it that way  It just simplifies it for everyone, and there’s just less   risk of confusion  I think it would be easier for the staff as well   I like the idea of the three to five years, by the way, for the longer term  That is   helpful in terms of explaining this to the public  I know some people are concerned that it   raises questions about what potential output is and so on, but you’re giving a range, and I   think it helps just to explain the complexity of this  Having the longer-term period would be   helpful as well   Getting back to Vince’s specific questions here—should we share them?  Yes  I like   the way you’ve used the fed funds rate path, and I like the uncertainty and risk  About   finalizing projections, I agree completely with what Don said  The information should be   what we have in hand at the time of the meeting because we all should have the same cutoff   point for the projection, and that’s the logical cutoff point, and then maybe give people a day   or two to update them or modify them based on what they heard at the meeting  But it   should be a very clear cutoff—the day of the meeting     About expediting the minutes, I guess I would have one disagreement here  I   disagree with Don on this  The benefits of expediting them would be very minor compared   June 27-28, 2007 157 of 261    with the potential costs in terms of additional staff resources that would be needed  I think   we have it just about right now  Again, if you shorten the schedule, you can’t lengthen it   again  So I would just keep it where it is now   I just mention one other little aspect, and that relates to the histograms  I agree we   should use them—they will show the outliers in the projection, which is fine  Again, using   them shows the diversity of views  There is a risk here that some of the outliers may over   time want to move more to the center, but so be it  I don’t think that is a great risk, but I   think it is something we should recognize might occur here  So on balance, I think the   proposal you have put forth is very, very good, and I agree completely with it    Obviously, the two would have to be drafted very carefully to   make sure that they are in concert and that there are no inconsistencies in them  But I   June 27-28, 2007 162 of 261    think doing so is clearly manageable because one is a set of longer-term projections and   the other is a discussion of the shorter-term outlook    Yes, whatever the timeframe is for the projections    Regarding the first question, the statement, I think the process is   working well at this point, and so I don’t see any need for major changes in it  Given the   consensus on moving forward on these projections, I think that fits in quite well with the   existing process we have for the statement  My feeling is to minimize forward-looking   comments in the statement  We never used to do this, and then we got into it with phrases   like “considerable period,” and “patience,” and so forth, and then we evolved to a statement   in which we say “future policy adjustments depend on the evolution of the outlook for   inflation” and so forth, and the data coming in  So we don’t really have a forward-looking   statement currently, but my preference is to use forward-looking statements only when it   really is important to serve a specific purpose for the Committee  I tend to agree with Jeff   Lacker that you could drop the last part of the statement   On the governance issue, it seems artificial not to vote on the entire statement   because we spend so much time talking about all parts of it  So on balance I would say, yes,   we should vote on the entire statement  One issue was raised in the background material   about whether the statement should be the Chairman’s or the Committee’s  I think it should   be the Committee’s  It would put the Chairman in an awkward position not to have it as a   statement of the Committee  If it wasn’t a statement of the Committee, people would try to   pull us apart by asking us questions individually as to whether we agree with “the   June 27-28, 2007 206 of 261    Chairman’s statement”  So I think the process we have now is just right and that it should   be a Committee statement    No, I should have clarified that  No, in terms of comments in the   statement about the outlook for the economy, yes, I think that’s fine  I was thinking of the   outlook for policy    No, when appropriate, I would keep that  But I was thinking   primarily of the last sentence that we had happen there  My recollection is that it evolved   from “a considerable period” to “patience” and so forth, and then we got into “it will depend   on the outlook for inflation and economic growth”  "
8171,2007-08-07,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will make some comments later on, but I   just want to add that I counted 104 meetings, too  [Laughter]  It has been a privilege and an   honor to serve on this Committee, and I will miss the intellectual stimulation, the camaraderie,   and the spirit of doing what is best for the American people  Thank you     August 7, 2007 3 of 136     An excellent presentation, Bill  One area that you talked a bit about was   the commercial paper market  That made me uneasy because this segment is different from the   other segments of the market that you were talking about, and obviously that short-term financing is   crucial to companies  I wonder if you could expand on your comments there    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Conditions in the Seventh District have   changed little since our last meeting  We continue to lag the nation largely because of   difficulties in the auto industry  Our contacts thought that the US economy had softened a little   since June but that international sales continue to be strong  They also voiced continuing   concerns about input cost pressures  There is no good news to report on residential construction    Some of my contacts again pushed back their expectations on when housing markets would   begin to improve and are now saying later in 2008  We did hear some upbeat comments from   our directors about nonresidential construction in the District, but manufacturers of heavy   equipment indicated that they were seeing less demand for products that are used in   nonresidential construction  We also heard some less-optimistic reports about consumer   spending  A major shopping center developer and operator scaled back his expectations for the   second half of this year and now thinks that spending will be softer than in the first half  In   addition, a large national specialty retailer saw a broad-based slowing in its sales over the past   six weeks  Still, no one was overly pessimistic  In our own forecast, we assume that the   weakness in consumption relative to trend during the second quarter was largely transitory,   perhaps a reaction to the run-up in gasoline prices   Regarding the motor vehicle sector, the major topic of discussion is the current labor   negotiations and the possibility of a strike in September  I get the sense that the odds of a   walkout are small because both the automakers and the UAW think that a strike would be very   damaging  As our director who heads the Michigan AFL-CIO noted, a strike would be mutually   assured destruction  The UAW realizes that the negotiations are occurring against the backdrop   August 7, 2007 28 of 136    of very bad economic conditions in the traditional automaking regions  For example, since 2000,   Michigan has lost 400,000 jobs  That’s an 8½ percent decline in employment  A strike would   be seen as just adding to these economic woes  So from all my discussions with management   and labor, my impression is that the climate for change underlying these negotiations is stronger   than it has been in the past, but I am not sure how big a move the UAW leadership thinks it can   get approved by its members   Of course, the major development affecting the forecast since the last round is the turmoil   in credit markets that we were talking about earlier  Our director who runs a major private   equity firm made a number of interesting comments regarding the difficulties that banks were   having selling off loans that had been made to risky borrowers with extremely beneficial terms,   such as covenant-lite and an option to accrue interest charges  The bottom line is that he thought   that after the current shakeout there would be fewer buyouts and that pricing and terms would   become more reflective of risk  Going forward, it seems likely that the market will favor so-  called strategic buyers, the nonfinancial firms that are looking for acquisitions that would   directly enhance the efficiency and scale of their business operations  So while we are concerned   about the negative implications of tighter credit conditions, markets may now do a better job in   pricing the tradeoff between risk and return, which is a positive development   So how might these financial developments affect the real economy?  If sustained, the   fallout of credit market jitters on the stock market and other assets would weigh on spending   through the standard wealth-effect channels  With regard to the credit markets themselves, the   key question is how many of the deals that are now being canceled or scaled back would have   resulted in an expansion of business activity as opposed to simply transferring ownership  Given   the modest changes in interest rates on higher-rated debt, continued growth in C&I lending, and   August 7, 2007 29 of 136    ample internal funds of nonfinancial firms, the cost of capital for most investment projects   probably has not risen substantially  So the first-order effects on spending will likely be limited    Of course, this could change quickly in the current volatile markets, and we will need to monitor   these developments carefully, or should I say you will need to monitor these developments   carefully  [Laughter]  However, right now, putting all these factors together, we view the   developments in credit markets as a risk to the near-term forecast but not a reason to lower the   outlook for growth very much  That said, we, like the Greenbook, have marked down our   assumptions concerning potential  We now see potential as a bit above 2½ percent  However,   relative to potential, our forecast for real activity is not much different from last round  We see   growth averaging close to potential in the second half of ’07, which is stronger than the   Greenbook, but running a touch below potential in ’08 and ’09, which is similar to the   Greenbook   Our inflation forecast also has not changed much since June  We still see core PCE   prices increasing a shade below 2 percent by 2009  But I must say I remain concerned about the   inflation forecast  The standard list of upside risks—the lack of resource slack, cost pass-  throughs, inflation expectations—these could break the wrong way and require a policy   response  So, if potential output growth is, in fact, significantly lower than our earlier   assessment, then you could face some challenges in calibrating policy as the economy and   economic agents adjust to the lower trend in productivity growth    I didn’t know I raised my hand, but I’ll go anyway  [Laughter]  I   certainly don’t want to recommend a change in the fed funds target at this point, Mr Chairman,   so I agree with alternative B in terms of the fed funds rate portion  I do want to go on record,   August 7, 2007 93 of 136    since this is my last meeting, as saying that I’m not agreeing with alternative B because I’m   comfortable with a 2 percent quantitative guideline for inflation  But I am, on balance,   comfortable with alternative B  I am concerned about inflation  I think the improvement that we   see may be transitory, as I mentioned  As President Stern mentioned in his earlier comments,   unit labor costs will likely be increasing, and I think that, although the forecast on inflation looks   promising, there could be significant risks that it might go higher  In terms of the developments   in the financial markets, I think we have all talked about them extensively  There is nothing   more to be said there  At this point, it is a period of watchful waiting  I would agree with   President Lacker, with his comment about paragraph 4 of taking out the phrase that the downside   risks to growth have increased somewhat  I would prefer to see it in the minutes rather than in   the statement, and I would prefer to have paragraph 4 exactly as we had it at the last meeting       I just have another objection to taking out the word “predominant”  I   don’t think the sentence makes any sense if you take it out  [Laughter]  You have to put something   in  You cannot say that it is our only problem    You could just go back to the original language in the Bluebook  It says   essentially the same thing  Just change the sentence around    That is in the Bluebook  "
8205,2007-08-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Don, I was just wondering if you could   review with us the pros and cons of doing something greater than a 50 basis point cut here  I’m sure   you considered that before you made the recommendation    Bill Dudley, did you have anything to add about the 50 basis points in   terms of open market operations?   August 16, 2007 10 of 37     Mr Chairman, may I make just a couple of comments about that?  First, I   strongly support the statement that you’ve drafted for the Federal Open Market Committee, and I   agree with it as it has been presented to us  I think that there is a risk that it will disappoint the   markets, but at this point it’s too early to have a cut in the fed funds rate  Second, I support the   primary credit proposal as well  I would agree with Governor Mishkin, though  I would prefer the   75 basis point cut rather than the 50 basis point cut now  I know it’s uncertain as to whether it will   have any effect, but I do think it maximizes the chance that it would have an effect if we went the   full 75  I view this as a one-time opportunity  If we did 50 now, it would be very difficult to come   back, say, in three days or five days and do another 25 basis points on the discount rate  That would   seem very weak to me  I don’t think you’re going to want to go down another 50 basis points   because then you will have it exactly the same as the fed funds target  So it seems to me to be a   one-time chance  We do either the 50 or the 75  I don’t think we could come back and do it again,   and for that reason I think you maximize the chance of being successful by doing the 75 now    Mr Chairman, may I just ask you whether the FOMC statements will be   issued at the same time?  Will both statements be issued simultaneously at 800 tomorrow morning,   Eastern time?    "
