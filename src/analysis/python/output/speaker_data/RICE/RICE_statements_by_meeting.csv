1084,1979-07-11," Mr Chairman, consistent with my tenure on the  Board, I will be brief Generally, I agree with the projection of the  staff it seems to me that almost all of the data now point to a  recession I would expect a more serious recession than the staff  seems to expect I believe the effect of inflation on household  balance sheets and liquidity will probably produce a somewhat steeper  recession than is projected In other words, the saucer will be  somewhat deeper but not nearly as deep as ‘74-’75 I, too, would like  to see a policy that is as effective as possible against inflation I  think we should do all we can to resist a high inflation rate but, as  has been observed by some others, there seems to be a limit to the  effectiveness of monetary policy as an anti-inflationary instrument  given the kind of inflation we are facing at the present time  Because we are in a situation now that is turning toward recesssion  but obviously with very strong employment figures--as a matter of fact  employment is still rising, though not as rapidly as in April and the  first quarter, and unemployment actually seems to be declining  somewhat--1 would favor holding with the current ranges for 1979  That is, since we are some distance into 1979, since the data still  show a great deal of strength in employment, and since the inflation  rate is very high, I would favor for 1979 staying with the current  ranges, which is alternative B    Yes, the current ranges That was alternative B,  I believe, in the Bluebook However, for 1980, I find it hard to     1/11/19 -26 -    imagine that we would want to follow a more restrictive monetary  policy in a situation of recession than we followed when we were  resisting inflation in a booming economy I would prefer to see us be  prepared to follow an easier policy in such circumstances I would,  therefore, be inclined to follow alternative A for 1980, recognizing  that it's very difficult to make meaningful projections or to have  meaningful notions about what the proper ranges should be out that far  ahead Nevertheless, I think our posture should be one that  contemplates some easing I would like to emphasize that our current  monetary policy is still a restrictive one and alternative A in 1980  will still be a restrictive monetary policy    You’re not talking to the market?    Alternative 11    Money market    No change    I agree, too, but I think the purpose that it  serves from our point of view is perfectly obvious And I think it  would help us at the present time to seem to be willing to be  forthcoming to the Mexicans Because I would be willing at this time  to be forthcoming, that does not mean that I would be willing to see  it politicized with respect to  that does not have the oil potential that Mexico does I don't see  that as politicizing I see that as economic    Well, that depends again on whether it costs us  anything and whether it would be helpful in future relations   countries that have convertible currencies so that those we mentioned  here, including ones I myself mentioned, aren't really eligible My  concern is that once we get into the political game of doing this to  pursue a US political advantage we won't be able to hold to that  line    Mr Chairman, if we are going to go for letting  them down easy or if we put conditions on it by working for the  Treasury's participation, I think we lose whatever advantage might be  gained in doing it So I think we either do it in a way that seems  obviously forthcoming and cooperative or we don't do it  "
1107,1979-07-17," I agree with everything that has been said so far I think we have to watch the situation very carefully and when we are sure that the situation is beginning to get out of hand then we need to consider monetary action At this time I would consider that a very serious step, as Chuck said In the meantime, I would favor a very active interventionist policy--perhaps the stronger interventionist policy we normally would take in circumstances like this--with the hope that it would [avert] any need for monetary action "
1126,1979-07-19," Mr Chairman, I think we should stay with the directive and that means to me that we should let the fed funds rate go up to 10-1/2 percent in accordance with the suggestions that we have heard I guess this is the middle range recommendation At this time, I would not like to see an increase in the discount rate I don't know if it's possible, in lieu of an increase in the discount rate, to suggest to the Federal Reserve Banks that they make access to the discount window less automatic I don't know how feasible that is I recognize that with the rise in the federal funds rate we increase the spread between the discount rate and the funds rate and thereby provide an additional incentive to the commercial banks to use the discount window I think that should be discouraged if at all possible Nevertheless, I would not want to discourage it by raising the discount rate at this time I would, however, like to see the funds rate rise a quarter point Thank you   No, I would favor staying at 10-1/2 percent   No, Mr Chairman, I wouldn't want to go to 10-3/4 percent at this time   Mr Chairman, I understand that this is an increase in the range, but if it becomes necessary--if developments in markets change so dramatically that we feel we have to go to 10-3/4 percent--we will have a chance to do that in another meeting "
1151,1979-08-14," Mr Chairman, I listened with interest to your comments at the beginning of the discussion, and I appreciate a good deal what you had to say I agree [with what you said on] economic policy, increasing prices, and credibility I also agree that if there were some action or set of actions that we could prescribe that would strike a really significant blow against inflation, turn around public expectations of continued inflation, and restore the confidence that you mentioned, that would be an imperative thing to do However, I'm conscious of the need to balance the goal of moving against inflation as well as doing what we can to minimize the impact of recession Obviously the economy today is weakening; even you recognized yourself, Mr Chairman, that the recession may turn out to be worse than the staff now projects Clearly most of the economic indicators are weakening; very few show any strength at all My own feeling is that the recession is likely to be deeper than we now are willing to recognize It may be true that increasing the money supply right now would result in higher prices instead of stimulating real growth, as Mr Willes pointed out But it may also well be true that any restrictive action that we're likely to take, given the causes of the current inflation, would be unlikely to have much effect except perhaps symbolically I doubt myself if any action we take will have any really significant effect in restraining the current inflation  So I would be most reluctant at this time to move in the direction of further restriction I can't help noting that money and credit are already tight and interest rates are very close to their historic highs at the present time To move further in that direction, in the face of the obvious evidence of a weakening economy, seems to me to run the excessive risk of making the recession deeper than it might otherwise be I might be persuaded differently over the next few days or weeks as additional data come in, but at the present time I would prefer to see us follow a steady course--that is, not move in the direction of further restrictiveness But also because up to the present time the unemployment figures have not risen significantly, I would be opposed to taking any easing actions I would therefore want to follow a policy of steady as we go I'd stay with the policy that we had adopted previously I think this would translate, so far as the monetary [aggregates] are concerned into alternative B, keeping the ranges roughly where they were   No, I realize that "
1181,1979-09-18," Mr Chairman, probably not surprisingly, I would  associate myself with the remarks made by Dave Eastburn, Nancy  Teeters, Frank Morris, and Chuck Partee I can therefore be very  brief I think it's time to give more weight to what is happening in     9/18/79 -29-   the real economy The economy is clearly weakening; the staff  analysis is very clear on this It's really very hard to see where  the strength in the economy is that some people are worrying about  Most of the indicators seem to me to point toward weakness and further  weakening in the economy Retail sales in real terms have been  declining since last May Industrial production has turned down GNP  is projected to decline further after the current quarter, which is  close to an end It seems to me that, as Governor Wallich pointed  out, we are faced with a problem of timing And I would say that at  this time it would be inappropriate to take any monetary action that  would have the effect of further weakening an already weakening  economy In response to the concern about inflation, which I share, I  would have to say that in my judgment any action that we might take  today is unlikely to have any effect on the inflation rate within the  next 6 to 9 months So whatever tightening of policy might be adopted  today would be largely symbolic Also, I would note that even at the  current federal funds rate--even with the current degree of tightness  --the monetary aggregates, M1, M2, and M3, would probably fall within  the long-run ranges of growth that have been set for the period from  the fourth quarter of '78 to the fourth quarter of '79 Given the  outlook, there's a strong prospect that the growth in the monetary  aggregates will indeed decline Therefore, in the current  circumstances I would not favor any increase in the federal funds rate  nor would I favor an increase in the discount rate I would want to  stand pat I would not argue at this time for an easing of policy,  but I would certainly argue that any further tightening would be a  dangerous step to take    I would go with Alternative B    Me I didn‘t vote    That‘s right Well, I would prefer a money market  directive  "
1217,1979-10-06," Mr Chairman, I would like to see a wider range on  the federal funds rate    Yes, wider on both the low and the high sides I  would like to see something like 9 percent on the low side and 15 to  16 percent on the high side    Yes    I really don't see how they could say that    Mr Chairman, I would support 46 percent    Mr Chairman, do we have to move on the discount  rate immediately?  "
1237,1979-10-22," I agree that we ought to stay with our present  nonborrowed reserves target I also feel that if this means that the  rates have to stay above--    I would not worry myself if the federal funds rate  stayed in the 15-1/2 percent area, either somewhat above or hopefully  somewhat below Also, I would want to wait for a few days, at least  until Thursday, to have a better idea of what is happening  "
1260,1979-11-20," Steve, is that 9-1/2 percent growth in M1 over  the November and December period what you expect under alternative B  or what would be consistent with the 4-1/2 percent?    What's the likelihood that we'll get 9-1/2  percent over the period [to year-end]?    But that is the most likely rate of increase?    Mr Chairman, I think the staff forecast is a  good one and I certainly am prepared to go along with it It seems  pretty clear that the economy is headed for a contraction in the early  part of 1980 We see evidence of this already but it's obvious that  the increase in energy prices, the prevailing tightness in financial  markets, and a continuing [high] rate of inflation will combine to  make the contraction in 1980 steeper or deeper than was earlier  forecast So the outlook is clearly for considerable economic  weakness in the year ahead   In the face of that, it seems that our choice is between  alternatives A and B; we should be focused more on the effect of such  a decision in the year ahead It was pointed out clearly in the     11/20/79 -23-   Bluebook that between now and the end of the year it doesn't really  make much difference which alternative we choose The main impact of  a choice between alternatives A and B will in all probability be on  the financial conditions that prevail in the early part of 1980 I  agree with a good deal of what has been said I, too, place a great  deal of emphasis on the need to continue to resist inflation  However, I feel also that at a time when we expect economic weakness  to occur we ought not to put the economy in a situation where monetary  policy is exacerbating rather than [helping] We at least ought not  to be operating to worsen the real developments in the economy S o  I  would much prefer to follow a course that would stand a better chance  of providing adequate liquidity in a weak economy--not excessive  liquidity, of course, but adequate liquidity at a time when it is  needed--rather than being in a posture of having to provide reserves  at a time when, as Nancy put it, they will not do very much good   While preferring to lean in this direction, I would also  prefer later on by some months to move more quickly to reverse policy  sooner in the cycle and to tighten monetary policy when it's clear  that the economy is strengthening rather than risk overtightness in a  situation that is clearly weakening So for those reasons I would  lean toward alternative B and I would also be prepared to stay with a  federal funds range of 11-1/2 to 15 percent I think one can no  longer be greatly impressed with the argument that real interest rates  are negative They are now positive and the unfolding situation that  would be consistent with alternative B would also be one that would  lean against inflation    Right, right In relation to that    Now, let me just finish What I had in mind was  late in 1980 or perhaps even early in t19811, whenever the economy  begins to strengthen, I would be prepared to tighten monetary policy    In terms of the money supply and at a much  earlier point than the Federal Reserve normally does In this way  we'd continue to resist inflation rather than err on the side of  maintaining the situation where liquidity would be inadequate [for a1  time     That's what I was getting at You are modifying  alternative C by reducing the borrowing level associated with it    Will it look as if we've departed [from our  original decision1 in any meaningful way?  "
1288,1980-01-08," Well, Mr Chairman, I don't see how we can look much beyond 1980 As a matter of fact, I would prefer not to look beyond the next 3 months   But since we have to look at 1980, I would favor some moderate reduction in the rate of monetary growth for 1980 Since the M1 range we would be reducing from is 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent, [whose midpoint is] roughly equivalent to the rate of growth in the target for 1979, 3-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent would be an acceptable range to me I think the range should be kept fairly narrow, at 3 points So, 3-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent would be acceptable I'd be prepared to see perhaps a slightly higher range up to 7 percent, say, 4 to 7 percent But I could certainly live with 3-1/2 to 6-1/2  -44-    1/8-9/80  percent with a midpoint of 5 percent I know we are supposed to discuss the 3-month target tomorrow, but what happens in the next 3 months is of great importance right now And I think over the next 3 months is a good time to lean rather heavily on monetary growth as compared to over the year as a whole It would have good credibility value and I think it can be done without much harm   Down I think it can be done without much harm It will be a period when unemployment is still relatively low So, I would argue for more restraint, or a rate of growth toward the lower end of the range over the next 3 months with the understanding as the year unfolds that higher rates of growth would be tolerable   Second   May I interrupt, sir? Don't you think the shape or the depth of the recession is already determined now?   So what we do now--   I don't believe that anything we do today is going to make the recession more saucer-shaped or more V-shaped   Mr Chairman, given the forecast for nominal GNP for this quarter which I believe is 5 percent and is, of course, very weak, and given the forecast for the inflation rate which I understand is 15 percent for this quarter, I would--   The consumer price index, yes I think this is a good quarter to try to keep the rate of growth in money at the low end of the 1980 range That would give us leeway to allow it to expand at a faster rate later on in the year if that appears desirable, and I think it will appear desirable So for this quarter I would favor alternative C; I would be comfortable with a 4 percent rate of growth for the next 3 months Also, I think this is not the time to accept a sharp reduction in interest rates, and alternative C will assure that interest rates will not fall significantly So my preference at this time would be for alternative C "
1316,1980-02-04," Mr Chairman, I also tread tentatively in an area like this In general, I am persuaded by Mr Axilrod's theoretical arguments that contemporaneous reserve accounting has advantages in the short run when applied to a reserve targeting approach to monetary control Mostly though, I am impressed by what Mr Sternlight and Mr Holmes had to say, which is that it probably won't make a great deal of difference in how the Desk operates I just have one question that I'd like to ask Mr Axilrod, if I may I assume you are familiar with Irving Auerbach's arguments in favor of lagged reserve accounting I take it that this is essentially an argument that the effects of any shifts in money demand won't be very quickly felt in markets and that the argument is based on the actual behavior of commercial banks in their lending and in their portfolio management I wonder what you would say in response to Mr Auerbach   Well, Mr Chairman, what I wanted to say was said by Frank Morris I have no reason to argue with the staff forecast with respect to GNP, the unemployment rate, and the CPI Given what we know today, these projections seem to me to be the most probable outcome But, I suppose like everybody else, I do have some worries; and one of them is the cumulative effect of the erosion of disposable income on consumer expenditures Consumers may well be prepared to spend less than has been projected in the forecast And, of course, if that happens, there will be further consequences for the economy Now, this may well be offset by the buildup in defense expenditures toward the end of the year So there is some uncertainty But I do worry that the possible shortfall in consumer expenditures may well make the recession more severe than is projected I also worry about the cumulative effects of a restrictive monetary policy If we are successful in damping inflationary expectations, the reaction may well be stronger than we now see, and this may also operate to make the recession more severe But these are just vague worries; I have no  -42-    2/4-5/80  data to support them And for the purpose of making suggestions as to monetary policy, I am prepared to accept the staff's forecast As for a tax cut, I would be opposed to a tax cut at the present time However, depending on how things emerge in the future, a cancellation of the anticipated social security [tax increase] package could well be an appropriate measure But that judgment would await future developments   Mr Chairman, I favor alternative II with a range of 3 percentage points Given the outlook for inflation over the next year, I think we're really going to have to show some reduction in the rate of growth in the aggregates While I agree with Governor Partee that we want to be mindful of the amount of tension that we create in the economy with respect to what we expect on nominal GNP growth, on the other hand I also agree with Governor Wallich that we want to look at this point at M2 with regard to the provision for nominal GNP That brings me to alternative II, with the range remaining at the wider 3-point spread   Is that a proposal, Mr Chairman?   Let me put it this way It makes me unhappy but in the spirit of unanimity I would change my vote and go with alternative III   Well, I surely share [that concern] with you  -66-    2/4-5/80   In light of this vote, I'll shift from my last vote and make it even I voted for alternative III in the spirit of compromise, but now that I know we can get 8 votes for this, which is more acceptable to me, I would like to switch my vote and make it [9]  SPEAKER(?) Let's have a vote on this compromise and see what we get  -72-    2/4-5/80 "
1337,1980-03-07, I would favor raising the [upper] limit to 18 and leaving the lower limit 
1358,1980-03-18," Well, Mr Chairman, generally I go along with the staff forecast It seems to me that the new anti-inflationary program will have the effect of making the coming recession deeper than it might have been and might even bring it on sooner If I have any skepticism at all [about the Greenbook forecast], it's in the area of the timing of the recession The economy appears to be continuing strong, or relatively so If I read the Redbook correctly, most of the businessmen around the country report remarkable equanimity in the face of the economic situation; they just don't seem to be excessively concerned about--or, in any case, feel confident that they can deal with--whatever is down the road It's pretty difficult to find evidence of weakness in the economy aside from housing and autos; one has to look pretty hard One has to look behind the industrial production figures to see that there would have been a decline in industrial production had production of autos and parts not risen Also one has to note that capacity utilization in the primary processing industries and materials-producing industries has declined And, of course, the average workweek has declined somewhat These are about the only signs I see of any emerging weakness  So, I feel that our posture at the present time is about right, with the appropriate tautness in financial markets I don't think alternatives B and C leave us much to choose between Actually, [for M1] the difference between them amounts to about $900 million at the end of June, and that doesn't strike me as being very much money out of the total money supply So, it doesn't really matter too much  -30-    3/18/80  to me whether we choose alternative B or C If we choose alternative B, it appears that we will have a slightly larger volume of money starting in April and a less substantial rate of increase in the third and fourth quarters On the other hand, if we choose alternative C, we will have a lower rate of increase in the second quarter and a higher rate of increase in the third and fourth quarters Given the current situation, it would seem to me better on balance to lean harder in the second quarter and increase the restraint then; that will [show through] in the third quarter and allow for a slightly higher rate of increase in those quarters when we expect the recession to hit Alternative C would probably be more consistent with that scenario than alternative B, but I have to repeat that really it doesn't make a great deal of difference On the funds rate, for now I would favor a ceiling of about 18 percent, but I am prepared to raise the ceiling if market conditions [warrant]   Could I just ask a question? Isn't it true, if we stick to the 4-3/4 percent annual rate of growth under alternative B, that we are going to have to reduce the rate of growth later in the year?   But we are setting the timing of the recession rather precisely, it seems to me And I am not too sure that we're going to get it starting in the second quarter   Well, we're really just talking about a few hundred million dollars [of added M1 growth]   You're absolutely right  -34-    3/18/80   It isn't how high we raise it; it's whether we need to move it at all "
1380,1980-04-22," I have no reason to disagree with the revised projections of the staff It seems to me pretty clear that as a result of recent developments the recession is going to be more severe, that the recovery is going to be weaker, and that we'll be in a period of recession for a longer time than originally expected I agree with much of what Governor Partee has said and what Frank Morris has said I have very little to add to that It seems to me that the basic risks are that if we revise our targets downward, we risk making    4/22/80  the recession worse and that if we stick to our current targets, we risk some misunderstanding of our policy and the inflationary psychology in the market might worsen I would be clearly inclined to take that latter risk I find it hard to imagine that whatever inflationary psychology might develop as a result of a temporary expansion in the rate of growth in money would last for a long time in the face of a nominal GNP growth that is roughly twice the rate of growth of the money supply In other words, if we allow money to grow at 4-1/2 percent against a nominal GNP growth of twice that amount, I find it difficult to believe that inflationary psychology can continue for very long against those facts Therefore, I am inclined to stick with our current targets And I would see the period that we're in-- where we demonstrate that we are sticking with our course and are maintaining our goal of restricting money supply growth--as an opportunity to educate the public on our operating procedure and what it means as well as on our determination to stick to our goals for growth in the money supply   Well, I'm prepared to go along with what you suggest Alternative B seems right, and I would be willing to see one point knocked off the top end of the federal funds range to 19 percent "
1400,1980-04-29," I agree with Chuck Partee almost completely I am concerned, though, about the speed with which interest rates fall If they fall too precipitously and we allow that to happen, I think that runs the risk of giving misleading signals However, I don't see much difference between 14-1/2 and 13 percent and, therefore, I would certainly favor maintaining our present range And if at 13 percent there is still substantial downward pressure on the funds rate, then I would want to have another careful look   We're not going to panic "
1419,1980-05-06," I don't think it makes a great deal of difference whether we lower it to 11 or 10 percent I would go along with either It's a matter of [what level] we expect the funds rate to reach if we continue to follow our objectives So, either 11 or 10 percent [is acceptable to me]; I don't think it makes much difference at this point   I really don't think it makes any difference "
1443,1980-05-20," What are the risks of not applying conditions to the swap line? Everybody seems to be in agreement I don't know what-- Isn't Sweden a good credit risk?   Mr Chairman, may I ask Peter a question? Is there any reason to expect a further back-up in short-term interest rates?   There was a time when we used to think an increase in the money supply would cause interest rates to fall   But, if the economy remains weak, with an increase in the money supply one would expect them to fall   We'd say that we're not really using it We'd try to ease our target growth   Well, MrChairman, I favor alternative B for the reasons that have been given by a number of people I'd like to assure Governor Schultz that I'm still very much worried about inflation and hope that we will bring it under control But at this time I believe the risks of undershooting our targets are greater than the risks of overshooting And I feel that if we adopt alternative A and find in September or October that we are far short of our targets, then we will be in a position--if we take our targets seriously and I certainly hope we do--of having to pump in reserves at a very rapid rate, thereby running the risk of giving the wrong impression again that we're panicking and that we are moving too rapidly toward monetary ease For that reason, it makes much more sense to try to get back on target as early as possible In this case, the earliest practical time is September and I would hope that we could do it [by then] I'm also, at the same time, comfortable with the federal funds constraint of alternative B I'm perfectly prepared to stay with a 9 percent lower limit for the time being And if that constraint prevents our reaching our targets as we move toward September, then I would be prepared to lower that 9 percent at the right time   Mr Chairman? Could I raise a question about the target range and the target itself? It's my understanding that while we set these targets in terms of ranges, we set our objective toward the midpoint of the range, the implication being that if it got above the midpoint we'd be a little nervous and if it got below the midpoint we'd be nervous I sense now some fudging of this objective of trying to hit the midpoint of the range I hear people say it's not the midpoint that's so important as long as we're within the range That's not my understanding [of what we decided earlier]   I'd say it's a matter of the point at which one begins to get nervous   I was thinking about what we decided within the last two or three months   I understand that   It's a question   No The funds rate range is what I proposed, but not the money growth target   Yes   I want alternative B both with respect to the aggregates and the funds range I have accepted the funds range specified here as consistent with the [higher] growth ranges [of alternative B]   I know, but that relates to whether we're going to get back [to the target range] in September or in December "
1464,1980-06-05," Well, my views were well expressed by Governor Partee I don't believe that we should become excessively alarmed if the funds rate, in the normal course of events, falls below the 9-1/2    6/5/80  percent level But I also agree with others that we don't need to decide anything today "
1493,1980-07-09," My question has been answered  -23-    7/9/80   I agree with everybody It's obvious to me that there is going to be a tax cut next year I just hope it's a good one--that is, one that consists in part of a reduction in payroll taxes but also increases investment incentives From my point of view it should have at least these two objectives To increase investment incentives, and hopefully have the effect of increasing productivity, and to reduce the payroll tax burden I would also add that it's terribly important to get people to start to think in terms of tax reform as soon as possible This is separate, of course, from the immediate tax cut issue that is going to have to be dealt with But the sooner we begin to think in long-range terms about tax reform, the better, because it has all kinds of implications for productivity and stimulating investment, and so forth  With respect to wage-price policies, I have a good deal of sympathy for Henry's tax-based incomes policy I don't think there is much chance of getting it, but I certainly would have a good deal of sympathy for it Absent a high probability of getting it, I would probably find myself agreeing with Governor Partee that we should just forget about the wage-price guidelines But, again, I don't know how politically realistic that is at the present time  -43-    7/9/80  With respect to the aggregates, I would favor maintaining the current ranges for the reasons that have been given already I think the credibility problem--I'm speaking now about 1980--is a real one We ought not be in a position of having it said that when the aggregates move in a way that's uncomfortable for us we adjust the ranges I don't think we ought to tamper with the ranges for 1980 Therefore, I would support alternative I, maintaining the present ranges, and not worry too much about where the aggregates come in within those ranges  With respect to 1981, I would favor strategy 1, again for reasons that have already been given We ought to say that we have no reason at this point to adjust the ranges downward in 1981 I hasten to add that six months or a year from now, when we are considering them again, we might well want to adjust the ranges But I see no reason to commit ourselves now to reducing the rate of growth in the aggregates To do so would run the risk of reducing the rates of growth in money at a time when unemployment is rising That is a realistic possibility, it seems to me, and I would not want to be in a position of mechanically having to follow a policy which requires us to reduce money growth at a time when unemployment is still rising So I would favor stating that we see no reason at the present time to change the targets for 1981; however, if the situation unfolds in such a way six months from now or a year from now that it seems necessary or feasible, we will certainly consider it   I don't understand the implications We don't have to raise them as much   Do we have to reflect unanimity on this?   Well, I'm afraid there is [a difference of opinion]  -74-    7/9/80   We don't know; we will keep bringing it down until we find out   So long as it's not assumed that this is our expectation "
1514,1980-07-25, I would certainly prefer 1/2 rather than 1 
1538,1980-08-12," You said that the market accepted the reduction of the discount rate as largely a technical adjustment Does that indicate to you that the market is becoming more sophisticated or was it just a happy circumstance of timing?   Mr Chairman, I come out very close to the position that you set forth for the reasons that you did and for the reasons set forth by Governors Schultz, Gramley, and Partee I would simply emphasize that the outlook for the economy is for a slow recovery--one which will be lackluster and far from robust It also looks as if it is going to be interest sensitive because, as has been noted, the recovery in housing is going to be interest sensitive and the recovery in investment is probably going to be interest sensitive We have to note that under either alternative A or alternative B,  -34-    8/12/80  we're likely to see some increase in interest rates The increase in interest rates under alternative B will be significantly greater than under alternative A And at this point we have to be very careful not to do anything unnecessarily that would choke off the recovery It seems to me distinctly possible that fiddling around [and getting] interest rates up runs the risk, as Governor Partee suggested, of choking off the recovery before it begins So it seems to me that alternative A is a much [safer] course to take   What's the advantage of narrowing the range? "
1575,1980-09-16," Mr Chairman, I can be very brief I mainly want to get on record on the tax cut question I don't disagree in any major way with the staff forecast The only reservation I would have on the staff forecast is the qualitative amendment that was made on the basis of the most recent retail sales numbers I don't see any basis for a sustained expansion in retail sales, and I don't see anything in the personal income data or wage and salary numbers that would lead me to expect a strong or even a moderately strong  -27-    9/16/80  resurgence in consumption expenditures Like most people, I think we are seeing the signs of the early stages of the recovery, a very weak recovery And anticipating the discussion that is coming up, I don't think we ought to do anything to choke off this weak recovery in its early stages  With regard to the tax cut question, I'm pleased for the first time to agree completely with what Tony Solomon said, especially his comments on the intangibles I think that was a very perceptive statement of our situation So briefly, my position would be that it's simply too late to think in terms of a countercyclical tax cut But we have to think in terms of tax reform--tax reform in the direction of increasing incentives to invest, incentives to save, and incentives to improve effort And once an effective rational tax reform program has been developed, I think it would be very important to announce the intent to reduce taxes over a given period in the future In short, I have a great deal of sympathy for the Feldstein proposal of announcing in advance what the government intends to do with respect to taxes and the tax structure   Mr Chairman, I favor alternative A for the reasons set forth by Governors Teeters, Gramley, Partee, and Schultz   End of statement   I know you didn't, but you gave reasons for favoring alternative A "
1598,1980-10-21," I just wanted to inquire whether there has been any official German reaction that has been noticed in the market   Yes, any official reaction Do they seem to be panicking in the government or are they, as Mr Solomon suggested, playing it cool, so to speak?   Mr Chairman, I agree in general with the staff projection The only point on which I have some reservation--I wouldn't say disagreement--is that the staff does not attach much weight to the possibility that consumers may continue to try to defend their current living standards and spend at a level which continues to reduce the saving rate We have misjudged the behavior of consumers before and we may do so again I'm not saying this has a high probability of happening because I recognize that the saving rate is at a low historical level, but it could happen And consumers have demonstrated a marked reluctance to accept lower real living standards I agree with much of what Governor Gramley said [except] in this one respect--that is, a difference regarding the likelihood of continued high levels of consumer expenditures  Now, from a credibility standpoint, I think it's very important to end the year with the aggregates close to the target ranges that we've established I emphasize ""close to"" because I think nothing we're likely to do today will bring all of the aggregates within the target ranges I mean ""close to"" in the sense that M-1A will be well within and M2 may be near the upper end of its target range, with M3 and bank credit, of course, being within the ranges I believe either of the alternatives presented to us will bring us very close to the target ranges at the end of the year I don't think it makes a great deal of difference, so far as our credibility is concerned, whether we get the monetary outcome under alternative A or the monetary outcome under alternative B The significant difference between alternatives A and B is the likely influence on interest rates Following alternative A, we're almost certain to get upward pressure on interest rates in the months ahead We will get upward  -31-    10/21/80  pressure on interest rates in 1981 under either alternative But under alternative B we're likely to get little, if any, upward pressure on interest rates for the remainder of the year and possibly the first month or two of 1981 Interest rates are already at high levels As was pointed out by Frank Morris, compared to other recoveries they're at extremely high levels And at this point they are also positive in real terms We have positive real interest rates I see Governor Wallich disagrees with me but--   So the danger is that by selecting alternative A we run the risk that interest rates will have the effect of eliminating even the possibility of that 1/2 percent growth that is projected for 1981 I don't think we ought to do that and, therefore, I lean toward alternative B   If we split [the difference between] ""A"" and ""B,"" would that imply changing the stated targets?  -49-    10/21/80   Monetary growth targets   Yes "
1624,1980-11-18," Mr Chairman, may I raise a technical question?   Do we have to sell securities in order to finance our purchases of foreign currencies?   Have we tied specific sales of securities to a specific volume of--   How do we know we need funds for financing our foreign exchange purchases?   Our foreign currency purchases?   So when we sell securities, we raise interest rates in the United States, do we not?   Are you saying that the net effect on interest rates in the United States is neutral?   Mr Chairman, I know we often say that we're facing a period of unusual uncertainty But this time I really mean it We obviously face uncertainty in the fiscal outlook resulting from recent political developments Also, as you and Mr Winn mentioned, there is uncertainty in the energy price picture Also, with possible changes in the discount rate and the surcharge, we don't know what bank attitudes will be toward borrowing So the picture is very cloudy Despite that, there seems to be an unusual amount of agreement as to the direction in which we should move I would say that in light of all these uncertainties, the staff forecast is about as reasonable as one could expect, and I see no reason to disagree with that forecast I feel that if we were to take any action that would result in a significant raising of the targets, that would certainly be open to an erroneous interpretation, or perhaps even the right interpretation but certainly one that we would not like to see And it would definitely run the risk of adding to inflationary expectations So, I would not opt for alternative A On the other hand, it seems to me that any further move toward restrictiveness would have the very undesirable effect of making the projected decline in economic activity in the early part of the year sharper than we would like to see or sharper than might prove to be the case if we followed a more moderate course Therefore, I would support alternative B And I agree with Governor Gramley that interest rates  -30-    11/18/80  are now about as high as they need to be So I would combine my support of alternative B with a federal funds range of 12 to 16 percent Now, the growth that we get, of course, may be inconsistent with this federal funds rate range If it is, I would be prepared to see the funds rate somewhat higher--maybe one percentage point higher But I would not like to see that occur without the advantage of additional information "
1646,1980-11-26," I would be prepared to go to 18 I don't see any realistic alternative, although I am uncomfortable with the present level of interest rates "
1665,1980-12-05," I support you, Paul "
1705,1980-12-18," Yes Scott, I understood you to say that some corporate treasurers were expecting a decline in the value of the dollar early next year What's the reasoning behind that expectation?   Mr Chairman, there are formal limits, which I take it have their origin in the instruments that are mentioned in the authorization and the directive and so forth And then there are informal limits that are discussed in the memorandum What is the origin of the informal limits on the currency holdings?   So the informal limits are set by the Foreign Currency Subcommittee?   Well, it's not my language; it's in the [memo]   Who establishes the informal limits?   Mr Chairman, do we have any notion as to what the right amount of foreign currency balances would be and at what point we would feel comfortable that we've accumulated enough?   It must have been 1978   Is there any reason for stating this excluding the yen?   Is this a downward revision from the targets we chose in July or is it a downward revision from the actual money growth we experienced?   Mr Chairman, I'd like to make some general remarks first about the economy and then about long-run strategy With respect to the economy, it's clear that economic activity is still lively That is indicated by the most recent data we've seen on industrial production, capacity utilization, employment, retail sales, the average workweek, and GNP We're in a quarter where we expect GNP to increase at a rate in excess of 4 percent We have seen the latest data, of course, and they obviously add up to strength, with housing starts holding up and real disposable income not slipping very much The major areas where we see weakness are in business capital outlays and nonresidential construction Despite this strength in the economy, it's difficult to see how this expansion can continue much longer in the face of interest rates as high as we are experiencing currently Consumer demand, which has provided the main support to this expansion, seems unlikely to hold up as inflation continues to place strains on household budgets And it's hard to see how households can continue to increase real spending as real disposable income slips, particularly at a time when the saving rate is already low Therefore, I'm inclined to accept the staff forecast as the most probable outcome  However, I do have two concerns The first is that the saving rate, while low, may go lower as consumers try to maintain their living standards That, of course, would impart continuing strength to the economy and that strength could possibly continue further into 1981 than we currently anticipate Now, if we have  -45-    12/18-19/80  underestimated the consumers' tenacity, that would suggest that inflation may become worse and interest rates may have to go higher And ultimately, we may have in reaction to this a sharper deceleration than we would like to see The other concern is that the current monetary restraint and the current high interest rates, particularly if continued longer as I'm sure they will be, may generate unbearable strains in the business sector If that continues and becomes severe, rather than a moderate drop in economic activity in the first half of 1981 as projected by the staff, we may well see a very sharp decline that becomes cumulative And we could find ourselves in or headed toward a severe recession And, of course, if that happens, we will see the kind of thing that Henry fears a great deal We'll see interest rates fall sharply and will probably find ourselves in something of a replay of 1980  Given all this, I think the best we can hope for is an outcome that closely approximates the staff's scenario And I think a policy should be established which would maximize the likelihood that we will get only a moderate contraction or moderate slowdown in 1981 If we adopt a more restrictive policy than is being currently pursued, I think we'll insure that we will get a sharp contraction, which will result in the downturn and the sharply lower interest rates that we're concerned about  With respect to the question of whether we should adjust our growth targets downward from the ranges set in July or from the growth actually experienced in 1980, I think we should move in the latter direction We have been through a year when monetary growth contracted sharply, even declined absolutely, and remained sluggish for a while and then we've seen explosive growth in money, with growth rising above the upper limits of the targets that were established Clearly, we don't know as much about money demand as we need to, and that's an understatement So it would seem to me a mistake to start with targets that we already know to be unrealistic and to a degree mis-specified So I would start with the actual results that we will have seen in 1980 and shave off [some] from that rate of growth I would like to see actual growth targets that have an upper limit somewhere around the actual growth rates we experienced from the fourth quarter of '79 to the fourth quarter of '80 and, as I said, I would shave off from there toward a desirable midpoint This would bring us somewhere in the vicinity of strategy II It seems to me that following the strategy I that is suggested in the Bluebook would be much too constraining for the economy If we are to believe the numbers, we would be buying some possible credibility with the hope of influencing expectations, with a large sacrifice in real GNP in 1981-- nearly a 1 percent decline in GNP--and with no effect on the projected inflation rates If we take strategy II, which seems more desirable to me, we get only a 02 percent higher inflation rate in [1982] and 04 percent more in [1983]; and output is 04 percent higher by 1983 So I would be more comfortable with strategy II as a means of achieving a moderate contraction in early or mid-1981 rather than risking a more severe recession later on with all the attendant instability in interest rates "
1735,1981-02-02," During the period of the study, it appeared that the broader the monetary aggregate targeted, the less variability from these targets I think that's true Was there anything in the study that would suggest that that would always be true--that there would be less variability in, say, M2 than in M-1A or M-1B?   Well, I think that M2 deviated less from its target range than did M-1A and M-1B from their target ranges   That was the question I was raising--whether there was anything in the studies that suggested that would go on in the future  -20-    2/2-3/81   Well, I have a second question   Was there anything in the study that would suggest what the most appropriate [width of the] target ranges would be? Would the most appropriate range be, say, 2 or 2-1/2 or 3 percentage points?   Good point   Well, at some point we might not   It's consistent with low, slow growth   Well, Mr Chairman, nearly all of the economic forecasts indicate little or no growth for this year Our own forecast, of course, indicates almost no growth, at 01 percent for 1981 I would prefer to see the targets set at a level that would permit some real growth during the year But we appear to be committed to this 1/2 percentage point reduction in the target ranges I hope we're not committed to a 1/2 point reduction every year hereafter, but we do seem to be so committed this year It seems to me that any pulling back from that would be interpreted as backing out of our commitment to monetary restraint So, I would go along with what almost everyone has recommended so far--alternative I I would take the target ranges specified under alternative I for M-1A and M-1B as well as for M2 and M3 I take it that the ranges suggested for M2 and M3 are those thought most consistent with the 1/2 percentage point reduction of the M-1A and M-1B ranges  I'd just like to add something else I would normally not want to take political considerations into account, but it seems to me to be an especially bad time to risk any kind of political confrontation The Administration is seeking some real economic growth While it calls for a policy of monetary restraint, it also emphasizes the need for a steady monetary policy The word ""steady""  -119-    2/2-3/81  appears in all of their pronouncements about monetary policy It seems to me that increasing monetary restraint at this time is not a steady monetary policy So, any increased restraint beyond what we have previously committed ourselves to--for example, [going] to a 1 percentage point reduction--I'm sure would be seen as not very steady So, the ranges that have been proposed under alternative I would be the most restrictive, consistent with any possible growth at all   I would throw that out I wouldn't try to explain that   Mr Chairman, did you say two out of three of the numbers would be higher?   But not better than 10   I would go with alternative B That alternative seems to be fairly consistent with the longer-range targets that we adopted, which came out to be someplace in between alternatives I and II Alternative B promises to get us back to the midpoint of alternative II by March So, I would go along with ""B"" and a federal funds range of 14 to 20 percent "
1758,1981-02-24," I accept your proposal, Mr Chairman, for the reasons that have already been outlined    2/24/81   I don't feel strongly either, but I lean toward informal because I don't believe we're taking any significant policy action here today and we may want to take some significant policy action in a few days "
1781,1981-03-31," Mr Chairman, I recognize, like Governor Wallich, that the economy has turned out to be stronger and has remained stronger for a longer period than one would have expected Nevertheless, it's hard to see where the sources of continued strength will be It's hard to see that the saving rate will fall much further than where it is at the present time and, of course, the outlook for growth in income does not leave much room for consumers to continue to spend heavily out of income So, I wouldn't see strength continuing to come from the consumer sector Again, it's hard to see that there will be any strong surge in investment spending So, in contrast to some of the views that have been expressed around the table, it seems to me that the staff forecast is certainly as good as any I have seen and probably better than most For lack of a better forecast, I would base my expectations on the staff forecast  -40-    3/31/81  In the circumstances, I think we need to preserve our flexibility and, as has already been expressed, it probably would best be preserved by alternative B I believe that in the circumstances we should give somewhat more weight to M2 Alternative B would do that to a degree Certainly it allows for a gradual return of M-1B to a lower range in time Hopefully, over the period of the year, we will get back closer to the top of the target range I think the risk of alternative C is that we may force higher interest rates over time-- interest rates higher than are likely to be sustained And we may then find ourselves facing a rather sharp fall-off from the peak rates that might be reached So, I think alternative B is the one that assures us the most flexibility, the most ability to maintain stability, and at the same time maintains a posture of significant restraint   I would prefer 6 percent or somewhat less, but I could accept that   Six percent or somewhat less "
1803,1981-04-28," This is Emmett Rice I agree with most of what everybody has said here, particularly with what Chuck said  -14-    4/28/81 "
1824,1981-05-06, I like the language as it is 
1846,1981-05-18," I'll start off Much of what I've heard from the presidents confirms the feeling I've had about our current situation If I had to characterize the current economic situation, I would say that the economy is slowing from a very high rate of expansion but it is not by any means weak yet I say this because it's hard to see any unqualified indications of weakness Even in retail sales we see, adjusting for autos, an increase And the slowing in industrial production, while negligible, would actually be an increase if it weren't for the coal strike So, most of the indications of weakness --for example in the payroll employment area--are not unqualified On the other hand, there are some fairly good indications of enough strength still left in the economy Business fixed investment is still strong And, of course, capacity utilization has increased So, I would say on balance that there may be some slowing but it's a slowing from a very rapid rate [of expansion] and the economy is not at all weak at this point   Scott, does the Federal Reserve have any independent authority to operate in foreign exchange markets apart from the Treasury--or possibly, in parentheses, in violation of Treasury policy?   I understand the political problem   Legal constraints were what I was asking about   Do you mean from the Treasury?   Mr Chairman, this kind of economic environment is one where most people see strength in the economy and where I would characterize the economy as indicating a pronounced lack of weakness It seems to me that we may continue to see money growth coming in pretty strong And in this environment, it seems to me the really basic question is how rapidly we want to bring M2 and M3 back to within their target ranges--whether we want to bring them back by the end of June or whether we are prepared to wait somewhat longer My own view is that we should try to get M2 and M3 back within their target ranges as soon as possible--that is, by the end of June And alternative C, of course, is the alternative that will do that Alternative C, if we get the results projected, would result in all three of the aggregates being within their target ranges M-1B at the low end, and M2 and M3 at the top I think that is important to achieve If we had an economy that we could be fairly sure was weakening and if money demand was slackening, we could take a longer time to try to bring these aggregates back to within their target ranges But in the current circumstances, with recent money growth having been so strong and with every possibility that strong money demand will continue, I would see less risk in trying to get the aggregates back [on track] Of course, to pursue alternative C would imply, as has been pointed out, substantially higher rates than we have now and somewhat higher rates than we would anticipate if we pursued alternative B That is, we would have these higher rates in the short run, or at least during the month of June and possibly longer However, by the fourth quarter, if I read Appendix II [of the Bluebook] correctly, alternative C would yield lower short-term interest rates and alternative B, if pursued, would yield higher interest rates So it's a question of whether one wants to take higher interest rates now or in the fourth quarter I would opt for taking them now And that would lead me to favor alternative C A final reason for favoring alternative C right now is that we really are not too sure what we are working with when we rely exclusively on M-1B In these circumstances I think we ought to attach more importance to M2 and to getting M2 back within the target range, so I favor alternative C   Why don't we find out what people can accept "
1884,1981-07-06," Well, Mr Chairman, I agree with the general thrust of your opening statement, especially the part where you seemed to say that we should take the risk on the side of more softness in the economy rather than try to counter any sluggishness that might occur in the short run From my point of view, probably the most critical question right now is whether we continue to do what we said we were going to do--whether we are going to continue to reduce gradually the growth of money--or whether we are going to try to adjust our position in light of what we think we see developing in the economy To me it's extremely important to be perceived as doing what we said we were going to do Rather than try to adjust to the short- run changes that we see, which might make more sense from the short- run point of view, I think it's better to continue to do what we said we were going to do That is likely to have a much more decisive impact on inflationary expectations So, for that reason I would favor, as have others, keeping the 1981 targets where they are I would not change the ranges at all for the reasons set forth by several of you, particularly those set forth by Tony Solomon I would also for the rest of 1981 opt for alternative 2 on page 8 But it's important to try to keep M2 and M3 as close to their target ranges as possible, and therefore, I would be willing to accept growth in M-1B of 3-1/2 percent [or less in the second half of this year] In the interest of trying to keep M2 and M3 close to their ranges, it's important to accept the shortfall for the rest of the year in M-1B  As for 1982, I would favor strategy 2 as indicated on page 12, accepting the 3-1/2 percent growth for M-1B for 1981, and moving back to the 4-1/4 percent midpoint of the range for 1982 That, I think, implies some variant of alternative II on page 14   You may be right   What I was going to propose is that, in effect, we do what we said we were going to do and reduce the M-1B range by 1/2 percentage point So, [for 1982] I'd move to a range of 3 to 5-1/2 percent and leave the ranges for M2 and M3 where they are right now   Did I summarize it wrong?   Well, Mr Chairman, I favor alternative B It seems to me that if we pursue alternative C, we run a substantial risk of not getting M-1B back even to the lower part of the target range We just may not get back to the range Alternative B gets us back to the range by November and we're still on the low side, so alternative B makes more sense to me And I would go with a federal funds range of 16 to 22 percent and borrowing at $2 billion   $2 billion That's the borrowing that goes with ""B"" I'm being a purist   That's what one has to expect with a--   And $2 billion would be consistent with what kind of funds rate?  -69-    7/6-7/81   But is it consistent?   I thought $2 billion would give us 18 percent   That's what Steve just said   But in answer to my question just a minute ago, I thought you said 18 percent   How about 3 to 5-1/2 percent? "
1921,1981-08-18," Did I hear you say that the Germans considered their operation a success?   Why did they consider it a success?   The dollar moved up afterwards   Mr Chairman, most of what I'd planned to say has already been said, so I can be very brief I agree with earlier comments that the staff's projection seems to be the most probable outcome The only area where I could imagine some possible deviation is in the consumer spending projection It seems to me possible that, based on expectational and improved confidence factors, there could be higher growth in consumer spending than is forecast Despite the recent data on employment, retail sales, and industrial production, it appears that there is still considerable slack in the economy, even sluggishness At the same time, as has already been pointed out, there is no evidence of any marked tendency toward deterioration or further weakening or of cumulative weakness With the unemployment rate stable at the present time and perhaps even declining most recently and with inflation easing as it certainly appears to be, the economy would seem to be behaving pretty much as I think one would like The trick seems to be how to keep it behaving this way And in my judgment we wouldn't keep it behaving this way by further restraining growth in the aggregates, nor would we keep it behaving this way if we try to force interest rates down Now, that doesn't mean that I would not like to see interest rates come down; I would But I don't think they should come down as a result of changing our short-run or even longer-run monetary objectives Rather, I would prefer to see them come down as a result of developments in the economy I think the best chance of keeping things delicately balanced, as I believe it was described, is to stay with the monetary  -23-    8/18/81  objectives we've stated in the targets and try to maintain Federal Reserve credibility to the extent possible  Obviously, at the present time we don't think we can keep both M1 and M2 within our target ranges I would favor, at this time at least, giving at least equal weight to M-1B [and M2] and not having M2 as a constraint If we tried to constrain the growth of M2, that would further restrict our monetary growth objectives and would of course run the risk of significantly higher interest rates--higher interest rates that we do not need at the present time So, I would for the moment try to stick with the objectives that we adopted at the last meeting I would not restrict them further That has the effect of pushing M-1B closer to the lower bounds of the target range   If things are so bad in the Middle West, why haven't they fired more people?   Is it down substantially?   Higher interest rates "
1948,1981-10-05," Steve, did I hear you say that if we tried to increase M-1B so that it moves back toward the lower end of the target range from where it is now, given the demand for M-1B, that would in effect be inflationary because we would be giving people more money presumably than they want to hold? Is that correct?   Any increase in M-1B?  -20-    10/5-6/81   Well, Mr Chairman, first of all I'd like to say that I agree with a lot of what Governor Gramley said the first time I'm not sure about his second statement   No, not quite I think the staff forecast is about right I agree with their view that there's no solid evidence at present that the economy is in the process of a sharp downturn, despite the softening tendencies that we see But it seems to me there is a danger that the weakening that we see in progress will gain momentum and could possibly become cumulative That is just a possibility I don't see it, but it's possible And much of what I've heard this morning increases my anxiety that there may be more financial strain out there than we recognize at the moment One possible result of that is that a downturn could gather momentum In the circumstances, I think our policy should seek to avoid encouraging any process of a cumulative downturn It would not do that, I believe, if we accepted a much lower rate of growth in M-1B than was targeted On the other hand, I think policy should avoid any attempt to achieve a precipitous easing of money and credit at this time What we should do is to aim at maintaining current conditions while gradually trying to nudge M-1B back in the direction of the lower end of its target It may well require some slight reduction in interest rates to maintain current conditions, but I think that would be desirable at the present time This suggests to me that alternative B would make the most sense in the current situation   On M-1B I would go along with raising the lower end of the federal funds range up to 12 or even 13 percent and I would like to see borrowing fall no lower than, say, $500 to $600 million   Well, I said I'm for alternative B I said that earlier   But in light of the discussion I would go along with raising the lower end of the federal funds range under alternative B from 11 to perhaps as high as 13 percent And I would not want to see the borrowing fall below $500 million or maybe even $600 million   On borrowing I would be inclined to want to do that   13 to 17 percent   The estimate in the Bluebook is that $200 to $300 million of borrowing is consistent with a 14 percent funds rate That's not cutting interest rates in half   But if we keep borrowing up at $800 million, we are not going to have to worry about a 12 or 13 percent funds rate "
1973,1981-11-17," What was the second occasion when you considered intervention?   There was no one particular event except the Chancellor's health?   Excuse me, Mr Chairman Is it too late to ask Mr Sternlight a question?   Well, I'd like Peter to expand on that last statement What makes you so sure that the credibility of the System would have been called into question more vigorously had we tried to keep money growth closer to the targets? Isn't that just your impression? You don't have any hard [evidence]   Mr Chairman, at the last several meetings I've been saying that the economy was sluggish, bumping along somewhere between no growth and very low growth I thought that was a good thing in terms of a desire to reduce inflationary pressures and I thought it would be good if we could keep the economy in that mode But now we see that the economy has not remained in that pattern Nearly all of the indicators point to a recession And, as the Redbook indicates, pessimism is widespread among businessmen It appears to me that the only question really is how deep the recession is going to be My own judgment is that the staff forecast is about right I would differ only slightly as to the timing of the turnaround The staff sees a mild upturn in GNP in the second quarter of next year I do not see a turnaround appearing as early as the second quarter I do not see the mild pickup in housing and in automobiles and in inventory that the forecast is based upon I think a turnaround has to await the tax cut of midyear and that it probably will be toward the end of the third quarter before we see any real signs of recovery So, I would put the recovery further back in time,  -15-    11/17/81  which means that we're likely to see very low economic activity continuing longer In other words, the duration of the recession would be longer than is projected I'm also more optimistic about the inflation picture for next year In my view the course of inflation will be somewhat less The staff is projecting an average inflation rate of something like 88 percent, and I would expect it to be slightly lower than that  I was interested to hear Mr Axilrod say he saw significant differences between this downturn and the one that occurred in the spring of last year I certainly agree with that This is a much more classic recession I don't think it will be V-shaped; I don't think there will be a very quick snapback because the conditions are different and the basis for a quick snapback in consumer and business spending seems not to be present now The main issues that seem to be before us then are (1) How much of a drop in interest rates would we find acceptable in the current circumstances; and (2) How much of shortfall in the growth of M1-B from its target range would we find acceptable And related to both of these questions is, of course, the credibility issue What happens to our credibility if we allow interest rates to fall below whatever level we find acceptable and what happens to credibility if we continue to allow money growth to fall substantially below the target range? I see our credibility being called into question much more when we are seen as letting up in a situation where inflation is gathering momentum and when interest rates are rising [than if] money is tight and we appear to be letting up--and I emphasize appear--in a situation when interest rates are falling and the economy is weakening In current circumstances it's much more important to be perceived as sticking to our objectives and taking our monetary growth target seriously Therefore, at present-- and I refer now to the period over the next six weeks to two months-- it's important to be seen as not contracting the narrowest monetary aggregate, M1-B, further than we had intended to six weeks ago I would think that our credibility depends a great deal at this time on whether we are willing to appear to move in the direction of trying to achieve our target for M1-B   It depends on what phase of the cycle we're in, Henry   Why does 7 percent for the next [5] weeks mean that we favor 7 percent growth next year?   I didn't think so   Well, we still have--   That's right   I would prefer to see alternative A, but I'd be willing to accept the money growth figures for alternative B with the borrowing at $200 million and a federal funds band from 9 to 14 percent   I'm willing to do that   Mr Chairman, no one has really [addressed] Frank Morris' point about what has happened since the last meeting to justify making our targets more [restrictive] than they were   I don't think that justifies it   I don't think that justifies anything   We all agree on that   That's the way it's going to look   Well, we're going to be "
2003,1981-12-21," Mr Chairman, I hope I'm in better voice this morning than I was yesterday I would like to say a few words about credibility I agree with most of the varying earlier comments on the importance of credibility However, it seems to me that credibility has several dimensions--certainly more than one Many people I have talked to feel that it was the high interest rate policy of the Federal Reserve that caused the current recession and they wonder what kind of institution this is that really wants to cause a recession On unemployment there are some credibilities involved, too, except that it is negative credibility In the long run, not necessarily in the short run, we have to take account of this negative credibility I agree with a good part of Governor Gramley's observation that some part of the current credibility that we seem to be enjoying, especially from the investor community, is based on the perception that we are willing to accept very high rates of unemployment as a means of fighting inflation However, over time we ought not leave the impression with the public that we are indifferent to high rates of unemployment It seems to me possible over time to accommodate both the need to fight inflation, which is the primary objective, and to consider as well the effects of our policy on the economy  As to the target ranges for the aggregates for 1982, Bob Black said much of what I wanted to say about that In the period immediately ahead, ie 1982, we should in the process of maintaining our credibility try to ensure that we do not starve the economy for money and that there will be enough money around to provide for a recovery, which we need Therefore, I would favor narrowing the target range for M1 somewhat I would favor raising the lower limit of the range from 2-1/2 to 3 percent and keeping the upper limit at 5- 1/2 percent I think that was the proposal made by John Balles That would tend to keep our performance closer to the target and reduce the possibility that there will be a repeat of this year's performance, where growth of M1 fell very, very short of the target range If we set the lower limit higher, it would be more likely that the shortfall in money growth would not be substantial So, I would propose a range of 3 to 5-1/2 percent; and 5-1/2 percent for the upper limit, of course, demonstrates that we are sticking with our policy of gradually reducing the rate of money growth But increasing the lower band also will reduce the likelihood that we would starve the economy for money during the period immediately ahead I would also say that we don't want to be too much influenced, in my judgment, by notions of growth in effective money Particularly we should not be in a position of trying to place too much confidence in our ability to predict shifts in money demand I think we should concentrate on the money growth that we can measure With regard to M2, I would stick with the range of 6 to 9 percent that we had set earlier and hope that that range will turn out to be more consistent with the target we set for M1   Do you think we have given monetarism a fair test?   But we don't know what the [employee] reception would be   Yes and no   I don't think we ought to give up on the principle of how to treat these various [monetary measures] We ought to decide where they ought to be   It is harder to understand what is going on   Mr Chairman, I would want to rush to support Governor Wallich's proposal while I can, for the reasons given by Governor Partee   I would say 5 percent for M1 and 10 percent for M2, borrowing of, say, $350 million, and on the funds range 10 to 14 percent   I said borrowing at $350 million and a funds range of 10 to 14 Did you hear what I said about M1 and M2?   Me too   Well, Mr Chairman, you said it was cosmetic, so 4 and 9 percent with the appropriate language would--  -67-    12/21-22/81   I have a preference I didn't know how you were going-- "
2030,1982-02-01," Did your demand deposits increase along with the rest of the country?   Have they fallen off recently?   Well, just quickly, my instinct is to agree with Fred Schultz, largely on the basis that to change the targets for the aggregates at this point would probably damage our credibility I recognize the point that Nancy made that we have somewhat of a conflict here in that if we don't make the ranges again, that's a basis for reducing our credibility But, on balance, I think we do more damage if we change the ranges or fiddle around with the base at this point than we do if we just stick with the current ranges As you know, I've been one of the people who have been worried about the fact that the money supply, up until this month, has not grown fast enough To me the ranges are basically cosmetic This is what we tell the public we want to do If we come in at the upper end of the range for M1 and if we exceed the range for M2 slightly, I for one will not be too worried about that   If we saw an increase of, say, 2 percent over the period, would you rush to resist that?   I'd go along with your proposal, Mr Chairman   It really was not an announcement; it was just a passing remark   I would too "
2057,1982-03-29," Mr Chairman, you expressed my feelings almost exactly when you said there was general support of and agreement with  -24-    3/29-30/82  the staff forecast and some worry, all the same I'd like first to elaborate on something that President Ford said about the staff forecast in relation to outside forecasts What he said is correct with respect to the outside forecasts we look at here, but only some distance out The Board forecast for the second and third quarters is by and large more optimistic than the outside forecasts   From the point of real growth in the third quarter, it is the most optimistic, as compared with Data Resources, Wharton, and Chase In the third quarter only Merrill Lynch is more optimistic than the Board's forecast   That's right I'm encouraged, of course, by that aspect of our staff's forecast, which projects the recovery to begin in the second quarter with GNP increasing at a 2 percent annual rate in real terms But I'm worried and concerned that this recovery depends pretty much on what happens to inventories Without the anticipated reduced rate of inventory liquidation, the recovery I take it will be delayed until the third quarter In the meantime, there's a good deal of stress and distress out there in the economy with many sectors in the economy feeling a good deal of financial pressure; pessimism was widely reported yesterday As President Winn says, there really may be too much doom and gloom out there, but it is nevertheless there Financial conditions have deteriorated markedly for nonfinancial corporations As you know, the interest coverage ratios for these firms have fallen to record low levels, downgradings of debt ratings have been occurring in large numbers, the business failure rate is running at a record postwar pace, mortgage delinquencies are up, and the housing sales situation didn't look as good in February as we thought it did up until yesterday We heard yesterday about the farming sector and the problems it was having In these circumstances, it seems to me that it is important that the recovery not be delayed until the third quarter While there is every reason for hoping that it will occur as projected in the staff forecast, I think everything should be done to try to encourage an early recovery Thank you   Well, Mr Chairman, Governor Partee stated the case for alternative A very well, I thought I don't have anything really to add to that I would just like to remind everyone of what I thought I heard Mr Axilrod say and that is that alternatives C and B assume that the NOW accounts or precautionary balances or whatever you want to call them are going to work themselves out very soon And if they don't, there is the likely implied risk of their being an obstacle to the recovery I don't think we ought to take that risk We don't need to take that risk and I think we'd leave ourselves in a position to be more flexible if we adopt alternative A   Like 5 or 6 percent "
2082,1982-05-18," Is this public knowledge yet?   I don't want to add to the doom and gloom either, but I do have to say that I agree with a good deal of what has been said on the pessimistic side around the table, and I share a good part of the view expressed by Governor Gramley Although the economy appears to be declining at a slower rate, there is no obvious and convincing evidence that it is bottoming out at the present time or  -18-    5/18/82  that an upturn is close at hand The main concern that I have, therefore, is with respect to the timing and strength and possible duration of the upturn--specifically whether we will have to wait for the stimulus we'll get from the midyear tax cut or whether the inventory correction will occur before then and provide the spark for the upturn I rather doubt that we will see a substantial buildup of inventories in the current environment I agree with what has been suggested by several people namely, that the stress in the economy is probably understated by the macroeconomic figures The data we look at probably don't reflect fully the strain and stress that a lot of business firms are feeling, particularly the debt-laden business firms And as Lyle pointed out, many of these firms are experiencing the stress of a rising ratio of debt [service costs] to profits In this environment, I don't think we are likely to see a strong buildup of stocks So, from my point of view at least, it appears that we will have to wait for the stimulus stemming from the midyear tax cut, which we may not feel until some time further into the third quarter Of course, that longer delay in the upturn will increase the stress on firms and their vulnerability to failure and bankruptcy Although the reduction and the elimination of inflation continues to be our primary goal and a matter against which we mount a determined struggle, I think it is obvious in the present situation that we have made a good deal of progress toward reducing inflation and that we've made enough progress so that we can now look around and survey the damage that has been done to the economy It's also time, I think, to see what we can do to allow the economy to repair some of this damage   We haven't heard from Mr Sternlight   Well, Mr Chairman, I don't believe that the alternatives we're looking at have much to do with inflationary expectations Whichever of these alternatives we might choose, I don't think it would have very much effect on inflationary expectations I just don't think many people out there are greatly worried about the fires of inflation being reignited in the immediate future So, I don't think that's the issue The question is how quickly we want to return M1 to the upper end of its target range I share the view that has been expressed that our main problem is to try to do what we can to get interest rates down My own view is that there is not much we can do to get interest rates down If we take alternative A, the most we can look to is a funds rate of around 12 percent; I think the estimate is slightly above 12 percent That's not a very low funds rate with unemployment at 9-1/2 percent And with a recession of the kind we're looking at and with the economy in the shape that was described by Governor Gramley, that's not what I consider pushing interest rates down to the levels that the economy needs in order to begin recovery  What we can do, though, is to create an environment in which interest rates can fall more easily than they can rise or where they would be more likely to fall than stay where they are The only one of these alternatives that increases the likelihood that rates will fall is alternative A And alternative A really just returns us to the target range at a later date We're still approaching the target range And if we don't get there until the second half--the end of the third quarter or the beginning of the fourth--I wouldn't be greatly worried as long as we're facing the kind of economic conditions that we're facing now So, I would opt for alternative A in the hope that it might encourage--though it may or may not--some downward movement in interest rates Along with that I would like to see a funds rate between 10 and 15 percent and borrowing in the $500 million range   In a nutshell, I was saying that none of these alternatives can be described as easing And I just cannot believe that any of them--alternative A at the extreme--would set up any serious inflationary expectations People are not worried about inflation now; they are worried about staying alive And alternative A stands the best chance of allowing interest rates to come down somewhat, though it probably won't even accomplish that "
2109,1982-06-30," Well, Mr Chairman, much of what I had in mind was very well stated by Jerry Corrigan I do think the main difficulty and the main thing that puts us into the dilemma we are in is the current level of interest rates I agree with Chuck Partee that our main objective ought to be to find a monetary policy strategy that would minimize the likelihood of shocks to the economy caused by monetary policy But listening to the proposals that have been made this afternoon before 500 pm, none of these seems really to get at the basic problem that Jerry dealt with at some length And that is How do we get interest rates down? In my judgment none of these proposals is likely to get interest rates down So, I'm in a position of trying to choose the least bad of the alternatives before us, and I think the least bad is the one that Tony proposed That is, that we stick with the current targets but allow ourselves the flexibility to come in above these targets--and in my judgment, considerably above these targets--if necessary I want to say that I'm very gratified to see so much flexibility around the table, and flexibility in unexpected quarters in some cases I hope we'll continue to be--   I hope we will continue to be flexible and continue to be willing to do as much as we can I'm not convinced that it will be possible to do enough Anything we're likely to do or can do wouldn't be enough, but I hope we'll continue to be flexible enough to try to do as much as we can in the direction of lowering interest rates In general, I go along with the staff forecast I very much hope that it turns out to be right   Significantly   No   Excuse me Could I just say that for 1983 I would stay with the present targets    6/30-7/1/82   Well, Mr Chairman, as I said yesterday, I don't think any of the alternatives that we're considering now are likely to reduce interest rates significantly from their current levels I would like to believe that alternative A would, but I don't think so Since it's unlikely that we'll be able to do anything to get interest rates down within the limits of what we're thinking about, I think we should at all costs avoid doing anything that would likely result in an increase in interest rates So, of course, I find myself in agreement with Pres and Chuck That means I would [support] alternative A and would be willing to see some overshoot from alternative A And I agree with Chuck that we need to put a cap on the funds rate I think it's important that we send a signal to the market that there is some point at which we will begin to look at interest rates again I do not agree with the view expressed that we can't afford to send a signal to the market that we care about interest rates or that we only care about the aggregates To indicate to the market that beyond a certain point we care would be a very positive thing to do right now If we announce that we would not accept a funds rate above 15 percent, that would indicate that we are flexible, that we're looking at a broad range of factors, and that we feel some sense of responsibility for the economy So, I favor alternative A and I support the funds rate cap and whatever borrowing is consistent with that--about $500 million   They may be higher   It might signal a fundamental change in monetary policy   In the sense that's it's better than 11 to 16?   Could I ask a question? How did we happen to hit on the figure of $21 million on the day of intervention?   Was the $21 million all one operation or did you do it in steps of smaller amounts?  -85-    6/30-7/1/82 "
2150,1982-08-24," Is that total production or exports?   Are all the borrowings coming from banks that are having trouble borrowing in the funds market?  -12-    8/24/82   The question is whether we would want to tell the market why there was a big bulge in such borrowings   Could I just ask, Tony, if your forecast wouldn't expect an increase in consumption expenditures in the fourth quarter even in the face of a higher funds rate in the range of 10 to 10-1/2 percent?   That's right It might be lagged    8/24/82   No, he's just saying these [unintelligible] words   Mr Chairman, I don't want to risk disagreeing with anything that has been said up to now I certainly want to see interest rates low, and for that reason I'm inclined toward alternative A But at the same time I want interest rates to stay low And I worry that if we follow alternative A in the face of the GNP forecast that we have, the implication is that interest rates are probably going to go back up in the very near future There are going to be upward pressures In order to keep interest rates down, we're really going to have to increase money growth substantially above the target range Now, I wonder if we want to do that If we increase money growth for the year to above, say, 6 percent, I just wonder if we are willing to accept such an outcome If we are, then fine, alternative A is a good way to go If not, then it seems to me that we're going to have a fairly strong back-up in rates And the effect of this I do not welcome Since the difference between ""A"" and ""B"" seems to me to be unusually narrow this time, I could go just as easily for alternative B But I am prepared to go along with alternative A It's rare that I'm in such a happy position as to choices But, I really want--   Well, I'm not so sure about that at all   I was going to ask you how you reconcile this--   The chart shows it a little above   Of course, they will say we have starting watching interest rates again   As for the wording, why couldn't we say both? Why couldn't we have your language and then after ""credit markets"" say ""or consistently outside a range of 7 to 10 percent"" Either way the Chairman calls a consultation  SPEAKER(?) Use both?   Yes, he would call a consultation when markets are, in his judgment, volatile But he also would call a consultation if the rate falls below 7 percent or goes over 10 percent   Well, Mr Chairman, what about using both?   Just put ""or outside a range of 7 to 10 percent"" after ""credit markets""   No, it's not over [unintelligible] These are two different circumstances One is a matter of the Chairman's judgment as to volatility and the second is objective--if the market produces rates at a certain level, that automatically triggers a consultation And that takes care of everybody's concerns   That's fine   Why is it self-fulfilling? "
2189,1982-10-05," Peter, you said that you had the feeling that the market would be much more tolerant of increases in the money supply from the target ranges today than it would have been, say, two or three months ago?   What's the evidence of that? How does this manifest itself? By discussion on the part of some of the dealers at the Desk or by--   Do I understand that you want to nudge the funds rate up?   Well, Mr Chairman, I have very little to add to your tour d'horizon I think it covers admirably the situation that we find ourselves in I would simply want to emphasize one thing and that is the timing of the recovery; the recovery is very late indeed We've been expecting recovery for at least six months, possibly longer And the longer the economy stays in the doldrums, the greater the risk and the greater the dangers In your words, the developing disarray feeds upon itself, and until we see some evidence of a turnaround, I think we're in a very vulnerable situation So, in this environment, we should not do anything that risks rising interest rates; on the contrary, we should do what we reasonably can to get interest rates moving down Therefore, I support this directive language I also agree with those who would shift emphasis away from M1 temporarily at this time I also would retain the last two sentences of the directive; they give the sense that we have not totally abandoned targeting of the aggregates and I think it's important to maintain that impression at this time I don't know if this is the time to discuss borrowing, but if it is, I would be prepared to see borrowing in the range of $200 million or less    10/5/82   No, it doesn't   The Garn-St Germain--   We certainly have    10/5/82   I agree with that   I would go for 7 to 10 What does the half point do for us?   We have a month to get down to 10 percent "
2215,1982-11-16," Second    11/16/82   We might get more leverage if we do it   The motion was to accept the recommendation   Can you imagine that we could do anything about confidence without reducing interest rates somewhat from their current levels?   I'd like to join all those who feel that interest rates need to come down from their current levels for all the reasons that have been given, both domestic and international I won't try to go through all those reasons again I'd just like to say that it's clear to me that real rates are too high to permit a recovery and, therefore, they have to come down from where they are at present Like Governor Gramley, I don't know to what level they need to come down And for that reason we ought to try to get them down gradually We ought to be careful not to overdo it But at the same time I think we have to do what we can to move rates in the right direction-- downward--but gradually I also agree with Governor Wallich that we have a limited amount of time during which we will be able to maintain our credibility and we ought to use that time wisely The clock is ticking and we don't want to wait too long to have some effect on the current situation I would conclude that we had better use some of that creditability soon in order to encourage recovery while we have time If we wait too long, we may not make effective use of this credibility Therefore, I would support alternative A in the belief that that will encourage a gradual decline in rates I also think, if I understood correctly, that alternative B would not result in any decline at all in interest rates from their current levels Is that correct, Steve?    11/16/82   So, to support ""B"" doesn't seem to me consistent with the objectives that we all say we have I would be content to be somewhere between alternatives A and B provided it resulted in some downward [interest rate] movement But alternative A seems perfectly safe at this time and that's the way I think we should go   Do you think this proposal of $250 million on borrowing and, say, a 7 to 10 percent funds rate band is consistent with a decline in interest rates?   Well, we would have to wait a while to reduce the discount rate in this current market environment Interest rates are going the wrong way   That's why I think we have to do something here   We have to do something to nudge market rates down and then we can reduce the discount rate   Won't they do that now?   Peter, isn't it true that you get calls from people in the market saying that they know that other people have gotten privileged information?   I would like to propose facetiously that we put it out for comment  SPEAKER(?) For a year!   I was just going to ask if the Bundesbank does not hold a news conference after each meeting in which the result was some change in policy If they change policy, they have a news conference immediately after the meeting Is that not true? "
2242,1982-12-20," Peter, did you notice anything in the financial    12/20-21/82  markets or other developments that would explain the relatively high volume of demand for excess reserves?   Thank you, Mr Chairman I also would like to compliment the staff on an excellent paper, which was done under a great pressure of time I happen to know when they started to work on it, and I think it was an excellent job all things considered Like Governor Teeters, I listened carefully yesterday And while I have no new insights as to how to deal with our problems, that was not your fault The discussion was an interesting one and helpful to me I do have some reactions and one main point I'd like to make, if I could But first where I come out I would join the emerging consensus and support the targeting of M2 at least over the transition period Regardless of how one feels about the feasibility of targeting the aggregates in the long run, this is not the time to abandon targeting on a monetary aggregate, given the concern that already has emerged in the financial markets as to the Federal Reserve's determination to continue to restrain inflation So at least for the next few months, and possibly even beyond the transition period--depending on how M2 behaves--I would certainly support the consensus that seems to be emerging I would also agree with Bob Black that we should make every effort to shift adjust M2 I would not like to make a commitment at this time to rehabilitate M1 after the transition period has passed While M1 may prove to have the desired behavioral characteristics, it will take some time, as Frank Morris has pointed out, before we can determine that it does have these characteristics M1, as pointed out by Mr Axilrod, will be a new kind of animal and will have to be observed for some time  Like some others around the table, I share some sympathy for President Morris' debt proxy and I think it certainly deserves further study The problem with it now, from my point of view, is its controllability I'm sure Frank would say ""What about our luck in controlling the monetary aggregates?"" I guess I would have to say that we believe we can control the monetary aggregates, even if we don't At any rate, at this time there are control problems I don't know how we would get total debt to perform as we would like it to And, of course, the practical problem is the one pointed out by Governor Partee The fact is that we don't have the background yet [to target debt] But, as I said, I would urge further study to determine the feasibility of targeting on debt or some broad liquidity measure Now, after the transition period, if M2 does not turn out to be a satisfactory target objective, I think we are in some difficulty We may well have to become more eclectic than we anticipate  I'd just like to say--and this is the main point that I want to make--that I don't agree that the only objective forever and for all time of central bank monetary policy is to keep prices down, to restrain inflation It seems to me, depending on the circumstances, that the primary objective of central bank policy could be maintaining a steady non-inflationary rate of growth Or in other circumstances, for example with prolonged stagnation, [high] unemployment, and under- utilization of capacity, it might well be to promote recovery It seems to me that the primary objective of central bank policy has something to do with the most feasible option with regard to targeting It may be, and I suspect is the case, that if the primary  -36-    12/20-21/82  objective is controlling inflation, control of the monetary aggregates might well be the most feasible object of our targets It may well be if our objective is maintaining a steady non-inflationary rate of growth that we would want to target on short-term interest rates And if we're trying to promote recovery from prolonged stagnation, it may well be that some variant of the debt proxy or perhaps targeting directly on GNP would be the most feasible road to take  And with regard to targeting on GNP, I don't agree that one is playing God when one undertakes to probe for a rate of real growth that is non-inflationary I think it makes perfectly good scientific sense to try to find such a rate in an economy at any given time So, we may have some difficult choices to make with respect to monetary targeting or other options beyond the transition period I would simply urge that we maintain a certain open-mindedness or flexibility, if you will, as we live from Federal Open Market Committee meeting to Federal Open Market Committee meeting Hopefully, in time, the right option will emerge clearly Thank you, Mr Chairman   How much weight would you give it vis-a-vis M2?   It may be a little low   I think it's close, but it preserves the status quo   I agree with this proposal   In "
2294,1983-02-08," Some bad weather   Well, Mr Chairman, I agree with a good deal--in fact most--of what has already been said Particularly, I agree with Governor Wallich and the view that we ought to continue targeting the aggregates and should avoid explicit interest rate targeting for the essentially practical reasons that he set forth I would like to emphasize, though, that we ought to keep in mind at all times what we consider to be a desirable level of real interest rates and, while we do not make these explicit, I think we ought to continue to look at interest rates and keep in mind what range of rates we think would be consistent with the results we would like to get I especially agree with Lyle that we ought to keep in mind that the main thing we have to achieve now is to get a recovery going and to try to nurture that recovery Therefore, as we target aggregates I would favor setting targets for Ml, M2, and M3, as well as domestic nonfinancial debt I would want to remain very flexible in my view of which aggregate was the one to target on at any particular time I would want to make it very clear in our public statements and in the record that we feel free to shift from one aggregate to another depending on its usefulness If we find that M3 is more useful than Ml or vice versa, we should feel free to make that shift in emphasis as we have in the past I would not at this point be prepared to throw Ml in the waste basket When things settle down six months from now, it may turn out to be a much more useful aggregate to target than it is today So, I would emphasize two things (1) we should maintain our flexibility and our right to choose and shift the emphasis from one aggregate to another from time to time; and (2) that we not take our eyes off of interest rates   Why not?   I don't know why we can't, if we explain in the record why we are doing it   Would you accept deemphasizing it for now?   ""Now"" is the emphasis?   It's because of the uncertainty that we were talking about earlier   I don't know what it does   Mr Chairman, could I just ask if this decision relates to the strategy?   [Unintelligible]   While I support the decision that was just made on the 7 to 10--   Yes, the tentative decision I have some concerns about the strategy and the relationship to the alternatives that we select   Is the problem with indicating numbers that M2 is too high and you don't want to mention it? I don't think that's a good enough reason "
2319,1983-03-28," These earnings come from investments in mark- denominated securities?   Do we manage the investment?   Moved   A very small amount   Mr Chairman?   I'd first like to compliment Steve on what I think was an unusually clear analysis of the kinds of issues we face The policy preference course today seems to depend more than usually on how one sees the current performance of the economy and how one sees the economy developing in the near term If one sees the economy as fragile and the economic recovery as vulnerable and much weaker than usual--and, of course, sees the inflation rate very low and, therefore, not a major concern--one obviously then would be pushed in the direction of alternative A and perhaps even a further relaxation On the other hand, if one sees that the economy is strengthening rapidly and indeed appears to have a boom momentum and there is a strong fear of the uncertainties of inflation, then obviously one might be pushed in the direction of alternative C or even more restraint I would agree with Governor Partee's statement yesterday in support of the staff analysis and the staff forecast, which he found to be in the middle And I would agree when he says that over the rest of the year the real GNP could come in 1 percent higher or 1 percent lower But the staff forecast is in the middle  I would agree also with Frank Morris when he says that we need more data and a little more time before we can be confident about the nature of this recovery Readily accepting that inventories are lean, that shelves are bare, and that defense spending is strong and rising, it seems to me that one must make some heroic assumptions with regard to consumer expenditures and consumers' willingness to take on debt in large quantities, given the level of real interest rates Also [it takes] some expansive assumptions with respect to residential construction in order to see that the economy is recovering strongly and in danger of causing a boom I think the worry that the economy is strengthening too quickly would ignore what is best [not] minimized There are drags on the economy at the present time the drag effects of capital spending and the probable composition of that spending when it turns around and begins to expand, and the drag effects of state and local expenditures as well While I would agree, as I said, that we need more time and more data to feel confident about the nature of the recovery, at this point I'm persuaded that the economy still needs nurturing and at the very least does not need any restraining influence resulting from a more restrictive monetary policy Now, I would agree that there may have been considerable stimulation in the sense that the underlying rate of growth of the aggregates may well have been very strong But I think that we have to see stimulation in relative terms, and we have to see that stimulation in a situation when real interest rates are negative [and] not quite as sensitive as stimulation in the context of highly positive real rates of interest So, I would come out in favor of a position somewhat between alternative A and alternative B--that is, somewhat of a holding position until the economic picture becomes    3/28-29/83  clear And instead of sending up interest rates, I would tend to err slightly on the side of a downward [nudge] I think that's what the outlook calls for at the present time   The numbers that will come out next month   Maybe the recovery in the underground economy is stronger than--   [I would prefer] whatever level of reserves is consistent with an 8-1/2 percent funds rate   I second that   It's the same as this part; that's in the parenthesis in alternative II   I could live with $250 million, but I would prefer to err in the direction 8-1/4 percent rather than 8-3/4 percent on the funds rate   I know, but we've also been pushing 8-3/4 and 8-7/8 percent "
2334,1983-04-29, They can't hear you  SPEAKER(?) We've lost you again 
2355,1983-05-24," Jerry, I think I heard you say that the expansion over the next year and a half through 1984 would be [at a rate] just below the median for previous expansions Would you still say, in light of the present data that we have, that the strength of the recovery so far is below the postwar average significantly?   Mr Chairman, I don't have any additional insights to put on the table I just want to say that I come out very much in the middle of this discussion that we've had so far I'm impressed with the vitality that the economy has shown recently And if things go the way they should go, I would expect that the expansion will continue at a healthy clip for the reasons pointed out by Chuck and Lyle and others around the table It seems to me that that's the best bet for the present time But I think that we ought to be prepared to be disappointed The consumer it seems to me has every reason to be expanding his expenditures, but the consumption sector may not perform the way we would expect at the present time We've been disappointed by the consumer before--surprised on both the up side and the down side, as a matter of fact And I think we should remember that the consumer did not respond to last summer's tax cut the way we expected Also, while I agree that it's too early to expect a big boom in the capital goods sector, the outlook for the capital goods sector is worrisome to me I recognize that the most recent figures for capital equipment spending have been very encouraging, stronger than anybody expected But we haven't seen any indication that capital expenditures for heavy equipment and so forth are going to perk up, and I'm just not convinced that they will Also, we have to keep in mind the possibility that the dollar will not decline and that exports will not expand--the scenario emphasized by Roger and Pres and Tony So, in short, I think we have to be prepared for the downside outcome But I have to say that I come out in the middle and, therefore, I would tend to go along pretty much with the staff's forecast   I don't think we ought to make any commitments to look at it even next time   I know it's the midyear review, but--   But I don't think we need to look at it with a [predisposition] toward changing it at this time   We're not likely to have any additional information on which to base a change   It's hard to [imagine] what new we could know about M1 between now and then   Just operationally, Mr Chairman, I agree with everything that Roger just said I would support alternative B and a borrowing level of $250 million, and I take that to be consistent with maintaining the situation substantially as it is at the present I would not want to take any action that would have the effect of raising interest rates at the present time I think it's too early to start pushing up interest rates   Funds have been up to 9 percent I don't know if you directly associate it with--   And that was associated with the temporary movement to $350 million?   It doesn't help to snug up   The market seems to be expecting no change at all I think Tony put his finger on the main risk When the market senses that we are snugging up, they will help us; they will conclude that that is what we want and will add impetus to it We're going to get an upward bias, which I think is the wrong thing at the present time  -33-    5/24/83   Henry Kaufman put out the word No change   The risk that the economy is going to get out of hand immediately is not--   We will not be lowering interest rates in the next three to six weeks no matter what happens   Sure   Yes, we are   I think that's a good suggestion   Not in this directive "
2393,1983-07-12," I think that makes sense I think Henry is right because it would be consistent with what I'd like to see over the long run when we look at what happens out to 1986 We seem to get the best results, from the point of view of both real growth and price performance, if we slow growth in the first two years--that is, the latter part of this year and next year--and permit somewhat faster growth in the last two years And reducing the top side of the ranges would indicate our intention to reduce money growth during this early part of the cyclical expansion  -26-    7/12-13/83   Steve, in your judgment, would it be correct to say that you get these results from the model in part because of the phase of the cycle that we're in? In effect, what seems to be the outcome is that if you start to slow money growth in the expansion phase and speed money growth just before the rate of real growth begins to slow down, you get the better result   So, if we are in a period that is just on the edge of contraction, we'd get better results if we increase the rate of money growth   I'm just accepting the [model] outcome; this is not my view   Right   If the exercise is cosmetic, basically, I think a half point is as good as a point  -31-    7/12-13/83   I don't think you would   Well, I don't think we would take any action at all on the basis of the credit aggregate alone   Psychologically, I think it's a good thing   Government borrowing--the deficit   I'd prefer to see it down on the top side and not the bottom--alternative III [Unintelligible] tactical   Except that I'm not worried about a rapid expansion   Some people   Also, there won't be much growth [unintelligible] next year, if we get it all this year   Compared to what--what we've done in the past?   Alternative A does include the present degree of restraint--that is, it includes the tightening that has already taken place?  -63-    7/12-13/83   The forecast doesn't show very much inflationary danger   No, the consensus forecast; I didn't hear any strong arguments against the staff forecast on that score   I don't understand how that tightening is consistent with steady [reserve] positions   I would support that I think we've already had a good deal of tightening I know some people think it's minuscule; I think it's significant at this point in the recovery I would not at this time want to damp the recovery because I'm not yet sure it is all that strong It may well be as strong as many of you think it is, but I would like to be surer than I am now and I would want to wait a bit before I tighten any further I'd want to wait at least another month or two   We would be trying to bring it back down to 9-1/2 percent?   Well, if it happens to drift up to 9-3/4 percent, it could stay there "
2418,1983-08-23," What was the total in 1978?   Isn't the composition different, though?   But isn't it true that the majority of outside forecasters expect higher interest rates?   Don't they expect higher long-term rates in 1984? "
2446,1983-10-04," In announcing the LTV merger did they say they intended to reduce capacity in the industry?   Also, partly in support of Frank, over the next year we're projecting a slight decline in long-term interest rates That would argue against any buildup of crowding out    10/4/83   We're projecting a decline in long-term interest rates of about 1/2 percentage point   Could I just ask why you expect increased pressure on prices?   Did it change?   Me too   But it's within the tolerance limits of unchanged That's [conveying] the point that we can still say unchanged even though there has been substantial--   Anything that makes those reconcilable is all right with him! "
2474,1983-11-14," It's in there    11/14-15/83   That was part of the question I wanted to ask Is there a feasible monetary policy that is consistent with no progress in reducing the deficit?   Is there a feasible one, a doable one?   So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second   Any reply?   It looks that way   Mr Chairman, I think the staff forecast is about right, but it's a little cautious on the current quarter The current quarter seems to me possibly a little stronger than is forecast I think the economy is slowing down from the third quarter, but not as much as [the staff projects] I'm particularly impressed with the labor market numbers There has been some decline in industrial production over this month from last month But all the other numbers seem to show continued strength at roughly the same momentum as in the last quarter I wouldn't be at all surprised to see this quarter turn out closer to a 7 percent real rate of growth than the 6-1/4 to 6-1/2 percent that has been forecast So, I would say the forecast for this quarter is a cautious one Again, I think the longer-run forecast for 1984 is about right The main difference that I would see is that the strength of consumer expenditures may continue longer into the early part, or the first half, of next year And the swing toward inventory accumulation may last longer than is projected, which of course would then mean that the growth rate for the first half of next year would be somewhat higher than is now forecast I would consider that to be unlikely But I mention it just to suggest that if there is any error in the forecast, it is that the outcome is likely to be stronger than is now forecast I was one of those people, I would remind you, who in the spring of this year were concerned about whether the recovery was really as strong as most people thought it was I'd like to say now that I am convinced and that it's probably stronger than forecast   Doesn't our forecast call for a decline in agricultural output?   That's somewhat contrary to what John Balles seems to be observing   Agriculture overall  -48-    11/14-15/83   I think we have no basis for a major move downward at this time   Or up   I'd just like to register a position on this Because of the way I see the economy developing, I have a good deal of sympathy for the position taken by Lyle and Jerry That is, I can see the case for some precautionary firming at the present time But I'm not prepared actually to move in that direction at this time I do agree that we have to be looking in a firming direction and I agree with Tony that it may be next time [we meet] But I think Tony put his finger on the problem and that is that if we took any firming action at all at the present time, it simply wouldn't be understood The public and markets are looking at the aggregates and they see them either well within the ranges or toward the bottom of the ranges And if we firm up now, even in a slight way, it simply wouldn't be easily understood But at the same time, we still ought to keep ourselves looking in that direction And if we expect that we may have to take some firming action next time, perhaps we ought to find some language in the directive this time to prepare the markets for such an action   The most important thing is that there will be time for a few more public statements to the effect that we might be firming   Yes   May, 1983   To no avail   Well, we do mention the strength of the economy   Well, it's a question of whether it really is increasing The rate of expansion [may be] decelerating at some point and if you get that and continue to do so--   Yes, ""continued"" would do it "
2504,1983-12-19," Mr Chairman, most of what I wanted to say has already been said in one way or another--especially by Governor Wallich However, my assessment of the downside risks is not quite the same as his I'm not quite as guarded in my outlook It seems to me that activity is likely to continue strong over the next year, particularly in the first half of the year, and to decelerate somewhat in the second half but still expand at an acceptable rate with unemployment continuing to fall So, I don't see business activity falling off to unacceptable levels over the period of the next year I'm a little more optimistic on the inflation outlook than I think most people have expressed I don't share the same worry with respect to the wage outlook I think the wage picture is probably still one of moderation It's hard to see that profits are going to continue to expand at such a rate as to weaken the resistance to higher wages and improve really significantly the bargaining position of labor So, I would expect continued moderation in wage increases The energy picture looks pretty good and the outlook is for moderate--not runaway--increases in food prices So, if there are going to be any strong inflationary pressures, it's hard for me to see where they are going to come from So, I see the inflation outlook as reasonably favorable--pretty much as the staff has forecast Along with the vulnerabilities listed by Governor Wallich, I would simply emphasize, as others have pointed out, that the major vulnerability is higher interest rates than we now expect--that is, higher than in the forecast A number of people have pointed to that, and I think there is possibly a real danger of interest rates being substantially higher than they are now forecast The reasons for that, obviously, are the deficit, the increase in private credit demands, and the falling off of capital inflows All of these possibilities would operate toward putting upward pressure on interest rates And if that happens, I think the economy will be very vulnerable and possibly in danger of some damage from that development I don't, however, expect rates to increase substantially, although I recognize that as a possibility that could affect the forecast, as I pointed out On balance, I would say that the probability is about 50 percent on being able to maintain current levels of interest rates; and if we're able to do that, I think [the economy] will be in good shape   Isn't that what you want?   What about 1 percent less growth?   Why aren't you optimistic?   Mr Chairman, I agree with almost everything Governor Teeters said I'm just not able to look much beyond 1984 and, therefore, I'm unable to say anything specific about 1985 I would just like to be able to say in general terms that we hope that things develop in 1984 in such a way that we can continue to move in the direction of price stability in 1985  As for 1984, I think that our tentative target ranges are realistic--that is, they are consistent with the staff forecast and with what I expect to happen, with the exception mentioned by Nancy that the M3 range could and should be raised in order to avoid the possibility of squeezing So, with the exception of that minor change  -47-    12/19-20/83  of raising the M3 range by 1/2 percentage point, I think these ranges are good, satisfactory, and realistic I think we should reiterate in very strong terms our commitment to long-run price stability And I think it's important that we demonstrate that commitment by the targets that we select, which we've done in this case We've reduced the ranges for 2 out of 3 and if we can continue to do that, the inflationary expectations will be affected in a manner that would be positive from my point of view So, I'm satisfied with the target ranges presented except for M3 And incidentally, I'm also encouraged by the recent behavior of M1 velocity But I'm not yet ready to resurrect M1 to full target status I would like to watch it for a while longer Perhaps in July we might consider that restoration   Do we have any problem with their coming into the New York market and operating there?   So long as we know   We prefer to have them do it through us?   Mr Chairman, I would support your original proposition whereby we hold our position where we are now and could apply more restraint if it seems necessary So, I would support alternative B, borrowing at $650 million, and a funds rate roughly where it is now "
2530,1984-01-30," It's not a Federal Reserve [swap]?   You mean alternatives I and II   I know he is, but he has been talking about the money supply   Mr Chairman, initially I was inclined to support giving more weight to M1 as a nod to the tendency of its velocity to move toward normality But I was talked out of it pretty much by Steve and by Lyle Steve reminded me, although he shouldn't have had to do that, that if interest rates turn out to be significantly different from the outlook for them at the moment, we really don't know what will happen to the NOWs and Super NOWs Therefore, the behavior of M1 and its velocity are much more unreliable than I think we should accept Given the need to keep the aggregates within our stated ranges, I would not want to give more weight to M1 in the sense of putting it on an equal plane with M2 and M3 I think we should wait a little longer and have more observations or indications of how it's really going to behave before we rehabilitate it and give it equal weight So, I would keep M1 as a monitoring variable and monitor its performance rather than rehabilitate it as a target  I also would support alternative II for the reasons that we established those ranges initially Alternative II does allow for some reduction in the target ranges in the direction of price stability Also, it seems to me that alternative II provides the best chance of maintaining market conditions pretty much as they are now Alternatives I and III would risk significant changes in interest rates and I would not like to see that happen over the foreseeable future I think the best chance for maintaining the recovery and a steady expansion is to maintain steady money market conditions at the present time I would, however, reduce the range for M2 from the 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent [shown under alternative II] to 6 to 9 percent, mainly because it would represent an effective 1/2 point reduction, which it does not now And that would make it more consistent with the reductions in the ranges of the other aggregates   Everybody is for flexibility   Well, I would prefer to see [any reduction] come out of M2 than M1   [Unintelligible] the movement of the velocity   Is it all over the South or is it restricted to--? "
2558,1984-03-26," Does it seem likely that these funds will stay with you as long as they did last year?   Second   Steve, the Bluebook says that the alternative B proposal is consistent with the staff forecast of GNP Does that mean that alternative B takes into account the rise in interest rates that has already occurred? Or does it mean that it will result in an additional rise in interest rates over and above what has occurred?   You mean a further rise from today but not from--   But it's helpful to know what they have in mind   Mr Chairman, when [we face] an economy [that] is expanding as rapidly as it is and the outlook is that it probably will slow down because of its own internal dynamics and, on the other hand, the economy may continue to expand rapidly and slow only a little, I think it's a good time to rely on what we consider to be acceptable rates of growth in the money supply I would do that and let the dynamics of the economy--the rate of expansion--determine pretty much what interest rates will be In other words, if we set the course of growth for money at rates of expansion within target ranges that we believe to be appropriate, then we should stick with that And if money and credit demands in the economy intensify and force interest  -60-    3/26-27/84  rates up, then we should accept that On the other hand, if the [growth in the] economy moderates as we hope and expect, that leaves scope for interest rates either to stay at current levels or perhaps even fall somewhat I think alternative B is the alternative that is most consistent with that way of looking at things So, I would accept the rates of growth for the aggregates set in alternative B and would accept the federal funds rate fallout from that   It's not just M1; it's M2 and M3 as well   Only if we don't have to go that far "
2584,1984-05-21," Don't they relate the deficit to future inflation?   It's hard to imagine what could be influencing long-term investment now if it's not inflation Maybe they just--   Well, Mr Chairman, you said much of what I was thinking and I agree with everything you said   Not quite No [unintelligible], however, just ""but in addition"" I agree that the state of financial markets right now is such that it practically precludes any significant tightening But apart from that I think the appropriate policy stance at the present time is especially sensitive to what the economy is doing and what it is likely to do in the short run Now, I certainly agree with Bob Black and Henry that we have to keep the long run constantly in mind But I think Lyle is right There is a good deal of uncertainty as to what the economy is actually doing right now If the staff is right that it is slowing down at a very significant rate--and I think the probability is on their side--that, of course, would suggest not moving in the direction of further restraint But it could well be that the economy will not decelerate as rapidly as we expect, in which case it may actually need some further encouragement in that direction by increased pressure on bank reserves But I don't think so I think that the recent run-up in interest rates has been sharp and is almost certain to have a significant slowing effect on the economy and that any further tightening at this time would run the risk of overkill So, I would think that the prudent posture for policy right now is as you suggest, Mr Chairman, to hold steady--to have no significant easing or tightening but to maintain the degree of restraint that the Committee called for at its last meeting   It means they have stopped losing deposits   I'm not so sure We put out this press release which seems to me to indicate a very deep involvement in this whole thing Now we come along with a statement to the Desk and we try to ignore it I don't think that's really very prudent   But they realize that; they read our words very carefully And if they don't see any acknowledgment, they'll wonder what-- "
2612,1984-07-16," Since my forecast is rather way out, I'd like to say a word Ed Boehne pointed out that a lot of the forecasts reflect individual personalities and whether one is a pessimist or an optimist When things are going poorly, I'm an optimist and I expect things to get better; when they are going very well, I'm a pessimist and I expect them to get worse   So, while my forecast was very close to the median for 1984, it's way out of line for 1985 and I'm going to revise it because I've been influenced by both the staff forecast and some of the comments I've heard Basically, I forecast a growth recession starting in the latter part of 1985; I just thought somebody should reflect that possibility among our forecasts Based on what I've heard and what I've looked at more recently, I don't really expect that to happen But it seems to me to be a possibility--enough of a possibility to note Having made my forecast before the latest figures on unemployment and employment and some of the more recent data reflecting more strength than I had assumed, I had real GNP falling off very substantially in the latter half of 1985 So, I came out on the low side for growth in 1985 and that's the basis for my way-out forecast The reason is simply that real interest rates are rising very rapidly The price forecast is very favorable but at the same time our forecast is for rising interest rates And real interest rates now, and as projected, are going to be fairly close to where they were in the latter part of '81 and early '82, at which point the economy began to reflect this by turning down I think it  -18-    7/16-17/84  is distinctly possible, though not probable, that in the latter half of next year we will see such a severe slowing in real output that we could think of it as a growth recession   Well, the target is the forecast   Strike behavior has been very favorable   Well, assuming that you are right and that Lyle is right, don't we get more psychological impact if we reduce the upper limit twice--one-half point now and one-half point in February, if things still look promising--rather than going down one point now?   Why?   So do I   I would support the Solomon/Gramley version of alternative B And I hope it finds a knife's edge   Does that commit us to tightening if they run strong? "
2637,1984-08-21," So would I, Mr Chairman   I don't either  -37-    8/21/84   It's still increasing [reporting burdens] "
2662,1984-10-02," Mr Chairman, it seems conceivable that we may need more than $500 million over the next year, so why not increase the informal limit by $1 billion instead of $500 million?   Shouldn't that show up in much higher excess reserves?   We're talking about the fourth quarter and this would be a quarter of pause and it could be a big pause   Well, Mr Chairman, the staff's revisions to the forecast for 1985 seem to be more than usually sensitive to the dollar  -11-    10/2/84  exchange rate We know what the various possibilities are there and we also know the difficulty of assessing the probabilities associated with forecasting the exchange rate But I don't think many people would argue that the basic long-run strength in the economy is being threatened I don't know of many people who have forecast a recession in 1985 I think the central question for us right now is What is going to happen in the current quarter and possibly the next quarter? The question is whether the economy is going to continue to decelerate below the current level of activity estimated for the third quarter or whether it's going to stabilize at levels around those of the third quarter or whether it's going to rebound as projected by the staff I think the scenario outlined by the staff for the fourth quarter is a very plausible one and I certainly hope that it is realized If it is realized, we'll have pretty much what Ed Boehne was hoping for--that is, we will have the kind of situation that we want  However, I think we have to recognize and pay some attention to the kinds of factors that the Chairman pointed to just a moment ago that there is evidence of considerable weakness and that the staff forecast is based on pretty wobbly foundations--primarily consumer behavior and the expected rebound in consumer spending Now, at a time when investment spending is also decelerating somewhat, this rebound in the current quarter seems to me crucially [dependent] on a substantial rebound in consumer spending And from past experience, I think we have found that predicting consumer behavior in the short run on a quarterly basis is a very hazardous business In other words, it seems to me highly possible that, in light of the very rapid deceleration that we've seen in the last quarter, this could carry forward to very low levels of expansion I would expect positive rates of growth, but conceivably fairly low rates of growth-- marginally positive rates of growth--and that, in my judgment, would not be a desirable outcome And I think we have an opportunity now to forestall that without any risk of threatening a sustainable expansion   I would just like to point out that even alternative A contemplates a funds rate no lower than 10-1/4 percent   Well, Mr Chairman, I agree pretty much with what Pres Martin said It seems to me that all of the recent developments point to a need to ease monetary conditions somewhat--the behavior of the aggregates, the level of the exchange rate, the level of the dollar, and the outlook for inflation Hardly anyone expects an inflation rate next year above 5 percent The consensus outlook among economists, as I read it, is between 4 and 5 percent We ourselves revised our inflation forecast down So, from almost everybody's point of view, the outlook for inflation is improving and is much better than it was just a month or so ago If you add to that the condition of the thrifts, I think this is a time when we could reasonably hope for a somewhat lower level of interest rates I think the case is as strong as it has been in recent years for some easing Call it a probing easing if you like, but I think we ought to try to ease some Now, the good thing about the present combination of circumstances is--at least it seems so to me--that we can do it with very little risk If the economy surges in the fourth quarter or early next year--we expect it will not, but if it does--we are in a very good position to reverse without any damage to the economy to speak of So, it seems to me that we can at this time think very much in terms of reducing the reserve pressures somewhat I would go for a position somewhere between alternatives A and B, although Governor Partee's specifications for alternative B are very close to what I  -29-    10/2/84  would be willing to go along with We could call it ""B"" with Governor Partee's specifications But I would like to see a level of borrowing around $600 million and I'd leave the funds rate range pretty much where it is   The Association of Business Economists, an organization of 200 people, is looking for an inflation rate somewhere between 4 and 5 percent I also noticed yesterday that our shadows expect an inflation rate between 3 and 4 percent   I don't have a pessimistic view "
2686,1984-11-07," Mr Chairman, Governor Martin said a good part of what I had in mind except that I don't expect a growth recession in the first half of next year I don't have any major argument with the staff forecast But I am more comfortable with the longer-term part of the forecast than I am with the forecast for the current quarter As was pointed out in the briefing, the performance of the current quarter is very sensitive to the increase in consumer expenditures; we have to get a substantial increase--on the order of 5 percent plus in this quarter--in order to get the projected growth for this quarter In addition, even if we get this substantial increase in consumption expenditures, the stimulus to GNP depends on the distribution of these consumer expenditures between imports and the rundown of inventory So, the net stimulus to real GNP may not be as strong as projected On the other hand, it may well work out that output does increase in the range of 3-1/2 percent My only point is that for this quarter we should be prepared to see an increase in real GNP of significantly less than 3-1/2 percent   As has been pointed out several times here, we've seen a good deal of easing since the last meeting As a matter of fact, the easing is just about the amount that I had hoped for at the last meeting, so what has been taking place in the easing of policy is getting very close to my comfort level I think it is important not to allow short-term interest rates to fall too far too fast In this sense, I share Bob Black's feeling of the need for some caution in the rate at which we ease policy Having said that, I think we have to do better than alternative B I would hope for something between ""A"" and ""B"" and I am not uncomfortable as we move toward ""A"" I would be very happy to go along with Tony Solomon's recommendation of borrowing at $600 million and adjusting the fed funds rate range down to 7 to 11 percent and hope that the aggregates show some improvement   Yes, that $400 million would be 9 percent "
2712,1984-12-17," Second   Haven't we said, though, that we expected a particular aggregate to come in at around the midpoint, or above the midpoint, or below the midpoint?   Well, more recently we've stated what we expect   The presentational problems are insurmountable   Mr Chairman, on this issue I would line up with Governor Wallich, Governor Partee, and Bob Boykin I think that Steve's proposal is very little different from what we're doing now I don't see the lines closely drawn between judgment and automaticity It seems to me that as long as we limit the automatic changes-- especially on the low end--to 25 percent rather than 50 percent, the result would be little different from the procedures that we're following That is especially true if you keep in mind how flexible this Committee has been all along In my experience since I've been on this Committee, there has been no reluctance to superimpose judgment on any kind of arrangement that we had agreed to earlier So, I'm confident that judgment, and hopefully good judgment, will always be there superimposed upon any slight automaticity that we agree to go with And I think the advantage of 25 percent automatic changes is that it keeps us going in the right direction without over- committing us   No, I don't think so   No, that's--   Especially long-term investments   Sure    12/17-18/84   Well, Mr Chairman, I'll try to answer all of your questions in order as well But first I'd like to say a word about the forecast Unlike Frank and Jerry, I'm very comfortable with the staff's forecast; I think it's just about on target I do not see any danger of a recession I don't see any of the usual signs or conditions prevailing which usually precede a recession On the contrary, the basic conditions appear to exist for continued moderate expansion   That means I agree with it as a forecast If I'm taking too long to get to it, I guess I could give you a ""yes"" or ""no ""   Although there are good reasons for expecting a 3 percent rate of expansion next year, again unlike Frank and Jerry, I don't see anything in the economy that's going to spark an expansion at a rate beyond 3 percent It may be, as Frank suggested a moment ago, that the recent decline in interest rates has been of such a magnitude as to stimulate further expansion The decline of the federal funds rate to around 7 percent, as we had today, is something I had not anticipated And I'm sure the staff forecast is not based on interest rates at these levels So, one question is whether the funds rate and other short-term rates should stay in the 7 percent area or not With rates in that area Frank may well have a good point about sparking a faster rate of expansion But if they don't stay around that level--if funds rates go back up to where they were a few weeks ago or to the 8-3/4 percent rate recorded two days ago and the short-term market rates associated with that go to 9 percent, I really don't see what is going to spark a faster rate of expansion I don't see it in consumer expenditures; I don't see it in the various components of investment; I don't see it in net exports I don't know where it would come from  As the Chairman put it, if the staff forecast is about right, the question arises as to whether that is satisfactory And my answer is that if that is absolutely the best we can do without inflation, yes, I would settle for a 3 percent rate of expansion However, I'm not sure that that is the highest rate of growth that is consistent with low inflation I'm not at all sure My own inclination is to try for a higher rate I'm not at all sure that 4 percent is a rate that is consistent with low inflation; 4 percent growth may be too high and may result in capacity or resource pressures But I think we ought to try to pull for the highest rate of growth that is consistent with low inflation and keeping the risks of igniting inflationary expectations very low I think we're in a good position to do that right now because the Federal Reserve has an unusual amount of credibility And I think it's a time that we could use some of the credibility in the interest of getting some further growth To put it simply We can play it safe or we can take some risks toward more growth I don't think the risks will be high As a matter of fact, as I've already suggested, the moment we see some danger of capacity or resource pressures or wage/price pressures developing or the moment    12/17-18/84  we see some ignition of inflationary expectations we can and should pull back Now, let me say that I'm simply trying to suggest an attitude we might take How does this translate into policy? As I said earlier, interest rates have come down much more in recent weeks than I had thought they would I'm perfectly prepared, with interest rates at this level, to sit back and wait and see what happens and not push them any further   What I'm trying to convey is a feeling that things have eased quite a bit, and a lot of what I'm saying applies to an interest rate level that was higher than I thought was good for the economy So, I would be prepared to sit back and see what effect this [easing] has for a while And if it isn't producing some kind of support for the economy, why then I'd be in favor of easing somewhat further But what I'm saying doesn't translate into doing something wild and pushing interest rates way, way down That's not what I'm talking about; I'm talking about a cautious, probing attitude We can talk about how to do that, which means numbers like ""B""   To answer you question about M1 I'm impressed with what the staff has found about the increased reliability of M1 If it has become more reliable in the last 18 months, let's recognize it That is not to say rehabilitate it completely but recognize it and perhaps consider putting it on equal footing with the other aggregates   No, I've never hear anybody say it's on equal footing or is given equal weight   Well, the markets were giving it more We're saying we are giving it more importance, even more importance than a month ago The markets have long since been giving it greater importance than we have Anyhow, if everybody agrees that we put it on equal footing with the other aggregates, that's as far as I'd like to go at the present time on M1 As for the ranges for next year, I'm comfortable with the ranges that we've established However, if we implement this probing attitude that I've suggested we should push for, we should be prepared to see growth in the upper parts of those ranges Is there something I haven't covered?  -36-    12/17-18/84   Oh, yes What I'm suggesting is to try to get as fast a rate of growth [as is consistent with low inflation], which means lower interest rates And lower interest rates are very consistent with what needs to be done on the international side As a matter of fact, I think one could make a case for easing monetary policy purely on the exchange rate situation now because of its effects on and ramifications for our domestic economy   I support your proposal, Mr Chairman It's essentially in a range that I'm pleased with   But it could make them feel better  SPEAKER(?) Make it $300 million   Give it to them; make it $300 million "
2730,1985-01-18," Why not in sterling?   That's where the need is greatest, is it not?  SPEAKER(?) We can't hear those comments   I said sterling is where the need seems to be greatest at the present time    1/18/85 "
2755,1985-02-12," Second   Well, maybe part of it--   Mr Chairman, given the forecasts that we've made --noting that nobody expects real growth less than 3 percent or in excess of 4-1/2 percent--I think alternative II looks very good It seems to me that the ranges proposed for M1 and M2 would accommodate growth within the range of 3 to 4-1/2 percent I'm quite comfortable with a range for M1 of 4 to 7 percent and for M2 of 6 to 8-1/2 percent I could live with the proposed ranges for M3 and total credit, but I would prefer to see M3 raised 1/2 of a percentage point to 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent and credit at 9 to 12 percent We expect M1 to come in near the upper reaches of the range And while we hope that M3 will also be in the upper part of the range established, we have this experience of M3 running very high And I don't see why we  -35-    2/12-13/85  should not set the ranges so that M3 will be at least closer, if not within, the range The main objection to that seems to be that this would transmit a signal to the public that we are not being sufficiently vigilant or, in the case of total credit, that we're trying to accommodate the deficit I myself am not impressed with that argument It seems to me that the public cares most of all about M1 and, to some extent, M2 But I don't believe the public would be alarmed if we recognize that M3 is tending to run very high relative to its range as it has in recent months and that we allowed for that by increasing the band to 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent I would favor also a range for total credit of 9 to 12 percent   But, Steve, doesn't that depend in part on the assumption of higher interest rates as the year goes on?   But your assumption that M3 will stay within the range is based on your expectations that interest rates will--   It may not happen   The change [unintelligible] circumstances   I thought you were talking about 9-1/2 to 12-1/2 percent, as in alternative I   Does anyone want to raise it?   Since it doesn't matter, why not raise it?  -45-    2/12-13/85   So do I   Well, I'm not [for] M2   No; that's why it's harmless-- "
2779,1985-03-26," Why did we buy sterling? Even though it was a small amount, what were the reasons for that?   It was really just a gesture?   Peter, how do you explain the fact that the ESM debacle had less effect on the market than Drysdale even though it would seem that the ESM effects will have wider ramifications?   Right Only one dealer was involved   Well, I thought the message was clearer than usual from Mr Axilrod   Well, Mr Chairman, I find myself pretty much in agreement with many of the things that you pointed to, though I don't know if I would describe that as excessively gloomy It depends upon the point of view from which you look at these things There is a point that you made, which Lyle also pointed out, that I'd like to emphasize, and that is that the staff forecast is probably the best we can hope for The risks to the forecast seem to me to be on the down side Looking at the economy, it is very hard to see where a kick to the growth could occur All the factors pointed to by the Chairman suggest that any higher growth rate than the one projected by the staff just seems to be unlikely Now having said that, I do think the staff forecast for the short run is a good one I think the current rate of expansion is probably a comfortable one but there are these vulnerabilities that Pres pointed to Although the Chairman pointed out that consumer expenditures are really the main source of strength in the economy, it seems to me that as we go out into the year--into the second half--that there is some risk that consumer spending may not hold up While as of now it seems possible to maintain current rates of growth, declining over time, I wouldn't be surprised at all if in fact the result of these vulnerabilities coming from declines of investment and also the lagged effect of import [penetration] on activity in the economy all add up to much lower rates of growth toward the end of the year than we expect at the present time Just to summarize, I would say that while the staff forecast seems to me at this time to be the most likely outcome, we have to be prepared to see significantly lower rates of growth than forecast  As far as the fragility of the financial system, I was much more worried about that a week ago than I am today I'm encouraged by the way the market has accepted the developments in Ohio and I'm encouraged by the way the people in Ohio have accepted what's going on there So I'm not as worried as I might have been While there are these threats to confidence, I would not at this point allow my concern about fragility in the system to influence my monetary policy prescription   Let me just ask if there were any runs on any of the S&Ls that did open up?   I agree that this is not the time to tighten But it's also probably not the time to allow money growth to expand substantially above the band   Right   I think the danger of allowing M1 to continue to grow at a rapid rate is that people eventually will conclude that interest rates are going to go up and we're going to have to tighten And we don't want that either So my own feeling is that the best way to deal with our dilemma is ""steady as you go"" And, as you point out, the problem is to define that   Do you have me, Mr Chairman?   I would favor the specifications of alternative B as presented, with $350 million on borrowing, because I think they are most likely to keep us where we are and are most likely to result in an 8-1/2 percent funds rate I can live with any kind of refinement or fine tuning that would increase the chances of our staying at around an 8-1/2 percent funds rate   Is borrowing at $500 to $600 million consistent with a 6 percent growth in Ml?   Well, that's my point I would think that--   That's what it says here   No Speakers mentioned interest rates but nobody has been talking targeting; they are talking about what they would like to see   The market might like that   $350 million That's what we [unintelligible] because we might get something on average a lot higher, just like now $350 million   I support that too   $350 million   We should know whether we can get fed funds rates running for a few days at 8-3/4 percent while remaining at $350 million "
2803,1985-05-21," I have a question, though Would this continue to be sent to the Chairman ex officio or is it specific to the present Chairman?    5/21/85   Well, Mr Chairman, I think the major concern is whether the economy is going to rebound moderately in the second half as projected in the staff forecast or whether it is going to continue along the present sluggish path Now, if one is convinced that the economy is going to perform along the lines of the forecast in the second half, I don't think we need to worry too much; the worry then would be about next year While I think the staff forecast probably captures the most likely outcome, the factors supporting that outlook do not seem to me to be very strong While we probably can expect continued strength from residential construction, the rate of growth in business fixed investment and consumption expenditures will be declining Yet, the 3 to 3-1/2 percent growth that we look to depends on some moderate strength in both these categories So, it is very hard to be confident that there is this basic strength in spending that's going to produce this outcome With resource utilization significantly below capacity, with capacity utilization most recently falling--and even if it stabilizes from this point on, it will still be at a relatively low level--and with the outlook for unemployment not very reassuring in that it is not declining significantly, it seems to me that the economy is vulnerable on the down side There seems to be very little risk of excessive growth in these circumstances So, I would say that what we can reasonably expect is an economy that is, as Governor Martin put it, very vulnerable It could go either way; I see no strong momentum in either direction  I think the inflation outlook is moderate Most of the recent influences on the inflation rate are probably temporary; I am not convinced that the recent spike in wage costs is more than temporary I would say, therefore, that with the inflation outlook moderate we should not be satisfied with anything less than a 3 to 3-1/2 percent rate of growth in the second half And I think we should make our policy judgments with that particular bias in mind Thank you   I would just like to respond very briefly to some of the observations that have been made First, if I thought we were facing an inflation rate of 5 percent, I certainly would be much more concerned and that would be reflected in my view of appropriate policy in that I'd probably want to be more restrictive I don't think we are Secondly, if I thought we could get the inflation rate down under 2 percent by keeping the economy growing at 2 percent and the unemployment rate at 73 percent, I would be willing to do that too I would be willing to pay that price, but I don't think we can get inflation down below 2 percent by holding the economy down at such a low rate of growth I don't see any beneficial effects to be achieved from such a slow stagnating rate of growth and that is why I said that we ought not to be satisfied with anything less than 3 to 3-1/2 percent Having said that, I would favor alternative B with a tilt toward ""A"" By that I mean that I would be willing to relax borrowing a little below Jerry's recommendation and more in accord with the borrowing that we would expect to be compatible with alternative B--in the $300 to $350 million range   He counted himself   I would support that   I don't see how anybody could have a problem with that   Just the way you did it "
2827,1985-07-09," You see the risks on the down side of the staff forecast or the down side of your own forecast?   Well, Mr Chairman, I agree that there seems to be some conflict between the anecdotal evidence and the figures as you try to make some sense out of them On the anecdotal side, most of the people I talk to and most of what I read suggest that the economy is a lot weaker than one would expect On the other hand, trying to make some sense out of the figures, one gets the impression of less weakness and some improvement, at least in the short run While my forecast is on the weak side of the range, I should explain that it does hide what I see going on between [now and year-end] My forecast was influenced by what happened in the first part of this year the first two quarters of the year came in very low But in the second half of the year, I see the economy expanding at least at a 3 percent rate and maybe as high as 3-1/2 percent The reason for that is that, looking at the numbers, it appears to me that it is hard to find any large component that is going to be weak for the next six months The business fixed investment outlook is pretty good for the rest of the year Business plans seem to be pretty firm, from 9 to 10 percent nominal Despite the overbuilding in office buildings, the numbers for non-residential construction are strong and contracts for non- residential construction seem to be holding up their strength So apparently growth in that area is going to continue at least for another six months And I am not at all convinced that consumption  -16-    7/9-10/85  expenditures are going to slow down to the extent that the staff forecasts; I am not entirely convinced that the pent-up demand has been entirely satisfied There has been a very strong increase in employment in the first half of this year and that may well influence consumption expenditures through the rest of the year, so consumption may well hold up higher than the staff forecasts So, my forecast is upbeat for the second half of the year Averaging it with the first half of the year brings it out on the low side And this strength in the second half, in my view, carries over into the first half of 1986 But then as 1986 proceeds, I [would expect] increasing weakness because (1) the expansion matures, and (2) as time goes on consumption expenditures are more likely to fall in line with disposable income, which has been declining and probably will continue [to decline] Eventually, non-residential construction is going to peter out as we move toward the second half of 1986 And in the absence of any stimulus--and of course the net new fiscal stimulus gets weaker and weaker as time goes on--it is hard to see where stimulus for continued growth along a 3-1/2 percent path will come from, especially in the last half of 1986 So, I would expect the economy to be expanding in the 3 percent range in the first half of 1986 and petering out very noticeably in the second half Again, averaging the two halves, 1986 comes out low as well So, my overall forecast for 1985 and 1986 looks low, but it does mask fairly credible performance for the second half of this year and the first half of next year   I agree with you, Henry, but what do you do about it?   I would like to see the borrowing number raised I could live with less than $100 million, but I would like to see it go up   Whether the policy is tightened depends upon what happens   Well, I don't want to tighten either I want to slow down the rate of growth of M1 I don't want to tighten in the sense of raising interest rates I don't think raising the borrowing level somewhat at this time actually would have much effect on market rates in the short term   It's still unacceptably high   Didn't that happen in 1980?  -30-    7/9-10/85   Well, we had this big jump in the money supply and then we said it couldn't possibly slow down enough I may be wrong on this but, as I recall, money started expanding very rapidly   Yes, we did have credit controls   That's right It was the opposite We said that it couldn't possibly increase at the rate it turned out to increase   Yes, rather than rebasing I wouldn't want to rebase at the present time for reasons that Chuck stated I would prefer, if we are going to ignore M1, to just ignore it   Another option--   Yes, change the range for the year   Without rebasing   No minimum balance   Well, Gary expressed my view pretty well It seems to be me that raising the upper limit to 8 percent simply recognizes what has happened already But at the same time, it puts us in a position to be flexible   It doesn't increase that danger if we just simply move the range to take into account what already has happened   How much over we don't know, and that's why raising the range somewhat gets--   I would like to see some gesture in the direction of less M1 growth, but I don't want to tighten up the interest rates   So, I could go for alternative B, keeping in mind that at the next meeting it might be necessary to do something to tighten   A minor gesture for public relations reasons might not hurt   If we rebase, we may as well make it 8 percent    7/9-10/85   Right   No, no   Probably   Would you read that last part about--   Or we can say 4 to 7 percent   4 to 7   Yes "
2853,1985-08-20," But isn't it up in the most recent period?   Not for Texas?   I don't have any quarrel with the comparison to a year earlier, but I somehow got the impression that within the last couple of months the rig count had climbed   Could I just ask Steve a question? Do you think there are good reasons for expecting that a slight decline in interest rates would stimulate the economy significantly?   Well, within a range of 1/2 to 3/4 of a point   My guess is it wouldn't   Lower rates   I really don't have much to add to what has already been said I don't see a high risk of recession over the forecast period, but I agree with the views that have been expressed that the risks to the forecast are on the down side I think the probability that we will be able to see 3 percent real growth in the second half is probably less than 50 percent And I think the rate of growth we get in the second half will not be satisfactory But just as I see nothing to encourage me to believe that we are going to get some significant acceleration, I don't see anything that is going to push us into recession; I think we are just going to bump along with slow growth And I agree with Chuck that there is probably very little that monetary policy can do about that at the present time without making things worse   Mr Chairman, I would favor moving a little insubstantially in the direction of--I wouldn't say tightening, but of trying to rein in M1 a bit more The main reason I feel this way is because the credibility of the Federal Reserve and its targeting procedures may well be at stake at some point soon, and I wouldn't like to see us lose that credibility So, I would like to indicate some perceptible move or effort toward bringing M1 back toward the top of the band by the end of the year I don't want to do anything substantial, as I said; I just want to indicate that we want M1 to move back So I would be in favor of doing a little more than alternative B and possibly a little less than alternative C, if that could be done And I would even be prepared to see borrowing around $500 million But my main concern would be to show some concern for  -24-    8/20/85  what has been happening to M1 There is a lot of liquidity out there now and I don't think that a slight rise in interest rates will have any perceptible effect on the economy at this point any more than I feel that a slight decline in interest rates will have any effect on the economy   So would I   He doesn't give it a very high probability  -30-    8/20/85   No change from where we are now   No, we were a little over--around $500 million   Mr Chairman, I wonder if we could consider some flexibility as we look out, along the lines suggested by Ed Boehne If growth in the aggregates should slow markedly, we could move toward ease rather promptly But if they continue to grow at current rates, we could tilt in the other direction   I would say the rate of growth is weak if it slows to the 8 percent area   For the quarter   It's not going to do that   Yes, I understand   An insubstantial change, though, is unlikely to do that   Well, the range is fine; the midpoint is not   The midpoint being $425 million   A little low   Mr Corrigan put some specifications on the table   I'd prefer 8-1/2 percent   On the first sentence?   I'd say ""would"" "
2878,1985-10-01," Well, Mr Chairman, I have no new observations to make that have not already been made around the table I, too, see the economy picking up I think that the staff forecast is right, and I particularly agree with it for the short term--that is, for the current quarter and the fourth quarter I think we'll get growth in the area of 3 percent Given this outlook and given the other noneconomic developments that Governor Wallich referred to, I agree with those around the table who say that we really don't have much policy scope, or very much room for maneuver from a policy point of view We certainly would not, or at least I would not, want to do anything that would reduce the chances of reaching a moderate 3 percent rate of growth And while I would have preferred to have seen in this period after the last FOMC meeting a funds rate somewhat higher than it did in fact average and certainly less money growth, I don't think that there is anything we can do now either to tighten or to ease policy; I think that we are in a very narrow range for policy decisions So, I think this calls for maintaining the existing degree of reserve pressure and that would be alternative B with borrowing around $500 million and the funds rate around 8 percent   So you would be guided more by what happens in the foreign exchange market?   I agree   Let's have a variant III   Right; that takes care of it "
2902,1985-11-04," Sam, what will the BIS do with the deposits of marks?   Where? In Germany?   Is that because you think long-term rates have as much effect on exchange rates as short-term rates?   You mean we may need the twist somewhere down the road?   But the amount of intervention that has occurred most recently would suggest that there are still some strong upward pressures   I certainly agree with that proposition   Or aiming for the lower side of the range more so than the upper   Oh, I wouldn't go that far   We could talk about $400 to $500 million   Aiming at being more comfortable? Or is it as close to--   Where do you see the natural tendency of interest rates--to rise right now?   5 to 6 percent   A good test is how much intervention   Even if it is the final day of the maintenance period "
2928,1985-12-16," Second   I think we have to prepare the Congress and the public for that; we can't do it suddenly this time If we think we are moving in that direction we need at least six months' preparation, and probably a little longer than that The last time we set targets we seemed to [unintelligible]   The more you ask us to focus on this, the more apparent it becomes that we should be hesitant about moving away from the aggregates too quickly The alternatives seem unsatisfactory   Well, Mr Chairman, it appears to me that we are depending on the modest growth in employment, some pickup in housing, and favorable consumer attitudes to get us to a moderate 2 percent rate of growth over 1986 If we look at the uncertainties in the forecast, particularly the uncertainties with regard to consumer capacities to continue spending, and if we also take account of our expectations that there will be some movement toward fiscal restraint, it seems to me that the risks to the forecast are on the down side Now, obviously, some very good things have happened In very general terms, interest rates have come down and the dollar has come down But when you try to evaluate what the impact of these generally favorable developments would be on specific sectors, it's very hard to see how this is going to get us more growth than is forecast for 1986 So, far from seeing the risks on the up side as Bob does, I see them rather on the down side So to me, the main question that is raised is whether a moderate 2 percent rate of growth for 1986 is acceptable,  -35-    12/16-17/85  all things considered, in the current circumstances, particularly in light of the inflation outlook   Well, it's less than 4 percent That's the outlook, and it could be [less] Most of the considerations surrounding that would suggest that, if anything, it would be more likely to be lower rather than higher There are oil price possibilities So, I would say that the inflation outlook is rather more favorable than unfavorable   Jerry, do you expect the Baker initiative to have an important impact before the end of 1986?   I would agree with that I just wouldn't expect to feel the impact before the end of 1986   They're perverse; they might turn around the other way   We tighten, then they move up   Well, Mr Chairman, I find the outlook for a 2 percent rate of [GNP] growth for 1986 unacceptable in the current circumstances So I find myself in sympathy with the observations that have been made around the table by Messrs Boehne and Guffey and also Mr Stern I would prefer an alternative somewhere between ""A"" and ""B"" for now I tend to separate the reduction in pressures on reserves from the discount rate decision I would prefer to ease pressure on bank reserves somewhat now and see what effect that has, and then make a discount rate decision in light of what happens when we ease somewhat So for now I would come down somewhere between ""A"" and ""B,"" holding in abeyance the discount rate reduction   I think when it's not clear what we expect to happen we should do a 1/4 point; but when things are pretty clear we may as well move in 1/2 points   Right   So you're pessimistic about coordination in Europe?   But they won't see it for a while; we would have done something or not   It's prospective   7 to 9-1/2 percent?   No, I don't think so   That's really elevating those things   Yes, that's right   I would prefer to see it stay as it is People will be trying to figure out what we are trying to tell them I don't want to tell them that because that's not how I see it   One less thing for market watchers "
2953,1986-02-11," Sam, are there any other explanations that you know about, other than the [reaction to] statements of foreign central bank and government officials, to explain the movement in the exchange rate after the lowering of the discount rate in Japan? As you said, after the Japanese lowered the discount rate and their interest rates generally moved down, the dollar weakened further and the yen went up I gather, as you said, that the explanation related to the statements of government officials But was there anything other than that?   Very puzzling   I will just say that I go along with the staff forecast with all the caveats and uncertainties Accordingly, I am raising my forecast for real GNP by 1/4 of one percent and I am lowering my price number by 01 of one percent   Mr Chairman, could I just ask Mr Axilrod if he thinks that alternative I would be consistent with an expectation that there is no threat of slow [M1] growth in the first half of this year but there is some danger of slow growth in the second half of the year?   Mr Chairman, like almost everybody else, I would favor retaining M1, with its weight similar to that of the other monetary aggregates, for the reasons that have already been mentioned by several people I would favor that not so much because M1 should be a rigid guide to policy but because, as Jerry and Ed pointed out, we may need it in the future to explain some policy moves that we might want to take I would favor a 3 to 8 percent range, but I suspect that probably would be seen as too wide and might be interpreted as a signal that we are moving away from targeting M1 So, perhaps a narrower range of 4 percentage points would be better received I would both lower and raise the range a bit to 3-1/2 to    2/11-12/86  7-1/2 percent but I would be perfectly willing--in fact I would prefer it if most people feel we could get away with it--to go with a 3 to 8 percent range On debt, I have a good deal of sympathy for the point Frank made; I think we ought to look seriously at the feasibility of an adjusted debt range I would urge the staff to look into the feasibility of moving in that direction However, until they do, I would favor expanding the range a little to take into account what we expect to happen We expect that debt will grow a little faster than 11 percent, so why not move the range out to 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent?   What is wrong with half percents?   If you think it is going to come within the half--   Well, we have reason to believe that we are going to miss the 8 to 11 percent   I could go with 8 to 12 percent   I think Governor Wallich supports alternative B   I also think we should hold steady at this point with alternative B and the borrowing range of $300 to $400 million with a little bias toward $300 million   It's a wider range than we've been [using]   A day or two  -59-    2/11-12/86   $300 million did you say, Peter, would be consistent with 7-3/4 percent?   I'd like a little above or a little below $300 million   I don't quite understand what Jerry was saying Are you saying we should be firming up a bit for you to stay comfortable?   Presumably, that's no change  -62-    2/11-12/86 "
2978,1986-04-01," Well, Mr Chairman, I would like to join the general euphoria and jump solidly into the Boehne camp I certainly agree that we are very likely to see strong expansion over the second half of the year The only reservation that I have is that, as Frank pointed out, the expansion may be stronger than we now expect We may get a higher rate of growth than is indicated in the staff forecast What is more [likely] in my view is that the expansion may be spread out in a pattern somewhat different from that in the staff forecast We may not feel the full impact of all of these stimulative developments until the first part of next year And the period of fairly strong growth may extend further into 1987 than we now expect Of course, that has some implications as to what one would be inclined to do about it So I would say that if the mixed pattern of news that we have been seeing currently continues somewhat longer than one would expect--continues even into the second half of the year--that it is not cause for worry I cannot remember any time in the recent past when the basic fundamentals pointed so clearly to a strong expansion And I am prepared to sit back and wait for it and let it unfold   Only that office construction that you point to is relatively permanent The others are going to--   Yes, we hope the budget deficit is going to fall   [Unintelligible]   Well, Mr Chairman, I wish I could be different from everybody else, but I can't So I am going to go along with alternative B for all the reasons that people have expressed We want to stay where we are, to do nothing, to maintain an even keel--steady as you go   The first time I have ever seen that!   I wouldn't say reserve pressures eased after the discount rate; interest rates fell   We're not making any change, so why move it? That's going to confuse people "
3003,1986-05-20," Well, Mr Chairman, I'd just like to join the general agreement that has been expressed around the table that the staff forecast is right--that the current economic indicators are mixed and that the current sluggishness that we seem to be seeing will give way to acceleration in the second half But I suppose the main question is What would be the timing of the acceleration and the size of it? I myself would expect that we will see this acceleration sooner rather than later--that is to say, that we'll certainly see some strong evidence of it in the third quarter rather than the fourth quarter And I would expect the acceleration to be strong rather than moderate I also share some of the concerns expressed around the table that, with the likely increase in import prices and the acceleration that I anticipate, we may begin to see some inflationary pressures emerging but not in the near term I would be concerned about the possibility of inflation much farther out into the second half of 1987 But my concerns would be there and I think that's a factor we should not lose sight of On that I would see the risks pretty predominantly on the up side   Well, Mr Chairman, I think we ought to stay in a holding pattern and that means I favor alternative B, like everybody else On the directive, I favor alternative II I also favor being neutral And I see no conflict in being neutral with allowing the market to know that we acknowledge what's happening with the aggregates without making a judgment; we just let the market know that we know this I think not to do that would risk giving the wrong signals So, I would prefer alternative II While I think we now are probably closer to the time when we may feel some need to snug up a bit, I would be careful not to give any indication to the market that I felt that way, because it just might make it happen; it might give rise to something   Who needs much more than 20 percent growth?   Are you changing your mind?   Me neither  MR ANGELL [Unintelligible] these aggregates [unintelligible] one path and it changed from 15 percent   Because of the vagueness of it, you don't know quite what it means How much lower?  -41-    5/20/86   I would be prepared to drop it   Not ""pronounced"" "
3028,1986-07-08," What about GNP?   Mike, I think I heard you say that tax reform would have the effect of broadening the tax base of state and local governments How is that?   I would hate to see us drop the target range for Ml I would much rather see us retain a target range but announce that we don't expect the growth to be within that range This way we would be facing up to the fact that--   I would have no problem dropping it for 1987 It would be easier to drop it for 1987 than for 1986 I would prefer at this time to keep 3 to 8 percent for 1987 too and change it later   But I would go along with dropping it for 1987, if there is a consensus   I think it conveys a sense of honesty We are telling the public what we think the range ought to be Then we are telling them that for reasons that are not altogether fully apparent, we are not going to make the target range It is more honest to do it that way   We could keep the present range and say it's a monitoring range   Do you think the difference is of any significance for public understanding of what we are doing?    7/8-9/86   Mr Chairman, I think the staff's forecast is about the best way of looking at things right now I continue to look for the pickup in the second half, though it likely will be less of an acceleration than I expected a month ago and probably will be later in the second half than I expected But like others, I find the situation looks more clouded than usual, in part because of some of the factors pointed out by Frank Morris and Jerry Corrigan It is    7/8-9/86  very difficult to read what is going on right now At the present time, I have less confidence in my view of the future than I have had in some time It could be that I am being, as are others, unduly influenced by the most recent data that we have seen over the last month I hope that is so But if we stand back and look at what is going on, I think we have to recognize, as Gary Stern pointed out, that some of the factors that have been dragging down the economy are likely to become less influential in the future The fundamentals that we counted on to spur the economy are still there In my mind, it is hard to imagine that business fixed investment will come in lower than the staff forecast It seems to me that [the forecast] in that sector is probably a rock bottom outlook And while a turnaround in net exports may be delayed somewhat further, it is hard to imagine that it will be delayed beyond the second half I expect that we will see this acceleration before the end of the year, and my own guess is that the risks are not on the down side--that we are not likely to get a poorer performance than the staff's forecast If anything, it will be somewhat better than the staff's forecast Now, all of this is clouded further by the overhang of tax reform Tax reform, of course, is factored into the staff's forecast But in my mind, there are certain psychological effects that can't be factored in, which could perhaps have a more restraining impact than one would imagine at the present time This would be especially true if the revenue raising provisions kick in ahead of the cut in rates So, while I would repeat that the risk is probably on the up side of the staff's forecast, there are these imponderables out there that are very difficult to factor in   That's mine   I would like to join Tom on that too for the most part I agree with most of what he said   Maybe a 1 percent discount rate reduction would do more   And do more about the cost of capital   If we really want to do something, or if we think that we have things to do that we should do--   I just don't think we need to--   But we wouldn't get the reduction in the funds rate   I'm sorry, I didn't understand   If we weren't going to reduce the discount rate, I would be in favor of alternative B   But given the reduction, I would have to go along with alternative A I don't know yet how I am going to vote on the discount rate   We don't hit the borrowing target exactly anyway--    7/8-9/86   It might be interpreted as tightening "
3053,1986-08-19," I was going to ask Peter one question   Did you say you haven't done anything so far this year?   Any particular reason for that?   I don't understand that last point If we lowered the discount rate, the Japanese would not follow us but would instead intervene to maintain--   And as a last resort--   I see   Well, I think you said it  -39-    8/19/86   No, I meant that we ought to stay on the current policy course and not move toward ease   I support that too   Mr Chairman, I favor alternative B with the view that we ought to stay about where we are with respect to the growth in the aggregates I expect that the economy is going to turn out to be very difficult to get a grip on And I would agree with some of the views expressed earlier that we don't need a discount rate cut for domestic reasons I don't see what it will do to improve our situation domestically However, I think the argument for reducing the discount rate to prod the Europeans and the Japanese to stimulate their economies is an important one That turnaround in net exports at the present time is probably very crucial to maintaining a satisfactory rate of expansion in our domestic economy and in my view the way to move in that direction would be to reduce the discount rate along with alternative B No one wants to add to liquidity in the economy right now, but I think the risks of not trying to do something to affect the trade sector are great enough to assume the risks that go along with expanding the liquidity in the economy and so forth   Mr Chairman, what's the argument for easing on the open market operation side if we don't reduce the discount rate?   That's not what I had in mind   If I am going to ease, I want to lower the discount rate   With a cut in the discount rate   Theoretical?   Leave it at $300 million with the discount rate cut or not "
3080,1986-09-23," Why don't we do both? Could we do it in both circumstances?   That's the point   Not necessarily   You'd go in the market more frequently but you wouldn't necessarily buy more   It seems to me that it's a potentially useful tool that we might not want to give up   You give it up if you don't use it every once in a while   I can imagine times--not often--when there might be a shortage of bills and we don't want to increase that shortage of bills in the market and there may be some long-term securities available   Would buying smaller amounts have an announcement effect?   What's the average amount?   You could certainly buy a couple of hundred million   To keep people from being surprised   Mr Chairman, I think the staff's forecast is a good one I expect, as they do, that the economy will pick up in this quarter and in the fourth quarter However, I can't help noting some areas of concern The first is that the two areas of strength in the economy--consumption spending and single-family residential construction--while likely to maintain their strength, will be contributing less to the economy That is, their rate of growth will be decelerating and residential construction in the single-family area will be offset by what's happening in multifamily housing construction And I'm mindful that the two components that we are relying on to provide this pickup--that is, inventory accumulation and an improvement in the external accounts--are areas that in the past have proven difficult to forecast As has been pointed out, we may not see the degree of improvement in these components that we would hope for Therefore, I would see the risks of the forecast on the down side I'm gratified, however, by the recent evidence of improvement in the economy, particularly in the employment area, and also by the anecdotal evidence that has come in There seems to be an improved sentiment in the business community as well But I do see the risks at this point on the down side   I will join the landslide Alternative B, no nuances   Sooner or later we will be right   I think we balanced it just right "
3105,1986-11-05," Mr Chairman, I feel pretty comfortable about the staff's longer-run forecast, despite the fact that we are seeing an aging of the expansion of the economy over the next year I am somewhat less comfortable about the short-range forecast--that is, over this current quarter and the next quarter, largely because the rate of growth that we are expecting is highly dependent on inventories and net exports And that, of course, [unintelligible] for a fairly chancy outcome I certainly agree with Wayne that there are a lot of other sectors in the economy that are components of the GNP So I think that at this time we are forced back more than usual on the anecdotal evidence I am encouraged by what I hear around the table that basically the feelings and the mood are good and/or better; chances are much greater that we will see some improvement in the short run, over the next couple of quarters, than no improvement But this is a time when I think we just have to sit back and wait to see what will happen  -22-    11/5/86   Mr Chairman, on Japan Aren't their exports still increasing?   In the last couple of months their trade surplus has increased   Okay "
