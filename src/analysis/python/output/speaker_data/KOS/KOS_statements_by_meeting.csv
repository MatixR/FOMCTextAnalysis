4278,2001-03-20,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m going to continue the tradition of   another tall, wavy-haired guy with glasses and refer to the charts that were distributed   this morning1/     On the first page the familiar forward rate  agreements depict in red the decline of US interest rates over the  last few months  After the Committee’s January meeting, both cash  and forward rates were stable at first but began to decrease as the  equity market fell under pressure, with announcements of earnings  shortfalls in the corporate sector, and as speculation regarding an  intermeeting move increased  That speculation was fueled by the  comments of a former Fed official, who in fact started giving  precise probabilities of an intermeeting ease  Currently, with the  three-month cash rate--the solid red line--already below 5 percent,  the market is anticipating further easing beyond any actions that  may or may not come from this meeting  And the chatter about a  75 basis point cut at this meeting has coincided with the spillover of  weakness from the NASDAQ to the broader stock indices  As of  early this week, most of the primary dealers were expecting a 50  basis point easing move at this meeting, though a minority, 10 out  of the 25, were forecasting 75  Another measure of expectations,  the April fed funds futures, is at about 484 right now, though it’s  difficult to disentangle the degree to which that reflects expectations  of a 75 basis point ease at this meeting or a 50 basis point move  today followed by an intermeeting move       Moving to the euro area--the blue lines--both cash and forward   rates have been largely stable since the beginning of the year  The  European Central Bank (ECB) has been symmetric in its rhetoric,  trying to prevent the market from anticipating an early ease and  taking what it is calling a wait-and-see approach  But I would note  that forward rates began to trade below cash rates around early  November, or roughly two months after the same dynamic was  observed in the United States  European officials have dismissed  suggestions that the market is sniffing out a euro-area slowdown  and have explained their forward market as being pulled by  movements in the US market  Maybe yes, maybe no  But both  forward rates and anecdotal surveys suggest that the market is  anticipating 25 basis points of ease from the ECB this spring and a  total of 50 basis points by the fall       In Japan--the set of green lines--we can see that rates basically   have made a round trip since last June  The Bank of Japan (BOJ)  initially raised rates in August and then pulled back in the last few  weeks with two cuts in the discount rate and a cut in the overnight  call rate  Then yesterday the BOJ announced a change in its  operating procedures; it indicated that it will target current account  balances on its balance sheet, possibly increasing its acquisitions of  Japanese government bonds (JGBs) rather than targeting the call  rate per se  Japanese markets were closed today, so we’ll have to     3/20/01 3  wait for reactions tomorrow in their markets  The call rate is  expected to trade near zero      Turning to page two, this set of charts is an updated version of   ones introduced last time as a measure of financial conditions,  taking the difference between two-year rates and the policy rates of  some of the major central banks  The policy rates of the various  central banks involve slightly different maturities; some use an  overnight target and some use a target of as much as two weeks   The top panel is the two-year government yield less the central  bank’s short-term policy rate and the bottom panel is the two-year  swap rate less the policy rate  In the top panel we show the German  two-year note versus the ECB’s refinancing rate  In the bottom  panel we used the euro swap rate versus that same ECB rate     Whether measured against the two-year note where the   inversions occurred first or against the swap rate where the  inversions followed a few months later, it seems that financial  conditions, if one accepts this as a good measure of them, were  rather tight by early this year  Now, since the January FOMC  meeting, the central banks of Canada, the United Kingdom, and  Japan also have eased policy  Only the ECB did not move  But the  degree of inversion was broadly similar, as was observed at the time  of the last Committee meeting     Turning to page three, I have shown some of the developments   in Japanese financial markets over the last few months  The top  panel has dollar/yen graphed on an inverted scale, and you can see  that the yen has been depreciating since December and is now in the  122 to 122-1/2 region  The market generally views the policy in  Tokyo as desiring a weaker yen, but Japanese officials have been  trying not to appear to be encouraging that weakening  But with the  Ministry of Finance (MOF) having taken a laissez faire approach,  the market is convinced that it is in accordance with their wishes   Nevertheless, the MOF is trying to walk that fine line, not wanting  to antagonize interests on this side of the Pacific      The middle panel shows the decline of JGB yields  That has   involved an interesting move from above 160 to about 115  percent, especially since the finance minister was quoted as saying  that the fiscal situation in Japan was on the verge of being  “catastrophic”  We have seen downgrades of Japanese banks, but at  least in the bond market that seems to have been outweighed by  expectations that interest rates would fall  Perhaps the market was  anticipating yesterday’s announcement by the BOJ  And regardless  of what we may think of it, the JGB market has been the asset of     3/20/01 4  choice during periods of stress in Japan  Even at yields of near l  percent, the carry, with a near zero financing cost, is still fairly  profitable  But there’s a sizable risk for the banks and the insurers  that have loaded up on these bonds, if confidence in this market  should falter     The bottom panel shows the Topix and the Nikkei indices    They are both down between 15 and 20 percent, perhaps not  surprising given what has happened in the economy, which I’m sure  Karen will discuss later  And with a decline of that magnitude, the  topic of bank capital adequacy has come back to the fore, especially  with mark-to-market accounting soon to be introduced  But  interestingly, the bank sub-index actually has performed in line with  the broader average  A widely held presumption is that the  government will pump more money into the banks as needed to  help with bad debt cleanup     On page four, the top panel has the euro-dollar exchange rate   since the beginning of the year, from the time when this Committee  first decreased rates in early January  The interesting point here is  the weakness of the euro, which has surprised traders and analysts,  given the reduced GDP forecasts for this country, the equity price  pressures we’ve seen, and the reductions in US interest rates  versus steady rates in Europe       The middle panel shows the degree of interest rate convergence   over the period since January 1, which is especially notable at the  short end  The green line shows the three-month spread in LIBOR  between dollar and euro time deposits, which has moved from about  150 basis points to near 20 basis points  The blue line is the two- year swap differential, and that has come down from around 100  basis points to about 40 basis points  The red line, the 10-year swap  spread, has been more stable  The less pronounced shift in that  measure may suggest that the market perceives the reduced return  on dollar assets to be a short-run phenomenon     The bottom panel charts the value of the US dollar on a year-  to-date basis against a range of currencies  As you can see, the  dollar has appreciated roughly 5 percent, give or take, against most  currencies  That appreciation has occurred despite some of the  negatives that I mentioned before  And market participants are  puzzled about what might explain it  Among the explanations is  that the market may just be getting it wrong, that a mis-pricing is  going on  Another is that a V-shaped recovery is being factored in  and that the market is looking beyond the valley  A less benign  interpretation is that the market is pricing in slowdowns in other     3/20/01 5  countries that are not yet embedded in economic forecasts  And  perhaps, though I’m not persuaded, there’s a safe-haven effect  going on  The reason I question that is because we have not seen  other indicia of a true safe-haven situation, such as a widening of  bid-ask spreads or other signs of stress in the market  Whatever the  cause, surveys suggest that portfolio managers may be  overweighted in euros relative to their benchmarks  So, from a  purely technical perspective, the risk for the euro in the near term is  that if portfolio managers move toward neutrality, the euro might be  in for a rough time at least on a short-term basis     Turning to the next page, the top panel reflects the lower yields   that we have seen in the coupon portion of our fixed income market   The recent steepening of the yield curve is evident; the curve is now  the steepest it has been since late 1998  Part of the reason for the  short end outperforming the long end is the expectation that policy  will continue to ease, to some extent because of a reallocation of  funds from equities to bonds, though that's a hard point to get a  handle on  But the underperformance at the long end might also be  at least in part a reflection of comments made by the Secretary of  the Treasury  Those comments raised questions in the minds of  some people about the Administration’s commitment to the buy- back program, which would affect the long end primarily, since  that’s where most of the purchases have been focused     I mentioned the safe-haven or flight-to-quality factor  Again,   there doesn’t seem to be much evidence yet of a true safe-haven  effect, although one area to keep an eye on is the emerging markets   The spread in the emerging market bond index (EMBI) has  increased by about 100 basis points in the last month and a half   And as you can see from the red line for Turkey and the green line  for Argentina--those are sub-components of JP Morgan’s EMBI-- the spreads have widened as the political situation in those countries  has deteriorated  The news overnight that the Argentine finance  minister has resigned may or may not help; we’ll see  The market  reaction so far, at least in early trading, has involved little change in  that spread, but I think the message is “stay tuned”     Page six provides an update on the commercial paper market in   a chart format you’ve seen before  The top two panels compare the  year-end 2000 spread--in red--versus the spreads in the previous  five years for 30- and 90-day commercial paper  The bottom panel  depicts the yields so far this year  The California power situation  and some downgrades of prominent companies like Daimler and  Lucent raised anxiety early in the year, but the amount of  outstanding commercial paper has actually declined in the last four     3/20/01 6  months  The reduction in A2/P2 paper outstanding was sizable,  about one-quarter of the total  The good news is that this short-term  debt has been refinanced with longer-term maturities and, in fact,  issuance of both investment grade and high-yield paper has been  running at a fairly strong pace year to date  But it’s noteworthy that  the A2/P2 spread has remained at a very high level relative to  A1/P1, even as interest rates have fallen  So it does create a bit of a  conundrum in that the market is willing to lend to some of these  lower quality rated companies on a long-term basis but is unwilling  to do so on a short-term basis     Finally, on page seven, a point or two on reserves as we head   into tax season  In the top panel the blue bars indicate the actual  levels of major tax receipts during the March-to-May period in  1998, 1999, and 2000  The red, green, and orange bars indicate the  projections of the New York, Treasury, and Board staffs for those  same months in 2001     In the bottom panel the blue line represents the New York   staff’s projected level of the Treasury’s general balance for the  period from March 15th to May 31st  We are forecasting elevated  levels of the Treasury’s balance at the Fed in late April-early May,  to between $15 billion and $20 billion  For perspective, this  compares to a peak of about $30 billion last year and an historical  peak of $52 billion during the 1997 tax season  The underlying  reserves over the period, assuming that $12 billion of long-term RPs  is rolled over and making a zero assumption for SOMA purposes,  are roughly $16 billion on average  We expect at the Desk to use a  mix of term RPs to deal with reserve needs in this period       Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations during the   intermeeting interval; we will need a vote for the domestic  operations  And I’d be happy to answer any questions       I’m sure New York has the right answer!  I have not endeavored to   find out what the difference is in the models  I can only guess that there might be   differences in capital gains projections  Is that the case, Don?     That might account for some of the difference  "
4322,2001-05-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the charts  that were distributed this morning1      The top panel of the first page depicts US cash and forward 3-month   rates  The cash rate is down about 3/4 of a percentage point since the day  before the Committee’s intermeeting move on April 18th  The 3-month  forward rate has declined a bit less, by about 40 basis points, and the 9-month  forward rate is roughly unchanged  The 3-month and cash rates are roughly  on top of each other as we speak, and the 9-month forward rate is actually  above the cash rate for the first time since last September  Perhaps the market  is looking forward to the end of the easing cycle      Moving to the center panel, cash and forward rates in the euro area have   exhibited a saw-toothed pattern, as the market first became convinced that the  ECB would ease after the March IFO survey and then reversed its view after  the ECB convinced the markets it would not ease  Of course, that was just in  time for last week’s 25 basis point reduction in the refinancing rate!     The bottom panel reflects the downward pressure on Japanese money   market rates across all tenors since the March 19th change in the Bank of  Japan’s (BOJ) operational target  But it’s not just money market rates  The  two-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield is currently yielding 6 basis  points       Moving to the second page, the top panel shows the 2-, 10-, and 30-year   U S Treasury yields since December 1st as well as the target fed funds rate   The 2-year rate has come down more than 100 basis points while the 30-year  has drifted up and the 10-year is roughly unchanged  That has led to a  steepening of the yield curve on the one hand, and also to a situation where                                                               1/  Copies of the charts are appended to this transcript        5/15/01     2   the 10- and 30-year yields are above the target fed funds rate for the first time  since May of 2000     The chart in the bottom panel depicts the fact that this is not just a   Treasury yield curve phenomenon  The US swap curve has steepened  substantially as well since last December, as have the UK and Canadian  yield curves, although by a lesser amount  The euro-area swap curve has  remained more or less unchanged, although it also has steepened in the last  day or two       Moving to the third page and taking a somewhat longer-term perspective,   I have shown the 2- to 30-year spread from January of 1989 through March  11th of this year  The shaded areas represent periods when the Fed was easing  policy  The sharp steepening of the curve from about –50 to +150 basis points  in the last few months has put the curve at its steepest since January of 1994   As the bottom panel shows, despite that steepening and the backup in yields,  the absolute level of 10- and 30-year yields is only slightly above the cyclical  low, which was reached in 1998       The chart at the top of page four shows domestic credit spreads to US   Treasuries of comparable maturities  The red line is the Merrill Lynch high- yield spread, which is on the left-hand scale  The A2 industrial corporates, the  US 10-year interest rate swap, and the 10-year Fannie Mae benchmark are on  the right-hand scale  In general, spreads have been narrowing since January  1st, although high-yield spreads are still wider than they were last summer,  perhaps affected by the weak equity market and the higher risk premium that  companies with more leveraged balance sheets are being charged   Nevertheless, issuance remained strong in the first quarter, especially in the  investment grade sector      The bottom panel shows the spread between A1/P1 and A2/P2 paper,   which has been drifting lower for both 30-day and 90-day issues  In part, that  may reflect a bit less risk aversion  But it may also reflect in part the fact that  some of the weaker A2 borrowers are having trouble rolling over their  commercial paper and have drawn on other sources of credit, such as backup  credit lines  Or more likely they have issued high-yield debt, a vehicle that  has remained open for many of these borrowers     Turning to the next page, I thought I would provide a quick review of the   tax season, now that it’s mostly behind us  In the top panel, the blue bars  show the growth of tax receipts for the last three tax seasons--that is, for April  and May  The red bar is the forecast for the current year, which is inclusive of  actual data through May 11th and thus actually reflects most of the period   The growth this year has been a bit slower than last year, but it is slightly  above what we saw in 1999          5/15/01     3   In the bottom panel, the red line depicts the Treasury’s general balance  between April 2nd and May 11th of this year  The Treasury’s general balance  topped out at about $70 billion in early May, but it remained comfortably  below TT&L capacity  Therefore, we were able to avoid the large reserve  drains and the associated buildup in the Treasury’s Fed balance that had  become the norm in the last few years  In fact, we looked back at historical  data and found that this was the first time in at least 15 years that the general  balance did not exceed the TT&L capacity and therefore spill over onto the  Fed  There were two reasons for this  One was that the Treasury made more  efficient use of cash management bills; secondly, the Treasury and the St  Louis Fed successfully campaigned with banks to bring additional collateral  into the TT&L program and thus raise capacity       Finally, on the last page I thought I would give the Committee a quick   update on our outright operations  It has been almost a year since we  established single-issue limits for SOMA holdings  And as the top panel  shows, we’ve had an increase in our outright operations  The blue portions of  the bars represent net portfolio expansion  The gray portions represent the  amount that has been purchased to offset the effects of redeemed securities   As you can see, before 2000 redemptions were relatively infrequent  But with  the sharp reduction of the size of auctions combined with our single-issue  limits, SOMA is having redemptions basically every month  In 2000 and in  2001 to date, as well as in our projection for the rest of the year, more than 50  percent of our outright purchases are to offset the effects of redemptions      The bottom panel depicts the number of outright operations that our Desk   has conducted since 1996  We are now operating on nearly one out of every  three business days  Performance is holding up; the bid-to-cover ratio on our  operations has stayed at 6 or higher  But the scale of the Desk’s activity is  growing at a time when the size of the market is shrinking, and that is placing  somewhat of a burden on our outright operations  We will be looking in  coming weeks at ways we can ease that pressure on our outright operations,  with one of the most likely ways being the expanded use of long-term repos   For the time being we’re planning to maintain the size of the repo book at $12  billion but we will be examining the scope for expanding that, and I will  report back to the Committee after we conclude our analysis     Mr Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations in the   intermeeting period  I will need a vote to ratify domestic operations, and I  will be glad to take any questions       Especially recently, with the steepening of the yield curve, there has been   chatter in the markets about that as a possible explanation  I don’t know that forecasts of   inflation are actually rising  At least in my reading of the research and commentary, I haven’t   seen that people are raising their expectations for inflation  But it may be that they’re using that   explanation to explain a steepening of the yield curve that they otherwise can’t quite explain     Thank you  I’ll try to be quick  I circulated a memo late last week with   some housekeeping items relating to our foreign currency reserves  Two items were for   information  One item--the renewal of our swap lines with Canada and Mexico--requires action   by the Committee  I think everybody will remember that all of the other swap lines that we had   with the European central banks, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank for International Settlements   were discontinued coincident with the launch of the euro  The two that were retained were with   our NAFTA partners, Canada and Mexico    With the change in Administration, Karen Johnson and I initiated conversations with   Treasury officials to ask them about their view of the swaps and the utility they saw in the swaps    They were very open to the idea of having discussions with their counterparts in Mexico and   Canada to see whether they could perhaps be cajoled into viewing the swaps in the same way   that many people here and some at the Treasury do--namely, that perhaps they have outlived   their usefulness  The Mexicans in particular have some difficulties with ending the swaps this   year, although in principle they were open to the idea that the day may soon come when the swap   arrangements are no longer needed  The Canadians are still having some internal discussions   about the swap issue, but I think there’s a good chance that they may come around to that view   as well  So it seems that some more discussion is needed until everybody agrees  I think we   may be close, with “close” measured in months rather than weeks  So we may be there soon    Karen, do you want to add anything?     I don’t want to make a forecast  In part it may depend on how quickly the   Mexicans can negotiate a CCL with the IMF, and that’s very difficult to judge  The Canadians   need to have their own discussion  So again, I wouldn’t make a forecast in terms of weeks; I   think it may take longer than that  But I believe we all three--ourselves, the Canadians, and the   Mexicans--are on the same plane in that the time has come or will soon come to end the swaps     "
4365,2001-08-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the  charts that were distributed at your places earlier this morning 1        The first chart depicts the standard 3-month cash and forward  deposit rates from early April through last Friday  As you can see, US  short-term rates continued to decline over the recent intermeeting  interval Weak corporate earnings, layoff announcements, and a Beige  Book that was perceived as downbeat were among many other factors  that affected sentiment during the period  Three-month cash and  forward rates declined by about 20 basis points over the period  Nine- month forward rates rose immediately after the June FOMC meeting  but then declined quickly and on balance fell about 35 basis points for  the period as a whole While the 9-month forward rate may suggest  that the market is building toward a tightening later in 2002, as perhaps  does the Eurodollar future strip, other indicators such as the   2-year  note are more ambiguous--a subject I’ll talk about later        In the euro area, cash rates have been stable since the last meeting,  but 3-month and 9-month forward rates have continued to be pulled  lower, by 16 and 21 basis points respectively  Forecasts for the euro- area economy have been trimmed and the market is cautiously building  in some additional easing, with many market participants expecting 25  basis points of ease at the end of this month  The largest changes in  rates occurred on August 8th and 9th after the Beige Book was released  here and the ECB’s monthly report, which was viewed as paving the  way for an ease in policy, was released in Europe         The bottom panel shows the Japanese government yield curve from  3 months out to 10 years  I’ve highlighted three snapshots coinciding  with the last two FOMC meeting dates and this past Friday, ahead of  the current meeting  The short end of the curve is below 20 basis points   1 The charts used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript     8/21/01 2   out to 3 years, but the longer end of the curve has proved more resistant  to further prodding by the Bank of Japan The announcement by the  Bank of Japan on August 14th that it would increase its current account  balance target from 5 trillion to 6 trillion and also raise the pace of JGB  purchases has not noticeably affected the yield curve In fact, the  longer end of the curve is actually higher than it was on June 26th         Turning to page 2, I’ve provided a snapshot of asset prices in US  markets  All three markets--the fixed income, equity, and foreign  exchange markets--reflect a continually shifting sentiment and are  discounting a weaker outlook The top panel shows the 2-, 10-, and 30- year yields along with the fed funds target since April 1st The entire  curve has shifted lower and the 2- to 30-year spread has steepened by  another 10 basis points, from about 166 basis points at the time of the  last meeting to about 176 basis points at the close yesterday           I would make two points  First, benchmark long-term rates have  come down quite a bit in the last seven weeks  The 10-year is down  about 40 basis points and the 30-year is down somewhat less, by about  20 basis points Second, the 2-year note traded as low as 364 percent  during this period, the lowest rate since the 2-year note began to be  regularly auctioned in 1976 By way of comparison, during 1992 and  1993, when the funds rate was at 3 percent for an extended period of  time, the 2-year rate never fell below 366 percent  Given the  sensitivity of the 2-year note to the funds rate, if the markets were  building toward a tightening at some point--as suggested by the  Eurodollar futures and the forward rate agreements--then one might  have expected the 2-year note yield to be higher than it is now  So, its  behavior at least raises questions about the signals being given by some  of those other indicators         In the middle panel I’ve plotted the major US stock indices  indexed to 100 on April 1st, which also coincides roughly with their  lows for 2001 As reflected in the chart, those indices rose through  much of the spring but have been coming down--and have continued to  come down in the intermeeting period--as the market has adjusted to  the weaker outlook         The bottom panel shows changes in the trade-weighted value of the  dollar against other major currencies  The dollar has declined modestly  on a trade-weighted basis, but that masks sharper declines against some  of the major currencies, especially the yen, the euro, the Swiss franc,  and even some other currencies such as the Singapore dollar that have  been used as funding currencies in so-called carry trades  In part the  decline is probably due to perceptions about the recovery; in part it may  reflect some risk aversion  As economic activity seems to be slowing     8/21/01 3   globally, a little risk aversion may lead to a closing out of some carry  trades And finally, some of the ongoing chatter in markets about the  Administration’s posture toward the dollar may also be a contributing  factor         Turning to the third page, the top panel depicts the major European  equity indices, also going back to early April  They show a similar  pattern to that in US markets except that the decline has been more  dramatic for European equities, especially over the intermeeting period   In that interval most of these major indices fell between 3-1/2 and 10  percent, in part reflecting revisions in forecasts for growth as well as  weak earnings Interestingly, though, the euro actually had one of its  sharpest rallies since its launch, moving from about 85 cents to almost  92 cents during this period for reasons that are not fully clear, given  some of the news that was coming out of Europe  One explanation  might be that interest rate differentials are finally biting  Those interest  rates have been narrowing for almost two years in favor of the euro   The bottom panel shows the differentials between dollar and euro swap  rates These spreads continue to decline modestly but are still slightly  in favor of the dollar         Turning to the next page, the top panel depicts the dollar-yen  exchange rate A couple of noteworthy events have taken place in  Japan since the last FOMC meeting First, the Upper House elections  were held and the LDP and Prime Minister Koizumi did quite well--an  outcome that is expected to accelerate structural reforms in Japan   Second, on August 14th the BOJ announced changes in its operational  targets, as I noted earlier That combination would have been expected  to produce a weakening in the yen and a lift to the equity markets  In  the event, the yen actually has appreciated from about 125 to below 120  this morning and equity prices have continued their decline, as reflected  in the middle panel  The reasons for the yen’s appreciation are not  fully obvious Repatriation and the approach of the end of the fiscal  half-year have been mentioned yet again  Another possibility is that  there may be some risk aversion kicking in that is causing some of the  short yen trades to be unwound But it’s not immediately apparent why  the yen would be appreciating in this kind of environment   As I mentioned, Japanese equities have continued to decline with  only a brief interruption after the Upper House elections and the BOJ’s  operational changes The Nikkei, which was over 13,000 at the time of  the last FOMC meeting is now below 12,000 and at its lowest level  since 1984 The Topix Bank sub-index has also been falling again,  reflecting renewed doubts about the health of the Japanese banking  system  As the bottom panel shows, that sub-index is actually lower  now than it was during the 1998 banking crisis in Japan     8/21/01 4        Turning to the last page, the chart shows monthly growth rates,  seasonally adjusted, for currency during 2001 As you can see, we’ve  had elevated currency growth in July and also in August  Most of that  is attributed to cash shipments overseas, primarily to Argentina  The  growth of currency has been running at roughly double the rates  observed earlier this year, translating into deepening reserve needs over  the past intermeeting period  Those deeper needs were met primarily  by an expansion of the permanent SOMA portfolio and by a modest  increase in the amount of long-term RPs outstanding           Mr Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations during  the intermeeting period, but I will need a vote to ratify the domestic  operations And I will be happy to take any questions  "
4412,2001-10-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the   charts with the salmon cover that were distributed to you1  I will   break up my remarks into two parts  First, I will talk about general   market developments, especially since September 11th, and then I’ll   say a little about our operations in the aftermath of the attacks    The first chart shows short-term deposit rates for the United   States, the euro area, and Japan US short-term rates continued to   decline during the intermeeting period  Both cash and forward rates   had been declining even before September 11th, and the fall in those   rates accelerated in the days following  Cash rates declined after the   Committee’s September 17th reduction in the target fed funds rate,   though the 9-month forward rate barely moved, apparently reflecting   the lingering expectation among some market participants that rates   will be reversing course some time next year    As shown in the middle panel, euro-area rates followed a   similar pattern of heading downward gradually even before   September 11th And on September 17th the ECB reduced rates by 50   basis points several hours after the FOMC’s policy announcement    The Bank of Canada, the Swiss National Bank, and several other   central banks cut their rates as well    As you can see in the bottom panel, Japanese rates continued to   scrape along near zero Late on September 17th our time, early on the   18th in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced another so-called   easing of policy when it stated that its current account balances would   be targeted at above 6 trillion yen as opposed to the 6 trillion target it   had indicated previously In the days that followed, that balance grew   and by the last days of the quarter it rose to more than 12 trillion yen    By today, it had eased a bit to 103 trillion yen, still significantly   above the earlier 6 trillion target  Interestingly, forward rates actually    1 Copies of the charts are reproduced in the Appendix     10/2/01 2   ticked up a bit and the Japanese government bond (JGB) yield curve  was little changed after the announcement, suggesting to some that  the BOJ’s tweaks in the past few months had ceased to have an  impact on rates beyond the very short end of the coupon curve   The top panel on page 2 graphs the 2-year, 10-year, and 30-year  Treasury yields along with the target fed funds rate since August 1st  Two-year rates declined, beneficiaries of policy easing, a weak equity  market, and general risk aversion  The curve steepened to 255 basis  points from about 165 basis points at the time of the last meeting   The 10-year yield declined 32 basis points, while the 30-year fell a  more modest 6 basis points  Some market participants explained the  restrained move in 30-year yields as reflecting nascent inflationary  risks, while others attributed the price action to the canceled  September buybacks and the generally revised fiscal stance that  would lead to far higher Treasury supplies than had been anticipated  previously   The steepening trend observed in the U S Treasury yield curve  has also been seen in yields abroad, as reflected in the middle panel   The 2- to 10-year Bund spread moved almost in lockstep with  movements in our curve  And even the Japanese 2- to 10-year spread  steepened ever so slightly, primarily due to a shift in the 10-year JGB  yield   In the bottom panel we observe that in some segments of the  bond markets the reaction has varied  Spreads in the investment  grade sector--not seen here--have largely been stable  And in the case  of agencies and swaps, the spreads have actually declined slightly   But spreads on riskier paper have widened  The EMBI+ spread and  the Merrill Lynch high-yield spread both widened after the 11th  These high-yield spreads hit levels last seen on January 2nd, the day  before the FOMC’s first easing move in the cycle  Trading turnover  in emerging markets and on high-yield paper decreased after the  attacks And liquidity conditions deteriorated and have not yet  recovered to normal levels     The three graphs on the next page depict the percentage change  in various equity indices for the third quarter  The US indices are  shown in the top panel, major foreign indices in the middle panel, and  a representative sample of emerging market equity indices in the  bottom panel  Most indices declined between 15 and 30 percent and  nearly all had fallen substantially even before September 11th,  adjusting to downwardly revised growth and profit forecasts  Stocks  of less established companies fared worse than more seasoned  companies  In the United States the percentage decline in the     10/2/01 3   NASDAQ was almost double the fall of the Dow and the S&P   Internationally, emerging markets indices on balance fell somewhat  more than markets in more developed countries   Turning to page 4 and the major currencies in foreign exchange  markets, the dollar actually was little changed as measured by most  trade-weighted indices, but showed considerable variation in bilateral  rates In general, risk aversion was reflected in the appreciation of the  Swiss franc and the yen, in part because of perceptions about their  value as safe havens, and probably more importantly as yen- and  Swiss franc-funded carry trades were unwound  On the other hand,  currencies of countries with large commodity sectors, such as the  Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, and the New Zealand dollar,  depreciated to near their all-time lows, as did the currencies of  countries such as Brazil, which have large external financing  requirements  While the downgrade in US growth has probably  reduced expected risk-adjusted returns on dollar assets, the  contemporaneous downgrade of overseas prospects may have offset  those adverse effects on the dollar   Turning to the middle panel, the yen had been appreciating  against the dollar since early August  With the retrenchment of risk  appetites, yen-funded carry trades were unwound and Japanese  investors were reportedly repatriating funds before their quarter-end   With the sustained upward pressure on the yen, the Japanese  monetary authorities intervened on September 17th and continued to  intervene in large amounts through this past Friday, the end of the  Japanese fiscal half-year In all, the Japanese monetary authorities  purchased $267 billion and 600 million euros, which the ECB  acquired as agent of behalf of the Bank of Japan  The aggregate  dollar purchases included $200 million which the Desk acquired as  agent for the Japanese on September 27th Within the foreign  exchange market, a major topic of discussion among traders is  whether the Ministry of Finance’s intervention was intended as a  bridge to get Japanese financial institutions through the fiscal half- year-end on September 30th or whether the intervention will persist   If the latter, that would be taken as a signal of a renewed attempt to  jump-start the export sector   As the bottom panel shows, all of the euro’s recent depreciation  occurred in early August Since mid-August, the euro has traded in a  narrow range The currency is perceived as neither a safe haven nor  an asset associated with an economic area that has higher growth  prospects than the United States  Therefore, asset returns are  expected to be no better and no worse than what will be available in  the United States       Turning to the next page, the terrorist attacks triggered an  increase in both observed and implied volatility in most markets, and  these graphs show the volatility of a sample of major asset price  relationships The top panel depicts implied volatility on one-month  euro-dollar and dollar-yen options  Both rose sharply on the 11th and  hit highs of about 14-1/2 percent on September 17th, the day that the  Committee and other central banks eased policy, but declined in  subsequent days These volatility levels, though sharply higher than  the volatility levels of 10 percent or so in early July, are modest by  historical standards In 1998 the volatility of dollar-yen options  reached a high of nearly 28 percent   The middle panel graphs the implied volatility of the December  Eurodollar contract and the bottom panel graphs the volatility of the  S&P 100, also known as the VIX Both volatility levels roughly  doubled from their levels in late August and both reached highs that  exceeded slightly the highs observed during the 1998 crisis  In the  case of the December Eurodollar contract, the implied volatility  exceeded the 1998 high by quite a bit  While the VIX index has  declined somewhat from its recent highs, its implied volatility and  that of the Eurodollar contract both remained at elevated levels     Turning to the next page, the top panel depicts total Federal  Reserve balances day by day since the last FOMC meeting  With the  disruptions caused by the attacks, the combination of discount  window loans, open market operations, plus autonomous factors  sharply increased balances to as high as $121 billion on September  13th Despite the apparent flushness of markets, even allowing for  higher demand for excess reserves, this was deceiving     The inset in the top panel shows balances, both borrowed and  nonborrowed, for the entire banking system for the five days starting  on September 11th The green bar in the inset shows the end-of-day  balances , which was having problems with  its clearing and settlement system  On September 12th, the entire  banking system held about $63 billion of reserves before borrowing    before  discount window borrowing and overdrafts  Distribution of reserves  continued to be a problem until the afternoon of the 14th when    began to make progress in clearing its backlog of  transactions  By early the following week, we began to work down  balances as they started to be distributed more efficiently   10/2/01 4     10/2/01 5   The bottom panel depicts the fed funds rate in the intermeeting  period The green line is the target fed funds rate  The red dots mark  the effective fed funds rate on each day, and the vertical line shows  the high-low range for each day  With four of the five major funds  brokers incapacitated by the attacks, banks largely traded directly  with each other rather than through brokers and they did so at the  target of 3-1/2 percent in something of a “gentlemen’s agreement”   This pattern persisted until late Thursday, September 13th, when the  weight of reserves in the system first began to show through and the  funds rate traded below its target  This pattern of low rates,  especially in later trading, continued in the period after the FOMC’s  intermeeting easing action on September 17th, particularly in light of  the Committee’s statement noting that the funds rate might  occasionally trade below its target  By the 19th the Desk began to  manage its operations with an eye toward restoring a sense of  normalcy in the money market, which had begun to take rates below 2  percent and even 1 percent for granted  Thus we began to nudge the  market back toward the target  In doing so the Desk continued to  balance that objective against the desire to respond to the financing  needs of dealers, but by that time dealers were not experiencing much  trouble getting their funding done through their normal sources   On page 7, the top panel shows three key autonomous factors  that affected reserves during the period  The grounding of air traffic  created an immediate spike in float to about $47 billion on September  13th The ECB’s three swap drawings added almost $20 billion at  their peak Those two factors added more than $60 billion of reserves  on that day Meanwhile, a near doubling of the repo pool drained  reserves  On balance, these factors added reserves during the first  few days of the crisis and thus reduced what might have been even  more traffic at the discount window on several days  By the week of  September 17th float declined and the foreign exchange swaps  matured but the repo pool remained elevated, in part because of the  large number of fails in the securities markets, and that was leaving  central banks with extra cash at the end of the day  There was also an  apparent desire for higher levels of liquidity, and in the case of  Japan’s Ministry of Finance the need to invest large amounts of  intervention proceeds   The middle panel depicts the mix of overnight and term  repurchase agreements used to manage reserves  We had no  operations on September 11th At first we relied on overnight RPs to  add liquidity and allowed several long-term RPs to mature without  replacement  When markets started working better, we increased the  level of long-term RPs to help meet underlying needs     10/2/01 6   The bottom panel shows for short-term RPs the level of  accepted propositions in red and the level of rejected propositions in  blue Normally, dealers submit a large number of propositions of  which we accept a relatively small amount  For four business days,  from the 12th through the 17th, our operations were driven by the  demand for financing rather than by reserve levels associated with a  given funds rate To better meet these demands, we operated later in  the day than normal, after dealers had an opportunity to assess their  financing needs Then for a couple of days, on September 18th and  19th, we accepted virtually all dealer propositions on our overnight  RPs This was done not so much directly to meet their demands but  to provide the level of reserves that was needed given that  autonomous factors, especially the repo pool, were draining reserves   After we arranged several long-term RPs that settled on the 20th, the  volume of our short-term RPs declined and the volume of accepted  propositions was just a fraction of total propositions     Turning to the last page, I want to give you a quick update on  our securities lending operations during the intermeeting period  On a  normal day, the Desk lends out a handful of securities from SOMA--  normally totaling less than $2 billion and frequently less than $500  million  With the disruptions caused by the attacks, not only to the  Bank of New York but to several major inter-dealer brokers and some  large dealers themselves, the number of fails rose dramatically  With  the flow of securities from usual sources disrupted or scaled back,  demand for SOMA securities rose despite our rather high pricing  structure We lent out about $10 billion on September 11th,  representing 70 different issues, and smaller though still high amounts  in the days following Volumes rose again last week in the run-up to  the quarter-end and remained high yesterday  Fails began to rise last  week for the 2-, 5-, and 10-year on-the-run securities for reasons that  are not fully clear  The dollar volume of our lending increased  beyond $10 billion, although the number of issues was less than on  the 11th, again because the number of fails was concentrated in the  small numbers of on-the-run issues     I want to make one final observation  On September 19th, the  very small volume of lending did not imply tranquility on that day   With the funds rate trading soft, the rate for general collateral fell  below 1 percent in the repo market  Since the Committee’s  authorization permits us to lend securities at a minimum of 1 percent,  the formula implied a negative financing rate  Hence it was cheaper  for dealers to fail and pay the near zero fails rate than to borrow from  the Desk, pay our higher price, and complete settlement  In  reviewing the securities lending facility in coming months, one aspect  that we plan to study is the pricing structure  In a low interest rate     10/2/01 7   environment, the general collateral rate could be susceptible to  occasional declines below 1 percent, thus making it difficult for our  securities lending program to meet its objectives   Mr Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations   during the period I will need a vote to ratify the domestic operations   and I’d be happy to take any questions     Securities lending volume?    We did a bit over $10 billion yesterday    That’s right Apparently the volume of fails is still at a very high   level    There are almost as many explanations as there are market   participants It is an issue that the market is struggling with, though  But they’re still--   In answering, let me try to package those questions together  I   don’t think we viewed the target funds rate as a floor  What we were trying to do was   return to some sense of normalcy in the functioning of the market  The low rate itself   was creating problems  There were problems for investors  For example, money market   funds had trouble investing money; there were complaints from investors who could not   get banks to take their money  These and other problems were being created by the very   low funds rate and those issues had to be considered  What we also tried to do was to   leave the market with enough liquidity, but there was a sense that if the rate remained too   low for too long, some of these unintended adverse affects would continue   If you look at the bottom of page 7, you can see that for several days beyond   September 17th we were basically accepting all the propositions that the dealers were   giving us We were trying to respond to the financing demands from the dealers  And   even in the subsequent period, once we got past the 19th and 20th or so, there were days   when we tried to respond to the financing needs of the dealers even though it wasn’t   necessary for reserve purposes One of the ways we did that was by having the Treasury   increase its balance That way we could respond by providing the dealers with more   financing than might have been dictated by the numbers  So my message is that we   really did not view the funds target as a floor  A lot of the trading was below the target   rate but there were days, especially in the mornings, when the rate was firm  That often   reflected efforts by European banks in particular to get their financing done early in the   day So we got a pattern with the rate firm in early-day activity and lower in reduced   trading at the end of the day     I don’t know if I answered your questions     10/2/01 10    Yes, I think that’s an important point  A large part of that market   was in effect bottled up     10/2/01 11    That’s a good question and one that doesn’t have an easy answer    In my own view, the shift is not so much an indication that people view inflationary risks   as imminent or that they have very strong expectations of future inflation  I think it   reflects more a concern about the fiscal side, given the talk of stimulus coming out of   Congress, the cancellation of the Treasury’s buyback program, and the prospect for lower   federal revenues In the New York Times or one of the major papers yesterday there was   an article saying that perhaps we’ll have a fiscal deficit  So the fiscal outlook has really   changed Now, the short end of the curve will tend to follow policy, or at least it has so   far But the long end is where the Treasury has been especially active with the buyback        10/2/01 14   program and that’s where we might see concerns or a shift in expectations about the   fiscal side    I’ll work on it! [Laughter]  "
4457,2001-11-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the charts that were handed   out this morning  1/   The top panel of the first page depicts US and euro-area cash and   forward rates US 3-month cash rates, the solid red line, declined about 1/4   percent since the last meeting, while 3-month and 9-month forward rates   declined by similar magnitudes as the string of data released reinforced   expectations that policy rates would continue to be reduced  In the euro area,   cash rates fell about 12 basis points but 9-month forward rates fell by more than   1/4 percentage point, widening the spread between cash and forward rates  The   rate movements reflected reactions to weak data for the euro area as well as   heightened expectations that the total amount of easing to come from the ECB   would be larger than had been previously anticipated    This morning’s two-week refinancing operation by the ECB was   under-subscribed by about 25 billion euros and the operation actually drained 23   billion euros, as banks expecting to be able to buy cheaper funds after this   Thursday’s ECB meeting did not have much demand for 2-week money    Overnight rates moved to about 4 percent after the operation’s results were   announced      The bottom panel provides three snapshots of the Japanese yield   curve in 2001--for February 28th, August 14th, and November 2nd Broadly   speaking, the curve continues to exhibit a very flat trajectory out to three years   and then steepens for maturities beyond that out to 30 years  Rates at the very   long end have stayed near 25 percent, reflecting both a premium for the longer   maturity and the lesser market liquidity of bonds beyond 10 years  But the long   rates perhaps also reflect worries about the prospect of significant government   debt issuance, which may be necessary to finance a cleanup of the banking  sector    1/ Charts used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript     11/6/01 2   Staying with the Japanese markets for a bit on page two, the top panel  shows the 5-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield and the 5-year yen  swap rate since January 2000 The middle panel depicts the 10-year JGB and  swap rates for the same period  In both, the spread between the swap rate and  the JGB yield trended near 25 basis points in early 2000, then began to narrow in  late 2000 and early 2001 as yields started to fall and rates at the short end  approached zero By the summer, the 10-year differential went to zero and was  even negative on some days  The 5-year differential narrowed a bit later and is  now also near zero So bank obligations in a country with known banking  problems are being priced as substitutes for government credit  One  interpretation would suggest that the market is already presuming that Japanese  bank risk is sovereign risk  Another explanation can be found by looking at the  flows that are creating this relationship  Japanese banks have been very large  buyers of 5- and 10-year swaps That is, they are receiving a long-term fixed  rate and paying a short-term floating rate, which lately has been near zero  That  is functionally similar to buying a JGB and financing it in the short-term repo  market  The sellers of these swaps reportedly have been foreign commercial and  investment banks  Japanese banks have added to their swap positions rather than  purchasing more JGBs because of a preferential accounting treatment   With small probabilities that short rates will move higher any time  soon, the situation probably does not pose near-term concerns  But Japanese  banks do have a stake in spreads staying tight and, given that the banks are also  large holders of JGBs, in rates remaining low  Ergo, one quickly gets into the  circular logic of the situation The possible need to clean up bank balance sheets  may force the government to issue more bonds to finance that endeavor, which in  turn will raise yields and inflict losses on banks holding large JGB positions and  large swap positions as well   As for the markets’ views on the state of Japanese banks, the bottom  panel graphs the Tokyo stock exchange composite index and the bank sub-index   Both are down substantially since January of 2000  Interestingly, the bank sub- index has had its greatest underperformance in the last 12 months, precisely  during the time that swap spreads began to narrow   As we go through the next three pages of charts, I will briefly review a  number of asset price relationships in major markets in the eight weeks since  September 11th The top panel of page three indexes the dollar’s exchange rate  against the euro, the yen, and the Swiss franc since August 1st  Despite the weak  data on the US economy, the dollar is back to levels where it traded in mid- August, having recovered from the post-September 11 losses against both the  yen and the euro It is still somewhat lower against the Swiss franc  The middle  panel graphs implied volatilities, which have continued to come down to around  10 percent, compared to 12 percent in mid-August and 14 percent in mid- September     11/6/01 3   Another vantage point into the seeming tranquility of the foreign  exchange market is through risk reversals  This is an options trade that reflects  whether market participants are willing to pay an added premium for protection  against the risk of a rising dollar, in which case dollar calls are expensive relative  to dollar puts Alternatively, in the case of trying to protect against the risk of a  falling dollar, dollar puts are favored   Immediately after September11th the marketplace bid up dollar puts,  but since then this indicator--quite unusually--has moved to absolute neutrality  for all three major currency pairs  The optimistic view is that market participants  believe that exchange rates have achieved something of a sustainable  equilibrium  Probably the more plausible explanation is that there is a lack of  conviction among traders about the likely course of exchange rates  That  hypothesis is also supported by anecdotal evidence in that there has been a  pulling back of risk-taking in the foreign exchange market   On page four, the top panel depicts a number of the major global  equity indices since August 1st, but re-indexed to their closing levels on  September 10th In general, the major indices have moved in a correlated fashion  back to pre-attack levels   The middle panel graphs selected major emerging market indices   With the exception of the Argentine Merval index, most have recovered but not  as much as the indices of developed country markets  There appears to have  been more discrimination among emerging markets and between emerging and  developed markets  Unlike the calm prevailing in the foreign exchange markets  and despite the recovery of stock prices, implied volatility--at least as measured  by the VIX in the bottom panel--has gone sideways at between 30 and 35 percent  since the last meeting, but it is still somewhat elevated relative to historical  patterns   As shown on page five, spread relationships in fixed-income markets  tell a similar story  Spreads continued to widen on higher risk assets, such as  debt of emerging markets, as seen in the top panel  The high-yield spread has  stayed relatively flat since the last meeting, but it has also remained at elevated  levels despite the rally in equity markets  In contrast, spreads have actually  narrowed for better quality obligations, such as agencies and swaps   Interestingly, the rising tide did not lift all boats in the investment-grade  corporate sector The spread in A2 corporate issues widened slightly  But even  there, one needs to consider that absolute yields for A2 paper declined modestly   Moreover, the market absorbed a massive amount of supply, including that  coming from several issuers who were refinancing maturing commercial paper  and willing to pay the premium spread in order to get the deals done  Finally, at  the short end, the implied volatility on near-term Eurodollar contracts has again  been rising recently, pointing to some lingering uncertainty at the short end     11/6/01 4   Turning back to the government yield curve, the top panel of page six  depicts the benchmark on-the-run issues in yield terms along with the target fed  funds rate since August 1st Until the middle of last week the pattern of recent  months persisted, with gradually falling yields--especially at the short end--and  thereby a steepening of the yield curve  The Treasury’s refunding announcement  last Wednesday, which included plans to revise the buyback program and to  suspend issuance of the 30-year bond, surprised the market in its timing and for  that matter also surprised the Treasury in the extent of the market reaction  Yields fell sharply on Wednesday and Thursday as traders rushed to close out  short positions in their trades, whereby they had been long the 2-year note or  similar duration paper and short the 30-year bond  By this morning the long  bond yield was at 486 percent or almost 40 basis points lower than the closing  yield on the day before the Treasury’s announcement   The bottom panel depicts yield curves for A2 industrial corporate  bonds, Fannie Maes, swaps, and Treasuries as of September 10th and as of  November 2nd In general, the pattern observed in the Treasury yield curve has  spilled over to the other curves as well  Since September 10th, interest rates are  generally lower and yield curves are steeper   Moving to the commercial paper market, the theme there is that the  year-end has come early to that market The top left panel graphs the spread  between 30-day A1/P1-rated paper and A2/P2 around year-end for three recent  years The 1997-98 period, in blue, was typical of many years until very  recently  The black line depicts last year’s sharply widening spread and the red  line represents the current spread    The top right panel shows the same set of relationships for 90-day  paper The trends are similar, though last year’s widening began later and the  size of the widening probably was influenced by the suddenness with which the  California utilities had difficulty rolling over their commercial paper  This  year’s widening began soon after the events of September 11th The  downgrading of several corporations has reportedly made some managers  unwilling to hold A2/P2 paper at year-end for window-dressing reasons, but  many other fund managers have become unwilling to hold any A2/P2 paper  under any circumstances  The wider spreads have been necessary to draw in new  buyers, such as European institutions, to pick up the slack  Still, the A2/P2  sector has contracted by nearly 50 percent this year in terms of the amount  outstanding   The bottom panel shows the spread of 90-day A1/P1 commercial  paper to 3-month Treasury bills on the left and A2/P2 paper relative to 3-month  Treasury bills on the right These two graphs indicate that the widening of the  A2/P2 spread, at least so far, is strictly a matter of deterioration in the A2/P2  sector Of note is how well the A1/P1 sector is holding up, with issuers able to  sell paper at a cost of only 10 basis points or so more than Treasuries     11/6/01 5   Finally, the last page depicts the relationship between the rate for   general collateral (GC) in the repo market, the so-called “specials rate” for on-  the-run securities, and the incidence of fails to deliver  The top panel graphs the   GC rate in blue and the 5-year specials rate--that is, the rate to finance the on-  the-run 5-year security--in green  The gray bars at the bottom represent the   volume of fails reported by primary dealers for that security  The interest rates   are all daily, while the volume of fails is collected weekly; the number represents   the volume of fails on the reporting date      The bottom panel has the same set of information for the 10-year note    The specials rate can be volatile from day to day, as dealer financing needs   change The upper boundary is the GC rate, which roughly tends to track the fed   funds rate The lower boundary is zero When a security is very scarce, the cost   of financing that security can fall to or near zero  But if dealers who are short the   issue cannot borrow the paper, a fail will result  More cynically, a dealer can go   short the issue and not deliver, knowing that with the specials rate so low there is   almost no financial penalty to the fail      While the fail situation in the aftermath of September 11th garnered a   lot of attention and was extraordinary in its size, securities at times do go on   special for extended periods of time, so a spike in the volume of fails is not that  unusual For example, as seen in the bottom panel, in May of 2001 the scarcity   of the 10-year issue led to a surge of fails until the May refunding was   completed      I want to make two points here  First, as short-term rates have come  down, the GC rate has come down as well  Second, the amount of elbowroom  for the specials market to move around has decreased  The rate doesn’t have to   move very far from the GC rate to get to zero and create a situation that can lead   to a rise in fails  Thus, even without future incidents of the kind seen on   September 11th, in a low interest rate environment there is the risk of more   instances where fails accumulate, at least for short periods of time      Mr Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations in the   intermeeting period  The temporary swap facilities with the ECB and the Bank   of England both expired without being renewed in mid-October, and the amount   of the swap facility with the Bank of Canada reverted to its normal size      I will need a vote to ratify domestic operations, and I’d be happy to   take any questions     I don’t think so The cash market continued to function normally  There did   not seem to be a spillover into the cash market  That might have occurred if the on-the-run/off-the-  run spreads had widened, but we did not see that  The problem remained a back office problem that   did not spill over into the front office  Of course, there is the risk that that might happen at some   point but thus far it has been contained to the back office    That’s right    I think it’s the risk that I mentioned--that if the back office gets clogged up,   then it affects how the traders behave    I can’t think of an instance when it has  In 1998 we had a different situation   where liquidity was an issue, and on-the-run/off-the-run spreads widened then  But I can’t think of   an instance where we had that kind of spillover problem because of fails  Again, that was a risk that   the Treasury was contending with, and I think it is the reason they made the decision that they did    There’s a preferential accounting treatment for swaps relative to JGBs; the   latter go on their balance sheets    In part I think for reasons related to capital  Also, a bank may be influenced   by not wanting to balloon its balance sheet, which is published  The Japanese accounting authorities   are looking at changing that preferential treatment because the Japanese banks are using it as a   loophole The swap is designed to be what they call a macro hedge--that is, it is designed to hedge   assets--and it can be excluded from the balance sheet  However, as the Japanese accounting   authorities see it, the banks are using these swaps to hedge liabilities, which more or less turns the   intent of the rules on its head So the accounting authorities have been looking at this and thinking   about whether to close that loophole There is some pressure on them to continue to keep that   loophole open, and I think the banks are waiting to see how the Japanese accounting bodies will rule    Well, in terms of how the markets are functioning, I think they are functioning   fine In terms of how market participants are discriminating among risks, I would have no reason to   second-guess the assessments they are making  They seem to be putting in a greater risk premium   on high-yield assets and on debt of emerging markets  So, to the extent that they are viewing the   economic outlook as being weaker than had been the case, they are putting in a higher risk premium   to those kinds of assets, which seems to be rational    I don’t recall that there has been any meaningful widening of bid-ask spreads   in the fixed income markets  And the on-the-run/off-the-run spread has not moved very much  So   those indicators are not pointing to problems with the functioning of the markets  "
4505,2001-12-11," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that   were distributed to you this morning 1    The top panel on the first page shows US and euro-area cash and forward   rates The 3-month US dollar deposit rate, the solid red line, is little changed   since your last meeting and as you can see the 3-month forward rate largely   tracked the cash rate  But the 3-month deposit rate 9 months forward, the red   line with narrow dashes, reflects the volatility of expectations in the past month    First, the 9-month forward rate moved upward after release of the stronger than   expected retail sales report on November 14th Then it declined about 1/2   percentage point after the November 27th Michigan Confidence report was   weaker than expected and comments by Governor Meyer were perceived as   keeping the door open for a further easing of policy  Subsequently, on   December 5th, that rate rose again after the nonmanufacturing NAPM index--an   indicator that generally receives little notice--rose sharply and heightened   expectations for a near-term recovery  Friday’s weak employment report did   not alter the optimism that is built into forward rates  That leaves the market in   a somewhat unusual position of having priced in a bit more ease in the near   term--indeed 22 out of 24 primary dealers expect an easing at this meeting--but     then an aggressive tightening beginning sometime in the second half of 2002       1 The charts used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript     12/11/01 2    In the euro area the ECB reduced policy rates by 50 basis points on  November 8th, two days after the FOMC action, and cash rates--shown in the  solid green line--have been stable since then  Forward rates fluctuated mostly  in response to US data On balance, the market expects that short-term rates  probably will decline by another 25 to 50 basis points over the next few months     As you can see in the bottom panel, interest rates in Japan remain very  low The discussion in Japanese financial circles is about what further steps the  Bank of Japan (BOJ) can take to make policy even more accommodative  So  one might ask why forward rates are beginning to drift higher  The answer is  not fully clear Certainly, there is no expectation that the BOJ will abandon its  zero interest rate policy any time soon  One possibility--and I stress it’s only a  possibility--is that forward rate agreements, which are obligations of banks, are  beginning to reflect a credit risk premium that is not showing up, at least not  yet, in other money market instruments     Turning to page 2, the charts on the top half of the page depict the  volatility of Treasury yields over the past 45 days  The top left panel graphs the  2-year yield along with the target fed funds rate  The top right panel graphs the  10- and 30-year yields In general, these yields moved in very much the same  pattern as the 9-month forward rate I mentioned earlier  They rose in early  November because of optimism about the economy, retraced that rise as the  optimism cooled, and then spiked higher despite data on some days, such as  Friday’s weak labor market report, that would typically be associated with  lower, not higher, interest rates On balance, 2-year yields have risen a bit more  than 1/2 percentage point over the intermeeting period and the spread between  the 2-year note and the fed funds rate has risen to 100 basis points, the largest  this year Yields on 10-year and 30-year Treasuries rose about 75 basis points   The complaints from market participants about volatility can be supported  by the data in the bottom chart on page 2  The red line is the volatility of daily  yield changes in the 2-year note, measured in basis points on the left scale, since  February 1988 Fluctuations have been smoothed by using a 60-day moving  average In general, during most of that period this measure of volatility moved  in a range of 3 to 6 basis points and usually between 3 and 5 basis points   Recently, the volatility of the 2-year note was as high as 7 basis points; that  level had been approached briefly a couple of times in the mid-1990s and was  exceeded only in the late 1980s  The chart also graphs the target fed funds rate  over the same period The relationship between the two rates is not perfect, but  casual observation suggests that spikes in volatility are frequently associated  with anticipation of the end of a monetary policy cycle or are coincident with  the beginning of a new one For example, the volatility spike in 1992 occurred  at end of the early 1990s easing cycle and the 1994 spike coincided with the  tightening cycle that began in February of that year  Again, the relationship is  not precise and I don’t want to make too much of it  Nevertheless, it is possible     12/11/01 3    that at least some of the volatility in recent weeks reflects indications that the  bond market is beginning to adjust to expectations that the forward markets are  taking more seriously, namely that this cycle is nearing a conclusion   Another question is why have yields on coupon securities risen so high?  Expectations about economic recovery are certainly part of the story  The rally  in the equity market suggests that this factor is at work there as well  But it is  difficult to explain the scope and speed of the move by that explanation alone   The second factor at work may have been positioning among dealers,  speculative funds, and other investors  A number of strategies involved going  long in Treasury bonds, especially at the short end of the curve  This worked  fine for most of the year, but the trading attracted many imitators and created  ingredients for a pronounced effect if everyone were to head for the door at the  same time  Third, corporate supply has continued at a rapid pace  And a fourth  factor cited recently is the reputed impact of hedging by large mortgage  investors With rates rising, mortgage investors tend to sell Treasuries to  maintain their duration targets, a point I’ll talk about a bit more in a minute   Finally, there may have been a calendar effect  November 30th is the fiscal  year-end for a number of large investment banks and December 31st the year- end for almost everyone else  With dealers scaling back positions and  individual traders protecting their bonuses, it was not an opportune time to have  large demands for liquidity from both investors and hedgers on the same side of  the market  Ultimately, the dealer community absorbed this supply but only  with a large price adjustment  Perhaps any one of these reasons alone would  not explain the fluctuations we’ve observed, but a shift in perceptions, a  position overhang, a price insensitive group of hedgers, and a risk-averse dealer  community came together at a delicate point in time     The fourth factor I mentioned was the importance of the mortgage market   That market has grown substantially in recent years, increasingly influencing  the Treasury market  The top panel on page 3 graphs the outstanding supply of  publicly held Treasuries and the outstanding supply of mortgage-backed  securities (MBS) Five years ago the Treasury market was twice the size of the  MBS market  Now the two are converging  And if one takes a broader  definition of the MBS market, its size is bigger still   The bottom panel graphs the yield on the 10-year Treasury note and the  estimated duration of the aggregate MBS market from September 4th to  December 7th of this year I should stress that this is an estimate by one  investment bank and differing assumptions regarding prepayment speeds could  change the duration, though the overall pattern should be similar  When yields  fell in September and October the duration of mortgage-backed securities also  fell, as prepayments rose and investors received cash flow sooner than  expected In that environment, asset managers will buy Treasuries or swaps to  maintain their duration target  Even if the hedging is via swaps, ultimately  swap dealers will hedge themselves with Treasuries and the net result will be     12/11/01 4    the same  When Treasury yields rose in November, the duration of mortgage- backed securities, shown in the blue line, rose sharply  Following their models  in such circumstances, large mortgage holders sell Treasuries, which  contributes to rising rates, which in turn extends the duration of mortgage  portfolios and leads to more selling until the process finally dissipates     Because mortgage portfolios are managed against a duration benchmark  and because hedging behavior is driven by similar models, asset managers will  to some extent be price insensitive  If the volume of those sales or purchases is  large enough, given the set of liquidity conditions, it could influence prices in  ways that are counterintuitive to new pieces of information  That may have  been the case last Friday when the weak labor report was followed by higher,  not lower, yields Finally, given the swiftness with which American  homeowners refinance mortgages in response to lower yields, mortgage-backed  securities are becoming more concentrated in fewer pools than in the past  And  this implies that as a mortgage pool gets closer to the point where refinancing is  economically advantageous, the impact of related hedging will be larger  As of  November 30th, mortgage-backed securities paying coupons of 6-1/2 to 7  percent represented 60 percent of the entire outstanding MBS market     Turning to page 4 and the corporate market, the top panel graphs the  spread between A and AAA corporate bonds and also the spread between BBB  and AAA corporate obligations  On balance, spreads were relatively stable  despite the continuing large supply and the Enron bankruptcy; the BBB spread  rose slightly while the A spread narrowed  The spread of high-yield bonds to  Treasuries, not shown here, actually narrowed from 850 basis points to 715  basis points   The bottom panel depicts changes in commercial paper spreads as the year- end approaches The red line shows the A2/P2 minus A1/P1 spreads for 1997- 1998 The green line is the spread for 2000-2001 and the blue line is the spread  for the current year to date  On the left side are the 30-day spreads and on the  right side the 90-day spreads Both the 30- and 90-day spreads widened earlier  this fall after 9/11 but actually have begun to narrow more recently  And both  are narrower than in the comparable period last year  One reason, and perhaps  the main reason, is that the A2/P2 sector has shrunk substantially as many  A2/P2 companies exited their CP programs and instead issued longer-term  obligations, generating breathing room but also increasing their interest cost   Turning to page 5 and developments in Japan, the top panel graphs the  dollar-yen exchange rate since September 3rd The dollar has been appreciating  gradually since the BOJ’s late-September intervention and the close of the  Japanese fiscal half-year  In part, the yen’s depreciation may be due to the  performance of the Japanese economy, which has deteriorated, with few  forecasts looking forward to a strong recovery in 2002      12/11/01 5    Recently the dollar-yen exchange rate has also been influenced by a   boisterous, if sometimes confused, debate in Tokyo about the BOJ’s monetary   policy Within some Japanese policy circles, the BOJ is being urged to buy   foreign bonds as a way of easing its monetary policy still further  Now,   whether the BOJ buys Japanese government bonds (JGBs) or foreign bonds, the   reserve impact in yen is the same  While stepping up purchases of JGBs may   add more liquidity and weaken the yen, buying foreign bonds is viewed as a   more direct way to influence the exchange rate  Hence, the foreign exchange   market is monitoring this very closely for signs as to whether monetary policy   and more traditional foreign exchange intervention will be converging  Adding   confusion to this mix is uncertainty about the US response to the idea    Newspaper stories have suggested that the Administration favored it, or more   subtly that a weakening yen would be acceptable as part of the broader effort to   counteract deflation in Japan    The middle panel shows the 10-year JGB yield over that same period    JGB yields have stayed low despite recent downgrades of Japan’s debt by both   Moody’s and S&P and despite the talk about the Bank of Japan purchasing   foreign bonds Presumably, such an action by the BOJ would remove or reduce   the activity of a very big buyer of Japanese government debt      The bottom panel depicts the Topix composite index, which has risen   slightly since its post-9/11 low But the Japanese stock market has not had as   much of a recovery as those in other countries  Bank shares continue to decline,   as confidence in Japan’s ability to clean up the bad debt problem deteriorates   still more    Finally, let me say a word on domestic reserves management  Since the   last meeting we have been building up our holdings of long-term RPs to help   meet needs associated with the seasonal growth in currency  We expect that   currency will have increased about $23 billion from its late-October level to its   peak in early January before beginning to unwind  Over this roughly two-  month period, our holdings of 28-day RPs will have risen a net of about $8   billion and are expected to peak at $32 billion or so before reverting to the low   $20 billion range by sometime in February    Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period  I will need   approval of our domestic operations, and I will be happy to take questions     I have had conversations with lower level officials of the Treasury  The views   have been somewhat vague in the sense of suggesting that if the yen goes down because of actions   taken to stimulate the economy, that’s one thing  But if there’s a deliberate attempt to weaken the yen,   that would be another    Absolutely, that’s the difficulty    I haven’t looked at that  One should look at it over a decade or so and we   haven’t looked at it back that far  But I think--and this is only a hypothesis--this correlation has been   getting tighter over time and the reason relates to the trends depicted in that top chart on page 3  That   is, the mortgage market has been getting bigger and there are more methods for hedging and managing   the mortgage books  As mortgage books first of all become concentrated--and there are some very     12/11/01 7    large holders of mortgages out there--and as models become similar, the impact is greater both   because of the size and the technique    I don’t, but that is work we will do    I haven’t looked at that  "
4560,2002-03-19,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the set of charts that  has been distributed In the top panel on the first page, US cash and forward deposit  rates are shown in red  The forward rates—the dashed red lines—moved higher in a  more pronounced manner after a string of stronger-than-expected economic data and  Chairman Greenspan’s Senate appearance on March 7  The three-month forward rate  is trading at 2½ percent, about ½ percentage point above the cash rate, and the nine- month forward rate rose nearly a full percentage point in the past five weeks or so to  almost 4 percent  European rates, the green lines, showed the same general pattern  though not to the same degree as US rates  Traders apparently believe that European  interest rates, which did not fall as much as US rates did in 2001, will not rise as  much in 2002 Japanese interest rates stayed low, and the Bank of Japan continued to  provide significant liquidity to the yen money market  As we approach the end of the  fiscal year, there is no hint of a Japanese premium in yen money markets and only a  very slight premium that shows up periodically in dollar money markets—at least  based on traditional indicators such as the British Bankers Association poll   However, market reports suggest that unsecured lending to Japanese banks has been  scaled back significantly  Meanwhile, Japanese banks have resorted to raising dollars  via foreign exchange swaps with non-Japanese banks wherein they are swapping in  dollars in exchange for yen The foreign banks doing these trades are able to raise the  yen at negative interest rates, so even if invested at a zero interest rate they can earn a  positive spread   Turning to page 2, Treasury yields began to rise in late February in response to  the same factors that moved short-term interest rates  From February 26 through  yesterday, the two-year yield rose about 60 basis points  And the spread of the two- year note over the fed funds target was at 185 basis points yesterday, the highest  spread in that relationship since January 1995  Similarly, the spread between the ten- year note and the fed funds target was 355 basis points, the widest since May 1994   Finally, the spread between the thirty-year bond—or I should say the twenty-nine­ year bond—and the target fed funds rate was just shy of 400 basis points, the widest  since May 1993  In the private sector, accounting and disclosure issues hung over the  corporate market during much of the period and securities of individual firms were  periodically repriced But spreads as a whole were steady or even narrowed slightly    1 Materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)                March 19, 2002 Page 4 of 117  The spread of the BBB over the AAA yields bounced around as rumors hit specific  names or sectors, but on balance it hovered near 125 basis points  As shown by the  solid blue line, the spread between A and AAA yields actually narrowed somewhat  during the period The trend of narrowing spreads is more pronounced in the lower  quality sectors of emerging-market debt and high-yield markets  Both the EMBI+  and the Merrill Lynch high-yield indexes narrowed dramatically, as investors’ risk  appetite seemed to revive and they priced in increasing odds of a global recovery   The Merrill Lynch high-yield spread narrowed to its lowest level since September  2000, and the EMBI+ spread narrowed to its tightest level since July 1998, but the  recent recomposition of the EMBI index exaggerates the scale of that improvement     Turning to page 3, volatility trends in major asset markets are shown in the top  panel The S&P 100 Volatility Index, also known as the VIX, has been declining for  some weeks now into the low 20s—at the lower end of its range of the last six or  seven years of 20 to 35 or 40 percent In general, high levels have been associated  with periods of stress and falling equity prices  Some analysts have asserted that the  current level of implied volatility suggests a complacent attitude among investors   Others, however, note that equity volatility above 20 percent is a relatively recent  phenomenon; before 1995 equity volatilities were frequently in the 10 to 15 percent  range These analysts suggest that, with the boom and bust behind us, a period of  more-modest returns may be consistent with a reversion toward lower volatilities   The middle panel graphs the implied volatility of the Eurodollar interest rate futures  contract That volatility had stayed at a high level in the months after September 11  but recently has declined to its lowest level since that date, though it remains at  elevated levels compared with its historical average  Finally, the bottom panel  depicts the one- and twelve-month implied volatilities in the euro-dollar exchange  rate With that exchange rate trading in a fairly narrow range between 086 and 089,  the volatility has eased into single digits, and the one-year implied volatility is at its  lowest point since November 1999   Turning to page 4, let me say a few words on Japan and Japanese assets The yen,  which had been exhibiting weakness early in 2002, had a dramatic about-face starting  in mid to late February  For most of January and part of February the talk in markets  was about the possibility of a major crisis around the end of the fiscal year  This led  to a “sell Japan” mentality and the prices of equities, JGBs, and the value of the yen  all declined As the talk about the crisis swelled, markets began to look forward to  two events in late February—the release of the government’s “anti-deflation plan”  due to come out on February 27 and the Bank of Japan’s policy board meeting on  February 28 In the event, the government’s anti-deflation plan was leaked slowly in  the days before its release, and it contained little that was new or viewed as being  truly helpful in fighting deflation The one concrete step was a tightening of short  selling rules on equities This was coupled with the announcement—a few days  before the plan was released—of sanctions by the FSA against four foreign firms for  violating the then-existing short selling rules Between aggressive buying by public  pension funds and a short covering rally, the Nikkei rose about 26 percent from its  low in early February to its peak in early March  On February 28 the Bank of Japan’s                       March 19, 2002 Page 5 of 117  policy board, under severe pressure from the government, decided to increase the   pace of its JGB acquisitions from ¥800 billion to ¥1 trillion per month  JGB yields   declined 10 basis points in the three weeks after that, to about 145 percent  With   Japanese asset prices rising, the yen appreciated sharply in late February, though it   has depreciated to a level of about 131 in the past day or so    Turning to page 5, a word on domestic reserves management  The top chart  shows monthly rates of growth in currency over the past year and our forecast for the  next few months  Currency growth has been well above trend in many recent months   Late last year, just when it looked as if it was getting back to normal, we experienced  unexpectedly rapid growth for several months  Argentina has been part of the story,  but domestic demand for currency has also been strong  The bottom panel shows, by  maintenance periods, the aggregate size of domestic financial assets held by the  Federal Reserve  The gray line represents our permanent SOMA holdings, and the  red line shows total holdings, including repurchase agreements, both long and short  term  Aggregate holdings will simply reflect the behavior of autonomous factors and  demands for Fed balances  The underlying changes in this series over time mostly  reflect currency growth The size of our total RP holdings rose quite suddenly in the  aftermath of September 11, as we stopped our outright activity for a few maintenance  periods while currency growth remained robust  Total RPs grew to more than  $30 billion, and the long-term RP book reached about $24 billion in October  In that  month we began to buy outright for SOMA once again; and over the past five months,  SOMA has expanded by over $25 billion, which in absolute terms is about as  aggressive a pace as we have ever sustained over any extended period  But the rapid  growth in currency has continued to surprise us over the past several months, and the  rapid pace of SOMA expansion still has not allowed us to bring down our holdings of  RPs, including long-term RPs, below the October levels Looking ahead, while  currency growth is expected to moderate, we plan to maintain the recent rapid pace of  SOMA expansion, which should allow us to bring RPs, including long-term RPs,  down modestly from the current levels Again, though, we are talking about forecasts,  and there is a lot of risk to those forecasts   Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in the intermeeting period  I do  want to mention that yesterday the Desk made its initial purchase of French bonds for  SOMA’s foreign portfolio as part of our effort to diversify the Euro portfolio beyond  German debt  I will need a vote to ratify domestic operations, and I would be happy  to answer any questions Thank you, Mr Chairman      I think you’re absolutely right that there is a suppression of the exchange rate   by the various rules and regulations, both formal and informal, that are being applied  How   much that is suppressing the exchange rate is hard to quantify, and I wouldn’t want to hazard a   guess But a lot of people in the analytical community think that we could see a further—and   perhaps even sharp—depreciation if and when a more open market is allowed to develop  As for   how that will spill over into broader markets or the society, I think it’s very hard to guess  But   it’s difficult to be optimistic about the situation    Yes Don and I will make some brief opening comments on that topic  At   this point the staff has done a fair amount of background work on how we might go about   acquiring for the System Open Market Account a portfolio of GNMAs and also on structuring a   portfolio of RPs (repurchase agreements) against foreign sovereign securities  Where we are   now is that quite a bit more—in fact a substantial amount—of rather nitty-gritty operational work   needs to be done both to study and to prepare for an actual implementation of either program    That then becomes a resource issue because a lot of the same people would work on both of   these projects  So there’s a competition for those resources between these two projects and also   on the contingency-related issues And that just makes it impossible for us to expedite the   contingency planning work and also work on GNMAs and the foreign sovereign debt    Therefore, we wanted to get some guidance from the Committee as to which one of the two   options for the portfolio the Committee wanted us to focus on  There are pros and cons for each,   which we tried to lay out in the paper that was sent to you  As we noted in that memo, there are   both tactical and strategic questions that the Committee may want to consider  Don and I would   be happy to answer any questions, but I won’t review the actual contents of that paper  Don, did   you want to say anything about some of the other topics on which staff work is being done?     March 19, 2002 Page 11 of 117 "
4561,2002-03-19," Just two brief points On the question of other assets that have the full faith   and credit designation, there is the credit issue and then there’s the liquidity issue  So, as we        March 19, 2002 Page 25 of 117  look at potential assets, the Desk might decide that a particular security meets our credit screen   but it might not meet our liquidity screen because not enough of that issue is outstanding  So we   wouldn’t necessarily automatically be in the posture of buying that asset  On President   Santomero’s point with respect to the foreign sovereign debt and which countries would be   included in the collateral basket, just to be up front I should note that we are in that posture now   with our foreign portfolio, where we do maintain a book of euro-denominated repos  At present   we take securities of six countries from the euro area that meet our credit and liquidity screens    So we are in that posture now, although it’s not as prominent because it is a small portion of our   portfolio  "
4613,2002-05-07,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that were  just circulated The top panel on the first page gives two snapshots of the Eurodollar  deposit futures strip, as of March 19 and as of noon yesterday, representing contracts  out to September 2004 The entire curve has moved sharply lower by between 50 and  80 basis points during that period as the market has scaled back expectations of rising  rates that had been built into the term structure  Among the reasons for the shift are  that the macro data moderated, corporate profit reports turned soggy, equity prices  exhibited weakness, forecasts for spending by businesses were revised down, and  tensions rose in the Middle East And there were comments by members of this  Committee that were interpreted as suggesting that a tightening of policy would not  come as soon as had been built into the forward rate structure  The same pricing-out  of tightening expectations can be observed in Treasury yields The middle left panel  shows two-year Treasury yields down about 50 basis points since the middle of  March, whereas ten-year yields are down a bit less—about 30 basis points from their  peak—over roughly the same period  Treasury yields began to decline in mid to late  March, as tensions in the Middle East increased and as the equity markets began to  sag and then continued to fall after the Chairman’s testimony to the Joint Economic  Committee on April 17  As shown in the bottom panel, the ten-year TIPS spread,  which had widened in February and early March, stabilized as expectations of a  strong recovery moderated and as commodity prices stabilized after rising earlier this  year Supportive comments by the Treasury about the TIPS program and the  announcement of plans to increase the frequency of TIPS auctions may also have  played a role   The generalized decline in nominal Treasury yields has occurred despite the more  bearish factor for Treasuries that the markets have had to contend with in recent  months, namely the shifting fiscal picture  The most recent event highlighting the  change in the outlook was the Treasury’s announcement that it now anticipates  $1 billion in net financing needs for the second quarter rather than the $89 billion  paydown that it had forecast only three months ago  The top panel on page 2 shows  one way of looking at the higher financing needs  This chart compares the average  issuance by maturity of the various benchmark issues this year relative to last year  In  the bill sector, issuance is twice as large as it was last year  This year’s monthly two- year auctions have been running at a record $25 billion in size compared with about   1 Materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)                        May 7, 2002 4 of 81  $10 billion last year Today’s five-year auction will be a record $22 billion, and the  size of the ten-year auction also has increased from last year  The thirty-year bond  has been eliminated, of course, but that was being issued semiannually and made up  only a very small portion of total issuance  After complaints about a shrinking supply  of Treasuries in the last several years, the market has absorbed this higher level of  issuance so far without any evident strains     Despite the increase in supply, as I noted earlier yields have fallen in recent  weeks, suggesting that the higher levels of supply have not affected nominal rates   But higher levels of supply may be showing up in spread relationships  The bottom  panel graphs the US ten-year swap spread since January 1, 1998  The swap spread  has narrowed about 10 basis points since the last meeting and currently is roughly at  levels not seen since the summer of 1998, just before the Russian default  The  reasons for both the widening and the narrowing are complex, including the level of  corporate issuance that is swapped, the stance of monetary policy, demand for  hedging by mortgage and other accounts, and other short-term technical factors  Thus  one can’t ascribe movements to any single factor  Still, it’s noteworthy that spreads  widened during the period of higher budget surpluses and then began to narrow as the  surplus first began to shrink in fiscal 2001 and as the forecast turned to deficits in  fiscal 2002 This may suggest that at least part of the widening of spreads represented  a repricing of government credit risks relative to other risk assets  Spreads of other  debt instruments such as agencies and corporates show a similar pattern, though not  as pronounced These spreads have not fully retraced their climb and returned to the  very low levels seen in the summer of 1998   The corporate bond market was affected by issuer-specific and sector-specific  news in the past few weeks, with the backdrop of continuing worries about event  risks emanating from accounting-related concerns  Despite the constant drumbeat of  headlines about earnings shortfalls, SEC investigations, and continuing pressure on  some companies—especially those in the telecom area—to refinance their  commercial paper, there appears to have been no generalized tiering in the corporate  sector Spreads in that sector are depicted on page 3  The top panel graphs spreads  relative to AA industrial corporates As can be seen in the top left panel, among  investment-grade borrowers BBB spreads have risen modestly while A spreads have  narrowed Meanwhile, in the high-yield sector, BB credit spreads have narrowed as  well Looking at the broad spectrum of corporates relative to Treasuries, the spread  has been relatively stable, as seen in the red line of the lower graph  However, the  telecom sub-index, which is where the problems are most acute and where a large  proportion of the borrowing was concentrated in the late 1990s and early 2000,  widened dramatically     Turning to page 4, the very busy graph in the top panel shows changes in the  value of a number of foreign currencies—the euro, the yen, the Swiss franc, the  British pound, the Australian dollar, and the Mexican peso—against the dollar since  January 1 The values above 100 represent appreciation of the foreign currency  relative to the dollar  In recent weeks, most foreign currencies have been                        May 7, 2002 5 of 81  appreciating against the dollar, raising concerns about a sustained period of dollar  weakness The Mexican peso is an exception to this trend; it has fallen in recent  weeks due both to local factors and to the perception that a slower US recovery will  delay the recovery in Mexico  Despite the dollar’s recent depreciation, we should not  exaggerate the movement  It has moved only modestly lower since the beginning of  the year, and by most measures the effective value of the dollar is at levels last seen  during the strong dollar period of the mid-1980s  Still, sentiment toward the dollar  has deteriorated in recent weeks  Market talk has focused much more on the potential  adverse effects of the current account deficit than it has in quite some time  What has  taken the market aback in recent weeks was that the dollar’s fall was as broad as it  was and that it occurred despite the strong first-quarter GDP number  Particularly  surprising was that the dollar’s weakness spread even to the dollar-yen exchange rate,  whereas expectations only a few weeks ago were that the dollar would rise against the  yen One argument that some analysts have made in recent years is that the higher  expected returns in the United States relative to returns in other countries have  supported a higher dollar In recent weeks the dollar skeptics have used the same  logic and pointed to the underperformance of returns in the United States to explain  the dollar’s weakness The equally busy middle panel on page 4 shows the  performance of selected major equity markets relative to the S&P 500, taking into  account exchange rate moves So a line above the zero axis does not necessarily  imply that a particular equity market had positive returns  Rather, it measures how  much better that market did than the S&P 500  Adding up both equity market  changes and exchange rate shifts, each of these markets outperformed the S&P 500  since January, some by double-digit amounts  The bottom left panel depicts three- month interest rate differentials between the dollar and the euro  These differentials  have been at about 150 basis points in favor of the euro for some time now  At the  long end, shown in the right panel, the US dollar ten-year swap now yields about  25 basis points more than the euro swap, but that differential has narrowed from  75 basis points in January So at least during this relatively short period of about four  months, foreign investors in developed markets generally would have done better at  home than in the US markets  Should this trend continue, the dollar’s exchange rate  could come under further pressure     Looking at Japan a bit more closely, the top panel of page 5 graphs the Bank of  Japan’s month-end current account balances since January 2000  The target has been  10 trillion to 15 trillion yen since December, but in practice 15 trillion has been the  floor recently  And in the run-up to the end of the fiscal half year, the current account  balance temporarily topped out at more than 27 trillion yen  The middle panel depicts  Japan’s monetary base over the same period, from January 2000 through April 2002   Despite the reduction in short-term interest rates to near zero and the increase in the  current account balance over 2001, the monetary base did not begin to grow until late  in 2001 That growth occurred as the Bank of Japan stepped up its acquisition of  assets and targeted ever-higher levels of current account balances  That the monetary  base has been growing at annualized rates of nearly 50 percent in recent months has  caught the attention of some market participants  It is taken by some as either a  positive sign about the near-term outlook for the economy or as a signal that the Bank                           May 7, 2002 6 of 81  of Japan will hold the financial system together, or both  Whatever the direct cause,  this sentiment toward Japan for the near term, while not positive, is at least less  negative The yen had been depreciating in early 2002 along with a decline in  Japanese equities—and to a lesser extent, Japanese bonds—during the “sell Japan”  phase With the steps taken by the authorities to prop up equities in late March and  the realization that the Japanese would muddle through the fiscal year-end without a  major crisis, equities began to rise, the yen began to appreciate, and JGB yields began  to decline In short, the “sell Japan” phase was replaced by a “buy Japan” phase   Yields on JGBs have declined despite their downgrade to double A minus by  Standard & Poor’s and their possible downgrade by Moody’s in the next few weeks  to the high single A level   With respect to domestic reserves, the Desk at times faced challenges in the   intermeeting period because of uncertainty about the Treasury’s balance, given the   shortfall in tax revenues Overall, however, this tax season was less eventful than in   some other recent years when the Treasury was running up against its TT&L   (Treasury Tax and Loan account) constraints  That was not an issue this year    Finally, I wanted to note two items regarding the Desk’s operations  First, the   Desk began buying French bonds as part of SOMA’s foreign portfolio diversification   and also on behalf of the ESF (Exchange Stabilization Fund)  The Committee had   previously approved this diversification of the euro portfolio  Second, the Desk   announced a modest change to its Securities Lending Program, effective May 15, as   was described in a memo to the Committee dated April 22    Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period  I will need a vote   to approve our domestic operations, and I’d be happy to take any questions     Yes    I don’t know I haven’t looked at that specifically    Yes, I think that is worth looking into      I was not trying to imply that this was necessarily driving interest rates  My   point was that it was a factor, along with many other factors, that may have been affecting these   spreads in—    Well, this is one of many  But I wouldn’t claim that it’s the only one or even   the primary one, only that it is one      Sure I think most of the people around this table will remember that last   year at this time forces were aligned where there was a possibility that it might be in everybody’s   interest to do away with these swap lines  Among the forces that made that a possibility were the   new leadership in policymaking positions in all three countries and some events occurring in   Mexico—mainly the negotiation of a contingent credit line (CCL) that the Mexicans were   working on with the IMF As it happens that piece has not worked out  For various reasons, the   Mexicans have not been able to agree with the IMF on a CCL, and that has made them less                    May 7, 2002 9 of 81  willing to give up the swap lines  They very strongly would like to maintain the status quo, at   least for the time being  So, my recommendation to the Committee is that the swap lines be   renewed Of course, we’d look for opportunities in the future—should they arise and if the   Committee so desires—to do away with the swap lines  But my recommendation at this time is   that they be renewed for a year  "
4663,2002-08-13,"1 Thank you, Mr Chairman  Good morning  I’ll be referring to the  charts that were circulated a short time ago  On the first page, the top panel graphs  US and euro-area three-month interbank cash deposits rates as well as rates three  months forward and nine months forward  The US rates are in red, and those for the  euro area are in green The US cash three-month deposit rates edged lower by a few  basis points in the intermeeting period  But the three-month forward rate fell about  30 basis points and now trades slightly below the current three-month cash rate  The  three-month rate nine months forward fell nearly 1 percentage point  All of these  rates were influenced by lower equity prices, economic data that came in weaker than  the market had hoped, and budding expectations of lower official rates at some point   The euro-area rates, shown by the green line, exhibit a similar if somewhat less  pronounced pattern in recent months  Forward rates for the euro area are now at or  below cash rates The market’s fling in early May with a possible tightening of  policy has evaporated, as market participants downgraded their forecasts of the  economic situation in the euro area and as the euro’s appreciation came to be viewed  as doing some of the ECB’s work for it  In the bottom panel, Japanese short-term  rates continued to stay low, and there’s not very much to say there  US Treasury  yields moved lower in the intermeeting period, responding to the same economic and  equity market news that affected US forward rates  Liquidity in the US Treasury  market has been good, as is the case generally in the mortgage backed and swaps  markets     But one segment that has frayed a bit is the corporate sector, which is covered on  page 2 The top panel on page 2 shows—with the dark bars—weekly issuance of  investment-grade corporate debt for the year to date  March and early spring were  active, as many corporations termed out commercial paper into longer-term liabilities   Issuance subsequently turned down and in the most recent weeks has slowed to a  trickle Perhaps there are seasonal effects, though that is only part of the story  As  depicted by the red line, issuance held up during this period in 2001 with the  exception of the July 4 week, which is always a week when there’s little or no  activity On the demand side, investors who have taken losses in their portfolios in  recent months have been reluctant to expand the amount of credit risk in their  holdings And on the supply side, companies appear to be a bit more restrained about  raising funds in the current atmosphere   The middle panel depicts the spread over Treasuries of investment-grade debt  since April 1 This is a Lehman Brothers index, which indicated a spread that was  hovering mostly between 175 and 200 basis points for much of the spring  That was  an already elevated spread, but perhaps understandable given the accounting and  corporate governance issues that investors have had to factor into their pricing  From  late June until early August, spreads widened another 50 basis points, to more than   1 Materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)                  August 13, 2002 5 of 92  250 basis points Liquidity in the corporate sector decreased during this period, with  dealers widening out spreads and reducing the amount for which a quote would be  good down to about $5 million in many cases  This has made it very difficult for  investors to transfer larger positions   While telecom names have been problematic for some time, new sectors have  become tainted  Energy trading and power companies are one example  And in the  past few weeks, the bonds of the auto companies have also been repriced downward   Representative of that, I’ve shown in the bottom left panel the spreads over Treasuries  of Ford Motor Credit and GMAC bonds since July 23 The spreads for both have  widened sharply in the two weeks, particularly for Ford, which was hit by rumors of a  possible downgrade The 7¼ percent bond of 2011 widened from 350 to 450 basis  points, and other Ford bonds rose to as high as 500 basis points over Treasuries in the  past few trading days The bottom right-hand panel depicts the bid-asked spread,  expressed in basis points, for the same two bonds shown at left  This spread in a  normal environment might be 2 or 3 basis points  By late July it had already widened  out to 5 basis points for GMAC and 10 basis points for Ford Motor Credit  The  spreads then ballooned to 20 and 30 basis points, respectively, in the first seven or  eight trading sessions in August     As the equity markets declined and fixed income markets turned volatile, the  price of insurance expressed by implied volatilities rose  The top panel on page 3  graphs the implied volatility on the S&P 100 equity index, which had been rising  steadily since late May but spiked higher in July and peaked at about 50 percent in  late July and again in early August  This is slightly higher than the peaks reached in  1998 and higher than the peak in September 2001 after the terrorist attacks  The  middle panel shows the volatility index for short and intermediate swaptions  These  are implied volatilities on options that give the holder the right but not the obligation  to exercise and roll into an interest rate swap  These instruments are used extensively  in hedging operations, especially by mortgage investors  Both indexes have hit very  high levels recently The short-term swaption index has nearly doubled to almost  45 percent By way of comparison, that index peaked at about 20 percent in 1998 and  at 36 percent in the aftermath of September 11  The intermediate-term index is also  at elevated levels and is currently near levels observed in October 1998  In contrast,  implied volatilities on currency options rose in late June but quickly began to trend  lower again None of the three major currency pairs is now near the peak levels  observed in either 1998 or 2001 Part of the reason currency volatilities have been  restrained is perhaps that speculative positions appear to be relatively small; hence  there is less demand by that segment for hedging purposes  It may also reflect the  market’s lack of conviction about the future course of volatility in exchange rates, as  the major economies are expected to move broadly in sync   Turning to page 4, the top panel graphs the dollar’s exchange rate against the  euro, the yen, the Swiss franc, the Canadian dollar, and the Australian dollar re- indexed to April 1 The dollar had been falling against all major currencies through  mid-June, and it continued to depreciate against the euro, the yen, and the Swiss               August 13, 2002 6 of 92  franc But the US dollar actually began to appreciate against the Australian and  Canadian dollars, as investors came to view a slowdown in the United States as  adverse for major commodity currencies  More recently, the reassessment of growth  prospects in Europe has resulted at least in a pause in the dollar’s trend to the  downside against other currencies The reduced growth prospects overseas can also  be seen in equity markets  The middle panel depicts changes in the S&P 500 and  major global equity indexes since April 1  All major indexes are lower, though those  for France and Germany, with heavy representations of telecom and media firms,  have performed worse than the others  Finally, in the bottom panel is the spread on  ten-year minus two-year government yields for the United States, Canada, Japan, the  United Kingdom, and Germany  As growth expectations have come down, the curves  have steepened, primarily by virtue of the two-year note declining faster than the ten- year note in each of these countries  The exception, of course, is Japan, where yields  at the short end can’t go any lower than they are now   Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations for the System account in this   period, and I will need a vote to ratify our domestic operations  I would be happy to   take any questions Thank you     I don’t know that there was any single event  There were rumors at about   that time that Ford Motor might be downgraded  Since then those rumors have taken on even   more steam      Yes, I agree with that Again, what seemed to be involved was a liquidity   shift and not really a single event  Now, corporate governance and accounting stories were   circulating, but these companies were not tied to those  I think that’s one of the more interesting   aspects about these bonds The issuers are not in industries that have been tainted by those   problems, which does point to some interesting questions             August 13, 2002 7 of 92   This is a very short period; it’s only about two weeks Again, these spreads   had already begun to rise earlier They were then stable for a few days and subsequently began   rising again If I could approach your question in a slightly different way—I think if we looked   at a number of companies, the patterns in their spreads might depend in part not only on   perceived creditworthiness but on how much debt they have outstanding  Ford Motor Credit is, I   believe, the largest issuer in the bond market  It’s a very, very large issuer, and of course,   GMAC is as well A year or two ago investors wanted to hold these jumbo issues  They were   considered desirable because investors perceived them as having a lot of liquidity  Now, we   know what has happened to some of the jumbo issues like those of WorldCom  Suddenly   investors don’t want to have these big positions on their books  They actually prefer to have debt   of issuers that don’t come to market that much, which will help to diversify their portfolios  So   to some degree a firm’s having lots of paper out there was perceived to be an advantage from the   investor’s perspective two years ago, and it is not viewed as advantageous today    Well, it’s a mix  To some extent it may be that investors have some   questions about the auto companies specifically  They’re selling a lot of cars—auto sales have            August 13, 2002 8 of 92  been strong—and yet they don’t seem to be making any money  So there may be a repricing of   their creditworthiness as well    Exactly    I don’t have the exact numbers in mind, but if I remember correctly, they   haven’t had quite this kind of deleterious performance    Broadly, they do tend to move together, but we can have periods when the   correlation is fairly low  It seems that at times—such as now, when the perception about the              August 13, 2002 10 of 92  outlook for the economy is changing—they tend to move together  At other times, they’ll move   on local factors and not as much on international ones    I think the answer to your question is “yes, often”  But at times the   correlation will break down      Well, the amounts of outstanding commercial paper have come down  I   would note two developments in particular in that market  One is that commercial paper for a   long time was a very low cost way of raising money  But having seen the commercial paper   market shut down to so many issuers, other corporations now are thinking twice about how to   structure their liabilities They’re being a little more cautious about how much they want to rely   on commercial paper There is also an interesting effect between commercial paper backup lines   and credit default swaps That is, a firm wants to issue commercial paper and needs to have   backup lines of credit The firm gets these cheap backup lines, and the people who provide the   backup lines then run out and hedge through the credit default swaps  We then have this effect   that Vince mentioned that the credit default swap rates go up and that makes it appear as if the   market has less confidence in the creditworthiness of those specific issuers  It has this   unintended consequence for the issuer And I think people are finally beginning to figure that   out To some degree I think issuers are having some second thoughts about how much paper                      August 13, 2002 11 of 92  they want to issue, given that there’s this avenue through which other people might view them as   being less creditworthy  "
4715,2002-09-24,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that were  circulated just a little while ago The top panel of the page 1 shows three-month US  dollar cash deposit rates, the libor fixing, and also the three-, six-, and nine-month  forward deposit rates, from June 3 to September 20  Since your last meeting, three- month cash and forward rates traded in a narrow range as market participants reacted  to mixed economic data  The three- and six-month forward rates continued to trade  below the cash rate, suggesting that market participants were assigning some  probability to a reduction in short-term rates, especially once the equity markets  began to decline again after the early August bounce     While short-dated deposit rates moved in a narrow range, Treasury yields fell,  especially in the middle of the yield curve  As shown in the two middle panels on  page 1, yields on Treasury issues have been falling for some time  The two-year note  was yielding about 188 percent this morning, a new low for that security, with the  latest decline in yield coinciding with the equity market sell-off  The most  pronounced decline in yields since the middle of August occurred in the five- and ten- year areas The five-year yield was at about 270 percent this morning, and the ten- year yield was at about 363 percent  The explanations for the sharp fall in yields are  many, though none by itself is fully satisfying Market participants have cited a weak  economy, although interestingly most forecasts for third-quarter GDP were raised in  recent weeks  Poor business sentiment was also cited, as were the corporate scandals,  geopolitical concerns, and occasional rumors about problems at particular financial  institutions   However, since the biggest moves were in the middle of the curve, it would seem  that mortgage hedging was in part the cause and in part an accelerator of the sharp  downward move in yields As interest rates declined since December, the volume of  mortgage refinancing increased, prepayments shortened the duration of mortgage  portfolios, and the quickest way for a portfolio manager to bring the portfolio  duration into alignment was to buy noncallable Treasuries  Those typically are in the  five- and ten-year sectors An added factor in recent weeks has been the expectation  by many market participants of increased hedging needs of Fannie Mae, which last  week reported a duration gap of minus fourteen months compared with its target of  plus or minus six months  Apparently many dealers and investors did some back-of­  1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)              September 24, 2002 4 of 115  the-envelope calculations and concluded that Fannie would need to buy a very large  amount of Treasuries to close the gap  While there is no evidence that the  government-sponsored entity conducted any such transactions in the Treasury market,  those who cleverly thought they would front-run Fannie may have added to the  buying wave Not surprisingly in this kind of market, volatilities have been high   The mortgage hedging needs show up in volatility measures as well  The market for  options on swaps is a key risk-management tool among investors in mortgage-backed  securities The bottom panel depicts the Mortgage Bankers Association refinancing  index and the three-month option on a ten-year swap  Implied volatilities have risen  to more than 30 percent along with the recent refinancing wave, as investors tried to  stay ahead of the prepayment cycle     Let me turn to the corporate market on page 2  During the summer the corporate  bond market was one of reduced issuance, wider spreads relative to Treasuries, wider  bid-offered spreads, and generally reduced liquidity, making it difficult for investors  to adjust the risk in their portfolios  In the intermeeting period, the situation  improved at the margin, but that improvement was from some very extreme  conditions, and sentiment in this market remains very fragile  Spreads on investment- grade debt narrowed to about 225 basis points—still very wide but better than early  August levels—as shown in the top panel Issuance has also picked up, as you can  see in the middle panel, though the markets have been very discriminating about  which companies have had access  Conditions in the secondary market have  improved since your last meeting  Liquidity is reportedly better  And the very wide  bid-offered spreads reverted to more-normal levels in the week or two after the last  meeting  The high-yield sector showed some signs of improvement in mid-August,  as the equity markets rallied and the August 14 deadline for certification passed  But  in September, issuance has been weak, and spreads again are beginning to widen   Finally, in the commercial paper market, there has been at least some stability at  lower levels of issuance I would note that one market that has continued to function  well is the asset-backed market, including the market for asset-backed commercial  paper But even this development suggests that investors are demanding obligations  that have an added dose of protection   I think investors can be excused if they remain skittish—as one might expect after  this year’s concerns about accounting, corporate governance, and reduced earning  prospects—and if they feel a bit burned by the corporate market  The bottom panel  graphs the monthly incremental return that an investor has earned from corporate  bonds relative to Treasuries of the same duration  In the early to mid-1990s, the  monthly incremental return was about 5 basis points, with a standard deviation of  about 29 basis points Since 1998 that incremental return has actually been minus  13 basis points—that is, the return on Treasuries has been higher—and the standard  deviation has more than doubled  In short, investors who have concluded that the  corporate market has high risks and low returns would not be out of bounds, at least  based on the experience of the past four years or so                September 24, 2002 5 of 115  Turning to page 3, Japanese equity markets have fluctuated widely as another  fiscal period end approaches In the run-up to March 31, almost six months ago, there  was talk of a crisis in the banking system, given the decline in equity prices on the  Nikkei to below 10,000 In response, the authorities imposed a series of rule changes  on short sales, which triggered a sharp short covering rally  Last week the markets  had to absorb a different surprise when the Bank of Japan announced that it would  buy stocks directly from the banks  The announcement had a short-lived effect on the  equity market, though bank stocks—the green line in the top panel—did bounce  The  effect quickly dissipated since the market is waiting to see what else, if anything, will  be done by the government to clean up the bad debt situation  Interestingly, the effect  on the bond market so far has been more pronounced  The ten-year JGB yield, shown  in the middle left panel, was heading toward 1 percent as gloom about Japan’s  prospects built up  Over the past three trading sessions the yield shot up from about  103 to 130 percent, and this morning it was at about l28 percent  The irony is that  in the near term the announcement has not done very much for stocks but has  adversely affected JGB prices, which itself is a major asset class for Japanese banks   While the long end of the curve is backing up, the short end is in demand, at least  for the time being, even at rates that are effectively or actually at zero  The Ministry  of Finance’s Treasury bill and financing bill auctions have been stopping out at about  01 basis point Now, you might think this would be an asset that would not be in  much demand  But the bid-to-cover ratios in recent auctions have been about 700 to  1 or 800 to 1, and in fact, it appears that about half the accepted bids at recent  auctions were at par That is, investors were incurring the administrative cost to buy  the bills at no return rather than take the credit risk of just leaving the money in a  commercial bank   As for the banks themselves, they, too, have a lot of cash looking for a home  The  middle right panel shows the growth of deposits since the early 1990s and also the  contraction of loans during that same period  With that much excess cash sloshing  around the markets—and little in the way of investment opportunity—market  participants expect the current environment to persist and, if anything, see more of the  yield curve get pulled down toward zero The bottom panel graphs the current yield  curve, the solid red line, along with two other snapshots—from one year ago and  from eighteen months ago before the Bank of Japan reverted to its zero interest rate  policy The current two-year yield is at about 5 basis points, and the middle of the  curve is being tugged lower by the weight of all that cash looking for a home  As yet,  however, this strategy has not helped to pull Japan out of its period of stagnation     Turning to euro area markets briefly on page 4, the top panel graphs the three- month euro deposit libor rate, shown in black, and the three-month, six-month, and  nine-month forward rates of that same three-month deposit  Those forward rates,  which earlier this summer had been trading at a premium to the cash rate are now  trading about 30 basis point below it, despite word from the ECB suggesting that it is  very comfortable with the current stance of policy  In part the same set of economic  and political factors that affected US expectations are affecting euro area rates                                   September 24, 2002 6 of 115  Forecasts for growth are receding quickly, a fact that has also been reflected in  equity markets  European stock indexes have fallen sharply this summer  Since  June 3, the Dow-Jones euro stocks index—a broad index of major companies in the  euro area, represented by the solid red line—has fallen more than 30 percent,  including declines yesterday and today The sector that has been hit hardest and led  the decline is the insurance sector—the dashed red line—which has seen its market  value cut in half during that time  Europe’s insurance industry has been hit by losses  not only related to the terrorist attacks, the floods in Europe, asbestos suits, and the  like but also notably by the sharp drop in equity prices and losses in their credit  portfolios One question that has been asked over the past year or two, as the levels  of defaults grew, was which balance sheets were absorbing these losses since few  indications seemed to be popping up with banks and securities houses  Well, it has  taken a while, but we finally seem to be getting some of the answer  Just for  comparison, the US insurance sector has also seen its shares clipped  The dashed  blue line is the S&P insurance sub-index, which fell about 20 percent over that  period, about the same as the broader index     Following the pattern of the US and other major markets, long-term bond yields  in the euro area have declined as well The yield on the ten-year bund to take one  example—shown in the bottom panel—has fallen about 90 basis points since early  June, including this morning’s price action  Given the weakness in major European  economies, one might ask why yields, which are still nearly 65 basis points above  comparable US yields, did not drop even more  Part of the reason might be the  outsized influence of the mortgage market in the United States, but part may also be  related to concerns about backsliding on Stability Growth Pact targets by several of  the major euro area governments   Finally, let me say a word on reserves  The graph on page 5 shows the growth of  currency over the past two years During that period, currency grew mostly in a  monthly range of 7 to 12 percent; through June the growth rate fluctuated around  10 percent, which was above longer-term trends  Since June, the monthly growth rate  has fallen sharply into the low single digits and shows little sign of a turnaround   This has allowed the Desk to slow its outright purchases of Treasury securities and  also to reduce the size of its long-term repo book from about $18 billion this spring to  about $11 billion now   Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period  I will need a vote  for approval of the domestic operations  And I’d be happy to answer any questions    It’s both domestic and international                   September 24, 2002 7 of 115   It’s everything It’s from a number of regions, and there’s also a slowing in   the domestic component  Really, the growth in currency is slowing in all areas    It’s an excellent question  And the problem at least in part is that the data are   not great What one hears are anecdotal reports         Yes, but I think what people typically focus on is the cost of credit, which   often is provided by the banks So if the question is what is the cost of credit and the borrower is   getting credit from the banks, that information is a little harder to get I don’t have the exact   spreads on the tip of my tongue    Oh, do you? Good    Let me make two points, President Jordan  First, the commentary from the   markets was that generic mortgage hedging and hedging of mortgage-backed securities   portfolios was associated with the decline in yields, which was one aspect of the story  Then in   the last week, since Fannie Mae announced its duration gap, this other aspect arose, which was   the expectation that Fannie Mae itself would be jumping into the hedging game  Now, in talking   with dealers, nobody has seen any of these flows And Fannie Mae in other settings has said that   they really don’t use Treasuries in this way There are other alternatives they could use to try to   bring down the duration gap—a step-up in purchases of mortgage-backed securities, for           September 24, 2002 11 of 115  example, or an accelerated calling of debt—short of actually doing what people expect them to   do And Fannie is fairly sophisticated, enough so that they probably would not do what   everybody expects    I can’t speak for the interworkings of how they manage their hedging  What   I was trying to do was to explain the commentary in the Treasury market  My point was that   Fannie Mae has other means of hedging—alternatives in terms of accepting the risks, which may   have an impact on their earnings if rates go the wrong way on them  So my message was that the   course of action that was expected by some in the market and that was showing up in Wall Street    Journal articles was not necessarily the one they had to follow      That’s a possibility, yes    Well, I think some of that is going on as well, though perhaps not as much as   in Argentina where people have been buying safes  But certainly we have heard some   commentary about people keeping cash as opposed to putting it into a bank  Let me make one   other point regarding your question about why residents haven’t taken their money out of Japan    There is a risk aversion aspect related to the fact that several times in the last ten years when   money has started to flow out there have been exchange rate losses  The most prominent case   was in 1988 when the exchange rate began to depreciate rapidly and the Ministry of Finance   began intervening aggressively to cut off that avenue  They basically said we’re not going to let   the yen depreciate As a consequence, there was a 30 yen swing the other way in a matter of   days That kind of experience is something that stays with people; they remember the pain, and   that makes them risk averse for the future until that memory wanes  So I think that’s another   aspect that we shouldn’t overlook    Well, I think in part there may be an aversion to credit risk  Earlier this year   we were hearing that one thing the Japanese banks were doing to fund their dollar assets was   foreign exchange swaps, swapping US dollars for yen  They were doing these trades with   foreign banks, non-Japanese banks, which then had yen that they were raising effectively at   negative interest rates So what one could then do was to invest at zero and still capture a   positive margin  You would rather buy a bill at zero, let’s say, than put funds into a bank where   you didn’t like the credit risk So that was one class of action where it was rational and it made   sense There are other classes I gather that I’m having a harder time trying to explain  "
4770,2002-11-06,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that were   distributed a short while ago The top panel of the first page shows the three-month   US dollar libor fixing in black and the three-month deposit rates three, six, and nine   months forward in red Forward rates had a minor roller coaster ride, first declining   immediately after your September meeting, rising in mid-October as equities bounced   off their October 9 lows, and then heading downward again as the economic data   were perceived as pointing to economic weakness  Although much of the decline in   forward rates had occurred by October 26, the day of the Washington Post article that   heightened expectations about a possible ease in policy, the article did strengthen   market participants’ convictions about the near-term direction of policy The three-   and six-month forward rates both are now trading below cash rates  In the Treasury   market, the two-year note moved broadly in line with shifting expectations for official   policy The yield fluctuated widely, going as low as 166 percent on October 9 and as   high as 222 percent around midmonth  The long end of the curve was affected by   many of the same factors as the short end, though the long sector once again was   probably affected by hedging of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) portfolios      The middle panel graphs the ten-year yield in blue on the left scale and an   estimate of the duration of outstanding mortgage-backed securities—in red on the   right scale—since June Many mortgages had been clustered in the 6½ percent   coupon bucket and, with rates falling, these mortgages became attractive to refinance    Hence the estimated duration moved even lower from June to September  To hedge   against that shortening of duration, MBS investors could buy Treasuries or fixed   receiver swaps, either of which would have at least some impact on yield levels,   given the size of mortgage market  As that wave of hedging slowed, Treasury yields   suddenly jumped about 62 basis points in mid-October  Some investors, in fact,   reportedly overdid their hedging and in mid-October had to sell some of the positions   they had just bought The other factor that had a day-to-day effect on yields—and   even an intraday effect at times—was the movement in equity markets  The bottom   panel shows one way of looking at this relationship  It graphs the 100-day rolling   correlation between the S&P 500 and the ten-year note yield since January 1988  I   would note two points First, for much of this period the correlation was modestly    1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)                           November 6, 2002 4 of 122  negative, but in late 1997 it abruptly turned positive and, though choppy, has on  balance remained positive Second, the correlation, which was already high, has been  increasing this year and is now higher than it was even during September 1998     The intermeeting period continued to be difficult in the corporate bond market   Investment-grade spreads—shown in the top left panel on page 2—remained  elevated, though they are off the peaks they reached a few weeks ago and also earlier  this summer  Meanwhile, high-yield spreads—shown in the top right panel—topped  1,000 basis points in early October before easing very slightly  The only other time  that index exceeded 1,000 basis points was in January 1991  Fixed-income investors,  whether in investment-grade or high-yield securities—most of which are measured  against the benchmark index—are in risk-averse mode, after having taken hits in  many parts of their portfolios  Another way of looking at the corporate bond market  is to take the investment-grade universe and divide the bonds into buckets according  to their spread relative to Treasuries The middle panel shows three snapshots of  this—as of October 25 in 2000, 2001, and 2002 The percentage of the investment- grade universe trading at up to 100 basis points over Treasuries has been hovering at  about 10 percent over these past couple of years  More than half of the investment- grade issues traded at a spread of between 100 and 200 basis points two years ago, as  shown by the tall red bar That category has now declined to about 40 percent,  reflecting in part a migration of credit downwards  But perhaps the most striking  development is the proportion of corporate bonds that are still investment grade but  are trading at more than 400 basis points over Treasuries  From a small number  earlier, that group now makes up one-fifth of the market, as you can see by the tall  green bar on the far right   That higher number reflects mostly the repricing of the debt obligations of some  very large issuers, a phenomenon illustrated in the bottom panel  The panel depicts  for the year 2002 to date the spreads on the fixed-income securities of four of the  largest issuers All four of these companies have seen a doubling or even tripling of  their spreads at times  And while they are still investment grade in name, they are  priced as if they were high yield Because of their high and regular issuance, the  bonds of these companies comprise meaningful chunks of mainstream fixed-income  benchmark indexes and are widely owned Now, I should note that not all large  issuers have experienced a widening of their spreads  For example, Bank of America  is trading at a spread of about 105 basis points, and Citigroup, despite negative  publicity, is at about 115 basis points     Also, while liquidity in the corporate bond market has been episodic, it has shown  some signs of improvement recently  Meanwhile, liquidity in Treasury, MBS, and  asset-backed securities markets has generally been good throughout the period   Finally, I should note that the level of outstanding nonfinancial commercial paper  continued to decline in recent weeks and is now nearly 40 percent lower than it was a  year ago And as we approach year-end, the A1-P1/A2-P2 spreads have begun to  widen just a bit, especially for thirty-day paper, but at least so far that widening has  been much less pronounced than we saw a year ago                     November 6, 2002 5 of 122  Turning to Europe on page 3, the top panel graphs the three-month euro deposit  libor fixing and three-, six-, and nine-month forward rates  Forward rates, which  were trading above cash rates early in the summer, have been steadily declining as  forecasts for euro-area growth have continued to be reduced  Forward rate  agreements are now trading below cash rates, and the market widely expects a  reduction in the ECB’s official target rate before year-end, perhaps as early as  tomorrow  With Europe’s slowdown, euro-area corporate spreads have also widened,  although perhaps not by as much as parts of our own bond market  In Europe the  widening has been most pronounced at lower quality levels, such as the BBB, shown  in the green line of the middle panel  Meanwhile, issuance—shown in the bottom  panel—has been falling as in the United States, but the full credit picture in Europe is  more difficult to gauge given the greater reliance on bank financing by European  companies   Moving to Japan on page 4, the market there has been on a bit of a roller coaster  ride recently, reacting to every little report about the likelihood, timing, size, and  speed of the government’s plan to clean up the banking system  At the time of your  last meeting, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) had just announced its intention to buy equities  from Japanese commercial banks  At first, Japanese government bond (JGB) yields  spiked higher to about 13 percent, but they quickly retraced that rise as the market  began to doubt the economic significance of the BOJ’s announcement Then the  cabinet reshuffle and the nomination of a new economic and regulatory czar raised  the possibility that stronger action might be forthcoming to cleanse the  nonperforming loan problem  While that might have been viewed as a negative for  JGBs, given the prospect of large government expenditures, in the short run the effect  has been to firm up sentiment that keeping money in the banking system is risky  So  JGBs again have become attractive as a safe haven  The government’s plan, when  finally announced, was viewed as rather general and a bit less than was hoped for or  expected With reform on a slower track again, JGBs continued to decline below  1 percent The last time that JGB yields were below 1 percent was in November  1998 The other development was the BOJ’s own announcement on October 30 that  it would increase the pace of its JGB purchases and its current account balances  target But that was shrugged off, as much as anything, by the marketplace   Meanwhile, bank stocks fell with the cabinet reshuffle, suggesting that investors in  these stocks at least were taking the probability of reform more seriously  The  biggest fall in stock prices—the bottom panel—was for stocks of the three large  banks thought to be at risk of a government takeover   Finally, let me say a word on reserves The chart on page 5 depicts, for each  maintenance period, average values for the three basic components of our total  holdings of domestic financial assets—that is, for the permanent System Open Market  Account, long-term repurchase agreements, and our short-term operations  This chart  shows actual or projected values for the one-year period from February 2002 through  February 2003, starting and ending at the seasonal trough for currency Through July  2002, currency growth continued to contribute to a steady expansion of our total                       November 6, 2002 6 of 122  domestic financial holdings, achieved almost entirely with growth in our permanent  SOMA holdings From July to October, the total size of the portfolio generally has  been flat, and it even shrank a bit recently  This shrinkage reflected essentially flat  currency growth combined with movement in some autonomous factors that added to  reserve balances, most noticeably the foreign repo pool  To maintain the total  domestic portfolio at the appropriate level, long-term repos were compressed, falling  from $18 billion in June to just about $6 billion in late October  Having the long- term repo book allowed us to compress our balance sheet quickly without selling  assets from SOMA or engaging in longer-term draining operations     In upcoming maintenance periods we face seasonal currency growth, and we  expect a resumption of seasonally adjusted currency growth to more normal levels   The resulting reserve needs will be met primarily with a buildup of long-term repos   Some resumption of outright SOMA purchases is also planned, but we will proceed  with that very slowly for the time being By the end of the seasonal currency swing,  long-term repos will have been built back up to about $16 billion, a level at which we  plan to hold them steady for a while   Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period  I will need a vote   to approve our domestic operations       The person responsible [Ms Perelmuter] is to my left    Yes, I think you can see that views had already been moving toward an   expectation of an easing move But there’s always the issue of how much conviction lies behind               November 6, 2002 7 of 122  that expectation and the degree of dispersion around it  To some  extent what Berry’s article did   was not necessarily to lock in that expectation but to raise the level of conviction about it  Even   if the expectations themselves didn’t change, the level of conviction did     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Recently, Vincent Reinhart and I sent a  memo to the Committee on the SOMA alternative assets study  Before we turn to the  main part of today’s discussion, let me just remind you that in March we sought  guidance from the Committee on prioritizing resources for the continuation of our  work on this issue  At that time the Committee instructed the staff to focus first on  the possibility of buying Ginnie Maes outright for the portfolio and second on the  possibility of accepting foreign sovereign debt as collateral on repos  But Committee  members indicated that to the extent there was a resource conflict—and there was—  the staff was to finish contingency planning for tri-party repos at our third site    So from the time of that meeting through about the August-September time frame  we were focusing almost exclusively on finishing the work on contingency planning,  and only recently have we begun to look at the issues of how Ginnie Maes might fit  into our outright portfolio Given that limited amount of time, most of our work has  been in the area of preparatory planning—thinking about how long certain tasks  might take, especially some of the settlement accounting, front office work, risk  management, and very critically the systems changes that might need to be made   Each of these issues is surmountable, but the work involved is time consuming  And  if the Committee were to approve expanding the allowable assets in the System Open  Market Account to include Ginnie Mae securities, the time before we actually would  begin buying them would be measured not in weeks but more likely in months and  quarters It probably would take at least eighteen months or so before we could make  all the necessary arrangements and begin to implement such a decision     In the interim, another element of the work that the FOMC had commissioned is  ready for the Committee’s review, and that is the study the staff has finished on the  auction credit facility  Rick Lang led that work, so let me turn the floor over to him  to describe the paper on that issue, which you also received recently    What I would propose then is that at some point over the next few months, at   a meeting next year, we come back to the Committee with a proposal for what a Ginnie Mae   program would look like  That is, we’d try to give you some concrete sense of the size of the   program that we would envision and how we would buy the Ginnie Maes  With the front office   there are some accounting issues that we might be able to resolve by then  We would try to              November 6, 2002 111 of 122  assess the implications in terms of costs so that you have a sense of what it would cost the   System or the New York Fed to do this  So the next document would be more concrete than the   general approach that we have taken to date when we’ve been looking at alternative approaches    That would be my suggestion for some time early next year    "
4822,2002-12-10,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that were  circulated a few minutes ago  The top panel on the first page graphs three-month  cash deposit rates for the dollar and the euro as well as three-month deposit rates  three months and nine months forward  The US three-month deposit rate—the solid  red line—declined in anticipation of an easing at the Committee’s November 6  meeting and fell further after the 50 basis point reduction in the target fed funds rate   While the three-month forward rate tracked movements in the cash rate, the nine- month forward rate diverged from the cash rate and actually rose about 25 basis  points over the intermeeting period, as many in the market began to weigh the  possibility that the end of the easing cycle had been reached  In recent days, the  three-month forward rate has fallen slightly, reacting to some weaker than expected  data, including the ISM data and the unemployment rate   Meanwhile, deposit rates in the euro area also were declining steadily in the  intermeeting period, as the market increasingly anticipated an easing move by the  ECB at its December 5 meeting Deposit rates in the euro area continued to fall in the  past few days, in reaction to the ECB’s surprising 50 basis point cut in its minimum  refinancing rate In contrast to the relationship between cash and forward rates  observed in the United States, forward rates in the euro area continued to trade at or  below cash rates, suggesting that market participants expect further easing by the  ECB   US Treasury yields have fluctuated widely, tending to rise after the Committee’s  November meeting as risk aversion receded  But yields subsequently declined as  several weak data reports again attracted flows into government bonds  The bottom  panel of chart 1 shows recent rates on the two-year Treasury note along with the  target fed funds rate The yield on the two-year note actually rose in the aftermath of  the Committee’s November meeting, and the spread to the target funds rate widened  to 75 basis points in late November, the widest such spread since early July  One of  the reasons cited was the more positive sentiment triggered by the easing action itself  Second, some participants viewed the election results as positive  Third, technical  factors related to positioning of the two-year note also may have played a role   Finally, as I noted earlier, there was a sense that the November cut in the funds rate  was perhaps the last move in the easing cycle   1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)                                December 10, 2002 4 of 87  Turning to page 2, the situation in credit markets has improved markedly since the  last meeting  Bid-offered spreads have narrowed to more-normal levels, liquidity is  improved, and issuance has revived in recent weeks  Spreads relative to Treasuries  have narrowed, in some cases significantly  As shown in the top left panel, the spread  of mortgage-backed securities to Treasuries declined only slightly since the last  meeting, but it had declined about 25 basis points since mid-October, to below  100 basis points   More pronounced has been the improvement in investment-grade corporate  spreads—shown in the top right panel—which declined from a recent peak of  220 basis points to about 140 basis points  The spreads for high-yield bonds—the  middle left panel—exhibited a similar narrowing, falling from over 1,000 basis points  to about 800 basis points The EMBI+ spread, driven in part by a recovery in Brazil,  also narrowed similarly    Another way to view the situation in the corporate debt market is to look at how  much of the outstanding stock is trading at distressed levels  For this exercise, we  arbitrarily defined distressed investment-grade bonds as those trading at a spread over  Treasuries of 500 or more basis points, and we defined distressed high-yield bonds as  those with a spread of 1,500 basis points or more  As shown in the lower panel by the  red bar on the left, on October 15 about 12 percent of the investment-grade universe  met that definition of distressed  That percentage dropped sharply one month later in  the days immediately after the Committee’s meeting, and it fell still more as of this  past Friday as shown by the green bar on the bottom left  As can been seen on the  right side of the bottom panel, there has been improvement in the high-yield sector as  well, though proportionately not quite as much as in the investment-grade sector         Looking at volatility across asset markets—page 3—volatility measures have  trended lower recently, but they have risen somewhat in recent days, coinciding with  the release of some weaker-than-expected data  The S&P 100 volatility index, or  VIX, fell from about 50 percent in early October to about 26 percent in late  November, coinciding with the rally in the major indexes  In recent days, this  volatility index rose again into the low 30s as equity prices began to decline  Interest  rate implied volatilities also fell sharply over the intermeeting period  The middle  panel depicts the implied volatility on eurodollar deposit futures contracts  From  extremely elevated levels of between 50 and 60 percent in late October, it fell sharply  in the days around the Committee’s meeting  Even though it has drifted back up to  about 30 percent, still a relatively high level for this contract, it is half the level of  only six weeks ago Finally, twelve-month foreign exchange volatilities for the major  currency pairs have remained low and short-dated volatilities were lower still  In  particular, the one-month volatility of the euro-dollar cross rate was briefly below  7 percent, as the currency pair appeared stuck near parity   Let me turn briefly to the behavior of the commercial paper market, as we  approach year-end The top panel of page 4 graphs A2/P2–A1/P1 spreads from  September 1 to the end of February for the years 2000-01 and 2001-02; for the                     December 10, 2002 5 of 87  current year it shows the spreads from September 1, 2002, to date  The top panel  depicts this spread for thirty-day paper on the left and for ninety-day paper on the  right In 2000—the black line—the spread between A2/P2 and A1/P1 spiked sharply  in late November, triggered by the crisis in the California electricity market  Last  year—the gold line—spreads similarly widened, affected by both the aftermath of  September 11 and the Enron crisis  To date this year—the red line—spreads for both  maturities are only slightly wider, and market conditions reportedly are showing none  of the stress exhibited in the last few years      The bottom panel on page 4 graphs commercial paper spreads around the year­ end relative to Treasuries  The left side depicts yields on ninety-day A1/P1 paper  relative to three-month Treasury bills  The bottom right shows the same relationship  for A2/P2 paper Once again the black and gold lines represent the spreads for the  last two years, and the red line depicts the spreads for this year through last Friday   The rate on A1/P1 paper has barely budged relative to Treasuries, and that on A2/P2  paper has widened somewhat, though less than in previous years  The reduction in  risk aversion that helps explain the narrowing of credit spreads is probably relevant  here as well But the other factor at work is the notable shrinkage in the commercial  paper market in the past year, as the most vulnerable issuers withdrew from the  market and termed out their debt   Turning to page 5, European markets have coped with weak data, lower forecasts  of future growth, a weakening fiscal outlook in major countries, uncertainty about the  Stability and Growth Pact rules, and—until last week—uncertainty about the  willingness of the ECB to ease policy to counter slow growth  European equity  markets along with the US and other global markets fell in September and early  October before recovering somewhat  The German market lagged, as the outlook  regarding the strength of the German banking system in the near-term was viewed as  particularly bleak Despite that bleakness, in the euro area bond spreads narrowed in  line with global trends The middle panel graphs BBB-rated and A-rated bonds  relative to German ten-year bunds  The lower-rated BBB bonds in particular  narrowed sharply in relation to bunds  And issuance in the euro area bond market—  as shown in the bottom panel—reversed course in November, roughly tripling from  October’s depressed levels   Finally, turning to page 6, Japanese markets continue to be nothing if not  interesting The dollar-yen exchange rate, though trading in a relatively narrow range  recently, has been susceptible to bouts of short-term choppiness  Comments by  finance minister Shiokawa eight days ago, suggesting that an exchange rate of 150 to  160 per dollar was appropriate, initially weakened the yen  Mr Shiokawa backed off  in subsequent days, and the yen retraced its decline a bit, but on net it was modestly  weaker against most major currencies over the past month  Market participants  generally still presume that the Japanese authorities prefer a weaker yen, though so  far the price action has been limited  The fact that the exchange rate has been stable  in the face of these comments is viewed by some as evidence that statements by  officials have little effect beyond the very short run  But others note that the volatility                        December 10, 2002 6 of 87  has been low for another reason—because the Bush Administration has not engaged   in a tit-for-tat public exchange and reaction to comments by Japanese officials, such   as those made by Shiokawa  According to this view, it was those types of back-and­ forth exchanges that made markets nervous in previous years      In the fixed-income markets, the ten-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yield  has been stuck at around 1 percent despite the uncertainty about the Takenaka Plan,  which involves the potential for significantly higher issuance of JGBs  Indeed, the  JGB curve has trended down during 2002 The middle panel depicts two snapshots of  the JGB yield curve—as of January 2 of this year and as of yesterday  The entire  curve is lower, especially at the long end where thirty-year yields are about 65 basis  points below their levels at the beginning of the year  Finally, neither the Bank of  Japan’s announcement of its equity purchase plan in September nor the Takenaka  Plan has so far inspired confidence among equity investors  The Nikkei index has  traded mostly below 9000 in recent weeks, a level that is thought to be problematic  for portfolios of many banks and insurers  The Bank of Japan began its equity  purchases from banks on November 29; these purchases in the aggregate could be  rather modest at about 2 trillion yen     Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period  I will need a vote   to approve our domestic operations  And I’d be happy to take any questions     I think the lower refinancing risks probably were a factor, but the mortgage   market is rather complicated, and the optionality in mortgages is something that obviously is   hard to predict It’s difficult to disentangle the refinancing aspect of the mortgage market from   the broader trends that were narrowing spreads more generally  "
4874,2003-03-18,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that were  distributed a short time ago  Since your last meeting, markets have been  characterized by a high degree of risk aversion—driven, first, by uncertainty about  the timing and extent of war in Iraq; second, by uncertainty about the underlying  condition of the US and other global economies as growth forecasts were being  trimmed; and third, by data on the real economy that tended to disappoint market  expectations  During most of the intermeeting period, investors favored government  bonds; their yields declined to new lows in many cases, while equities fell sharply  and the dollar depreciated  In the last three or four trading sessions, however, many  of those trends were partially or fully reversed, and the price of oil has declined   Some attribute these recent price moves to investors’ optimism about the outcome of  the war that now seems imminent  Others see the recent price moves as another  variation of uncertainty, only this time the response was to revert to a neutral posture  vis-à-vis their benchmarks       The first page in the materials distributed shows US and euro-area three-month   deposit rates  For most of the intermeeting period three-month cash rates were  relatively stable in the United States, as shown by the solid red line  However, three- month deposit rates three, six, and nine months forward (the dashed red lines) began  to fall in early March, as the gloom deepened and the data deteriorated, especially  after the employment report of March 7  Surprisingly, forward rates snapped back  late last week and the three-month rate nine months forward is back to 15 percent,  near where it traded for most of the period  Part of that reversal may have been due  to technical trading factors, but the revival of equity prices and the growing sense that  your meeting today would not result in a change to the target funds rate also played a  role  European forward rates (the dashed green lines) continued to trade below the  cash rate, suggesting that markets expect further easing from the ECB  Many market  participants had expected a more aggressive 50 basis point cut at the March 6 meeting  of the ECB  The contemporaneous uptick in euro-area forward rates suggests that  those rates often remain influenced by their US counterparts in the short run                                                         1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)      March 18, 2003 3 of 101    In Japan, the announcement of a new governor of the Bank of Japan did not alter  expectations of persisting deflation  With Japanese short rates at zero and the  economic outlook unchanged, the BOJ’s continued infusions of liquidity and a search  for yield by investors have pushed funds out the yield curve  The ten-year Japanese  government bond yield hit a new low of 72 basis points on March 12; that compares  with a yield of 145 percent one year ago  In fact, the entire yield curve has been  pulled down by the weight of the BOJ’s infusions, as shown in the bottom panel   While the BOJ’s so-called nontraditional monetary operations have successfully  brought down the JGB yield curve and corporate spreads apparently have followed,  still the amount of borrowing in the private sector and in the securities market is  limited, and prices on other assets such as equities and property continue to fall      Turning to page 2, another way of looking at monetary conditions in major   economies is depicted there  The five graphs on that page show the main policy rates  (the blue lines) since December of 2002 for the United States, the euro area, the  United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada, along with the two-year swap rate for each  currency (the red lines)  By early March the two-year swap rate was trading below  the short-term policy rate in the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Australia,  suggesting that markets were expecting a weaker outlook and possibly some  monetary ease  In this country, the two-year swap rate fell 83 basis points from  December through early March, tracking the two-year note, which itself hit a record  low of 133 percent on March 10  In all four cases the swap rate moved sharply  higher last week—more than ¼ percentage point—as markets at least temporarily  were willing to consider that the glass was half full  Interestingly, Canada’s pattern  was quite different from the others  In Canada, swap rates began their turnaround at  year-end, and the Bank of Canada tightened policy 25 basis points on March 4       Turning to page 3, the dollar continued to trade with a soggy tone for much of the   intermeeting period  Part of the dollar’s decline was attributed to weaker economic  data, which seem to have had a more pronounced effect on the US currency than  weak data had on either the euro-area or Japanese markets and currencies  The  reason typically cited is the United States’ reliance on imported capital due to the  current account deficit  A second factor mentioned by some was the widening budget  deficit forecast, and a third concern was the financing of the war  Traders recall that  the United States was reimbursed for the vast portion of its expenses in the first Gulf  War, a factor that narrowed the current account deficit at that time and was thought to  have benefited the dollar  A similar benefit is not expected this time around     Notwithstanding this sentiment, the dollar strengthened in the last week along   with most riskier dollar assets  The euro weakened sharply in the past week to about  $106 as we speak, and European equities rallied  Some attributed the euro’s  weakness to technical factors; others cited discord within Europe on both foreign  policy and economic performance issues  Still others pointed to the seemingly  increasing volume of bad news coming from European banking and insurance  businesses To give one example, in recent days there have been calls by prominent   March 18, 2003 4 of 101    Germans for the government to prepare for the possibility of having to take over one  of the large German banks       The yen’s exchange rate has been rather more subdued  The middle panel graphs   the dollar–yen exchange rate and shows (in gray) periods of Japanese intervention   Although claiming to have no exchange rate target, the Japanese monetary authorities  have intervened consistently when the dollar–yen rate has been in the 116 to 118 area   During the intermeeting period, the Japanese bought about $106 billion and  €700 million  That is in addition to the roughly $56 billion they bought in January   So-called repatriation flows, which actually cover a wide variety of book-closing  maneuvers, tend to wear off by mid-March as the necessary transactions are  completed  With the onset of the new fiscal year and a new team installed at the  Bank of Japan, the market will be focusing intently on the policy choices by the  government and central bank officials to revive the economy       Finally, the dollar also has been weak since last December against other   currencies, as shown in the bottom panel, although it has had a bit of a bounce in  recent days against those currencies as well  The British pound has benefited least  from the dollar’s weakness, perhaps in part because of the suspicion that the UK  economy is decelerating  But some observers have suggested that the economy may  experience some negative backwash from the government’s decisions regarding Iraq     Turning to page 4 and moving back to US fixed-income markets, corporate bond   issuance in January and February in both investment-grade and high-yield markets  was fairly strong, in contrast with the lower year-over-year levels we were seeing for  much of 2002  As shown in the top left panel, the investment-grade corporate spread  continued to trade below 175 basis points, which while rather high historically is a  significant improvement from October  Actually, perhaps the news here is that there  was no widening in the spread despite the uptick in supply and the weak equity  market  High-yield and emerging-market spreads also held fairly steady, as shown in  the top right panel, especially among selected emerging-market borrowers such as  Brazil, which has performed well since the election  Market commentary suggests  that, with investors craving higher yields, these asset classes offered a fairly attractive  risk–reward ratio at those spreads over Treasuries       Volatilities in fixed-income markets have remained at somewhat elevated levels, as   shown in the middle panel  This panel graphs the implied volatility on options to enter into a  swap  The purple line graphs the volatility index of options of short-dated swaps, and the  blue line depicts that measure for intermediate-term swaps  These instruments are the  hedging tools of choice among large mortgage investors, and implied volatilities tend to rise  during periods of heightened refinancing activity  In recent weeks, the Mortgage Bankers  Association refi index hit a new high—a level much higher in fact than last autumn’s peak   In that context it’s not surprising that implied volatilities among these instruments are high,  and it may be a surprise that they are not higher still      March 18, 2003 5 of 101    The bottom panel graphs another aspect of the refinancing boom  The blue line is  an estimate of the duration of the mortgages in the mortgage-backed security  universe; the burgundy line is the yield on the ten-year note  These two do tend to  move together since one way for investors to hedge a shortening of portfolio duration  due to a refinancing wave is to buy Treasuries  Conversely, they hedge by selling  Treasuries when rates rise and duration extends  With the significant growth of the  mortgage market, hedging activities among these investors can—and often do—have  an impact on the Treasury market  Now, I should mention that one small aspect of  the recent heavy volume of refinancings is speculation that higher prepayments will  cause a mismatch among some large MBS holders unable to adjust their positions  quickly enough  In particular, some traders apparently thought that Fannie Mae  would report a much higher duration gap, as it did during last autumn’s prepayments  wave, and that this would imply large purchases of Treasuries and still lower interest  rates  In the event, Fannie Mae reported last week that its duration gap for February  had widened by one month, from minus four to minus five months, which was much  lower than the market had expected  And the gap stayed within Fannie’s desired  range of plus six to minus six months  Part of the reversal in the ten-year note last  week was apparently triggered by disappointment that this gap was not wider, which  caused some short covering  On the bright side, some have suggested that, with the  spotlight on GSEs, they are hedging a bit more conservatively to avoid the negative  publicity that Fannie Mae in particular garnered last September and October       Let me turn to page 5 and a quick word on reserves  Several meetings ago I   mentioned that currency growth had slowed unexpectedly in late summer and early  autumn  The Desk responded by ceasing outright operations and shrinking our long- term repo book to $6 billion  As currency growth resumed, in the holiday period we  first increased the long-term repo book, and in the intermeeting period we resumed  our outright purchases for SOMA, as shown in the panel on page 5  During the  intermeeting period we acquired almost $11 billion of securities, or just $1 billion  short of the intermeeting leeway  Looking prospectively, we do not anticipate that  the onset of armed conflict will have any significant effect on the demand for excess  reserves or otherwise upset financing markets  In a review of banks’ behavior during  the 1991 Gulf War, there was no evidence that banks increased their demand for  excess reserves  However, analyzing that period is made more difficult because of  the sharp reduction in reserve requirements that became effective in December 1990,  a few weeks before the war began  Nonetheless, we will be on the lookout for any  signs that shifts in financing patterns or flows across asset markets might be upsetting  normal conditions in financing markets, and we will adjust our operations or  provision of excess reserves accordingly     Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations  I will need a vote to approve   domestic operations, and I’d be happy to answer any questions      That’s a great question  The Committee spoke about the Canadian situation   last time as something of an outlier, and one can see that here as well  I think one way to view   this is that the market probably does consider the prospects for the United States and Canada as   somewhat better than for the euro area and the United Kingdom  The case of Australia is a bit   more interesting  I don’t know to what degree technical factors are involved there  The   Australian economy has performed extremely well, and perhaps the markets are sniffing out a   slowdown that’s not in the forecasts  At least most forecasts that I’ve seen for Australia don’t   show that its situation will become similar to that which the euro area and Japan are in now or   toward which many people think the United Kingdom is heading  So we might be getting an   inkling here that perhaps the market is indeed looking for a better performance prospectively in   the United States as they are for Canada     Yes, I could have used the two-year note, but that creates a different problem   of credit differentials among countries  So, I decided to take the two-year swap rate across all of   March 18, 2003 7 of 101    these countries  But I think we would see the same kind of pattern—although the level would be   different—if we used the two-year note  The numbers would be somewhat lower because of the   differential between the two-year note and the two-year swap rate     Yes, I think that’s a good interpretation, and I believe that’s the analysis that   most in the market have made  Interestingly though, one would have thought, that being the   case, that Freddie would be rewarded with a higher PE in its equities, but one doesn’t see that    One could argue that they are being more prudent and are protecting against risk a little better,   but that is not showing up in the way investors are assessing their equities       It has been faster because Fannie is willing to take more risk, which is your   point about how much insurance a GSE is willing to take out     I think it’s very difficult to parse  If you pushed me, I would probably say   that the market in the last year has become more inclined to think that deflation has become ever   more entrenched  Therefore, market participants tend to feel that the risk of being badly burned   in the near term by buying a ten-year bond is low, which I think is probably a mistake  So I’d   say it’s probably more price expectations than the demand for liquidity, but obviously it’s a very   difficult issue to parse     Yes, that’s an interesting point, and I’ve asked about that  One explanation   I’m hearing is that liquidity is improving, which it probably is  The other one is that we’re not   March 18, 2003 9 of 101    seeing much supply  Japanese corporations are still not borrowing, and investors are starved for   yield  One can buy a lot of government paper at a return of close to zero percent  So if one can   get some ten-year paper with a 2 percent handle, that looks pretty good—the risks   notwithstanding     I don’t know of any  Karen, have you seen anything?     It is interesting in one sense, though, that the curve has been pulled down    Interest rates are lower, and spreads have come in; yet the economy really does not seem to be   able to respond  So it does raise the question of whether a flat yield curve produces better   prospects for the economy  "
4923,2003-05-06,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that were  distributed a short time ago  Since the last Committee meeting, markets have been  characterized by a mixture of uncertainty about—among other things—the outlook  for the economy, residual geopolitical risks, and SARS  Simultaneously, the degree  of risk aversion decreased and spreads narrowed, volatilities declined or stayed at low  levels, equities rallied in most markets, and a consistent theme among investors was  the search for yield       The top panel on the first page graphs the US dollar three-month Libor deposit   rate in black and the three-month deposit rate three, six, and nine months forward in  the dashed red lines  Since your last meeting, forward rates have traded in fairly  narrow ranges, as markets were pushed and pulled with conflicting news—the mostly  weak economic data and a corporate earnings season that, while unspectacular, did  not come close to many of the most dire expectations in the markets  Forward curves  and futures prices are still pricing in another ease in policy at some point, though  those same curves suggest that a tightening cycle will follow shortly thereafter  Of  course, this pattern of expecting lower rates to be followed by higher rates some  months later has persisted for quite some time now     As shown in the middle two panels, two- and ten-year Treasury yields also have   moved in a fairly narrow range  One factor that did not seem to affect prices and  yields was last week’s record refunding announcement  The Treasury will auction  $58 billion of three-, five-, and ten-year notes in the next few days, with almost all of  that bringing in new cash  Further, all forecasts of future deficits continue to rise   While analysts have commented about the risks that the increased supply poses, those  worries have not yet shown through to yields, though perhaps they will in time as the  competition for funds increases Two possible reasons for the lack of reaction were  cited  First, worries about future supply are already reflected at the long end of the  curve and hence partly explain the steepness of the curve; and second the decrease in  recent quarters in private-sector issuance is allowing the Treasury to borrow what it  needs without bidding up rates                                                         1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to the transcript (appendix 1)   May 6, 2003 3 of 115    The bottom panel graphs the investment-grade spread, which has continued to  fall  If one excludes some very large issuers such as auto companies that have special  stories surrounding them, the remainder of the index is trading near spring 1998  levels  Swap spreads, in fact, are already back to those levels  Part of this narrowing  probably is a correction from what are now viewed to have been extreme levels in the  autumn of 2002, when corporate governance scares were peaking  Part of the  narrowing is simply due to supply and demand  Inflows continue to come into bond  funds and need to be invested       On the supply side, although issuance did tick up in late January and February, it   fell again as the war approached, and it has stayed low since then  Dealers note that  corporations are using free cash flow and what little corporate issuance there has been  to repay debt and de-lever their balance sheets  This helps to explain the credit  quality improvement, though it also implies that less is going into investment than  would normally be the case       Meanwhile on the demand side, investors have pushed out the maturity and credit   risk curves in the search for higher yields  The bottom right panel graphs the  narrowing of high-yield and emerging-market spreads  Funds specializing in both  asset classes have had inflows, and with only a limited supply coming to the market,  the competition has been intense and spreads have narrowed sharply  Just to take one  example, Brazil issued a $1 billion five-year global bond that was six times  oversubscribed  A week ago the bond was issued to yield 107 percent, and it has  rallied in the week since then  It now yields 98 percent  The issue also included a  collective action clause, which did not appear to affect demand  The Brazilian real,  Mexican peso, and South African rand were among the currencies that benefited from  investors’ search for higher yielding currencies and asset markets     Consistent with the narrowing of spreads and less risk aversion in recent weeks,   implied volatilities have decreased or stayed at relatively low levels  Page 2 graphs  long-term implied volatilities on the S&P 100, the two main exchange rate pairs, and  the ten-year Treasury futures since January 2000  The better performance of US  equity markets in recent weeks—the S&P 500, for example, is up 15 percent—has  coincided with the fall in implied vols  As shown in the top panel, which depicts the  S&P 100 volatility index, that measure of equity volatility is back to below the  25 percent level for the first time since corporate governance worries heightened after  the WorldCom collapse  Currency volatilities continued to trade in well-worn ranges,  near the 10 percent level that has prevailed for some time  These volatility levels  have been maintained both during the appreciation of the dollar in the beginning of  the period and during the more recent period of dollar depreciation The implied  volatilities in the ten-year Treasury futures contract have continued to ebb in recent  weeks to levels observed in the first half of 2001  Part of that recent falloff in  volatility may also be due to the decline in the Mortgage Bankers Association’s  Refinancing Index, as prepayments have slowed  That also may have lessened the  demand for hedging by mortgage investors and corporate treasurers       May 6, 2003 4 of 115    Turning to Europe, the top panel on page 3 graphs the Libor fixing for euro three- month deposits in black and the implied rates three, six, and nine months forward in  green  The forward rates continue to trade below the cash rate and market  participants expect further easing from the ECB, as forecasts for European growth are  still being trimmed  In the middle panel, credit spreads in the euro area continue to  narrow as well  In particular, the lower end of the investment-grade universe has  outperformed the rest  But unlike the case in the United States, issuance actually  picked up early this year, as shown in the chart at the bottom left, so supply there is  holding up  One possibility is that European companies are now going through some  of the same dynamics that US companies went through in 2001 and 2002, when they  issued debt heavily in order to refinance and restructure debt and to extend the term  of maturing commercial paper     In the foreign exchange markets, the euro has continued to rise past 112 and is   now at the 113 level against the dollar—its strongest level since February 1999,  which was roughly six weeks after the euro’s launch  Investors shifting assets into  the euro area reportedly include central banks, Japanese insurance and pension  companies, and European institutional investors who have preferred to keep funds at  home rather than move them overseas  Although we don’t think of the euro as a  high-yielding currency per se, both short- and long-term rates are meaningfully higher  than those for the two G-3 counterpart currencies       Turning to page 4, Japanese markets show no signs that the deflationary pressures   in that country are abating The banking situation continues to post challenges for  Japanese policymakers, and the recent declines in Japanese stocks have accentuated  those worries  The Nikkei stock index fell below 8,000 during the intermeeting  period for the first time since 1983  This has again raised talk in Japanese policy  circles about measures such as so-called price-keeping operations to stem the declines  in equity prices and hence conserve capital resources of the banks and insurers   Unlike most other major equity markets, the Nikkei did not rally in mid-March  That  divergence from other equity markets is depicted in the top panel  The S&P and  DAX, to take just two examples, came off their lows rather sharply, whereas the  Nikkei continued its steady decline toward and then below the 8,000 level  Today it  is just above that level  The Japanese bond markets also have been gloomy, as shown  in the middle panel The ten-year yield is trading at about 61 or 62 basis points, and  the yield on the twenty-year bond is at 94 basis points  Among benchmark issues,  only the thirty-year yield, trading at 106 percent, has a positive integer before the  decimal point, though not by very much      The BOJ’s policy stance has pushed investors out on the yield curve and to some   degree into private-sector and foreign assets  The right middle panel shows the recent  narrowing of private-sector spreads in Japan, which is not unlike the patterns  observed in dollar and euro area fixed income markets  But let me note three points  of caution  First, as we know, companies in Japan rely more on bank financing; bond  market issuance is low compared with both their US and European counterparts   Second, the data are poor  But net new issuance is probably flat or perhaps even   May 6, 2003 5 of 115    negative in the lower-rated segments, which would help to explain some of the spread  compression  Third, spreads widened substantially in late 2001 when some fund  managers were faced with large losses, and the ensuing liquidation widened  spreads—especially for lower-rated paper  Those spreads are only now reverting to  the levels we saw in the summer of 2001     The noisy chart at the bottom left graphs the TOPIX bank sub-index and the share   prices of the four major Japanese banks, all of which are down substantially as the  prospect for improvement in their business recedes  Mizuho, for example, reported a  $19 billion loss a week ago  Ironically, the spreads on Japanese bank debt have  nevertheless narrowed during 2003  The bottom right panel graphs the spread for  each of the four major banks between their five-year senior debt and the five-year  JGB yield  I would make two points  First, all the spreads have narrowed and are  converging, suggesting little in the way of differentiation among the banks—or at  least less than had been the case some months ago  Second, these spreads obviously  represent very low absolute yields  With the five-year JGB yield itself at 21 basis  points today, a spread of 10 basis points on Sumitomo’s debt, for example, means that  the bank is able to sell five-year debt at 31 basis points       Moving to the next page, one of the stars in the currency market has been the   Canadian dollar  In recent trading sessions the Canadian dollar has risen above  70 cents and is now trading at its strongest level since 1997  Among the reasons for  the Canadian dollar’s performance are Canada’s strong economic performance,  higher yields, less overcapacity in Canadian industry, a large energy sector at a time  when prices have generally been high, and the Bank of Canada’s move to tighten  monetary policy  Canadian ten-year yields are about 1 percentage point higher than  those on comparable US instruments; and at the short end, Canadian interest rates  are about 2 percentage points higher  The divergence in policy has also had a  different effect on the yield curve  The middle panel graphs the two-to-ten-year US  Treasury curve in blue and the comparable data for Canada in red  While the US  curve has been steep at between 220 to 240 basis points all year, the Canadian curve  has actually flattened by about 60 basis points and is currently only half as steep as  the US curve  The World Health Organization’s decision to issue a travel advisory  for Toronto had periodic but only transient effects on Canadian markets     The Hong Kong and Chinese markets, on the other hand, had at times a more   pronounced reaction to SARS-related news but perhaps less than one might have  expected given the sheer volume of coverage the story received  At the bottom left in  blue is a graph of the Hong Kong dollar, which is fixed at 78 to the dollar The one- year forward rate moved upward in mid- to late April to 783 but since then has eased  back somewhat  At the bottom right, China’s spot exchange rate is depicted in blue  and the implied one-year renminbi nondeliverable forward rate in red  The discount  on the renminbi has narrowed somewhat, but all in all the reaction was fairly modest   Equities in both Hong Kong and China, however, did fall, although again perhaps not  as dramatically as one might have expected       May 6, 2003 6 of 115    Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in the intermeeting period  I will  need a vote on domestic operations  And I’d be happy to answer any questions           I’m not an expert in that particular area  Certainly some of the stigma   associated with the CAC will be taken away  One of the concerns that officials had worried   about was that there would be some stigma associated with being first off the block with a CAC    With Mexico and Brazil having moved to include CACs, there may be less of a stigma so it may   be easier to get them in  But I wouldn’t want to make a forecast that they will become a routine   part of such contracts     I believe so, yes     That’s true, yes     Yes, I think for us it was a question of data that were available on short   notice  But I think you’re right that that would be a better way of presenting it    Yes  It’s May, which means that it’s time to take up the renewal of those   swaps  They expire in mid-December; but because of the six-month notice that would have to be   given if the Committee chose not to renew them, this is the proper meeting to vote on renewal  I   sent out a short memo on this last week, and my recommendation is that the Committee renew   the NAFA swap lines with Mexico and Canada  "
4976,2003-08-12,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that were  just circulated  Fixed-income markets in the intermeeting period were characterized  by a high degree of volatility, as market participants readjusted their expectations for  the future path of monetary policy in response to the Committee’s June 25 statement,  comments from various Committee members emphasizing near-term growth  prospects, the generally positive economic data, and a relatively strong corporate  earnings season       The top panel on the first page graphs the US three-month deposit rate in black   and the three-month deposit rates three, six, and nine months forward in the dashed  red lines  In the weeks before the June meeting, rates were trending down, as further  easing by the Committee was anticipated in light of the various comments by Fed  officials about the risk of deflation and the need to take aggressive measures to  counteract it  The 25 basis point easing move at the June meeting—less than the  50 basis point cut many had expected—combined with language that suggested a  better outlook for the economy, led markets to re-price short-term interest products   Many concluded that the easing cycle was perhaps finished and that there was only a  small probability that the Fed would take so-called unconventional monetary policy                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   August 12, 2003 3 of 110    actions  That move toward higher expected interest rates accelerated on July 31 with  the release of the second-quarter GDP data, which came in higher than expected, and  the continuing strength in some of the manufacturing and service sector surveys     Treasury yields had declined sharply in May and into early June, based on the   same set of expectations  Market participants expressed their views by putting on  carry trades along the Treasury yield curve as well as in other sectors such as swaps,  agencies, and mortgages  As these expectations were revised, the liquidation of  positions—aided by some very strong technical factors that I’ll get to in a second— accelerated, and yields rose along the curve  The two-year note traded to an intraday  high of 193 percent on August 1, creating an unusually wide spread between its yield  and the funds rate, especially taking into account the various statements by  Committee members that the funds rate was likely to stay low for a long time  The  two-year note yield subsequently eased back a little to 1¾ percent  Similarly, the  yield on the ten-year note moved to an intraday high of more than 4½ percent from  about 31 percent or so  The bottom chart graphs the “breakeven” rate on ten-year  TIPS since January 2000, calculated by subtracting the TIPS yield from the nominal  yield  The breakeven rate has traversed a well-worn range of between 125 and 225  basis points  I would make two points  First, despite the market’s apparent fixation  on deflation during the last few weeks and months, the breakeven rate drifted down  only slightly and did not get far below 175 basis points before reversing recently   Second, the recent rise in nominal rates has been mostly an increase in real rates,  which could be seen as consistent with expectations for an improved macroeconomic  environment       Still, the question remains What were the factors that led to the sharp selloff in   fixed-income markets?  While incorrect expectations for policy played a role, at least  as large a role was probably played by the dynamics of the mortgage-backed  securities market  Unlike earlier cycles, the mortgage market is now larger than the  Treasury market  Anecdotal reports indicate that a large percentage of MBS holdings  are actively hedged by fund managers, all of whom are using fairly similar models       The top left panel on page 2 graphs the distribution of MBS coupons as of   December 31, 2002  The largest concentration of coupons was at 6½ percent  The  shaded area to the right represents a very rough estimate of the portion of the  distribution of mortgages that were candidates for refinancing based on December’s  average mortgage rate of 605 percent  In short, the shaded area represents the  portion in which the homeowner’s option to prepay is in the money  These estimates  are crude and require the usual health warnings, but the trends are interesting and  revealing nonetheless  The top right panel depicts the comparable distribution as of  May 31, 2003  By then the thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage had come down to about  5½ percent and was still falling as we were heading into June  Nearly the entire  distribution was in the money  However, with the backup in yields, mortgage rates  rose even faster than other rates  By late July, the thirty-year fixed rate was reported  by Freddie Mac in its survey to be at 614 percent  The most recent distribution of the  coupons, which is as of June 30, gives a picture of the degree to which mortgages   August 12, 2003 4 of 110    went from being in the money to being out of the money  Adding up the three bars in  the unshaded area of the middle left panel indicates that a total of about $1 trillion of  mortgages was suddenly out of the money       Now, as rates were falling, fund managers were buying Treasuries as fast as   possible to hedge against a shortening of duration caused by prepayments  Once rates  began to back up, the risk was an extension of the portfolio  At that point the model  suggested selling Treasuries to keep duration from increasing  Since the structural  position of the mortgage market is well known, some speculators were no doubt  front-running those flows and adding to the liquidity demands  The middle right  panel graphs an estimate of the duration of the universe of fixed-rate mortgage- backed securities  In a span of about five weeks, that duration increased from about  one-half year to more than three years  The increase was the largest ever seen over  such a short period of time  The bottom panel on page 2 attempts to quantify the  hedging needs generated by the backup in yields  Each bar represents the estimated  purchase or sale of ten-year Treasury equivalents for each half-month period since the  beginning of the year  The red line is the ten-year Treasury yield  As with most  estimates, these figures are to be treated gingerly  The calculations assume that the  entire MBS universe is actively hedged  That is not the case  But even if only half is  managed in this way, the numbers are still very large  On the other hand, this graph  does not include whole loans held by banks, thrifts, and the GSEs, some of which we  know are managed actively  Nor does it include the activities of the mortgage  servicers      As the hedging in the mortgage-backed market reached something of a climax in   late July, the activities of MBS investors increasingly pressured the swap market,  which is the other major hedging vehicle for mortgage investors  The top panel of  page 3 graphs the ten-year swap spread, which jumped more than 30 basis points in  late July  Scattered reports of spotty liquidity circulated during this period  But for  dealers and some investors the important point is not necessarily the level of the swap  spread itself but the rate of change, since risk-management models make assumptions  about the speed with which positions can be hedged     The middle panel shows the standard deviation of the twenty-day change of the   swap spread going back to 1993  Typically this measure of volatility was very small,  less than 1 basis point, until 1998 when it suddenly spiked to about 4 basis points in  the aftermath of the Russian default  In recent years, swap spreads have become  somewhat less volatile as the spread narrowed  In July the volatility shot up again to  a level comparable to or higher than that seen in 1998 and mid-2000  Occasional  rumors circulated again about some bad positions and some losses in the dealer  community, and liquidity was reported to have decreased as demand for fixed payer  swaps rose  Nevertheless, the markets generally worked well  And as shown in the  top panel, the spread itself has dropped more than 20 basis points from its peak   Mortgage and agency spreads also widened suddenly in late June and July  That is  not surprising given the shifts in the mortgage market and, in the case of GSEs, the  entity-specific news that buffeted them  On the other hand, the corporate market and,   August 12, 2003 5 of 110    for that matter, the equity markets were not noticeably affected  The bottom panel  graphs the investment-grade corporate spread year-to-date  Although it has ticked up  in recent days, it moved slightly lower over the intermeeting period and is  substantially down from January 1  The high-yield and EMBI spreads in the bottom  right panel show broadly similar—and benign—patterns  US equity markets on  balance are slightly higher and traded in a narrow range over the period       Turning to page 4, the reversal in our bond markets is not isolated  This page   graphs the ten-year yield since April 15 for the United States, Germany, Canada,  Sweden, Australia, Japan, and Mexico  All of these sovereign yields reached their  lows in mid-June and then rose together  While part of the explanation may be that  the economies are more interrelated, the more convincing explanation may be that  bond markets are more interrelated and are especially sensitive to US yields  I have  just two minor points to add  First, the ten-year yield is now higher than that of the  German Bund for the first time since May 2002  Second, the more than doubling of  the ten-year JGB yield—from about 43 basis points to about 110 basis points at the  peak—created much discussion about the losses on the books of Japanese banks  But  it was little more than discussion, in part because the rally in the NIKKEI, it was  argued, offset some or all of those losses  More recently, ten-year yields in Japan  have retreated to about 89 basis points     The top panel on the next page graphs the euro-denominated three-month cash   deposit rate and the rate three, six, and nine months forward since mid-April  With  weak sentiment and downbeat data, the market expected that the ECB would ease  policy, which it did on June 6, cutting rates by 25 basis points  That is not marked on  this graph, I should point out  The forward rates suggest that the market expected  further easing, though less, through much of July  However, as the global bond  market selloff accelerated, euro area forward rates trended higher and spiked on July  31 after the US GDP report  The nine-month forward rate has eased off a bit since   The dollar has risen modestly against most currencies since June, consistent with the  higher yields and the more upbeat view of the economic outlook  The dollar–yen  exchange rate, shown in the middle right panel, continued to trade in the 117 to  120 range that it has been trapped in all year  The Ministry of Finance (MOF)  continued to intervene, buying $19 billion in the period and raising its total  intervention for the year to $75½ billion  In general, the yen has been depreciating or  stable against most currencies  The bottom panel graphs the Australian dollar, the  Canadian dollar, the euro, the pound sterling, and the US dollar against the yen since  January 1  The first three currencies have risen against the yen while sterling and the  US dollar have moved little  The US dollar–yen relationship looks rather like a  straight line since January 1 but perhaps mostly because of the frequent intervention  by the MOF  The days Japan intervened in dollars are marked with small boxes on  the red line      Turning to page 6, let me say a word on reserves  The Desk has faced an   unexpected decline in the growth of currency, as shown in the top panel on the page   That slowdown is due mostly to reflows from overseas for reasons that are not fully   August 12, 2003 6 of 110    clear  Regardless of the reasons, the slowdown and the resulting overall pattern in  autonomous factors have led us to shrink the System Open Market Account (SOMA)  slightly by reducing our holdings of long-term RPs and essentially ceasing outright  purchases for the time being  This is the second instance in the past year when we  have had to contend with an unexpected need to temporarily contract SOMA  We  have used the flexibility inherent in the long-term RP book to do that  But we have  found that a book of RPs with a maturity of twenty-eight days at times does not give  us enough flexibility to adjust the balance sheet on very short notice  So in order to  give us more flexibility, I plan to shift the long-term RP book from a typical maturity  of twenty-eight days to fourteen days at our regular Thursday operations  The change  is purely a technical measure and does not require a change in the authorization, but I  did want to advise the Committee before we implement the change  We plan to  announce this modification to the primary dealers later this month and manage the  shift in late September  Again, the main benefit of this change would be to provide  the Desk with greater flexibility in addressing the demand for banking system  reserves over the two-week length of the maintenance period  We will, however,  continue to arrange operations with an original maturity of up to a maximum of sixty- five business days when reserve needs are expected to persist for relatively longer  periods of time  That is often the case around the year-end, for example, when the  total volume of temporary operations typically peaks in response to seasonal growth  in currency     Mr Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations  I will need approval   of the domestic operations  If possible, after I take any questions on my regular  report, I would like to make a few comments about Ginnie Maes       It’s basically everywhere  It occurred in all regions, I believe, except   Africa—and Iraq, as President Parry reminds me  There are reflows of currency from Latin   America, eastern Europe, and all of the other major regions       I wish I could  I don’t know if Mr Reinhart has any insight, but it’s a bit of a   mystery   August 12, 2003 7 of 110      It’s everywhere     I have not seen any data on that  I don’t believe that the ECB makes those   data available if they have them  Obviously, the euro is becoming used more actively  Some   countries in eastern Europe have currency boards, but I don’t know that that would explain the   shift in the reflow of US currency  I don’t believe the size of those countries, which is fairly   modest, would be large enough to explain what we’ve seen       Well, in this case the first thing we need to do is to respond appropriately in   terms of our balance sheet management  Then, I agree with you, the next order is that we need to   understand it a little better     I agree  I presented the picture in this way for simplicity because of the   difficulty of making that kind of calculation—locking in the closing date and the like—which is   what one would really need to do to calculate this with precision  I was not trying to be   absolutely precise but to give a sense of scale in terms of how these mortgages can move in very   large sizes into and out of the pool of candidates for refinancing, if you will       The volume of aggregate fails has been very large  It actually has been larger   in the aggregate than what we saw in the aftermath of September 11  The biggest component of   the fails has been in the current on-the-run ten-year note  The precise cause is difficult to pin   down  Certainly there seems to be a large short base in that issue in particular—and in some   others as well—which is creating a demand for that specific security, and the size of that issue is   modest That’s one point I would make  The second thing I would say is that there are no   concentrated positions, so we can’t point to one or two dealers that seem to be boxing this  The   third point is that the fails have not affected the cash market  That is, even though the back   office hasn’t been settling these trades the way they would be settled normally, that has not   affected yields or how the traders are looking at the marketplace  What I’m trying to say is that   so far it has been a back office event; it has not migrated from the back office to the front office   Let me mention two other things  First, the FICC, the former GSCC, did attempt to do a   netting among its members to try to clear this up  But because that group doesn’t include   nonmembers, the problem basically reappeared immediately  So that did not work  The hope is   that with the new ten-year note that was auctioned last week, which also will be reopened in a   month, there will be enough supply to clear this up  We’ll see  That may be more information   than you asked for!  Sorry     They’ve been functioning fine  I think the situation has created concern   among some of the dealers that as these fails age, higher capital requirements will kick in under   the SEC’s rules  So there’s been an effort to get some regulatory relief, if you will, on that side     I would agree with your opening statement that it’s impossible to answer that   with any precision  It’s very hard to assign percentages to the causes  In my own mind, the   dynamics in the mortgage market clearly were a very important factor  Anecdotally, dealers do   suggest that some of them in fact believed that so-called unconventional monetary policy actions   might well be implemented around the middle of this year  Exactly who believed what and the   responses that those beliefs triggered is hard—     Well, there was something already there  But it’s interesting to look at the   chart on the breakeven rate on page 1, which I like a lot, in part because it suggests that, at least   in this segment of the market, people were not really buying the deflation story  So, yes, there   were some disconnects here, and it’s hard to put all the pieces together in a tidy story     Yes, let me say a quick word on that  The Committee will remember that last   November you directed the staff to come up with a proposal about how we might incorporate   Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities into the System Open Market Account  This was part of   the alternative assets work that we began some time ago  We’ve essentially completed that   work, and we’ve learned a lot from the process  Initially I had intended to bring this issue to the   Committee either at the June meeting or at this meeting, but other topics took precedence    Currently, with the market’s rather intense focus on unconventional monetary policy measures   and also the recent volatility in the MBS market, there is the strong possibility that any decisions   the Committee might make in this area would be misinterpreted  In addition, given the fiscal   situation and the slowdown in currency growth, there really is no immediate pressure to add to   SOMA’s list of available assets to purchase  So after some consultation with Vincent and in turn   with the Chairman, the suggestion was made to defer consideration of this topic until early next   year when the environment might be more conducive  So that’s the suggestion that I come to   you with today   August 12, 2003 12 of 110   "
4977,2003-08-12,"  If I could, I think one of the issues here was the wording of the question used   to ask the dealers about their assessment of the likely balance of risks statement  We found that   we had to go back to some of the dealers, in some cases more than once, to get clarity because   they did not—     That’s the way that some dealers interpreted it, yes       Again, the question may have been posed slightly differently, and there may   have been different follow-ups   "
5056,2003-09-16,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that are on  the table in front of you  During the intermeeting period, fixed income and equity  prices were first driven by growing expectations of a strong pickup in the global  economy in the second half of 2003 and into 2004  Global yields and equity prices  both rose during August  Those expectations have been tempered somewhat in recent  days because of some disappointing data in the United States and as questions about  the sustainability of the recovery became more widespread     The top panel on page 1 graphs the US three-month cash deposit rate in black   and the three-month deposit rate three, six, and nine months forward in the dashed red  lines  The three-month deposit rate nine months hence continued to rise in the  intermeeting period to nearly 2 percent after the ISM report on September 2  The  wide gap between that rate and the cash rate was consistent with expectations in the  futures markets at that time suggesting a tightening of policy by next spring   However, after comments by Governor Bernanke and other Committee members on  September 4 and the weaker-than-expected employment report on September 5,  forward rates fell sharply, and adjusting for term premiums, that took out most of the                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   September 16, 2003 9 of 106    expected tightening that had earlier been priced into the forward curve  In a similar  pattern, Treasury yields initially rose after your August 12 meeting, despite the  Committee’s announcement that policy would likely stay accommodative for “a  considerable period”  The two-year note yields, shown in the middle left panel,  pierced 2 percent in early September  Around that time, some market commentary  briefly raised concerns about nascent inflationary pressures, but those concerns  proved to be short-lived, and the two-year note yield fell sharply after the  employment report  This morning it was trading at about 16 percent  The ten-year  yield traded around the pivot point of 4½ percent for most of the period before  declining to a range around 4¼ percent  The strong technical factors that had  accelerated the upward move in yields, especially the hedging of mortgage securities,  ran their course, and trading conditions were somewhat less volatile in recent weeks     A separate issue that could affect Treasury yields prospectively is supply  With   the deteriorating fiscal situation, the Treasury has had to increase the frequency and  size of auctions to finance the growing deficit  This could become the subject of  increased market focus, especially if it should be coupled with a weaker dollar   Finally, the bottom panel on page 1 depicts the breakeven inflation rate, calculated by  subtracting inflation indexed yields from nominal yields  The red line graphs the ten- year breakeven rate and the blue line the five-year rate  Both have stabilized in the  2 to 2½ percent range after rising earlier this summer       For the euro area, the top panel on page 2 graphs the three-month deposit rate in   black and the three-, six-, and nine-month forward rates in the dashed green lines   With the more upbeat sentiment about the economic outlook in the United States  early in the period, the nine-month forward rate rose in much the same pattern as its  US counterpart  Like the US nine-month forward rate, it fell back in the past two  weeks, typically responding more to US data and suggesting that market participants  still view a US recovery as key to better European performance  Long-term bond  yields also reflected this improved sentiment about the global outlook The middle  panel graphs the ten-year yield of UK gilts and yields on ten-year securities of the  four major euro-area governments  All had risen sharply since their June lows before  edging down in recent days—again as questions about the sustainability of the  recovery emerged  Finally, the bottom panel graphs a sample of both developed and  emerging country equity markets since May 1  All have appreciated sharply,  especially markets, such as those in Korea and Taiwan, that are perceived to be more  leveraged to the global economy  Whereas changes in global bond yields seem to  reflect a reappraisal of the intermediate outlook, equity markets have continued to rise  and, therefore, are perhaps more vulnerable should disappointing news arise       Interestingly, among developed markets, the strongest equity market in recent   months has been Japan’s  As shown in the top panel of page 3, the Nikkei and  TOPIX indexes have risen about 30 percent since May  Overnight the Nikkei rose  more than 1½ percent  The bank sub-index has risen even more, as perceptions about  the global recovery grew and the bailout of Resona Bank earlier this year removed  what had been very negative sentiment toward the financial sector  That rally   September 16, 2003 10 of 106    continued overnight, and bank stocks rose another 8 percent  With Japan reporting  somewhat better economic data in recent weeks and months, the JGB market—which  even by Japanese standards had reached extremely low yields in mid-June—began to  be repriced to reflect that stronger growth  By August some market participants even  began to talk about the Bank of Japan (BOJ) moving away from its zero interest rate  policy at some point next year  The middle panel graphs two snapshots of the yield  curve—as of June 12 and September 12  The entire curve moved sharply higher and  steepened in that three-month span  With yields rising that quickly, the BOJ moved  in recent weeks to calm the markets in two ways  First, in late August, the BOJ  conducted two operations involving long-term repos with maturities of nine months  in an effort to signal that the market was getting ahead of itself  Both operations were  conducted at 45 basis points  Second, Governor Fukui on September 3 offered  reassuring words that the policy stance would be maintained and that in his view  long-term yields had risen too far too fast  As shown in the bottom left panel, the  Bank of Japan’s current account balances remained at the upper end of its target range  of 27 trillion to 30 trillion yen, well above requirements of about 6 trillion yen  In  recent days, Japanese money markets have stabilized somewhat  However, the steps  taken by the BOJ may have established a new minimum benchmark that the market  will expect the next time the BOJ’s commitment is tested  That may have raised the  hurdle for an exit strategy whenever that point may come       There is little new to report regarding the yen’s movements against the dollar in   exchange markets  The rate continues to be trapped between 119 and 116   Commercial and speculative flows again have tended to place upward pressure on the  yen  However, continuing to counteract those pressures was aggressive intervention  by the Ministry of Finance  Since late August— and including the activity  overnight—the Japanese authorities have purchased about $41½ billion in the  intermeeting period, most of it in September  That has raised their total intervention  for the calendar year to date to $1137 billion  Having established a firm line in the  sand at about 115 to 117 yen, the Ministry of Finance has its own exit strategy to  consider  Various analysts expect the pace of intervention to be maintained until the  upcoming LDP elections and possibly even until the general elections that are  expected to follow later this fall       Turning to page 4, the Treasury and mortgage markets have been grappling with   the problem of chronic settlement fails, a subject you’ve heard about in recent weeks   Let me spend a few minutes on this issue  As a starting point, fails are a routine  feature of the landscape and are usually caused by miscommunications about the  details of a trade in the confirmation and settlement process  Typically a fail to  deliver is cured after a day or two  The party that has been failed to has use of its  cash an extra day  A fail that lasts longer than a few days can lead to credit exposures  if the price of the security has moved in the interim  For that reason, the SEC applies  capital charges to aged fails  Elevated and chronic fails have the potential to diminish  liquidity in the market if market participants step back from trading because of  uncertainties about settlement, concerns about credit exposures, or concerns about the  capital that they may need to allocate for aged fails  The top panel on the page graphs   September 16, 2003 11 of 106    aggregate fails in Treasuries and Treasuries only for trades cleared through the Fixed  Income Clearing Corporation, or FICC  Many of you will know that organization by  its predecessor name, the GSCC  Although the level of fails varies, it was relatively  low until May That level rose sharply as the short base grew—particularly in the ten- year on-the-run—given the backup in yields and the demands to hedge other  instruments with the ten-year Treasury  Typically, dealers will short Treasuries and  deliver by borrowing that security from custodians and other securities lenders,  including the Federal Reserve  Fails have been most concentrated in the ten-year note  maturing in May 2013, as shown by the red bar in the top panel  That security  continues to trade consistently at the fails rate in the specials market  Chronic fails in  that ten-year issue reflect a sizable short base that has accumulated during its on-the- run life  The persistence of fails reflects, in part, the minimal cost of failure in the  current interest rate environment and the correspondingly low incentives for holders  of that security to make their supply available for lending  Although this situation has  created disruptions in the back office, to date there has been no spillover that we can  see into the front office  Recent weeks have witnessed reductions in fails in the  aggregate and in the May ten-year issue  The trend is in the right direction but fails  volumes remain high by historical standards and continue to be a matter of  considerable market attention  The tightness across the specials market has resulted  in a noticeable increase in borrowing from the SOMA securities lending program, as  can be seen in the bottom panel  Unfortunately, SOMA’s holdings of the May ten- year note in particular are meager, at only $251 million, preventing the program from  providing the relief that it might if our holdings were more sizable       Let me turn briefly to the functioning of the fed funds market during the blackout   in the Northeast on August 14 and 15  All in all, the fed funds market continued to  function reasonably well for clearing purposes, but disruptions to payment flows  caused by wire transfer problems at individual institutions were a source of some  dislocation, primarily among foreign institutions  The top panel on page 5 graphs  total Fed balances  As shown by the top red bar, on August 14 there was some  borrowing at the discount window, mostly by one foreign institution that was short at  the close of the wire  On Friday August 15 the Desk did a large $20 billion RP and  provided a very high level of excess reserves  But these reserves had a surprisingly  limited effect on reducing rate pressures in the funds market—again, as it turns out,  primarily because of a few foreign banks that were experiencing systems problems  that prevented them from making payments  This can be seen in the shaded inset of  the top panel, which shows the distribution of end-of-day Fed balances between  foreign banks in red and all depository institutions in blue  Typically foreign banks  have virtually no balances, given that the vast portion of their liabilities is  nonreservable  On August 15, however, foreign banks as a group ended up with  $177 billion in Fed balances  More than $15 billion of that was held by just two  moderately sized foreign branches that were not able to make payments until late in  the day, or not at all, and hence they absorbed much of the liquidity that the Desk  injected that day  With that background, it is not surprising that the funds market on  Friday was elevated, but rates never exceeded the primary credit rate that day despite  all of these problems  Two institutions did borrow funds in the market at rates above   September 16, 2003 12 of 106    the primary credit rate on Thursday  They paid about 2½ percent for a total of $14  billion  One was a foreign institution that did not have collateral eligible for  borrowing at the discount window; the other was a domestic institution that we heard  did not want to borrow from the window  Perhaps more significant for evaluating the  effectiveness of the new primary credit facility, however, over $7 billion was traded  in the funds market at 2 percent on Thursday, indicating that the primary credit  facility was acting as a ceiling for most institutions      Finally, let me go back to a subject we looked at last time—currency growth—on   which several Committee members had questions at the August meeting  The bottom  panel updates the same chart shown last month and, as indicated, currency growth  slowed sharply and suddenly this summer  It has shown a bit of a rebound lately,  however  I should note that the last bar for August—estimated on the chart—has  been finalized, and in that month currency actually grew at a 56 percent rate  Getting  back to the reasons for the dramatic downward shift in currency growth, it was  depressed in June and July because of exceptionally high foreign reflows on top of  weak domestic demand  Foreign reflows have been fairly persistent for many months  now from Latin American countries, acting as a partial offset to domestic demand   But this was compounded by large reflows from the Middle East despite the currency  shipments to Iraq following the end of the major combat operations there in April   Again, that source of reflow has abated  In addition, our contacts among note dealers  in Europe suggest that consumers in some countries—Russia, in particular—are more  willing to hold domestic currency notes  As I mentioned a little while ago, domestic  demand has shown a pickup in August from its recent sluggish pace and seems to  have coincided with some signs of strength in consumer spending  As a result of the  pickup in currency growth, we have returned to the market, purchasing securities on  an outright basis recently for the first time since mid-May      Mr Chairman, in this period once again there were no foreign operations  In fact,   this coming Monday, September 22, will mark exactly three years since the last US  intervention in foreign exchange markets and will extend what is already for this  country the longest period of non-intervention in the floating rate era  I will need a  vote to approve the Desk’s domestic operations, and I’d be happy to take any  questions       I don’t know that I can give you a single answer  In part it may be that the   general economic performance of the United Kingdom has been better, so real yields are higher    Another possibility is that because there seems to be a 25 to 35 basis point difference—       Yes, and the fact that the United Kingdom has a 2½ percent inflation target   whereas the ECB has a target of 2 percent or less may also account for the difference in yields      I’m offering various explanations; you may think of them as a menu from   which you can pick the ones you like       I’m happy to have assistance where I can get it!     I’m pretty comfortable with the way it worked  I’m comfortable given that   on Thursday—and for that matter on Friday—we didn’t have a spike beyond 2 percent for the   September 16, 2003 14 of 106    most part, again except in the limited instances I cited  And we had a lot of trades that took place   at 2 percent or just below 2 percent, so the primary credit rate did seem to act as a ceiling    Obviously, for whatever idiosyncratic reasons, some individual institutions may have decided   either that they couldn’t or didn’t want to come to the window  But that’s just one of those data   points that we may have to live with  On the whole, I think the discount facility did its job in   capping the funds rate  Over time, as institutions get used to the new facility, we hope that the   residual stigma on borrowing will fade even more  "
5113,2003-10-28,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that were  circulated a short while ago  During the first part of the intermeeting period, market  participants looked at incoming data and concluded that the glass was half empty   Then for most of October, they tended to see the glass as half full  Interest rate  developments largely mirrored these shifting views  The other topic that has  occupied markets in the aftermath of the G-7 summit in Dubai is the dollar’s  exchange rate and the feedback effects that a further fall in the dollar might have on  asset markets       The top panel on page 1 graphs US and euro-area three-month cash deposit rates   and the three-month rate three, six, and nine months forward  During much of  September, markets were disappointed by US data, culminating with the weaker- than-expected Chicago PMI and consumer confidence numbers reported on  September 30, and US forward rates (the dashed red lines) fell sharply  However,  starting with the September employment numbers, released on October 3, the outlook  began to take on a more positive tone  GDP forecasts were upwardly revised, and  forward rates started moving higher  Comments by President Parry and Treasury  Secretary Snow in mid-October caused market participants to price in a higher  likelihood that short-term rates would rise sooner than had been anticipated  But that  flurry of angst quickly ebbed as stock prices began to give back some of their gains  after news of disappointing outlooks from a couple of bellwether companies  On  balance, forward rates are roughly where they were in late August  Short-term rates  in the euro area, both cash and forward (the green lines) traversed the same general  path as US rates, as the outlook there was also perceived to be a bit more positive   Once again, euro area rates tended to show a more pronounced reaction to US data  and announcements than to European ones       Yields in the Treasury market also followed the same general pattern, as shown in   the bottom two panels on page 1  When ten-year yields briefly fell below 4 percent,  some market strategists speculated that another wave of convexity hedging by  mortgage accounts might kick in  In the event, that did not materialize  However,  even without that, Treasury yields across the curve were choppy on a day-to-day                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   October 28, 2003 3 of 126    basis  The ten-year note of May 2013, which is now once off the run, has continued  to trade with a high degree of scarcity value in financing markets and with a high  level of fails  In earlier meetings when I was asked about the fails situation, I said  that it was largely a back-office event that had not spilled over into the cash market   However, in the past week we have noted a decrease in transaction volume in this  note, and it has begun trading very rich relative to the current on-the-run ten-year  note  The May ten-year note is now yielding about 15 basis points less than the on- the-run August ten-year note, and the issue is trading at negative rates in the repo  market Given the very limited supply and reports that more investors are demanding  delivery, it is not at all clear how this situation will resolve itself     Despite the ups and down of the Treasury market, spreads continued to narrow, as   shown at the top of page 2 The investment-grade spread (shown in the top left panel)  continued to narrow  This index hit a low of 103 basis points on October 20  The last  time the spread was that narrow was in April 1999  High-yield and emerging-market  debt spreads also narrowed, as shown in the right panel  The high-yield index  narrowed to a low of 453 basis points, the lowest level in about 4 years, while the  EMBI+ spread hit its lowest level in 5½ years  A year ago the spreads on both of  these indexes were at about 1,000 basis points  While a narrowing of spreads is  expected during an economic rebound as the quality of credit improves, several  strategists are voicing concerns about whether a liquidity-driven rally has pushed  spreads to unsustainable levels—particularly in the emerging-market sector     The apparent lack of fear also showed through in some volatility indexes  The   middle panel graphs the volatility index on the S&P 100, also known as the VIX  On  October 21, the VIX hit a low of 16½ percent, its lowest level in more than three  years  Now, one volatility measure that rose was that of the dollar’s exchange rate   The bottom panel graphs the one-month implied volatility of the euro–dollar and  dollar–yen exchange rates As shown in that panel, the volatility of the dollar–yen  exchange rate, which had been trapped in a narrow range by Japanese intervention,  spiked higher—from 8 percent to more than 12 percent in the days surrounding the  Dubai summit and coincident with the suspension of Japanese intervention activity   The G-7 summit in Dubai gave the markets a lot to mull over  The dollar had already  been under downward pressure before the summit  That, coupled with statements  from the Administration earlier in September pushing for more exchange rate  flexibility among Asian currencies, made the markets look cautiously toward the  summit, but most observers did not expect much from the communiqué  In the event,  reaction to the communiqué ranged along a wide spectrum  Some viewed it as a  milestone that finally buried the so-called “strong dollar” policy; some were confused  about what, if anything, the G-7 was saying; and some were convinced that nothing  had changed and that the communiqué did not signify any policy shifts by the G-7     In that environment it is not surprising that the dollar continued under some   downward pressure  The top panel on the next page graphs the euro’s value against  the dollar  After a dip in late August, the euro appreciated sharply in the run-up to  Dubai and in subsequent days  European policymakers at that point were expressing   October 28, 2003 4 of 126    some concern that the bulk of any adjustment to the dollar’s exchange rate would  have to be borne by the euro if many Asian currencies in particular continued to be  fixed against the dollar  Asian currencies appreciated somewhat against the dollar, as  shown in the middle panel, with the exception of the Chinese yuan, which continued  at its fixed rate  Some central banks reacted with traditional intervention to stem the  rise of their currencies; others resorted to capital controls, restrictions on access to  local banking systems, and various forms of moral suasion  Although the Chinese  yuan spot rate stayed fixed, the upward pressure on the yuan showed through in the  nondeliverable forward (NDF) market where the one-year NDF implies a 40 percent  appreciation of the currency  The Hong Kong dollar also strengthened in the days  after Dubai, at first without actions from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority  Given  the currency board system in Hong Kong, the lack of intervention surprised those  who were short Hong Kong dollars and had perceived the currency board to be  symmetric  The actions taken by a number of central banks in the region have added  a sense of two-way risk to Asian currency rates, which perhaps was lacking before   A less favorable view expressed by some was that a new risk premium had been  introduced into Asian markets  In any case, with reserve levels in Asia rising, traders  are asking a number of questions  What is the end game for this process?  How do  these countries counter capital inflows?  Do the central banks have the instruments to  sterilize their foreign exchange interventions?  And that list doesn’t even include the  broader macroeconomic questions that are relevant, such as the risks of overheated  economies  The bottom panel graphs the dollar–yen exchange rate  That rate had  traded in a narrow range until September 16, when the Japanese stopped intervening   The rate promptly depreciated sharply to the 110 region, whereupon the Ministry of  Finance (MOF) again resumed intervention  This morning the yen/dollar exchange  rate hit a three-year low of 10810 amid token intervention by the authorities  During  the period, the MOF purchased $25½ billion, including $400 million that the Desk  purchased as agent on behalf of the Japanese authorities     Given the large scale of Japanese intervention this year, I thought I’d spend a few   minutes on this topic  The top panel of page 4 depicts net yearly intervention by the  Japanese monetary authorities since 1989  With two months left in 2003, the MOF’s  intervention exceeds $139 billion so far this year—more than double the previous  high  The middle panel shows how Japanese intervention has evolved over the years   Each dot is a daily intervention purchase or sale of dollars over the period from 1989  to date  Between 1989 and mid-1995, Japanese interventions tended to be frequent,  but each operation was relatively modest in size—at least by later standards  With a  change in leadership at the Ministry of Finance in mid-1995 came a different  intervention style  Over the next seven years, Japanese intervention episodes were  much less frequent but much larger in size  Individual operations were frequently  larger than $5 billion and in a few cases more than $10 billion  Ironically, the largest  single operation is—appropriately perhaps—off the chart and was a sale of $20  billion dollars in April 1998  For reference purposes, the largest dollar–yen  intervention by the US monetary authorities was $833 million in June 1998  Since  the beginning of 2003—coinciding with another leadership change at the MOF— Japanese intervention tactics have shifted yet again; interventions this year have been   October 28, 2003 5 of 126    frequent and large  In short, the two previous styles have been combined  The  bottom panel looks at the effect of Japanese interventions on volatility during the  major intervention episodes in the last nine years  The red bars show the intraday  range, expressed in yen, on days the MOF did not intervene, and the blue bars show  the range on days when it did intervene  Since intervention typically imparts some  information to the markets—whether that is intended or not—markets generally react  with a higher degree of movement than usual, and volatility rises  Indeed, that is the  pattern we observe  However, during the January to July 2003 period, this traditional  and expected pattern does not apply  The daily range was actually lower on  intervention days, suggesting that intervention was constraining the “normal” elbow  room, if you will, that the exchange rate uses in a typical day  That is also consistent  with a strategy that appeared to be aimed at preventing the exchange rate from  moving further rather than at attempting to engineer a reversal     Mr Chairman, once again, the Desk did not conduct any foreign operations in this   period I will need a vote to ratify domestic operations      Well, I’m not sure I would go that far     Academics have long argued about the effect of intervention  Certainly the   size of the Japanese intervention has been incredible this year      That’s yet another set of issues  Nevertheless, the rate is about 12 yen lower   than it was at the end of last year despite this very, very large intervention  Compounding the   situation is the question of whether the intervention is sterilized or not     I don’t think I would argue with that  In fact, one of the points that   commentators have made over the years is that, in the absence of the Japanese financial system   being able to recycle these funds, it is left to the authorities, through intervention, to do that    Even so, the scale of this year’s intervention is very large and far exceeds the current account   surplus  So they’re recycling the current account and then some  The amount of intervention is   quite pronounced this year     I have watched foreign exchange markets for about eleven years, which is   nowhere near as long as you’ve been watching them, and I would never want to forecast   exchange rates because it seems so impossible to do  So that’s my first point  On your second   question—whether the spot rate captures all the information that is knowable—I wouldn’t even   want to venture a guess  I don’t know if Karen wants to give us some views on this question     In a recent paper, Professor Ito calculated that the Japanese actually have   made significant profits because of the carry—the interest rate spread between the cost of   financing, which has been essentially zero in the last few years, and what they’ve earned on their   treasuries  So there has been a significant profit  Exchange rates have fluctuated, and the   Japanese have been buying at different rates  But on the whole apparently the intervention has   been quite profitable for them     The way that the MOF finances its intervention is that it issues financing   bills, which in the first instance are underwritten by the Bank of Japan  Subsequently, some   number of weeks later, the MOF sells new financing bills to the market, and then it can refinance   and repay the Bank of Japan  So the one-to-one yen relationship that one would typically see   when a central bank is intervening, we really don’t see because of the secondary route, which   October 28, 2003 10 of 126    then gets unwound  Now, when I spoke to people at the Bank of Japan about this issue, they   didn’t see what the fuss was about  Their view is that the MOF is doing its thing, we’re doing   our thing, and we don’t think of it in terms of sterilizing foreign exchange intervention  They’re   looking at it in terms of targeting current account balances—full stop      Yes, but what I’m describing is the mechanism involved and what the people   at the Bank of Japan have said to me       I’m confident in saying that this is not unsterilized intervention  I think that’s   as far as I want to go  Whether it’s something in between—a little of this and a little of that—  I’m not so sure about that       I think you make a good point that spread relationships in a low interest rate   market might be somewhat different from those in a high interest rate environment Again, I   don’t want to overstate what is depicted here on page 2  I thought it was somewhat noteworthy   that we were seeing some interesting levels that we hadn’t seen in a while  As for the equity   volatility, I would take your point that these kinds of volatility numbers were not unusual in the   early 1990s  So I would agree with that  They are low, however, compared with the late 1990s   and early 2000s  On the fixed-income side, it’s not a question of fear but that in some quarters at   least I think there’s a degree of discomfort with the level of the spread relationships, especially   on emerging-market debt    "
5175,2003-12-09,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the package that was  circulated a short time ago  The intermeeting period was characterized by generally  stronger data both in the United States and abroad but with a divergence of views  about what that implied for near-term movements in interest rates  In addition, the  dollar continued to depreciate regardless of the tenor of the accompanying data     The top panel on page 1 graphs current three-month deposit rates and three-month   deposit rates three, six, and nine months forward for the dollar and the euro since  September  Dollar rates are in red and euro rates in green  In the days after your last  meeting, the initial GDP report, manufacturing survey releases, and the October  employment report were all stronger than expected, and forward rates (the dashed red  lines) rose Those rates subsequently retraced that rise after a succession of comments  by Committee members emphasized that policy would not be tightened any time  soon  The upward revision of third-quarter GDP to 82 percent, coupled with market  sentiment that the Committee would remove the “considerable period” language from  its statement, drove forward rates higher yet again  But this past Friday’s                                                    1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)      December 9, 2003 3 of 133    employment report and the Washington Post article about the possible content of your  statement for this meeting caused a sharp reversal in forward rates, and on net  forward rates are much as they were in mid-October     Euro forward rates largely moved in sympathy with US rates; but in Europe, too,   the data improved, and European growth forecasts were revised higher  In particular,  in Germany machinery and factory orders for October turned positive after several  weak months  In addition, increased talk about the “stickiness” of European inflation  emboldened those who are expecting the ECB to be aggressive if signs of inflation  appear  Rate hikes by the Bank of England and the Reserve Bank of Australia and  increases in some commodity prices provided traders with periodic reminders about  the risk of not being positioned for a possible turn in the cycle  Shown on the bottom  panel of page 1 are the two-year Treasury yield and the fed funds target since July 1,  2002  After a year-long period of narrowing, the spread between the two started to  widen after the June reduction in the funds target and did so again more recently as  the market was bringing forward the horizon for higher short-term rates  Even with  Friday’s narrowing, that spread is fairly wide by recent standards     Looking at a longer time period, the top of page 2 graphs the spread between the   two-year note and the fed funds target since 1990  The recent peak in the spread is at  the high end of the range since 1995  It is narrower, however, than the spread  frequently observed in the 1991-93 period, when the funds target was anchored at  what was perceived to be an unusually low rate at that time—30 percent  There have  also been false alarms such as in early 2002, when the spread shot up to 200 basis  points only to be walked back down by disappointing data in subsequent months   There is less ambiguity with credit markets, which continue to perform well  Spreads  have continued to narrow even as they have approached 1998 levels  Optimists point  to improving credit quality, a global recovery that will lift all boats, and anecdotal  reports of less leverage in the system  Cynics counter that there is too much investor  confidence and hence complacency, given the small room for error, and that the  recovery is no sure thing—especially for more-leveraged companies and weaker  emerging-market borrowers       The two middle panels reflect the continued contraction of risk spreads  The   investment-grade corporate spread narrowed to less than 100 basis points—the  narrowest level since July 1998 and down from 265 basis points during the distress of  early October last year  The middle right panel depicts the Merrill Lynch high-yield  and EMBI+ spreads to Treasuries  At 425 basis points, the high-yield spread is at its  lowest level since August 1998, just before the Russian default  The combination of  low Treasury yields and narrow spreads has led to the lowest nominal borrowing rates  for lower-rated borrowers since before 1990, as shown in the graph at the bottom of  page 2       While equities and fixed-income markets have performed well this year, the dollar   has continued its steady depreciation  The chart at the top of page 3 shows the value  of the dollar against five major currencies from January 1, 2003, to date The pace of   December 9, 2003 4 of 133    depreciation has accelerated somewhat since early September  Part of the explanation  is purported to be the G-7 communiqué in Dubai  But the dollar has continued to  depreciate despite all the positive data of the last 2½ months  The dollar is at its  weakest point against the euro since the euro’s inception—at about 12260 as we  speak  The British pound recently hit an eleven-year high versus the dollar, and other  floating currencies have also hit multiyear highs  Part of the reason ascribed to the  dollar’s fall relates to reduced long-term private capital flows such as FDI or long- term equity investments  Instead, the funding for the current account deficit relies  more on short-term capital flows such as official purchases  Excluding Japan and  Switzerland, dollar interest rates are lower than those of most major currencies across  the yield curve  The middle panel shows the yield advantage that five-year  government bonds of Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia have  over the five-year Treasury  The picture looks similar at other maturities  With lower  interest rates and an absence of long-term capital flows, what appears to be giving  way is the value of the dollar  So far, the dollar’s fall has been gradual, and  volatilities have been low  The bottom panel shows implied volatilities for the euro– dollar and dollar–yen exchange rates  There has been little movement in euro–dollar  volatility despite the move to successive new highs for the euro  This suggests some  comfort with the direction and pace of euro appreciation  The implied volatility for  the dollar–yen has continued to decline following its mid-September spike  surrounding the G-7 summit in Dubai and the temporary intervention pause of  Japan’s Ministry of Finance  During the intermeeting period, the Japanese monetary  authorities purchased another $17½ billion, bringing cumulative purchases for 2003  to $157 billion     Moving on to page 4 and activity in the System Open Market Account (SOMA),   tomorrow will mark something of a milestone  Fannie Mae’s ten-year bond that was  issued on December 10, 1993, will mature, and that is the last agency instrument held  outright in SOMA  The top panel graphs the evolution of SOMA’s outright holdings  of agencies going back to 1970  At its peak, SOMA held about $9 billion dollars of  agency debt, accounting for about 6 to 7 percent of SOMA’s holdings  That number  shrank rapidly in absolute size and as a percentage of overall SOMA holdings with  the decision in 1981 to cease outright purchases and to roll over maturing securities  only when suitable new securities were available in the primary market  With the  maturity of the Fannie Mae issue tomorrow, our outright agency holdings will be  zero  The Desk does continue to accept agency debt as collateral in its repo  operations, as shown in the bottom panel  Until the late 1990s the amount of agency  collateral held was small, though as a percentage even that small number accounted  for 10 to 30 percent of our collateral  That number shot higher in the late 1990s with  the shrinkage of the Treasury market and the run-up to Y2K  In addition, the Desk  also started to accept agency-sponsored mortgage-backed securities in late 1999, as  shown by the green bars of the lower panel  The absolute level of our collateral  comprised by agencies, including mortgage-backed securities, has declined in the past  two years  As a percent of the overall collateral pool, the numbers are back to the  high end of their historical range      December 9, 2003 5 of 133    Mr Chairman, There were no foreign operations  I will need a vote to approve  domestic operations       I’m not sure that I have a third  The way I would tend to look at it is that, to   some degree, official holdings have had to fill in the gap to the extent that officials elsewhere   have made a policy choice not to let their currencies appreciate  Now, exactly how that relates to   the substitutability of domestic assets—     Yes, and that’s the unknown  I don’t have a way of quantifying that  I agree   with you that it is the crucial question, but all we can see is the end result  Exactly how we got   there is the more difficult question, and I’m not sure I can give you an answer that would be   robust and would make sense in a full-scale econometric model     I think the answer is “no”—I don’t have a view going forward  Certainly,   there’s a lot of discussion in the markets—if one looks at what is going on in the junk bond   market, for example—that low interest rates and the perception of abundant liquidity have helped   to support risk assets be they high-yield bonds or equities  I don’t know whether or not that’s   true, but that certainly is a perception  The flip side of that coin is that, if monetary conditions   were to change, some of those markets would be at risk     Well, that’s an excellent question  The way I tend to look at it is that we have   a current account deficit and that deficit has to be financed somehow  The cost of financing that   deficit can rise or fall at any given point in time  One way that the cost of financing can rise is   that we have to offer higher rates to attract funds and interest rates here go up  Another way is   that the dollar goes down  That is, a foreigner gets more US assets for the same amount of local   currency assets  So I think the exact mechanics of that are somewhat difficult to pinpoint  But   that’s at least a simple model of how I would look at this  There are a certain number of   investors who are willing to buy dollars at a lower exchange rate with the expectation that the   dollar will appreciate at some point  Now, that’s a question of time horizon, and different   investors will have different time horizons       It’s a puzzle absolutely     I think that’s a good point     I don’t have the specific number, but I believe about 10 percent of Japan’s   overall reserves are held at the central bank       Of their overall reserves     The rest is in the Ministry of Finance  All of the intervention-related activity   is by the Ministry of Finance  The bigger risk to the Bank of Japan’s balance sheet is probably   their holdings of government securities at interest rates of zero and credit risks based on   borrowings from the Bank by some lower-rated entities  Recently you may have seen some   press references to a loss that the Bank of Japan reported       Exactly what the market would do with any particular situation is hard to   predict  But in cases where some other central banks have had low or even negative capital   positions there hasn’t been any material effect that I can think of  Mexico, for example, had this   problem recently when its capital account was depleted  The market didn’t seem to be concerned   by that  That situation has reversed, and now they are back to a more normal capital posture    But I don’t know that the market would react very much if the Bank of Japan reported the   depletion of its capital  "
5176,2003-12-09,"  There is a minority that would say that the low interest rates here are   affecting the dollar  They would also say that that doesn’t mean that our policy isn’t the right   one  It’s just that one of the side effects of having that policy is that the dollar will depreciate     December 9, 2003 37 of 133   "
5229,2004-03-16,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that Carol  Low just circulated  During the intermeeting period, markets fluctuated in response  to somewhat tempered forecasts for economic growth  While some market segments  appeared to be in a risk-reduction mode, others were in a risk-seeking mode  And in  the foreign exchange market, the dollar appreciated after a long period of weakness   Most of the focus was on the dollar–yen rate amid continued very high levels of  intervention by the Japanese authorities  I’ll discuss each of these issues in turn     Forward interest rates in the United States continued to grind lower as   expectations for a pickup in the labor market were dashed yet again  The top panel  graphs the three-month deposit rate and the three-month deposit rate three, six, and  nine months forward going back to November 1, 2003  The green tripwires are dates  of employment reports, and the number next to each tripwire is the difference  between the expected payroll number and the actual number reported that day  In the  November 7 report, the growth of nonfarm payrolls exceeded expectations by 61,000   But in the December 5 report, job growth undershot the consensus expectation by  93,000, and that was the first of four consecutive disappointing reports  I should note  that for this graph we used the number in the initial release—rather than any                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   March 16, 2004 3 of 107    subsequent revisions—since the first report is the number the market responded to  In  any case, the focus on the employment data has been intense  Although a lagging  indicator, market participants are looking to the labor report to confirm other data that  have already turned and thereby confirm that the recovery has durability  Treasury  yields have been edging lower since January and declined sharply on March 5 after  the latest employment report  This morning the ten-year note was yielding about  3¾ percent  Besides reacting to the employment report and other data, the Treasury  market has continued to be preoccupied with the impact on Treasury yields of central  bank buying  The Bluebook has a boxed section on page 2 examining this issue     The middle panel on the first page of my handout graphs the ten-year note yield   on the left scale and the aggregate amount of Treasury securities held in custody by  the New York Fed on the right scale for the period starting in January 2003  From  January 2003 to November 2003, foreign central bank holdings of Treasuries steadily  grew from $700 billion to about $800 billion The ten-year yield traversed a wide  range from about 310 percent during late spring to a high of about 460 percent and  by November 2004 yielded 4¼ percent  Since November Treasury holdings have  gone up another $100 billion or so, and yields on the ten-year note have declined  about 50 basis points  But the direct quantitative links between the two variables are  hard to find  In part the reason may be that we cannot gauge the direct impact of the  purchases because, as with sterilized foreign exchange intervention, we don’t know  the counterfactual  But certain other factors cannot be ignored when assigning  relative weights for why yields are at their current levels  First, as noted earlier, the  data have been disappointing  Second, earlier comments by Committee members that  short-term rates would stay low have affected the shape of the curve  And third, there  is the possibility that some convexity-related purchases among MBS investors have  also kicked in, though anecdotal reports suggest that these hedging programs have  had only a limited impact so far     Although the yield curve has flattened a bit in the past few weeks, it is still very   steep by historical standards The bottom panel graphs the spreads of the ten-year  note less the three-month bill since 1990  Some investors believe that yields should  be much higher at the long end of the curve, but they are battling a countervailing  force that should not be underestimated—namely, the very attractive yield pickup  between the financing rate and the return on longer-term securities That dynamic has  the capacity to keep bringing new investors into the trade for as long as investors  believe financing rates will stay low     Turning to page 2, breakeven rates on TIPS were rising—especially for the five-  year maturity—until very recently when nominal rates moved lower and reduced the  breakeven point  One interesting characteristic of recent price action has been the  convergence of the five- and ten-year breakeven rates  What is unclear is whether  this reflects a change in the inflation outlook for the second five years in that time  span or whether it reflects technical reasons related to recent increases in the CPI that  have had a greater impact on the value of the five-year maturity      March 16, 2004 4 of 107    The middle left panel graphs the investment-grade spread, while the middle right  panel graphs the high-yield and EMBI+ spreads and the Brazilian component of the  EMBI  All of those spreads widened after the last FOMC meeting and the change in  wording in the Committee’s post-meeting statement  In Brazil, local events affected  spreads as well as the fact that Brazilian paper is often used as a proxy hedge for  other less liquid securities  These spreads may suggest the beginnings of a risk- reduction phase in markets  To some extent this widening was long awaited given the  concerns that had been expressed for months about the underpricing of risk in these  segments  Other price movements suggesting the onset of a risk-reducing phase  include the decline of equity prices  Although all of the equity indexes started the  year strong, the weakness in the past few weeks has now put all of the major US  indexes into negative territory for the year to date      The pattern in European markets has largely paralleled events in the United   States, though not always for the same reasons  As shown in the bottom panel,  expected short-term interest rates have been falling in Europe as well  In part the  economic data did not come out as strong as the markets had hoped  But perhaps the  more important factor—until very recently—has been the strength of the euro  With  the euro’s appreciation in December and January, the markets came to believe that the  ECB would ease policy to counteract the currency’s strength  However, with the very  recent depreciation of the euro from $129 to about $12350, some of the pressure was  taken off, and the ECB kept rates steady at its last meeting Nevertheless, the markets  still seem to place fairly high odds that the next move could be an easing one     The exchange value of the dollar has preoccupied both foreign and domestic asset   markets  The dollar had been falling against most currencies into February, but it  then rebounded sharply, as shown in the top panel on page 3  The reasons for the  rebound seem to lie as much in the realm of technical analysis and position  adjustments as in any interpretation of the fundamentals  Data on positions are hard  to come by  But one source that gives us a glimpse is the commitment of traders  report published by the IMM every week for currency futures market activity   Although admittedly imperfect, it does offer one window into the activity of  noncommercial users of futures The bottom panel graphs for the euro and the yen the  number of contracts held at the end of each week since September 2003  The recent  shift from more than 50,000 long yen contracts to about 10,000 short yen contracts  represents the largest weekly shift in the history of this time series  During that week,  there was nothing in the data that could explain such a shift  It may simply have been  a case of the dollar having fallen too far too fast and a consolidation needing to take  place  A variation on this has a link to the risk-reduction story  That is, if risk  positions were being reduced, this would include the closing out of some of the large  short dollar positions that had been built up  In any case, the longer-term forecast  among Street economists is for the dollar to resume its decline, so the dollar’s recent  rebound has not changed the underlying sentiment  In part that reflects concerns  about the current account, and in part, as shown in the two middle panels, it reflects  interest rate differentials—except with the yen—that favor other currencies       March 16, 2004 5 of 107    The yen story, as usual, is a bit more complicated  For once the recent data for  Japan have been decidedly more bullish  Fourth-quarter GDP growth, for example,  was reported to be at a 7 percent rate  Adding in the Japanese current account surplus  and the inflows into Japanese equities from foreign investors, it’s not surprising to see  the yen facing upward pressures  The panel at the top of page 4 shows (in the red  line) the depreciation of the dollar–yen exchange rate through mid-March  The blue  bars graph the daily interventions by the Japanese monetary authorities  As the dollar  moved down, Japan intervened steadily and sometimes in massive size to smooth the  fall of the dollar  Market participants noted a change once the dollar began to rise  It  appeared that the Ministry of Finance (MOF) was actively seeking to push the dollar  higher—in contrast to its previous action of smoothing out the decline as the dollar  was falling  The largest and most controversial intervention occurred on March 5, the  day of the employment report  The middle panel graphs for that day the intraday  evolution of exchange rates indexed from midnight eastern time for the yen, the euro,  the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, and the pound sterling  At 830 am, the  weaker-than-expected employment report was released  Yields and the dollar both  fell sharply  The exception was the dollar–yen exchange rate, which disengaged from  other currency rates and actually rose  The MOF bought $11 billion dollars in the  hours after the data release and, in effect, pushed the rate in the opposite direction  than that suggested by that new piece of fundamental information  Market  participants were confused by the price action, which threw some of the cross rates  out of alignment and adversely affected liquidity  We’ve heard anecdotal reports that  speculators have reduced their activity in the dollar–yen currency pair—reports  corroborated by data from the major interdealer brokers indicating that activity in  dollar–yen has been flat or going down in recent quarters  The dollar–yen rate fell  again late yesterday and this morning following Japanese newswire reports that the  Japanese authorities would cease large-scale intervention after the end of the fiscal  year  This morning the dollar was down about 1 yen, at 10935  During the  intermeeting period Japan bought—including overnight purchases—$76 billion,  bringing to $138 billion its purchases in the first two and a half months of the year   For comparison’s sake, during a very busy 2003, Japan bought $180 billion over the  entire twelve-month span     Leaving aside the trials and tribulations of the exchange markets, other Japanese   asset markets appear unfazed by the scale of the intervention  As seen at the bottom  left, equity prices in Japan rose, in contrast to the pullbacks in US and European  equity markets  Bank stocks have continued to rally as they have since the bailout of  Resona in May  The recent IPO of Shinsei was in demand, and with GDP forecasts  generally being raised, the bad debt situation is expected to improve somewhat   Though at one point there was a sharp selloff in the Japanese government bond (JGB)  market, perhaps the most surprising thing about that market is how well it has  performed  Ten-year yields still trade near 13 percent despite the better economic  numbers  Although there has been chatter about the Bank of Japan’s having to plan  for an exit strategy from its very accommodative stance, most JGB investors still  seem to think that is a long way off      March 16, 2004 6 of 107    There were no foreign operations in this period, Mr Chairman  I will need a vote  to approve the domestic operations       Well, there are a lot of moving parts here  The aggregate custody holdings   are for all countries      In terms of the delta, Japan is obviously a key contributor  But there are a lot   of major players and many ins and outs in these figures  Also for Japan, their cash has actually   been rising over the last few months  That is published on their web site  I believe almost a   quarter of their reserves, if I have my numbers right, are now held in cash  So they are not   automatically–      Deposits, right      In banks in dollars  So it’s not that they are automatically buying dollars and   immediately putting them into Treasuries  There has been a lag, and in fact that lag actually has   been growing     Well, it is if they are immediately buying securities  But again, if we look at   their deposit data, we see that their cash has been rising, so they are not immediately putting all   of their intervention dollars to work     At the point of settlement     Exactly  Again, though, one of the missing pieces is how much of their   dollar purchases are staying as deposits rather than going directly into securities     Yes, this is used because I think people tend to be more familiar with this   relationship  I was not trying to be precise, but I wanted to show that there is a sense in which   the people who have been saying that yields ought to be a lot higher are really fighting this in   part  That is, the spread is so high that—      Well, that’s a good point  In the interest of full disclosure, I must say that I   put the euro in there just to point out that there wasn’t a universal response from this group    Now, one of the anecdotal stories that we keep hearing is that there’s a group of market   participants—if not hedge funds then CTAs and model-driven accounts—that are becoming   more and more important in the marketplace  A lot of these funds use the same kinds of models,   and when their moving average triggers get hit, they all tend to move at the same time  So what   we seem to have had is that kind of move—in the yen in particular     It was a dramatic move  Again, it seemed to be very much a position-  adjustment story, and that was the point I was trying to convey  It seemed to be a change driven   not by fundamentals but by technical factors—and those technical factors were most powerful in   the yen     Yes, we’re really seeing some crosscurrents  On the one hand, if we talk to   people who are active in, say, Treasuries, we hear a lot about the carry trade and about an   expansion of risk and leverage      On the other hand, there are pockets where risk-reduction moves do seem to   be occurring—where people have had some losses and then reduced their other positions  It’s   not universal  This may be a very short-term phase that was localized or limited to a couple of   market segments  We may not be talking about this in the next week or next month  So it seems   as if we have some conflicting forces going on here     Well, explaining exchange rates is always a risky business  The rebound in   part seems to have been technically inspired It’s hard to pinpoint, but I think a number of things   were going on that had some effects  I didn’t spend much time talking about economic   March 16, 2004 10 of 107    developments in Europe, but there has not been as much of an improvement in Europe as people   thought there would be three or four months ago  If Europe had performed better over the last   few months, then we might not have had this rebound in the dollar  On the other hand, as I   pointed out, the underlying sentiment among the strategists on the Street really hasn’t changed    When the euro got to 129, a number of people thought that the market was ripe for a correction    One fellow on our foreign exchange committee, which is a private-sector group, said when the   euro was at 128, “We’ll see 120 before we see 130”  So this may be a natural process that   we’re going through of a flushing out of positions, and we may have a revival of the trend we   were seeing  But that’s one guess    "
5281,2004-05-04,"1  Yes  Thank you, Mr Chairman I’ll be referring to the charts that  Carol Low just circulated  In the intermeeting period, stronger economic data and  rapidly shifting expectations brought forward the timing of the anticipated tightening  cycle and affected a range of asset prices  The top panel of page 1 graphs the three- month deposit rate in black and the three-month deposit rate three, six, and nine  months forward in the dashed red lines  The first move up in forward rates followed  the strong employment report on April 2  The second move was coincident with the  higher-than-expected CPI data on April 14, coupled with other indicators suggesting  to market participants that inflationary pressures were building  Also contributing to  the shift were comments by the Chairman and other members of the Committee—and  even a former member of the Committee—that were broadly interpreted as laying the  groundwork for a tightening later this summer  During April, the three-month  forward rate moved about 35 basis points higher, whereas the nine-month forward   May 4, 2004 5 of 112       rate moved up about 100 basis points  Not surprisingly, the Treasury curve sold off,  and yields moved sharply higher as well  The two-year yield, which tends to be the  most sensitive to policy changes, rose about 82 basis points between late March and  this morning  As shown in the middle panel, the spread between the two-year note  and the target fed funds rate widened to 130 basis points, its widest level since the  spring of 2002     Just as a footnote, I would point out that there has been a lot of talk about what   would happen to bond yields if the fed funds target were raised  What perhaps has  been lost in the discussion is just how much yields already have risen in only the last  five weeks with the mere discussion of a possible tightening  The bottom left panel  graphs the two-year to ten-year Treasury spread  If the market were truly worried  about inflationary pressures, one would expect the curve to steepen as the long end  rises faster than the short end  But the spread has not widened and in fact has  narrowed somewhat—especially after the Chairman’s testimony  Similarly,  breakeven rates from TIPS have not widened and have also narrowed slightly in the  past two weeks  The market is certainly discounting higher interest rates; it is not  obvious, however, that higher inflation is also being priced in     The churning of positions and hedging adjustments as new data came in did cause   a bit of congestion in segments of the market  Turning to page 2, the top panel graphs  the overnight repo rate for the on-the-run two-year Treasury note since February  The  Treasury Department auctions two-year notes monthly so this graph picks up each  new issue on settlement  It’s typical for the on-the-run two-year note to trade slightly  “special”—translating into an overnight financing rate a bit below the general  collateral rate, which itself is normally a few basis points below the funds rate  After  the last employment report, the market rushed to sell the curve, especially at the short  end  In that situation, those with short positions then need to borrow the security to  complete settlement  Given the size of the short base, the demand to borrow that  piece of paper quickly pushed the financing rate toward zero  The congestion also  caused a rise in fails for this issue, and to a lesser extent some other on-the-run issues,  though aggregate fails are still significantly below where they were last summer,  when the May ten-year note was in short supply  The increase in the repo rate at the  very end of April is due to the issuance of a new two-year note that is trading more  comfortably nearer to the general collateral rate     The mortgage market provided another element to recent price changes  The   middle left panel graphs the ten-year yield in red and an estimate of the duration of  outstanding thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in blue  With  the ten-year yield going from 375 to 45 percent, the MBS duration index nearly  doubled from two years to more than three and a half years  There was certainly  some MBS convexity hedging, but it probably played a lesser role than it did last  summer when duration widened very rapidly from about one-half year to three and a  half years  The thirty-year MBS spread, shown on the middle right panel, has  widened in recent weeks, but it is still a long way from the highs of last summer    May 4, 2004 6 of 112       This may suggest that MBS holders such as banks and hedge funds are still holding  on to their levered MBS positions     Corporate spreads, on the other hand, actually have narrowed since the March   FOMC meeting  The investment-grade spread on the bottom left narrowed to about  90 basis points  The better economy seems to be part of the explanation for the  perception of improved creditworthiness The more pronounced move was in the  high-yield spread, shown in the bottom right panel, which narrowed about 70 basis  points The reasons are complex and not necessarily consistent  The better economic  numbers, perceptions of improved pricing power, and improved balance sheets are  part of the explanation but are not fully convincing—especially given the weakness of  equity markets and the widening of other spread products  The narrowing of the  high-yield index is even more paradoxical, given the wider spreads in emerging- market bonds  The high-yield and EMBI spreads had been tracking each other for  about four years now until April’s sharp divergence  I’ll get back to the emerging- market story a bit later     Turning to page 3, the dollar is broadly higher since mid-February, driven by   many of the same factors that sent interest rates higher  At least in this very recent  period, the improved economic prospects in the United States and higher yields have  outweighed worries about the current account imbalance  And while US data have  improved, European growth has lagged, and that divergence has shown up in interest  rate differentials  The middle panels show the Eurodollar and Euribor futures curves  out to June 2006 as of April 1 on the left and April 30 on the right  On April 1 the  Euribor curve was above the Eurodollar curve except at the longer dates; by April 30  the Eurodollar curve had moved higher and had steepened and was trading above the  Euribor curve except at the shorter dates  The bottom panels graph the differential  between a sampling of two-year major sovereign yields and the two-year Treasury  note  All have narrowed in the past month—in some cases, dramatically        The dollar’s recent moves against the yen are graphed at the top of page 4  Since   the last FOMC meeting the dollar has made a round trip, going from 110 yen to  104 yen by the March 31 fiscal year-end date and then back to 110  One factor that  did not affect the exchange rate during the intermeeting period was foreign exchange  intervention  The Japanese Ministry of Finance last intervened in the market on the  date of your previous meeting  The changed tactics had traders scratching their heads  initially, but they have since taken the view that Japan’s improved economy has made  policymakers more comfortable with the exchange rate     The improved Japanese economy has also shown through to fixed-income and   equity markets  The top right panel graphs the continuing, if irregular, rise in ten- year JGB yields  The middle left panel graphs for the past twelve months the rise in  the overall Topix index and some of the domestic equities not linked to the export  sector, such as real estate, that are doing better  Even more impressive has been the  recovery of the banking sector  The middle right panel graphs the stock prices of the  big four banks, each of which has risen sharply  Mizuho and UFJ, which had fallen   May 4, 2004 7 of 112       in 2002 and early 2003, have risen about sevenfold in the last twelve months  The  latter appears to have been unaffected by the special inspection that was announced  on the day of your last meeting     Finally, equity and debt values in emerging markets have fallen in recent days  In   part that may reflect the implications of an incipient tightening cycle here  But the  other factor that may be at play involves an actual or perceived linkage to China   Some emerging markets were affected first positively and later negatively by this  linkage  A few weeks ago the strength of many commodity prices was attributed to  demand from China  With strong signals in the past few days that Chinese officials  are intent on slowing down credit and investment, these popular trades in some case  had sharp reversals  Non-oil commodity prices are one example; they have fallen in  recent days  As I mentioned earlier, the widening of the EMBI+ spread has been  sharp, although as I’ve said in previous meetings many emerging-market analysts  were wary of the narrow EMBI spreads even several months ago  The bottom panel  graphs a sample of major emerging-market equity indexes, all of which have turned  lower in the past week or two with the changed sentiment         Mr Chairman, we conducted no foreign operations in the intermeeting period  I   will need a vote to approve our domestic operations      Well, I think it’s hard to identify what the vulnerabilities are  On the downside,   it’s the refinancing risk that is being hedged; on the upside, it’s the extension risk  As the duration   is extending because higher interest rates are pushing off the day of possible refinancing, there’s a   certain amount of selling that portfolios will naturally do     Exactly  We had a flavor of that in ’94 when an unexpected change in interest   rates caused a huge amount of extension hedging  So, that’s always the risk  Now, what will   trigger it is difficult to pinpoint ex ante  But certainly there would be some amount that would need   to be hedged as rates increase     Yes  I’m looking at Governor Bies, who may have some direct experience in   this area  But again, my guess is that there would be a certain amount of hedging that would still   need to be done     Well, the only message is that, with the euro having brought together a lot of   currencies into one, the number of currencies out there with floating rates has been reduced  We   basically have the euro and a number of fixed-rate currencies, which are not worth showing, so the   number of alternatives in the population is smaller     It may be too calm       We tend to talk to traders rather than to shippers and factory managers, so I   would not hold myself out as the expert in this area  Certainly among trading and investment types,   I would say that there’s a lot of confusion  The sentiment about China has been pretty volatile in   terms of whether the economy is overheating or not, what the inventory situation is, and what the   policy stance is  Some of the volatility that we’re seeing in markets may be reflective of the fact   May 4, 2004 10 of 112       that people change their minds about those issues from day to day  Now, in terms of inventories, I   don’t know if Karen has a better handle—       They’re down a bit     It’s May, which means it is time to consider the renewal of the swap lines  I did   send a brief memo around which covered the renewal of the swaps, and I’m recommending that the   Committee renew them  There were also a couple of other items that I mentioned briefly regarding   May 4, 2004 12 of 112       some things that we’re doing with the euro reserves  I’d be happy to answer questions about either   item   "
5282,2004-05-04,"  May I just add a comment?  One difference to note between Asia ’98 and China   now is that a major issue in the earlier situation was an outflow of capital, but China has a closed   capital account  So a capital outflow is something that we’re just not going to see to the same   degree in the current case  That’s one difference that may mitigate the possibility of a sudden   financial crisis similar to what occurred in Asia in the late ’90s    "
5283,2004-05-04,"  My dictionary aligns perfectly with Vincent’s       Vincent makes a very good point about the initial reaction in January, when   “patience” replaced “considerable period”  And I think he’s right that market participants will look   to see if “patience” is in today’s statement  If it is not, there will be a knee-jerk reaction pushing   yields higher  "
5331,2004-08-10,"1  Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that  Carol Low circulated a short time ago  During the intermeeting period, market  participants scaled back their forecasts for US economic growth—in part because of   rising oil prices—and the effects were reflected in expectations of a more gently  rising trajectory for short-term rates, in lower bond yields, and in lower stock prices      The top panel graphs the three-month deposit rate in black and the three-month   deposit rate three, six, and nine months forward in the dashed red lines  The three- month cash deposit rate (the black line) had been rising and continued to rise in the  intermeeting period, as expectations solidified that the Committee would tighten  policy at this meeting  But forward rates (the dashed red lines) traded in a range and  then declined sharply on Friday, as the employment report led market participants to  reassess their expectations for the pace of future tightening beyond today’s meeting   The six- and nine-month forward rates have both declined about 50 basis points since  late July      The yields on two- and ten-year Treasuries, shown in the middle panels, both fell   in recent weeks and especially on Friday  The two-year yield is about 40 basis points  lower than when the Committee last met The ten-year yield is about 60 basis points  lower than it was in early June, and with yields at this level, the market is again  discussing the possibility of a mortgage-induced wave of buying that would send  yields still lower—but I’ll come back to that point shortly  With the outperformance                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   August 10, 2004 3 of 103          of the ten-year note, the yield curve has continued to flatten, as shown in the bottom  panel     Several weeks ago bond traders were worried that the sharp rise in bond yields   might set off a wave of selling by MBS investors facing extension risk  With the  move down in yields those worries have reversed  The top left panel on page 2  graphs the duration of the thirty-year MBS index, which has narrowed sharply since  early June and now stands at just above 3½ years  On Friday alone that index  contracted by about six months  The level of MBS-related buying in recent days is  hard to track, but anecdotally it has not been a prominent feature of recent trading  A  further move in the MBS yield toward 4 percent could trigger hedge-related buying  by accounts positioning for a new wave of refinancing     As shown in the top right panel, the spread between MBS and Treasuries has   narrowed from 55 basis points in early June to about 40 basis points  Part of that  outperformance by MBS is probably due to a reach for yield in an environment where  the market believed it had comfort about the pace of tightening going forward  An  alternative way of looking at MBS spreads is to measure the level of the implied  volatility of the embedded option  With volatilities generally low across a range of  securities and instruments, the value of the short option embedded in MBS is worth  less, and the MBS itself becomes worth more That vols in MBS are low is a bit  puzzling given the shortening of duration, which increases the likelihood that the  options will move into the money  A side effect of this narrowing of spreads is that at  least one housing GSE has already signaled that it will scale back MBS purchases,  given the reduced value it perceives in current spreads      Other credit markets performed well  Spreads on investment-grade corporate debt   were little changed and appeared nonplussed by the June tightening, as shown in the  middle left panel  Swap spreads were also little changed  The high-yield market— shown in the middle right panel—performed well in the aftermath of the tightening  but widened more recently as the equity markets sold off  Interestingly, spreads on  emerging-market bonds—where there had been perhaps the most anxiety about the  tightening cycle—also narrowed slightly  Ironically, the equity markets hit their  recent peaks just about the time of the Committee’s last meeting and have struggled  since, as shown in the bottom panel  The list of reported ailments for equities is  lengthy  oil prices approaching $45, weaker macro data, terror alerts, and earnings  outlooks for the next few quarters that are far less favorable than the generally strong  Q2 results  According to several equity strategists, operating earnings growth  probably peaked in Q2 and is expected to decelerate in coming quarters  Given  higher oil prices and higher short-term interest rates, the recent sluggishness in equity  prices becomes perhaps a bit more understandable      The picture of moderating economic outlooks and range-bound markets is visible   overseas as well  The top panel on page 3 graphs the euro area three-month deposit  rate and the three-month rates three, six, and nine months forward  Forward rates had  generally fluctuated in a well-defined range, and the ECB was thought to be on hold   August 10, 2004 4 of 103          for the rest of the year  But forward rates fell in the last two weeks as the weaker  US data and continued sluggish data in core Europe took a toll  By late last week  even the modest tightening for early next year began to be priced out      The euro has traded mostly in a 120 to 124 range for the past three months,   though it appreciated sharply on Friday after the employment report The dollar–yen  exchange rate has been similarly in a range buffeted by events on both sides of the  Pacific  Through the middle of June the yen (in the middle right panel) and JGB  yields (in the bottom left panel) both had upward pressure coincident with several  months of strong Japanese data, improved business sentiment, a movement by some  price indexes away from deflation, and generally increased optimism from investors  that the long period of economic underperformance in Japan was at an end  Since  mid-June, however, the value of the yen, JGB yields, and Japanese stock prices have  all fallen, as investors have tempered their optimism with the latest batch of macro  numbers  Those numbers have been almost uniformly weaker than investors’  expectations and have caused some reassessment of how strong the Japanese recovery  really is      Let me change gears just a bit  In the past several months, quite a few traders   have bemoaned the low level of volatility across a range of asset markets and the  absence of perceived trading opportunities  Indeed, according to public reports by  consultants who track the performance of hedge funds, the last few months have been  difficult ones  Page 4 graphs the option-implied volatility since 1999 for a sampling  of the major asset markets  The top panel graphs the S&P 500 volatility index; the  major dollar currency pairs are in the middle panel; and two- and ten-year swaptions  are shown in the bottom panel  In general, implied volatility has been toward the low  end of historical averages for these assets, but a quick look at other markets not  shown here suggests that volatility is low in markets as diverse as the Mexican peso  and the Korean stock market       Given the list of potential worries out there, including the upcoming election, high   and rising oil prices, terrorist threats and other geopolitical issues, the onset of a  tightening cycle, and the usual concerns about the durability of the recovery, one  could reasonably make the case that vols are on the low side  Since options are a  form of financial insurance, one explanation could be that investors are shrugging off  the list of possible concerns and that there’s no apparent mispricing of assets that  investors want to protect against  A more intriguing explanation some have offered  centers on the supply side of the volatility market and particularly on the behavior of  the speculative community  This explanation posits that, with the flood of money  moving into hedge funds recently, the best trade ideas have been picked over pretty  well  But the pressure to make absolute returns persists; and the suggestion is that, in  lieu of adding to traditional carry trades, hedge funds have been selling options to  generate premium  That flow of selling is in turn putting downward pressure on  volatilities in a range of markets        August 10, 2004 5 of 103          As long as volatilities stay low, that is a winning strategy  If volatilities should  rise, then those with short vol positions would have to rush to cover their positions   Data limitations do not allow this explanation to be validated, but the possibility of  large short vol positions spread out over many institutions cannot be ruled out   Finally, note that selling volatility is in effect very similar to a traditional carry trade  both need stability of prices or rates or both in order to work  If this strategy is being  used in size, then our traditional measures of the size of the carry trade would be  underestimated      Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period  I will need a vote   to approve domestic operations       Let me answer that in two ways  First, guessing where convexity-related   hedging might kick in is as much an art as it is science  What some of the dealers are talking about   is that at a rate of about 4 percent we might see some kind of buying or hedging kick in  On the   second aspect—     No  On the second point of where the rate might need to be to trigger a   refinancing wave, the universe is pretty limited, as you say  In the spring, when the ten-year rate got   to about 39 percent, a good deal of refinancing occurred  So, really, the candidates for refinancing   are the mortgages that were originated over the last few months at higher rates; those now might   become attractive candidates for refinancing  As for how many of those there are outstanding, I   don’t have the data here, but I agree with you that it’s probably not a huge number      Yes, exactly  And the number is probably not huge; it’s nowhere near as large   as what we saw, say, in late ’02 and the spring of ’03      Again, might it have some effect?  Yes  Would it have the same kind of effect   that we saw in those earlier periods?  Probably not       Also it’s a difference between historical observed volatility and the implied   volatility   "
5381,2004-09-21,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that Carol  Low circulated a short time ago  In the intermeeting period, markets were generally  calm, and investors perceived events with a generally positive outlook  Despite the  Committee’s tightening of policy on August 10, yields fell across the coupon curve,  spreads narrowed, equities rose, and asset markets continued to exhibit unusually low  volatility       The top panel on the first page graphs the three-month deposit rate in black and   the three-month rate three, six, and nine months forward in the dashed red lines since  mid-June The cash rate rose commensurately with the increases in the target fed  funds rate  But forward rates have been falling gently at the same time, apparently as  the softer data and more-tepid corporate outlooks caused market participants to revise  their expected path of further monetary tightening       The coupon curve has also declined  Two-year Treasury yields, which tend to be   very sensitive to the funds rate, held firm and actually declined a few basis points  since the last meeting, as shown in the middle left panel  But the ten-year yield  continued to fall  This morning the yield was at 407 percent, not far from the mid- March lows before the strong April employment report  At this point the ten-year  yield is again close to hitting levels that may trigger mortgage hedging activity that  could send yields lower     In part the fall in yields seems associated with the softer data—the revised and   lower forecasts—and in part the persistence of high oil prices The market is viewing  higher oil prices as a restraining force far more than as an inflationary one  The net  result is that the yield curve has continued to flatten  A flattening yield curve is not  unusual in a tightening cycle  But the typical pattern is that the short end rises faster  than the long end—which also rises  This cycle has had the anomalous situation in  which the very short end is rising and the rest of the curve is falling       How unusual is this cycle?  The top of page 2 graphs the change in the two-year   yield measured in basis points indexed to the date of the first tightening in recent   September 21, 2004 3 of 100          cycles—for 1994, the mini-cycle of 1997, 1999, and 2004  I did not include earlier  cycles given the different policy and operating environment prior to 1994  As this  graphs shows, the red line depicting 2004 stands out in that yields have fallen  We  see the same pattern for ten-year yields in the middle panel  Finally, the bottom panel  graphs the change in the swap spread also on the same basis  This last item has more  variability, but again this cycle stands out in that spreads have actually narrowed  since the beginning of the tightening cycle  Admittedly this is a limited sample, and  one can argue whether 1997 should even be included, but it is notable in any case that  the market’s reaction has progressively become more benign as the Committee has  become more transparent and the communications policy has evolved     Moving to page 3, breakeven rates on TIPS have narrowed and that fall even   accelerated as the price of oil again headed higher in recent weeks  Whereas earlier  this year the correlation between TIPS breakevens and oil price changes was positive,  it has now turned negative—again suggesting that the economic tax of higher oil  prices is viewed as a more powerful force than its inflationary impact  The middle  panels graph corporate and emerging-market spreads, which continued to narrow   Corporate issuance was on the low side, while investors’ search for yield continued   And after a soggy July, equity prices have risen since your last meeting despite some  downbeat corporate outlooks, the summer slowdown in retail sales, and a buildup of  inventories in parts of the tech sector     Extending this favorable picture is the continuing low volatility in many markets    Page 4 graphs the implied volatility for the S&P 500, the major currency pairs, and  representative swaption contracts  These are similar to graphs I presented at the last  meeting, so I won’t go through them in any detail but only to note that implied  volatilities remain low and in some cases are going still lower  The VIX equity  implied volatility index is at about 14 percent, its lowest level in about a decade  This  combination of low volatility, narrow spreads, stable or rising equity prices, and  lower yields, even in the face of tightening monetary policy, is about as benign an  environment as one can imagine  What is unclear is whether this happy set of  conditions will persist or whether this is the calm before the storm     One market that did see a bit of volatility during the intermeeting period was the   fed funds market  After my June briefing, when I described how the fed funds market  had become less volatile, this is a development I should have anticipated!  [Laughter]  Ironically probably the main reason for the volatility around the time of the last  Committee meeting is the transparency of monetary policy and the confidence this  gives reserve managers at banks to buy reserves to meet requirements before a well- anticipated rate increase  I’d like to spend the rest of my briefing on this topic  But  let me step back a bit to summarize what we at the Desk do on a day-to-day basis       Keeping the funds rate close to its target involves providing enough reserves over   a maintenance period to allow banks to achieve two objectives  First, the injected  reserves should allow the banks to meet all their requirements as well as their   September 21, 2004 4 of 100          precautionary demands for excess reserves  Second, the reserves need to be injected  at a measured pace to avoid undue risks that some banks will end any day overdrawn  or that some banks will accumulate so many reserves early in the maintenance period  that they risk holding unwanted excess levels by the end of the period  But managing  reserves becomes more complicated when there is a great degree of certainty  regarding changes to the target fed funds rate around FOMC meeting dates  When  the expectation of a potential rate hike becomes priced into the interest rate futures  market, these expectations also begin to show through to the funds rate in the days of  the maintenance period immediately prior to an FOMC meeting at which an increase  in the policy rate is anticipated  Reserve managers begin to shift their demand for  balances to meet more of their reserve requirements ahead of the meeting, when rates  are expected to be relatively cheap     This reaction was exhibited during the reserve maintenance period leading up to   the August 10 increase in the fed funds target, as shown in the shaded portion of the  top panel on page 5  That panel depicts the target funds rate in black and the  effective rate in the horizontal red line, along with the highs and lows for each day   With near certainty that the Committee would raise the target funds rate, the incentive  for reserve managers was to accumulate reserves and bid up the funds rate  The Desk  sought to lean against those pressures by adding more reserves than is typical at that  point in the reserve maintenance period  The green line in the bottom panel graphs  the average level of excess balances in that period compared with more-normal  levels, the blue line  Perhaps the funds rate would have been even firmer had we not  added the extra reserves  However, as we witnessed in that reserve maintenance  period, there are tradeoffs in how the Desk reacts to a widely anticipated rate hike   The added reserves may be of limited effectiveness if expectations are very firm   And any buildup of high cumulative excess reserve balances in the banking system  during the first half of the maintenance period will leave banks holding a much higher  than normal level of reserves than they typically want at that stage in a period once  the meeting date has passed  That could possibly set up conditions in which  downward pressure on rates would emerge—whether the funds target was raised at  the meeting or not      This risk materialized after the August meeting because the Desk did not feel that   it had the scope to reduce cumulative excess positions following the meeting date   Given the upcoming high payment flow day of the Treasury’s mid-quarter refunding  settlement on August 16, to do so seemed likely to exacerbate the expected upward  rate pressures anticipated on that day  As we witnessed during this period, the high  cumulative excess positions eventually led to very high levels of volatility  The latter  worked their way into trading as the end of the maintenance period approached, with  trading well below the new target rate as well  At the same time, it’s questionable  what impact the high levels of excess reserves provided early in the period had in  damping rate pressure before the change was announced  Evidence suggests that that  effect was only limited        September 21, 2004 5 of 100          As the Desk will continue to face these challenges in a rising interest rate  environment, it may be prudent to battle firm trading conditions less aggressively  prior to a widely anticipated hike in the funds rate  While providing some level of  reserves in excess of median levels in the midst of firm trading may be warranted, we  are likely to be cautious in our provision, recognizing the risks that arise from high  cumulative balances subsequent to the actual rate movement     Mr Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations in the period  I should   note that tomorrow will mark four years since the last intervention by the US  monetary authorities  This continues the longest period of non-intervention by the  US monetary authorities in the floating rate period  I will need a vote to approve  domestic operations         Well, that’s an excellent question  The charge that I at least believe I have   from this Committee is to achieve—      Well, okay  But in the regime under which we are now operating, as far as   I’m aware I’m expected to try to achieve the target fed funds rate every day  So despite the fact   that the market is expecting a higher funds rate, until the Committee decides to raise its rate   objective, we’re still working under the old directive      Well, what you’re suggesting would make our task easier  We felt somewhat   uncomfortable with the result in that final reserve maintenance period in August, so I think doing   what you suggest would make our life a lot easier      Yes     Well, I think it would be very awkward to have any kind of pre-  commitment—I’m not sure if that’s the right word—about reserves unless we were to do that in   every period   September 21, 2004 8 of 100            Having a two-week reserve maintenance period and operating on a daily   basis to achieve the funds target daily will result in the market trying to anticipate moves that   may happen within the maintenance period  It’s not a stable equilibrium  We’d have to give it   some thought, but I’m not sure what the obvious solution to that is     Mr Chairman, if I could?  One thing that President Lacker pointed out is   that, if we operated more than once on the first day of the reserve maintenance period, we could   create as much reserves as possible, and we’d probably do a better job of achieving the target   rate on that first day  The cost of that, though, is that in subsequent days we might have a very   low funds rate for the rest of the reserve maintenance period  Therefore, over the period as a   whole we might have a rate that is below the target  So there is a tradeoff here      Could I just make one small point?  In a sense, after ’94 the Desk was taken   out of the business of signaling policy changes, which was a positive development    MR KOHN  Absolutely      I think one thing we should be careful of is not to get back into that practice   by having either a signal or a non-signal be taken from what the Desk does  That would not be   something that I think this Committee would welcome  Certainly we at the Desk wouldn’t   welcome it  "
5439,2004-11-10,"1  1The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts circulated a  short time ago  During the intermeeting period, asset prices traded largely in the ranges  we have seen for most of the year, though certain trends were maintained, particularly  the continued flattening of the yield curve, the narrowing of spreads, and the  depreciation of the dollar against some of the major currencies  Until Friday’s  surprisingly strong employment data, market participants had focused more on signs of  a slowdown in growth   November 10, 2004 3 of 107      The top panel on the first page graphs the three-month deposit rate in black and the   rates three, six, and nine months forward in red  Forward rates sagged somewhat after  the September employment report that was released on October 8  However, forward  rates began to rise again when oil prices began to fall from recent highs of $55 and then  again after Friday’s October employment report     Two-year note yields, shown in the middle left panel, have risen more than 35 basis   points since the last meeting, with much of the increase coming in the past few days   The longer end of the curve has not responded as much  Ten-year yields, depicted in the  middle right panel, rose about 20 basis points and have remained in the 4 to 4¼ percent  range  As a result, as shown in the bottom panel, the yield curve has continued to  flatten, with the two-year to ten-year spread narrowing further since the September  meeting  Some in the market are interpreting this flattening as reassurance that  inflationary concerns are contained     Interestingly, despite the flattening of the curve, TIPS breakeven rates have widened   since the September meeting  As shown in the top left panel of the next page, ten-year  breakeven rates widened about ¼ percentage point  Part of the recent widening may  have been due to the last CPI report, which rose 04 points  TIPS, as you know, use the  non-seasonally-adjusted consumer price index to determine inflation compensation   That makes the latest widening a bit of a puzzle since the recent decline in oil prices  may reasonably be expected to have a damping effect on upcoming CPI reports  Indeed,  to add to the puzzle, some have linked the recent widening of breakeven spreads to the  recent fall in oil prices on the theory that this is stimulative to growth and later for  inflation     As depicted in the middle panel, spreads have continued to narrow  The   investment-grade spread, in the middle left panel, is currently at its lowest level since  July 1998  High-yield and emerging-market spreads, shown in the middle right panel,  are also at multiyear lows  While some of the narrowing is, no doubt, the result of a  search for yield by some investors, the strong cash positions of the corporate sector, the  repair to balance sheets since the fall of 2002, and improved situations in some major  emerging markets—especially Brazil—suggest that the move can’t be categorized  solely as a liquidity story  Equity prices have risen in recent days but they are only  slightly higher for the year, and implied volatilities are a bit higher but not materially so     Changing gears a bit, right after the Committee’s September meeting, OFHEO   released its report on Fannie Mae’s accounting methodology  At first, Fannie Mae’s  stock price fell about 15 percent and sharply underperformed both Freddie Mac’s stock  and the broader indexes  Fannie’s equity price has since regained about half its losses   The effect in spread markets, as shown in the bottom right panel, was fleeting  The  green line graphs the spread of Fannie’s senior ten-year debt to Treasuries, which  widened about 10 basis points initially but has now retraced that move fully and is back  to its mid-September level The blue line graphs the spread to the ten-year swap rate,  which is probably more meaningful to Fannie’s funding and hedging costs  That spread  also widened slightly but has since retraced      November 10, 2004 4 of 107    Finally, let me say a few words about foreign exchange markets The dollar  continued to fall during the intermeeting period, though the reasons for its fall are less  than clear The top panel on page 3 graphs the dollar’s movements against a selected  group of currencies indexed from September 1  Despite some thought that the Japanese  authorities might begin intervening again, the dollar has fallen below 106 yen   Meanwhile, the euro has risen to nearly $130 and was trading at $12975 earlier this  morning  These are the euro’s highest levels since its launch  The Canadian dollar is at  its strongest level since 1992; the Swiss franc is at its highest level since 1996; and the  British pound a week or two ago hit its highest level since the ERM crisis of 1992     In recent weeks the market has focused its attention quite a bit more on the current   account deficit  Indeed, some market commentators ascribed part of the dollar’s fall to  comments by several Committee members speaking about the size and implications of  the current account deficit  However, the deficit has been with us for a long time, and it  is not clear why it should suddenly capture the market’s imagination  Other  commentators focused more on what they saw as uncertainties about the growth outlook  for the United States in 2005 or the possibility that the election would not have a clear  winner  And still others viewed the prospect of a Kerry victory as dollar negative  In  the event, of course, the election produced a quick winner  Friday’s employment data  were far stronger than expected, and on Monday ECB President Trichet dabbled in a bit  of verbal intervention when he labeled recent euro–dollar moves as “brutal” and  “unwelcome”  That the dollar was either sold off or at best held its ground after each of  these events has added to the bearishness many traders now have toward the dollar in  the near term  Interestingly, some of the same people who previously believed a Kerry  victory would be bearish because of trade concerns now see the Bush victory as bearish  on the assertion that the budget situation will not be addressed     Asian currencies also gathered more attention than usual in recent weeks  The move   by the People’s Bank of China to increase interest rates by 27 basis points and remove  the ceiling on bank lending rates was taken as a symbol of the authorities’ determination  to rein in growth  Several commodity prices, especially metals prices, fell in the days  after the decision, though the price of oil did not begin to ease until a week later   Interestingly, some market participants viewed this interest rate move as a signal that the  authorities might be more willing to revalue the exchange rate The middle panel graphs  the yuan spot rate, which is fixed at 828 to the dollar, and the forward rates implied  from one-, six-, and twelve-month nondeliverable forwards  The forwards widened  somewhat to a level seen earlier this year during another wave of speculation that a  move might be at hand     While China’s exchange rate has stayed solidly fixed at 828, some of the other   Asian countries have permitted some modest appreciation of their currencies against the  dollar  The bottom panel on page 3 graphs the changes in six selected currencies since  early August  Although appreciations of between 2 and 5 percent may not seem like  much, they have been noted by market participants given how little these currencies had  moved previously  The reasons for permitting this appreciation probably differ from  one country to the next, but some have probably hit the point where they need to  balance competitive issues vis-à-vis China against the inflationary impact on their own  economy of continuing to intervene in foreign exchange markets  The balance may   November 10, 2004 5 of 107    have shifted back somewhat overnight in South Korea, which reportedly intervened  aggressively to prevent a further rise of the won  Market participants estimated that the  intervention was between $600 million and $2 billion  Other Asian currencies  depreciated modestly as well     Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations by the Desk in the period  If you   agree, I suggest that we pause for any questions and approval of the domestic  operations  Then I could say a few words about the memo that Vincent and I circulated  last week about the Desk’s domestic operations       Shall we do that now?     Okay, fine  At the last meeting, the Committee asked Vincent and me to be a   “committee of two” to review how the Desk operates during a period when the market strongly   expects the Committee to change the target fed funds rate  I should say that most of the work was   conducted by Spence Hilton, who is sitting to my left, and by Jim Clouse from the Board’s staff,   who is also here today  I won’t repeat everything that’s in the memo, which I think speaks for   itself, but I’ll summarize our primary conclusions  First, we found that the volatility of the fed   funds rate does not seem to correlate with any major asset class  Therefore, to the extent that there   is volatility in this narrow sector, it has no observable adverse spillover effects  We also believe   that over time the Desk has the tools to deal with such circumstances  Indeed, we think we learned   something from the August experience that helped us manage the funds rate around the September   FOMC meeting  And over time, as both the Desk and bank reserve managers adapt to the new   environment, I would expect this type of volatility to dissipate   If the Committee did wish to change the regime, the choices fall in two categories  First,   FOMC meeting dates could consciously be aligned to coincide with the end of the reserve   maintenance period  A variation would be for policy changes to take effect in the next reserve   period  A second possibility would involve publishing reserve forecasts  Both of these regime-  November 10, 2004 6 of 107    change options have some disadvantages, and the solutions themselves may create new problems    Thus, at the risk of seeming to push for the status quo, our recommendation is to maintain the   current operating framework  Vincent, I don’t know if you have anything to add       I know I haven’t done it  "
5494,2004-12-14,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  With the outcome of this meeting firmly  priced into markets, the intermeeting period was characterized by more than usual  attention to exchange rate developments  Dollar sentiment was bearish for most of  the period, and thus the market was caught offside by last week’s sudden  appreciation  The behavior of Asian central banks, from both a policy and a portfolio  perspective, gripped the markets during much of the period and continues to do so     The top panel on page 1 graphs the three-month US and euro-denominated   deposit rates  The solid red and green lines depict Libor fixings  The dashed lines  graph the three-month deposit rates nine months forward for both currencies  With  the tightening cycle advancing in the United States, short-term rates—represented by  the solid red line—are now higher than in the euro area  However, perhaps the more  interesting point is what has happened to forward rates  At the time of your  September meeting, nine-month forward rates for both dollar and euro deposit rates  were about 26 percent  Since then forward dollar rates have risen along with  generally positive data  Meanwhile, euro forward rates have declined and now sit  very close to the cash rate  With economic data in Europe showing sluggishness and  with the strength of the euro adversely affecting export prospects, the ECB’s earlier  expected tightening has been priced out, and many in the market are talking about a  possible easing       Looking at a somewhat longer time frame, the bottom left panel graphs US–  German three-month interest rate differentials since the beginning of the year  Dollar  interest rates have gone from being 120 basis points lower to being almost   December 14, 2004 3 of 118           ¼ percentage point higher  At the long end of the curve, as shown at the bottom  right, the relationship is more volatile  But there, too, dollar interest rates are higher  by about ½ percentage point—with the most recent widening driven almost entirely  by a fall in German yields, as recent data disappointed  I should note that Japanese  yields, although not shown here, also have fallen modestly, as incoming data were  disappointing there as well     The favorable shift in interest rate differentials might have been expected to help   the value of the dollar  However, as shown at the top of page 2, the dollar has been  on a downward trend  In mid-November, comments about the current account by  Secretary Snow and Chairman Greenspan in the days surrounding the G-20 meeting  in Europe were interpreted by some as signaling acquiescence to the dollar’s fall,  though sentiment was so bearish at the time that perhaps any comments might have  had the same response  With the market so one-sided, it did become vulnerable to a  sudden reversal, even in the absence of any fundamental news  The extent of the  positions can be seen in the middle panel, which graphs the IMM’s net  noncommercial positions for three major currencies—the euro, the yen, and  sterling—against the dollar  After a rather uneventful summer, speculators began to  build up short dollar positions in early fall  By mid-November sentiment was  overwhelmingly bearish and positions extended  As some accounts began to reduce  risk, there was position squaring in several so-called crowded trades, including these  short dollar positions, which fed last week’s appreciation  The dollar’s fall is  certainly affecting returns on US assets for foreigners  The bottom panel graphs the  return year to date for a variety of asset classes and for the US dollar index  Returns  for most asset classes cluster around 5 percent, with high-yield bonds being higher   But for foreign investors, returns for most classes are closer to zero, given the nearly  5 percent fall in the dollar     Another focus of market attention has been the behavior of Asian central banks   from both a policy and a portfolio perspective  Page 3 provides updates of two charts  I showed at the last meeting  The top panel graphs the Chinese yuan spot rate—fixed  at 828—and the one-, six-, and twelve-month forward rates derived from  nondeliverable forwards that are traded offshore and settled in dollars  This is a small  market, but it is one of the few indicators of speculative interest regarding the size  and timing of a possible revaluation of the yuan  Since your last meeting, the forward  discounts have widened, as speculation grew of a near-term change in the regime   This is despite Premier Wen’s comments that any move to make the exchange rate  more flexible would not come if there were pressure from foreigners or from the  markets  That does place China’s officials in a box since they have conceded the  principle, and one would expect that markets will intermittently price in a change in  the regime     Meanwhile, other Asian countries have allowed some appreciation against the   dollar—and therefore against the yuan—in recent months, as shown in the middle  panel  However, the pace of reserve accumulation has again begun to rise, suggesting  that the authorities are nearing their limits  Japan, on the other hand, has not   December 14, 2004 4 of 118           intervened, perhaps in part because the rise of the Korean won and other currencies  means that Japan’s effective exchange rate has not risen as much as the yen’s bilateral  rate against the dollar     Investors have watched closely these countries’ willingness to tolerate further   appreciation  But they are watching at least as closely how these countries are  managing the reserves they have accumulated  There are two dimensions to this  question  First, are these central banks diversifying away from the dollar?  Several  weeks ago a Russian central bank official publicly disclosed that the Russian central  bank had shifted some of its dollar reserves into euros  That announcement and— until recently—the steady decline in the dollar fed speculation that Asian central  banks might act similarly  Of course, if there were a shift from dollars to euros, the  immediate effect would be a further appreciation of the euro, which would result in  an additional reduction in the value of the Asian central banks’ remaining dollars   Also, a further appreciation of the euro is something the ECB might resist at some  point  To date, several Asian central banks have said that they have no plans to  change their currency allocations, though market participants are wary     The second dimension of the question is whether central banks are diversifying   their dollar holdings from Treasuries into other asset classes  Hard data on this point  are hard to come by  Anecdotally, those central banks with large reserve holdings  have been growing both their Treasury and non-Treasury holdings for some time,  though it’s fair to say that the growth rates of agency, MBS, and even corporate  holdings have been faster than that for Treasuries  The bottom panel graphs the New  York Fed’s aggregate custody holdings for Treasury and agencies since the start of  the year  I should stress that this is an incomplete data set since central banks also  hold securities with other custodians  Nevertheless, this does suggest that— especially in recent weeks—there has been a spike in agency holdings whereas  Treasury holdings have been flat  We are aware of one major account that sold  outright some of its Treasuries and re-allocated into agencies  Since the buys and  sells for such securities are conducted with different counterparties, it is entirely  possible that those dealers seeing the sale of Treasuries may have extrapolated in  thinking that this account was also selling the underlying dollars—and thus fed some  of the rumors in recent weeks      Turning to domestic markets on the next page, the short intermeeting period   featured a continuation of recent trends  Spreads are low and, if anything, have  narrowed further  Implied volatilities continued at very low levels, and the price of  oil continued to fall while prices of equities rose  The top panel of page 4 graphs the  two-year to ten-year spread  The yield curve has continued to flatten though there  was a sharp, if brief, steepening in late November driven more by technical factors  than any fundamental news  Once the unwinding subsided, the curve resumed its  flattening trend and at 121 basis points is at its flattest level in more than three years   Financial conditions remain favorable  As noted, corporate and emerging-market  spreads are narrow  The middle panel graphs the absolute yield level for the EMBI+  and High-Yield indexes since 1997  The combination of a lower Treasury curve and   December 14, 2004 5 of 118           narrower spreads has lowered absolute yields to levels where financial comedians are  asking if the name of the high-yield index will need to be changed  Finally, mortgage  spreads continue to trade at low levels, as shown in the bottom left panel  The large  holdings of MBS previously accumulated by banks continue to attract attention on the  theory that a sudden spread widening would trigger this group of investors to start  liquidating these positions     Turning to page 5, let me provide a quick update on the growth of outright   Treasury holdings in the System Open Market Account  The top panel graphs the net  expansion of the SOMA from 1994 through 2003  Not surprisingly, there is a  correlation over the long term between the growth of currency in circulation and the  growth of SOMA  During this ten-year period, currency in circulation grew by  $35 billion per year (averaging over the Y2K event)  Through November 2004 it has  increased by $32 billion this year  Although similar in dollar magnitude to prior  years, that represents a slowdown in currency growth from about 7¼ percent in the  1994-2003 period to just under 6 percent this year  The somewhat slower currency  growth that has emerged in recent years appears to reflect weaker overseas demand   The bottom panel graphs the Federal Reserve’s direct net currency shipments going  back to 1990—a somewhat longer period than in the first two panels  I should note  that these data cover only the Fed’s shipments and receipts  We do not know how  much currency left the country—or came back—via migrant workers, tourists, and  other legal or illegal means, though we have no evidence to suggest that those  relationships have changed in recent years     In many years through 1997, foreign growth composed the bulk of overall   currency growth  Starting in 1998, shipments overseas began to moderate, and  averaging out Y2K effects, the overall trend of foreign shipments has been falling and  in the last two years has turned negative  Without the significant shipments to  Argentina and Iraq in recent years, these numbers would have been lower still     Mr Chairman, that concludes my prepared remarks  There were no foreign   operations in the period  I will need approval of domestic operations, and I’d be  happy to take any questions       I believe so  But as I said, we don’t see the currency that leaves the country—or   that can come back in—by other means  There seems to be a correlation between the middle panel   and the bottom panel, but again, there is a lot of slippage because of other ways currency can leave   the country  But I have not seen a firm reconciliation     I can’t say that I can tell you     We actually did some work on this  Bob, do you remember the paper that we   did a few years ago?   December 14, 2004 7 of 118             People do use these data sometimes as a contrary indicator—for the very   reasons that you note     That’s the risk     Yes  The short answer is yes  They have observed—especially over the last   year —any number of things that should have and did create uncertainty  Yet there was this   dichotomy where volatilities were low and spreads were low  So yes, there has been this   December 14, 2004 8 of 118           dichotomy, and people talked about it  There’s a certain amount of frustration about it as well, I   think, because it doesn’t make sense in terms of most people’s mental models of how these things   work  "
5551,2005-03-22,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  At the Committee’s last meeting I  characterized markets in the preceding weeks as “more of the same,” inasmuch as  trends, such as the gradual rise of short-term interest rates, a flattening yield curve,  narrowing credit spreads, and low volatilities, were continuing their well-established  patterns In the past six weeks, some of those trends ceased, though it is too soon to  declare that they have gone into reverse Questions about the pace of tightening and  prospects for inflation in the medium term became a more prominent source of  concern among investors   The top panel on page 1 of your handout graphs eurodollar deposit contracts  maturing in June 2005, December 2005, and June 2006  What had been a steady rise  in futures rates accelerated after the Chairman’s semiannual monetary policy  testimony, especially for contracts beyond the front month  The spreads between the  June ’06 and June ’05 contracts widened to reflect this more aggressive expected path  of tightening And while some traders ran to their dictionaries to look up the meaning  of “conundrum,” perhaps the more important event with regard to the testimony was  the expectation among many market participants that the Chairman would use the  occasion to signal a pause in tightening or to elucidate the factors that could lead to a  pause Receiving no clarification on either point, the market pushed out the length of  the tightening cycle and, at times, even the pace—with both anecdotal comments and  some fed funds futures reflecting a stronger sense that the Committee might at some  point ratchet up the pace of tightening to 50 basis points   Yields moved higher at both the short and long ends of the curve  As shown in  the middle left panel, the two-year Treasury yield, which had been treading water  earlier in the tightening cycle, increased about 40 basis points—thus widening the  spread to the target funds rate As shown in the middle right panel, 10-year yields  rose from roughly 410 percent at the time of the February meeting to more than 4½  percent today Besides revised expectations of policy and increased worries about  inflation, there were also periodic bouts of anxiety about foreign central bank actions  to diversify away from dollars and/or Treasury securities  The 10-year yield is now  back to roughly the level it was last summer when the tightening cycle began   1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)                                   March 22, 2005 4 of 116  Until the last few weeks, the combination of a gentle rise in short-term rates and  an immovable 10-year yield had substantially flattened the yield curve  The recent  price moves did not reverse that trend but did, as shown in the bottom panel, stabilize  the shape of the curve, which stopped flattening at about 80 basis points The last  few weeks also featured an increased preoccupation among traders and investors with  the prospects for inflation Several inflation reports were higher than expected, and  commodity prices continued to rise  For example, the top panel of page 2 shows the  CRB [Commodity Research Bureau] index since January 2004  Unlike other popular  commodity indexes, the CRB does not have a large energy component and was more  contained during 2004 The recent breakout had contributions from nearly every  segment of the index   Focusing on energy, the middle panel depicts the oil futures curve out to two  years for West Texas intermediate [WTI] as of two dates  The green line shows the  curve as of October 26, 2004, the day oil prices hit their highs last fall and when the  front-month contract topped $55 per barrel  The curve sloped downward by more  than $10, and, for contracts at the end of that two-year horizon, oil was trading below  $45 The blue line graphs the WTI curve as of this past Friday  The front-month  contract was trading at about $57, but the curve has only a small downward slope;  and the contract 24 months out is trading near $53, suggesting that market  participants do not expect much softening in oil prices   The bottom panel graphs in blue the five-year TIPS [Treasury inflation-protected  securities] breakeven inflation rate, which has been rising the past few weeks and is  up substantially from a year ago  This rise in the breakeven rate has been  contemporaneous with the most recent increase in oil prices  During last fall’s oil  price rise, the breakeven was falling Higher oil prices were seen more as a restraint  on activity than as a catalyst for inflation The situation has now reversed, though  there are lots of caveats one needs to consider when interpreting breakeven rates  Other market-based measures of inflationary expectations are tame  For example, the  five-year breakeven five years ahead has remained in a narrow range, as shown by the  red line, and, in fact, is very little changed from a year ago   One question that has occupied market participants is whether risk is being  mispriced  The narrowing of spreads over the past two years and the fall of volatility  suggest that investors have been in risk-seeking mode  In the intermeeting period,  that trend did not reverse, though it did moderate somewhat   The top left panel on page 3 shows the investment-grade corporate spread since  mid-year 2004; in the top right is the high-yield spread  Both have narrowed  substantially in the last year or two At its lowest level in the period, the high-yield  spread was at 266 basis points on March 6 The all-time low for the high-yield  spread was 213 basis points in October of 1997 In recent weeks, both indexes  widened suddenly, contemporaneous with the rise in Treasury yields and some                                      March 22, 2005 5 of 116  specific corporate events Though sudden, the recent widening was modest compared  to other widening episodes during the last two years and relative to the previous  narrowing episodes   Of course, the widening did not affect all issuers equally  The bottom left panel  graphs the spreads of investment-grade issuers by credit rating  The AA, A, and BBB  sectors are all narrower than they were a year ago, but in the past few weeks the BBB  sector underperformed, as investors got nervous about the auto sector in general and  General Motors in particular after that company reported disappointing earnings  The  bottom right panel graphs the auto sector in green and representative 10-year GM and  GMAC bond spreads GM credit default swaps widened as well The pessimist will  take this price action as suggesting that risks are mispriced and that market  participants have not been adequately anticipating deteriorating outlooks The  optimist will conclude from the GM news that markets are discriminating among  issuers as new information becomes available and are repricing accordingly    Turning to page 4, the top panel depicts the EMBI+ [Emerging Markets Bond  Index Plus] spread, which also widened in recent weeks but only to levels observed in  January The conclusion of the Argentine debt package, with its large haircuts, did  not appear to have a contagion effect on the spreads of other large issuers   Parts of the outer rim of the risk spectrum did feel a chill, as shown in the middle  and bottom panels  The middle panel graphs movements of a select group of  emerging-market currencies against the dollar in the period between October and  March 7 Several of these currencies had rallied by more than 10 percent  The green  bars show the depreciations of the past two weeks   The bottom panel shows the same set of relationships for the broad equity market  indexes of the same group of countries  Yes, there has been some unwinding of these  positions in both currencies and equities But, to date, the retracing has been mild  and represents only a fraction of the appreciation observed in previous months  In  short, if this is the beginning of a more general unwinding, there is far more to go     I should also note that the dollar has been firmer against the euro and other major  currencies the past few days, which may suggest a bit of risk aversion, as the  possibility of a more aggressive tightening cycle is causing a reassessment among the  large contingent of dollar shorts   Finally, turning to page 5, I have graphed the implied volatilities of the S&P 500,  representative swaptions contracts, and the major currency pairs  I won’t go through  them in any detail but would only point out the following (1) they are still at very  low levels; and (2) there are signs for both equity and swaption vols that the  downward trend is confronting a bit more headwind at these very low levels,  especially if the inflation and monetary policy outlook changes meaningfully in  coming weeks                             Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in the intermeeting period  I will  need a vote to approve domestic operations  Bob and I will be happy to take any  questions about markets or about the memo I circulated last week regarding some  changes we are planning to make to the yen reserves portfolio    Yes Oil is a little less than a quarter of that index    Yes, it’s about 23 percent, but that compares to about two-thirds or three-  quarters weighting that energy has in the Goldman Sachs and the Dow Jones–AIG indexes, for   example  The other components are—          “Softs,” as they are called—things like agricultural commodities and metals                   I don’t know if iron ore is in there but copper is; copper scrap is in there, I   think    I don’t think steel is in the CRB    The biggest contributor to its movement has been oil, but all of the other   components also had increases  So they all contributed to it, whereas, in the earlier period, when   oil was rising some of the other components actually were declining  So it’s a mixture of effects  "
5552,2005-03-22," Mr Chairman, if I could just add a point on the market effect  As some of   you know, Greece issued a 30-year bond recently at 26 basis points above the rate on Bunds, or   about ½ point below the US 10-year rate and about 100 basis points below the 30-year rate    It’s interesting, since they are at about double the 3 percent limit  So the   markets are not punishing anybody for not complying  "
5600,2005-05-03,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The intermeeting period began with   worries about building inflationary pressures but ended with a growth scare, as   incoming data were weaker than expected and Street economists fell over   themselves to cut their GDP forecasts for the first half of 2005  Meanwhile, the   inflation concerns remained, leaving traders and investors with a sense that the risks   were higher    The top panel on page 1 graphs the June and December 2005 Eurodollar deposit   futures contracts since mid-February  The December contract peaked around the   time of the March FOMC meeting, as the markets interpreted the Committee’s   statement as opening the way for a more aggressive pace of tightening  But that   view was short-lived as weaker retail sales, manufacturing survey data, and a   deteriorating trade situation all tempered what had been a more bullish growth   outlook In short, the markets tinkered with the possibility of a more aggressive   tightening path but quickly fell back to the baseline scenario of 25 basis points per   meeting    That can also be seen in the middle panel on page 1, which shows the spread   between the 2-year Treasury note and the target fed funds rate That spread    1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)                                                   May 3, 2005 4 of 116  contracted sharply at the start of the tightening cycle but then settled into a  comfortable range of 80 to 85 basis points  In February and early March the spread  widened to about 120 basis points as the probability of more aggressive tightening  seemed to increase  But as the growth outlook began to be questioned in recent  weeks, the spread reverted to about 80 basis points   The bottom panel depicts the yield change in basis points of the 10-year Treasury  note reset from the start of the tightening cycles of 1994, 1999, and the current one    Following the Chairman’s February testimony, 10-year Treasury yields rose to  levels where they—arguably—were less of a conundrum  Alas, that also proved  temporary as the fall in yields leaves them stuck in a corridor between 4 and 4½  percent At 419 percent this morning, the 10-year yield is only a few basis points  higher than in mid-February at the time of the Chairman’s testimony   The next page takes a look at the yield curve and credit spreads In the past year  the search for yield, improved corporate and sovereign fundamentals, and the  assurance the Fed was providing regarding the tightening path were common reasons  cited for the flattening of the yield curve As investors moved out the maturity  curve, credit spreads narrowed and implied volatilities fell as market participants  became more certain that monetary policy would not bring surprises  The past few  weeks has seen a reversal, or at least a pause, in some of these trends   One exception to this has been the behavior of the shape of the yield curve The  top panel graphs the 2- to 10-year spread, which flattened further in recent weeks  However, unlike the earlier flattening, this cannot be viewed as a period when  investors were reaching for yield or when they were very complacent about the  policy outlook Nor is there evidence that central banks were unusually active An  alternative, though more unpleasant explanation, is that this sector of the bond  market is signaling a further slowdown in activity   Investment-grade corporate and emerging-market spreads both widened in recent  weeks, as investors became somewhat more risk averse and reacted to some  unexpected credit events The recent widening of spreads in these two sectors can  be seen on the right side of the page However, this widening of spreads barely  registers in the longer-term charts on the left side of the page  The optimist will look  at this situation and be reassured that the markets are not overreacting to events and  are still pricing in a fairly benign outlook The pessimist will argue that the power  of the cycle will continue to assert itself and that the period of spreads widening is  just beginning, especially as the effects of previous tightening begin to be felt and  corporate fundamentals shift from being in a period of improvement to a period of  deterioration   Speaking of deterioration, the top panel on the page 3 graphs the price of 5-year  credit default swaps for GM, GMAC, and Ford since January 2004 The price of                                                   May 3, 2005 5 of 116  credit protection has more than tripled, mostly after GM’s earnings warning on  March 16   Meanwhile, spreads have widened, as shown in the middle panel  Although GM  has more than $20 billion in cash on its balance sheet and the company is still  investment-grade according to the rating agencies, it is a high-yield bond according  to the markets  The blue line graphs the spread of a representative longer-term GM  note GM spreads are now wider than the BB and B indexes and closing in on the  CCC index Ford spreads are also trading like high-yield credits, though not as high  as those of GM   The news from GM appears to have had some chilling effects on issuance in the  high-yield sector more generally, though the evidence is inconclusive  The bottom  left panel shows the drop-off in high-yield issuance since the GM news  Of course,  other events were going on at the same time, such as the changed tenor of the macro  data and the fall in equity prices  Still, a plausible contributory explanation is that  high-yield managers were unreceptive to taking on new paper with the prospect of a  large migration of auto-related debt coming into their sector  One important  question mark for portfolio managers is whether the troubles in the auto industry are  sector-specific or whether the general period of improving corporate balance sheets  is ending, to be followed by a period of higher financing costs, margin compression,  and generalized credit deterioration   The bottom right panel graphs the largest components of one high-yield bond  index on a pro forma basis if GM were to be downgraded  Apparently GM would  account for about 6 percent of this index With GM spreads having already blown  out, a downgrade may not have that much of an effect—on the theory that markets  have already discounted the news Of course, GM and GMAC are large issuers in  the investment-grade sector, which is much larger than the high-yield sector   Therefore, we should not be surprised if there were some indigestion and a period of  volatility, as a very large amount of paper is transferred from one set of holders with  one set of time horizons and risk tolerances to another group with a different set of  preferences   As I mentioned earlier, implied volatilities were higher, although not in all asset  classes But they were higher for equities  The top panel of page 4 graphs the VIX  index since January 2004 After reaching a low near 11 percent, the index shot up to  about 19 percent during the recent period of equity price weakness It has since  settled back but in a choppy way In fact, the volatility of the VIX—the second  derivative—is as high as it has been during periods of more generalized market  stress   Fixed income and currency volatilities have been less exciting—in the middle  and bottom part of the page—reflecting less anxiety relative to other indicators  I  should note that dollar-yen volatilities rose on Friday when a brief flurry of                                                May 3, 2005 6 of 116  excitement about a possible revaluation of the renminbi spilled over into dollar-yen  and there was a temporary spike in implied volatility   Finally, I want to return to a subject that was mentioned briefly at the last   meeting, namely, the appetite for longer-dated paper in Europe  As you will recall,   early in 2005 there was a mini frenzy about the need for pension fund managers to   “extend duration” European issuers have been quite happy to step in and fill that   demand at pretty attractive levels  This is despite the watering down of the Stability   and Growth Pact and evidence that some countries showed creativity in managing   their financials to get into EMU [European Monetary Union] in the first place    The top panel simply graphs the German and US 30-year yields; German yields   have been consistently below those of the United States in 2005 Parenthetically I   do need to note that the last US long bond was issued in 2001 so the US 30-year   bond actually has a residual maturity of 26 years  While a 30-year Bund yield of just   under 4 percent could prompt one to ask what the German word for “conundrum” is   [laughter], there is no doubt that the environment has been favorable to issuers—and   not just for the most highly rated  As shown in the middle panel, spreads among   European sovereign issuers have converged over the last several years, just as   promised by the proponents of the Monetary Union  Among the higher-rated   issuers, France recently was able to issue a 50-year bond At the other end, Greece   issued an attractively priced 30-year security    The bottom panel graphs long-dated issuance—that is, beyond 10 years—for   euro area sovereigns since 2000 In 2000, all long dated issuance was by three   countries Germany, Italy, and France  Through only the first four months of 2005,   such issuance has already exceeded that for the full year in every recent year except   2000 And most of the issuance is by countries other than the three I mentioned   earlier    Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in the intermeeting period  I   will need a vote to approve domestic operations  And I also need to talk about   swaps     Well, they will be affected in the short run, as investment managers reprice the   GM and Ford paper    Oh, I see I’m sure that there would be an effect, but I haven’t looked at this  As   that paper was taken out, I guess it would tend to reduce the posted spreads We did see that in the   emerging-market indexes, as some countries defaulted and were taken out of the indexes     Exactly So, I would think that one would see the same kind of effect on the   index itself, but I haven’t looked at the specific question to check it out   Yes, my favorite issue     It’s May, which means that it’s the time of year that I come to this Committee   and ask for a vote on the renewal of the swap facilities for Mexico and Canada  They get renewed in   December, but six months’ notice would need to be given if the Committee chose not to renew them    That’s why we vote on it at this meeting  "
5644,2005-08-09,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts in front of you    During the intermeeting period, market participants confronted the surprise  Chinese revaluation, strong domestic data, and high oil prices  On net, the  result in the market was higher yields and equity prices     The top panel of the first page graphs the December 2005 and December  2006 eurodollar deposit futures contracts  Earlier this spring, the implied rates  on these contracts had been coming down and the spread between the ’05 and  ’06 contracts was narrowing, as most market participants thought the end of the  tightening cycle was approaching But during the intermeeting period, rates  rose sharply and the calendar spread widened  The strong data and some   reassessment about inflationary pressures suggested to many in the market that  the Committee will continue to tighten beyond the so-called neutral rate—  whatever that is      Longer-term yields rose steadily in nearly a straight line since the last  meeting, as shown in the bottom panel  Since June 30, yields on 2- and 10- year  Treasuries rose about 45 basis points Essentially, the curve had a parallel shift  higher and the shape remained unchanged  That dimmed slightly, but did not  silence, the chatter about inverted yield curves observed in the last period    Despite the rise in yields, risk appetites in credit markets remained strong   and the search for yield remained intact  The top of page 2 graphs the option- adjusted spread for 30-year mortgage-backed securities (MBS) That spread is  slightly wider than earlier this year but remains low by historical standards  As  yields move in either direction, this is one market that investors—and for that  matter we at the Desk—tend to watch closely, given the accelerating effects that  convexity hedging can have However, even if yields continue higher, there are  reasons to expect that, at least under current conditions, MBS-related hedging  will play a lesser role    First, mortgage convexity is concentrated in traditional 30-year fixed-rate  mortgages and MBS Right now 70 percent or more of the 30-year fixed MBS  universe have coupons below current rates and thus are already “out of the  money” to be refinanced (The top right chart shows the distribution of  outstanding 30-year MBS)  As a result, further increases in long-term rates will  likely have only a small impact on hedging needs going forward   1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)                                          August 9, 2005 4 of 110  Second, the shift in issuance to hybrid and other adjustable products has  reduced the overall need to hedge convexity for new MBS products    And third, those who do hedge mortgage convexity are more likely to hedge  up front with interest rate options and less likely to hedge dynamically with  swaps or Treasuries The low level of implied volatility has made it cheap to  buy interest rate options for hedging, and several mortgage hedgers have  increased their use of option hedges after their dynamic hedging strategies  produced poor results in the summer of 2003   Finally, there has been some shift at the margin among the holders of MBS  from those who hedge actively to those who probably do not  As shown in the  bottom left panel, the two major housing GSEs [government-sponsored  enterprises]—which do hedge actively—have seen their portfolios level off or  shrink outright   Meanwhile, one group that has been accumulating MBS is foreign official  accounts The bottom right panel graphs aggregate holdings of GSE securities  held by foreign accounts at the New York Fed since January 2002  Despite the  accounting and management problems at both major GSEs, central banks kept  buying GSE securities over the past few years; their overall holdings more than  doubled to over $360 billion Most of those holdings are direct obligations  But  MBS, which were essentially zero only two years ago, now make up about $66  billion, or almost 20 percent of agency holdings  Moreover, this number  probably understates total central bank holdings of MBS since some central  banks have outsourced management of their MBS portfolios to external  managers who use other custodians   Moving to page three, the corporate market recovered very quickly after its  springtime jitters  The top right panel shows the high-yield spread, which has  narrowed by more than 100 basis points since early May  Taking a longer-term  time frame, as shown in the top left panel, even at recent peaks spreads are at  very low levels   While spreads are narrow, quality has shown some signs of deterioration  The middle panel graphs for 1987 through 2005-to-date the percent of high- yield issuance comprised of securities rated at B- or lower at the time of  issuance In the past year, roughly 40 percent have been in this category,  exceeding the levels seen in early 1998 and also in the late 1980s during the  junk bond boom  The use of those proceeds is shown in the bottom panel   After several years of focusing on balance sheet repair, mainly through  refinancing, issuers are getting a bit more aggressive  Let me draw your  attention to the red bar at the bottom of the stack  So far in 2005, about 20  percent of issuance has been used to finance leveraged buyouts—the highest  that number has been since 1989                                         August 9, 2005 5 of 110  Moving overseas, the picture was mixed  In the euro area, economic data  were, at the margin, somewhat better than had been expected  Those improved  data and statements by ECB [European Central Bank] officials that they were  not contemplating an easing of policy shifted sentiment in euro area money  markets  As shown in the top left panel on page 4, the 9-month forward rate  agreement on 3-month euro deposits—the solid green line—rose sharply and  unwound the ease that had been priced into markets around the time of the last  FOMC meeting  The ECB has now maintained its key policy rate at 2 percent  for 26 consecutive months   In contrast, the Bank of England eased policy by 25 basis points last week,  as expected And as shown in the top right panel, another easing is expected     In Asia, the Chinese revaluation was the most noteworthy news event, even  though, overall, the price action in regional markets was tame  Ex ante, the  currency that was expected to appreciate the most if China were to move was  the Japanese yen And on the day of the Chinese announcement, the yen rose  sharply But that was quickly unwound and—as shown in the middle left  panel—the yen remains broadly weaker compared to its level at the beginning  of the year Japanese exporters, who reportedly are using a reference rate of  ¥105, are feeling very comfortable with the yen at these levels    With data such as this morning’s strong machinery orders suggesting that  the Japanese recovery is intact, equities and JGB [Japanese government bond]  yields have both been rising The 10-year JGB yield has risen to about 14  percent  The failure of the Diet to approve the postal reform bill and the  upcoming elections will add some uncertainty in coming weeks, though most  market participants are no longer questioning the recovery even if deflationary  pressures on prices persist   The bottom panel shows the Chinese yuan spot rate since May 9 in black  and the 1-, 6-, and 12-month NDF [non-deliverable forward] rates over the same  period The July 21 revaluation announcement caught the market by surprise   However, the small 21 percent revaluation, the vague nature of the new regime,  the virtually fixed rate versus the dollar since July 21, and finally the July 26  announcement by the People’s Bank of China that this was not the “first step”  of a broader revaluation took the wind out of the sails of those expecting more  forceful measures  Indeed, the longer-term NDF tenors are virtually unchanged  from levels prevailing before July 21  Other regional currencies also  appreciated briefly but, with the exception of the Malaysian ringgit, those  moves have been largely unwound   Turning to domestic operations, I wanted to briefly update the Committee  on the growth of SOMA [System Open Market Account] in the first half of  2005 The top chart depicts the growth of SOMA’s outright holdings in half-                                               August 9, 2005 6 of 110  yearly increments since 2000  So far in 2005, SOMA has expanded by only   about $7 billion, the slowest growth since the first half of 2000, a period that   was distorted by Y2K effects And, given the rising base, in percentage terms   the slow growth of SOMA is even more pronounced    The bottom panel graphs the autonomous factor changes over those same  six-month intervals  The relationship between net factor movements and  SOMA growth is not one-for-one but over longer periods the two track each  other The notable features of the first six months in 2005 are the slow growth  of currency (in green) and the reduction of required operating balances (in blue)     Finally, let me say a word about our foreign reserves  Earlier this year I   reported on my plans to shift investment of the System’s and the ESF’s   [Exchange Stabilization Fund] yen reserves from Treasury bills to a portfolio of   JGB investments and deposits at the Bank of Japan  You will recall that the   Japanese t-bill market had become illiquid and, in my view, no longer suitable   for a reserve portfolio After making the necessary system and procedural   changes, we recently started the process of rolling off maturing t-bills and   investing the proceeds into JGBs and BOJ deposits    Mr Chairman, once again there were no foreign operations in the period  I   will need a vote to approve the domestic operations     Well, I actually had a different institution in mind—a very large player in this   market who did have some issues in ’03  And they have now changed their hedging strategies    Yes    Well, a fact is something that can be observed and verified, and I’m talking—                                                  August 9, 2005 7 of 110   Well, let’s put it this way Some institutions do it better than others, and there   were some institutions that didn’t do it very well in ’03  Patricia, do you want to add something?    Right    Yes, because all of these securities are on Fedwire  We as custodians are not   holding any physicals or other white labels that are not on Fedwire  So these would all be   Freddie, Fannie, or Ginnie, but in fact, they are mostly Fannie and Freddie    I think in part there’s a diversification effect going on because some of these   central banks have such large reserves that they have expanded out the risk curve  So they’ve   expanded their holdings from Treasuries to agency securities to MBS to corporate bonds, and   some even to equities and ABS [asset-backed securities]  Actually, some of the central banks                                        August 9, 2005 9 of 110  with very large reserves have expanded their asset classes quite a bit  So it’s hard to disentangle   how much of that is a substitution for Treasuries and how much reflects just an effort to get a   more diversified portfolio    It’s the optionality  It’s the unpredictability of when you get your cash back     I would not see it that way    Well, the market thought that the July 21 move was a first installment, and   they were encouraged to believe that by some of the initial statements  And then in the July 26   statement they did an about-face    Well, I think the July 26 statement basically sent a signal that there wasn’t   going to be as much flexibility as the market thought    Right, and very little movement or shift has occurred  So I think the markets   are saying that this is either a basket of one [laughter] or it’s a basket where the dollar is 95   percent of the basket and that’s really what they’re targeting    Trish?    Well, if you package something with a lot of yield, there are buyers out there   waiting for that    Yes, there have been a couple of articles in the last two days about that   situation In my view, that particular article in the New York Times was somewhat exaggerated   and had some facts wrong That said, the cheapest-to-deliver into the contract in June was very   tight But to conclude that there was a squeeze as a result is probably going too far, based on the   evidence The issue here is that the futures are very, very large  The cheapest-to-deliver contract   is a finite-sized Treasury As you know, this sort of Treasury issuance has not increased over the   last few years, while the number of people trading and the volume of trading have increased  So   there is this imbalance that we saw a few months ago in another futures case, and we may see   more of it because of the way the contracts are structured  Brian has done some work on this as   well I don’t know if you have anything to add, Brian    It’s a few basis points It can be five to ten basis points, which at one level is   a lot At another level, it’s merely the market forces at work                    Well, at core, I think it’s a supply issue  By the same token, that doesn’t   mean you won’t have people trying to take advantage of that    But there’s no evidence that I’m aware of that there was anything of the kind   of situation that Salomon presented a few years ago  "
5689,2005-09-20,"1  Good morning, Mr Chairman  Thank you I’ll be referring to the  charts that are in front of you     During this intermeeting period, market participants were principally occupied  with the economic impact of Hurricane Katrina and alternating their judgment as to  whether the growth or inflation effects would dominate     The top panel of page 1 graphs the 3-month deposit rate in black and the same   rate 3 months and 9 months forward in red  In the two weeks after your last meeting,  the 9-month forward rate edged down a bit, as market participants began to speculate  that the tightening cycle was pushing the fed funds rate into territory that was within  hailing distance of the so-called neutral rate  Forward rates then fell sharply in the  days after August 29  Suggested reasons for the fall include the possibility that the  Committee might pause at this meeting or that the negative growth impact of the  hurricane would dampen output and abbreviate the cumulative amount of tightening,  even if the Committee were to move today  However, forward rates began to rise as  market participants shrugged off initial worries about lower growth and began to  worry somewhat more about potential inflationary effects  Those concerns were  reinforced by higher prices-paid data in some of the manufacturing surveys and also  by Friday’s inflation expectations component of the Michigan consumer survey   Longer-term yields (in the middle panel) told a similar story, with the 10-year  Treasury yield heading toward 40 percent in the aftermath of the hurricane but rising  to 4¼ percent subsequently The yield curve, which had flattened on expectations  that the impact on growth would dominate, steepened as concerns about growth were  balanced by equal concerns about inflationary effects  Adding to the uncertainty for  the Treasury market was the wide range of estimates for rebuilding the Gulf region  and hence for additional federal borrowing in fiscal 2006     The bottom panel graphs the breakeven inflation curve as of three dates the day  of the last FOMC meeting, the Friday before Katrina hit, and this past Friday  The  horizontal axis represents the maturity of each outstanding inflation-indexed Treasury  security Note that the short end of the curve began to rise before Katrina inasmuch  as oil and gasoline prices had already begun their ascent  The breakeven curve rose   1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)                                 September 20, 2005 4 of 117  further in the next three weeks across the curve, though the rise was especially  pronounced at the short end   With nominal rates, on balance, little changed in the period and the breakeven  curve higher, the effect has been to lower and steepen the real yield curve, as shown  on the top panel of page 2 Given the arithmetic relationships between nominal and  breakeven yields, this graph merely takes the information of the last two charts and  shows it another way Nevertheless, the reduction of real yields is pronounced and  may suggest—at least for the next few years—that investors have an eagerness for  protection from rising inflation  In other asset markets, spreads and volatilities were  mixed on balance and did not exhibit any uniform anxiety about a changed outlook    The middle panel graphs the performance from July 1 of selected equity indexes   In general, equities have risen globally in that period, apparently unfazed by higher  energy prices The middle right panel graphs the performance of the S&P 500 and its  major components since the hurricane  Not surprisingly energy stocks have  performed best  Meanwhile, consumer-related equities have performed worst  And  some retailers, especially those catering to lower-income households, have been  particularly hard hit, as higher gasoline prices took their toll on those consumers even  before Katrina   Municipal bonds issued by governments in the Gulf region held in fairly well  despite the physical destruction  As an illustration, the bottom panel graphs the  spread to the 10-year Treasury of the New Orleans bond of 2029  The spread  narrowed versus Treasuries and outperformed the broader index  Apparently, the  prospect of a multibillion-dollar infusion of federal funds quickly eased any anxieties  investors might have had   Turning to page 3, there was no uniform response in the spread and options  markets to the hurricane  The top left panel shows the implied volatility of a 1-month  option on the front-month gasoline contract for the year to date  With the refinery  outages, it’s no surprise that volatilities for gasoline have jumped sharply, though the  extent of the spike is noteworthy However, as noted earlier, the picture for other  assets is mixed  The top right panel graphs the implied 1-month volatility of 1- and  10-year swaptions Volatilities on longer-dated swaptions barely budged, though for  shorter-dated swaptions—which are more sensitive to changing expectations about  monetary policy—volatility rose sharply   With equity markets rising modestly, the VIX [S&P 100 volatility index] traded  toward the lower end of its range and actually declined after the hurricane, as shown  in the middle left panel  Meanwhile, volatilities on currencies, shown in the middle  right panel, stayed low in the high single digits                                   September 20, 2005 5 of 117  Finally, credit spreads showed no clear pattern  The investment-grade spread at  the bottom left and the high-yield spread in yellow at the bottom right both rose  slightly In contrast, the EMBI+ [Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus] has continued  to narrow to an all-time low spread despite higher energy prices, a political scandal in  Brazil, and uncertain elections in 2006 in several large issuer countries, including  Mexico and Brazil   Turning to page 4, I wanted to return to a topic that President Minehan asked  about at the last meeting, namely, the dynamics related to settlement of the Treasury  futures contract   To provide some background and context, the top panel depicts in the light blue  bars the peak open interest in the 10-year Treasury futures contract  The dark blue  bars represent the issue size of the cheapest-to-deliver Treasury security, also called  the CTD Starting in 2002, the volumes and open interest in the futures contracts  began to rise sharply But with issue size remaining in the $20 billion range, the ratio  of open interest to size of the CTD increased sharply   The growth of peak open interest did not raise eyebrows initially since most  futures contracts are used for speculative, hedging, or arbitrage purposes  Most  contracts are closed out or rolled over into the next contract before maturity, and the  volume of securities actually delivered was de minimis   For example, the middle left panel graphs for the March 2002 contract the open  interest in blue With 15 days of trading left, open interest was about $40 billion  equivalent on the 10-year futures contract Over the next few days there was a slow  decay of open interest, as traders closed out positions or rolled them into the next  contract Only a tiny amount was actually settled  And those with short positions had  no trouble borrowing the August 2010 security, which was the CTD into this contract   This was the normal state of affairs   However, as the markets have grown, some large market participants have begun  to view taking delivery of securities as a viable option compared to the alternative of  slowly building a position in the cash market  Other traders—perhaps more  opportunistically—have noted the disparity between the peak open interest and the  relatively small issue size and may have concluded that there was an increased  possibility that the shorts might have to deliver securities other than the CTD    The center middle panel graphs the situation in June  Open interest decayed very  slowly as those with long positions in the futures market did not find it profitable to  roll their positions Instead they took delivery  As the shorts realized they would be  forced to deliver, there was a scramble to find the February 2012 security  In the  event, the shorts were able to find enough of the CTD—about $14 billion—to fully                                 September 20, 2005 6 of 117  satisfy delivery obligations, but the experience fostered conspiracy theories and the  press articles that followed about a possible squeeze   The September contract, which has two days of trading left, is proving equally  challenging As shown in the middle right panel, the open interest with 15 days of  trading left was an elevated $70 billion or so; and the decay has been slow, suggesting  that the longs would trigger a multi-issue delivery  In the past few days, the open  interest has decreased, but the possibility for a multi-issue delivery remains   The CTD in this settlement cycle is the August of 2012 security  As one would   expect, this issue is hard to find and trading very special in the repo market  The   bottom left panel shows in blue the overnight repo rate for that security, which has   decreased from about 3 percent to zero as it became apparent that there would be a   sizable delivery into the contract  As the security was “boxed,” it has all but stopped   trading in the repo market, and fails in the issue jumped to more than $90 billion and   yesterday they were more than $110 billion From previous experience, those fails   should clear up very quickly after the contract settles    So, has this flurry of activity affected the cash market or the shape of the yield  curve?  All indications are that the answer is no  The bottom right panel graphs notes  in the 5- to 10-year sector as of late last week  The red dot is the August of 2012  security It is trading slightly rich to the curve but not disproportionately so, and it  doesn’t seem to be affecting neighboring securities   The Chicago Board of Trade has instituted position limits for individual  participants during the last 10 days of trading, beginning with the December contract   Whether that will alleviate the problem or will shift the pressure elsewhere remains to  be seen   Mr Chairman, once again there were no foreign operations in the period  In that   regard, I want to note that this coming Thursday will mark five years since our last   intervention  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations     Well, I’ll let Bob Elsasser fill in some texture here  Certainly, larger   investors are more active in the futures market and are using those contracts in more ways than   they had, say, 10 or 15 years ago So the prospect of a—    Yes, but I’m not specifically referring to them  So, as these larger entities   have become more active in the futures, for them the prospect of buying a multibillion dollar   position through the futures market is not daunting  It’s something that they’re easily capable of   doing, whereas probably 15 or 20 years ago taking on a very large position and financing it   might have been a task  So I think that’s part of the story   Second, going into the cash market and building a multibillion dollar position might take   a very long time You might move the price against you, whereas in the futures market there’s a   lot of liquidity and in some ways it could be done more easily  Now, that’s something about the   trading dynamics  But as you point out, if people think something is happening—if one trader   thinks that somebody else is going to be taking delivery—then they might get on the bandwagon    They might add to their own positions in the hope of getting some of those cheaper securities      Yes Now, there were some other dynamics this summer that I don’t want to   get into having to do with position limits that the Board of Trade instituted, which affected the   situation at one point But on the whole, yes, if you had intended to close out a position, you   might be more inclined to take delivery if you observe the large open interest                            September 20, 2005 8 of 117   Well, the Treasury did issue a large-position report request last week for this   particular security  So, those with large positions will have to report that by a particular date—   it’s sometime this week                   September 20, 2005 9 of 117   I know that they’re concerned about the situation, and there was certainly a   signaling effect perceived by the market when the Treasury issued that request for large-position   reports We saw some decay accelerating right after that request, so perhaps some of the longs   took that as a signal that they should reduce their positions   "
5734,2005-11-01,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The now lengthy period of tight spreads  and low volatilities continued in the intermeeting period  That was despite some  unexpected credit events, another hurricane, and increased talk about upside  inflation risks   The top panel on page 1 graphs the 3-month deposit rate in black and the same  rate three and nine months forward in red  The 3- and 9-month forward rates rose  47 and 53 basis points, respectively, as market participants absorbed incoming  data and, even more, comments by Committee members expressing heightened  levels of concern about upside inflation risks      Many market participants now assume that the Committee will tighten during  each of the next four meetings, including the first meeting to be presided over by  the new Chairman  The tone of market expectations—at least among traders as  opposed to Street economists—has changed a bit  Earlier this summer the betting  was about where the co-called “neutral” rate resides  The assumption was that the  Committee would stop in that neighborhood Now, with increased concern about  inflation, the question of where neutrality resides is slowly being superseded by a  new question How far beyond “neutral” will policy need to go to dampen  inflationary pressures?   The yield curve rose across maturities, as shown in the middle panel  The  2-year Treasury yield rose 40 basis points while the 10-year yield rose 30,  apparently affected in part by MBS-related hedging flows  The 2-year yield is at  its highest level since May 2001  The shape of the curve narrowed by 10 basis  points and sits at a relatively narrow 17 basis points       While the conversation in markets was about inflation, interestingly, break- even inflation rates from TIPS [Treasury inflation-protected securities] were little                                         November 1, 2005 4 of 114  changed, as seen in the bottom panel  The 2-year break-even inflation [BEI] rate  had risen over the summer as energy prices rallied; but it plateaued and came off a  bit as the price of oil headed back down  The 10-year BEI was little changed  This suggests that the rise in nominal yields was an increase in real rates and  suggestive of tightened financial conditions  The sluggishness in equity markets  until this past Friday was consistent with this view   The behavior of break-even rates also calls into question some of the instant  analysis surrounding Ben Bernanke’s nomination last Monday  While some  analysts were quick to attribute the rise in nominal yields last week to the  nomination—on the basis of some perceived squishiness on inflation—the rise in  real yields, which had already been in train, and the flatness of BEIs do not bear  this out   If there is some suggestion that financial conditions are tightening, the  evidence elsewhere was mixed  Certainly, yields in other major economies have  been moving higher since the end of the summer, as shown in the top panel of  page 2 Long-term sovereign yields in the UK, Canada, and Germany—the  latter as a proxy for the euro area—have been rising recently  The rise of nearly  40 basis points in German yields has been particularly noteworthy and may reflect  upgraded forecasts for European growth in general and improved sentiment  toward Germany, notwithstanding a messy election outcome that leaves prospects  for reform uncertain   Even Japanese yields have been rising recently  Investors are increasingly  contemplating that maybe, just maybe, after so many false starts, this time the  recovery is for real  The better economic tempo and heightened probabilities that  sometime in the next 12 months the CPI will no longer be preceded by a negative  sign are leading more investors to take a defensive posture toward Japanese  bonds   Expectations about near-term policy in those same countries are broadly  consistent with the movement in longer-dated yields  The middle panel graphs  March 2006 futures prices for short-dated interest rates for the US, UK, Canada  and the euro area Short sterling futures are flat—in itself noteworthy, given that  the Bank of England most recently eased policy  The others are all moving  upward to varying degrees  The middle right panel graphs the December 2006  euro-yen deposit futures contract, which has also risen as the market tries to  anticipate the end of the Bank of Japan’s [BOJ] quantitative easing policy, now  expected by the market—and the BOJ, as reported in the monthly report  yesterday—to be sometime in the fiscal year beginning on April 1   If the developed world provides evidence that financial conditions are  tightening, the same cannot be said for the emerging markets  The EMBI  [Emerging Market Bond Index] spread was little changed and is at historically  tight levels Despite higher dollar rates, the central banks of Brazil and Mexico                                          November 1, 2005 5 of 114  have both been able to ease monetary policy—albeit from high levels—in recent  days and weeks, as reflected in the bottom panels  Brazil and Colombia have  managed to issue local-currency-denominated debt in the international market at  attractive rates, as have some private borrowers in Asia  This decoupling from  policy rates in the major economies stands in sharp contrast to previous cycles   And to emerging market bulls, it reflects a better policy mix, higher reserves, and  a strong global economy   As with emerging markets, the byword in domestic credit markets seemed to  be “what, me worry?”  Despite some high-profile bankruptcies in airlines, auto  parts, and the surprise collapse of Refco, credit markets were not flustered and  took the news in stride As shown in the top panels on page 3, both investment- grade and high-yield spreads moved only slightly and remained at historically  tight levels   The bankruptcies of Delta and Northwest were dismissed, having been long  expected The Delphi bankruptcy was also broadly expected  And yet when it  happened, protection for General Motors in the CDS [credit default swap] market  temporarily shot higher, as shown in the middle panel  The prospect that GM  might have to absorb billions of dollars of additional pension costs got traders’  attention Ford Motor CDS rates were also affected  But the broader Dow Jones  CDX high-yield index—comprised of 100 single names—was little changed    One collapse that was not expected was that of Refco, whose fraud was made  public the morning of October 10 and which filed for bankruptcy on October 17   Refco is a small corporate bond issuer but it does have linkages to firms across  Wall Street  All in all, the stress emanating from Refco was limited  The rather  busy graph at the bottom of page 3 depicts credit default swap rates for eight  major financial firms since January  Note the temporary increase in the price of  protection for these firms in the spring, when GM and Ford were downgraded and  the so-called “correlation trades” began to go bad  In contrast, the Refco news did  not even register a blip in CDS rates   Overall, markets are posing something of a puzzle  The rise in real yields and  the fall in equity prices for most of September and October suggest a tightening of  financial conditions There were both expected and unexpected bankruptcy  filings Yet both emerging markets and domestic credit markets were unfazed,  and money continues to seek higher-yielding assets  Maybe it really is different  this time  Then again, maybe the reaction will come with a lag that is longer than  usual   Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period  I will need a  vote to approve domestic operations                               November 1, 2005 6 of 114    I may be wrong, but didn’t we do—     I think this question came up about a year ago, and Vincent was summarizing the   work that had been done    You know, I haven’t looked at the rolling correlation coefficients recently   Certainly, there have been episodes, going back at least a decade, when these rates moved very,   very closely; 1994 was a period—     Right  Then the correlation sort of breaks down and then it starts up again  I   don’t know if Karen knows more about a date, but over the past couple of years they have been   moving pretty tightly    Denominated in local currencies?    The Brazilian issue was denominated in reals, but actually the payments will be in   dollars  It’s indexed back to reals, so the exchange rate risk is wholly with the investor    Well, they are able to get a much more attractive rate  The spread that they’re   able to get—     The principal is repaid in dollars     No  The payment is in dollars                           November 1, 2005 9 of 114   But it’s indexed to the exchange rate    In other words, the flow of payments you receive is in dollars  When you get your   money back, you will be paid dollars     That’s right    For reasons that I can’t fully explain, the spread that Brazil was able to get by   doing it this way has been much tighter     I’m not as familiar with the Colombian one  I don’t remember the details of that    No, no This is if you want to buy protection on, say, Lehman Brothers or Bear   Stearns  This is the price of protection on these firms                                               November 1, 2005 11 of 114    Yes, all eight of them    This comes from a private-sector firm, so there’s no inside information here     The probability, based on fed funds futures, I think is pretty low right now  My   point was more about the way that people in the markets are slowly coming to view the situation  In   this cycle, they’ve been looking two to three meetings ahead  But the next few meetings are a bit   different, obviously  I believe traders are thinking that the policy moves over the next couple of   meetings are more or less baked in the cake  The new Chairman won’t want to be in the position   where he has to “stop” and confirm the dovish suspicions of some of the folks out there  So that   gets you to the next four meetings, basically  But that fourth one I don’t think is in the fed funds   futures                                November 1, 2005 12 of 114   It’s Citigroup and Bank of America      I do need a vote  "
5735,2005-11-01, I think that’s right  I believe it would be viewed as very hawkish because you’ve   taken out the accommodative language and you’re talking about firming  So I think Vincent is right   that it would be taken as a very hawkish statement  
5779,2005-12-13,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the handout that is in  front of you With the year-end approaching, I thought I’d look back at 2005 a bit   One of the more surprising market developments has been the steady—if low-key—  appreciation of the US dollar  That strength is all the more surprising after the dollar’s  depreciation in 2004 when it appeared that the current account imbalance had hit a  threshold that was impacting exchange markets  But, as shown on the top of page 1 of  your handout, the trade-weighted dollar has appreciated by 8 percent since the start of  2005 The dollar’s strength was broad-based against all major currencies  As shown in  the middle left panel, the dollar rallied from below 105 yen to 120 yen  That last 10  yen—from 110 to 120—came in a nearly straight line and was coincident with Prime  Minister Koizumi’s victory in the September elections and the ongoing improved  sentiment about the Japanese economy  Risk appetite among Japanese investors seems  to have risen and capital outflows have accelerated, as investors look to pick up yield in  fixed income markets not only in the United States but also in markets such as the UK,  Australia, and New Zealand   As shown in the middle right panel, the dollar has also risen against the euro  At  the start of 2005 the euro was trading at about $135  Today it is below $120  Sentiment toward the euro has been poor, given lackluster growth and the widening  interest rate differentials with the dollar—but I’ll comment more on that later  Among  the few currencies that the dollar depreciated against were the Mexican peso and the  Brazilian real Both countries have substantially higher nominal and real interest rates,  and both central banks in recent months have been easing policy   At this point, you might be asking yourself Whatever happened to the issue of the  current account deficit?  Weren’t the imbalances supposed to lead to a weaker dollar?    Certainly, that explanation appeared to work last year when the dollar was falling  The  bottom panel of the first page graphs the trade-weighted dollar—the red line—and the  current account balance for the United States as a percent of GDP since 1980—the blue  bars Ideally, this should show that when the deficit is high, a weak dollar follows   While there have been a couple of periods when growing current account imbalances  were followed by a subsequent bout of dollar weakness (for example, in the period after  1985), there are examples of just the opposite as well  The dollar strengthened in the  early 1980s and also the late 1990s in the face of high and rising current account  deficits When looked at quantitatively, the correlation between the current account  and the next year’s exchange rate is weak      1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)                                             December 13, 2005 4 of 100  What, then, explains the dollar’s strength?  The most compelling explanation—  and this is tentative, I should say—appears to center around the economy’s strength  relative to other major economies  That difference in performance is, in turn, reflected  in interest rate differentials, as shown on page 2  This page graphs the sovereign G-7  yield curve in green, the US Treasury curve in blue, and the G-7 curve excluding the  United States in red The composite yield curves are based on GDP weights for each  country At the beginning of 2004, US short-term rates were lower than those of other  major countries and the US curve was steeper  By the beginning of 2005, and with the  tightening cycle here already well along, the entire US yield curve had shifted above  the others, as shown in the middle panel  That interest rate differential continued to  widen during 2005, with the prospect for further widening if futures markets in the G-7  are to be believed   Of course, all that tells us nothing about the future course of exchange rates   Perhaps growth and interest rate differentials will continue to drive exchange markets   Or perhaps the current account will finally hit some threshold where a sharp  depreciation is triggered  Unfortunately, reviewing past relationships does not help  answer that key question   Turning to page 3 for a closer look at recent monetary policy expectations in the  G-3, the top panel graphs the 3-month cash rate for the dollar and euro—in the solid  blue and red lines, respectively—and 3-, 6-, and 9-month forward rates in the dashed  lines This graph depicts the widening of differentials between dollar and euro interest  rates during the year But it also shows the recent uptrend in rates in the euro area, as  the ECB finally tightened by 25 basis points earlier this month—although that uptrend  was contained by the ECB’s deliberate attempts to signal that this was not the first of a  string of moves along the lines of the US cycle    Short-term rates from forward-rate agreements for Japan, shown in the middle  panel, suggest some backing off from earlier expectations about how quickly the Bank  of Japan [BOJ] would enter a new tightening cycle, with 9-month forward rates falling  about 10 basis points over the intermeeting period  Although the BOJ has signaled an  intention to exit its quantitative easing policy in the second quarter of 2006, there has  been substantial push-back from politicians  Furthermore, the BOJ itself has said  explicitly that even after the exit from quantitative targeting, short-term rates would  stay at or close to zero for some time afterward   Despite actual or expected further tightening of monetary policies in many  countries, risk appetite remains robust  As shown at the bottom of page 3, stock  markets have rallied in most regions  In fact, in local currency terms, the S&P has been  the laggard However, when converted into dollars, the returns on foreign markets are  reduced, given the strength of the dollar; and after that adjustment, the S&P’s  performance looks a lot more like stock market performance elsewhere in the  industrialized world Emerging-market equity markets have been booming in local                                            December 13, 2005 5 of 100  currency terms  And for specific markets such as Brazil and Mexico—whose  currencies have appreciated— returns expressed in dollars have been turbocharged      Turning to page 4 and continuing on the theme of healthy risk appetites, the top  panel graphs the high yield and EMBI+ [Emerging Market Bond Index Plus] spreads  for the year to date High yield spreads have stabilized at around 380 basis points—  higher than levels observed last spring but still low by historical standards  In contrast,  since the last FOMC meeting, emerging-market debt spreads—the green line—have  continued to tighten to all-time lows      Investment grade spreads—in the middle left panel—show a similar pattern   Excluding the troubled auto and airline industries, corporate financial health remains  strong Earnings and cash levels are both high, and leverage is relatively low  That  said, a bit of re-leveraging is in the pipeline, judging by the increasing flows in LBO  deals and announced stock buybacks   The big credit story in November, of course, was the worsened outlook for GM   CDS [credit default swap] spreads for GM, shown in the middle right panel, are now  trading about 1200 basis points over Libor, compared to just over 300 basis points for  the high yield CDX index  Near-term prospects for GM have deteriorated significantly,  so much so that the credit yield curve for GM has inverted  In other words, it is more  expensive to buy credit protection against a GM default in the next 12 months, than it is  to buy credit protection against a GM default over the next 5 years  In addition, sellers  of CDS protection on GM have started to demand up-front payment from buyers of  protection They are “front loading” their coupon payments of the swap because of  fears that GM will default before they have received any payments from protection  buyers The worries about GM were likely reinforced by yesterday’s announcement  from Standard and Poor’s that it had downgraded GM to single B   Recent declines in volatility in both equity and debt markets reinforce this low  risk concept and are consistent with the strong risk appetite in markets  While the VIX  has shown some periodic spikes this year, the movements this year are very small  compared to historical changes  Fixed income volatility is also low, as shown in the  bottom right panel      Turning to page 5, let me say a few words about the System Open Market  Account [SOMA] The top panel graphs the growth of SOMA in dollar terms for each  year since 1995 So far, SOMA has expanded by a bit more than $25 billion in 2005—  somewhat less than the growth in recent years  The main driver of SOMA’s growth is  growth of currency in circulation  As shown in the middle panel, currency growth—  again, measured in dollars—has been trailing off in recent years and is likely to have its  weakest year of growth since the late 1990s  We don’t know the cause of that falling  growth rate, although greater use of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of  electronic payment may at least partly explain this development                            December 13, 2005 6 of 100  Looking at shorter periods, the bottom left panel graphs for 2005 the year-on­ year growth rate for currency Currency growth has decelerated from a 55 percent   growth rate at the beginning of the year to about 35 percent  The noisy panel on the   bottom right shows the growth of currency in the year-end period for each of the past   four years as well as this year through last week, with projections for the remainder of   this year in the burgundy dots During the 2001 year-end—the blue line at the top—   currency grew about 4 percent from November to the peak in late December before the   reflows began The following year the year-end seasonal bulge was less pronounced,   and that pattern has continued in each year since  Again, it’s not clear what is driving   this process, but greater use of alternative forms of payment sounds reasonable  In any   case, the smaller hump in seasonal demand will, if it persists, make the management of   reserves more straightforward in the future    Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations by the Desk  I will need a vote to  approve domestic operations     I didn’t look at it that  closely  I suspect that if one looks at the relationship over a   long enough period, probably not a whole lot  That’s a suspicion    That was my point  I’m sorry, I was not clear  My point was that the S&P looks   as if it underperformed the others, but when you look at it in common terms against the dollar, the   S&P doesn’t quite look like the laggard that it does in local currency terms    Yes, that’s a good point, and we’ve had that discussion here in the past  In fact,   the estimates are that two-thirds of the currency is overseas    We have good data on shipments The shipments data say that the currency is   coming back  What we don’t know is how much is going out by other means, whether legal or illegal,   through things like remittances, for example  If one looks at the other indicator that is used, which is   the number of $100 bills issued, and makes some assumptions about how many of those go overseas,   then that reflow from overseas is tamed  It’s damped a bit   So I think there’s some truth to what you say, but it’s hard to quantify  And in any case, the   interesting thing about this bottom right chart, at least, is that it’s probably driven mostly by domestic   factors because there is evidence of the domestic holiday fluctuation    In terms of the seasonal, yes  "
5825,2006-01-31,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  There are two votes  On the domestic authorization,   I’m recommending that the Committee approve it  There are no amendments that are being   suggested     Okay  Thank you  Then, the next vote is on the foreign currency authorization,   the foreign currency directive, and the procedural instructions  In the memo that I circulated, there   was one small amendment that I am suggesting to the authorization, having to do with some   housekeeping language related to reverse repos, to bring it into alignment with domestic operations    It’s a purely housekeeping item   1       Thank you, Mr Chairman  With the start of the new year, domestic  markets were preoccupied with the same set of questions that occupied market  participants in 2005  How much longer would the tightening cycle continue?  What  is the shape of the yield curve telling us?  Are there signs of a slowdown?  And are  inflation pressures increasing, or are they likely to ebb?   The top panel on the first page graphs the three-month deposit rate in black and  the three-month rate three and nine months forward in red since June 2005  As the  market began to anticipate an end to the tightening cycle, the cash and forward rates  began to converge in recent weeks  With three- and nine-month forwards essentially  trading on top of each other, and allowing for term premiums, taken at face value  forward rates suggest some more modest tightening but also some probability of an  ease later this year  Those market participants that are bearish on interest rates and  the economy point to data hinting at softness, such as signs of a slowdown in housing   The bleak view was given a lift on Friday by the weaker-than-forecast fourth-quarter  GDP report  These market participants see either a quick end to the tightening cycle  or a swift reversal toward policy easing later this year  The counter view is that  inflationary pressures will forestall an early end to the tightening, much less usher in  a new easing cycle  Ironically those with that view took comfort from the price data  in Friday’s GDP report       The compression we see in cash and forward rates at the short end of the curve is   also visible for longer maturities  The middle panel graphs the target fed funds rate in  green along with yields on two- and ten-year Treasury notes  Yields have slowly  been grinding upward the past few days toward 4½ percent as the market, on balance,  has come to discount further tightening beyond today’s meeting  In the past week,  the yield on the two-year note has risen from about 435 percent to 45 percent   Given the mixed data, it’s difficult to make the case that the upward move was driven  by data alone  Indeed, for the first time in a while, traders were talking about  looming supply given fiscal needs Yesterday the Treasury announced a somewhat  higher-than-expected borrowing need for the first quarter  And at last week’s two- year auction, the low level of participation by indirect bidders was taken as a signal   1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   January 31, 2006 7 of 106    that foreign demand was waning  Perhaps market participants are finally coming to  the view that yields are too low given the likely prospect that the cost of financing  positions will continue to rise at least a while longer       With the convergence of yields along the curve, last summer’s chatter about yield   curve inversions flared up anew  The bottom panel graphs two views of the yield  curve going back to 1977  The red line graphs the spread between the ten-year note  and the three-month bill  The blue line graphs the yield spread between the ten-year  and the two-year notes  These are monthly averages, and the last data point is from  January 2006 through last Friday  The gray areas denote recessions      Looking at this chart and similar charts, it’s easy to see why the curve flattening   has received so much attention  In recent decades, recessions have tended to be  preceded by curve inversions  Of course, markets are now so much more developed  and sophisticated that maybe it’s different this time  Changes in markets, such as the  role of pension funds or central bank reserve accumulation, may be distorting the  curve  And maybe that argument is right  But a cautionary point is in order  After  all, the inversion in 2000 was dismissed by most analysts as technically inspired  given the shrinking stock of federal debt and the Treasury’s buyback program at the  long end of the curve  On the other hand, the pessimists may be overplaying their  hand too early in the game  We haven’t had much of an inversion as yet  You need a  magnifying glass to see the inversion, which is very small and so far very brief  The  curve has merely gone flat  As I noted last summer, the curve can be flat for years— as was the case in the late 1990s—without adverse effects on the broader economy   The Chairman has talked about the conundrum, which most private-sector  commentators have used as a jumping off point to talk about low nominal yields at  the long end of the curve  Until recently, less attention was focused on trends in real  rates both here and abroad      The top of page 2 graphs the yield of ten-year inflation-linked securities for the   United States, the United Kingdom, and France for the past seven months  The ten- year TIPS yield in the United States (the green line) has traded at about 2 percent   That’s up from about 1 percent briefly observed in 2004 but well below the 4 percent  earlier in this decade, when the market was still maturing  UK and French real rates  have also fallen since the beginning of the decade  The United Kingdom probably  has the most developed inflation-linked market, with maturities going as far out as  fifty years  The middle panel graphs the real rate on ten-, thirty-, and fifty-year  inflation-linked bonds since September 2005  Note that thirty- and fifty-year yields  have gone down faster than the yields at the ten-year maturity  The fifty-year real  yield traded below ½ percent, and the fifty-year security issued just last week traded  under 40 basis points     What accounts for such low rates?  Well maybe institutions are worried about the   United Kingdom’s long-term inflation prospects  But that does not seem to be borne  out by anecdotal or other indicators  Two intertwined trends in the United Kingdom  related to the insurance and pension fund businesses are frequently cited  First, after   January 31, 2006 8 of 106    the decline in equity prices earlier in the decade, UK and other European insurers  lowered allocations to equity and shifted toward fixed income  Second, in the United  Kingdom, pension rules now require fund managers to match the duration of  liabilities with similar-duration assets  But the shortage of supply relative to demand  has pushed bond prices up and yields down  As a result, the very long end of the  UK real yield curve has been inverted  The long end of the nominal curve, as shown  in the bottom left panel, has also inverted  To fill out the picture, the bottom right  panel graphs ten-, thirty-, and fifty-year break-even rates; but given the distortions,  it’s not clear how much should be read into these numbers  Such movements in UK  real yields have caught the attention of US portfolio managers With continued talk  about the prospect for changes to pension fund rules here, there are those who believe  that the United States will gravitate toward the UK approach of requiring the  matching of duration for assets and liabilities  If so, then the prospect of a steady bid  for long-dated assets may both damp yield volatility at the long end and lower yields  from what they might have been  That would truly make the curve very suspect as an  indicator of future economic performance      If the shape of the US yield curve is bearish for the economy, there is no   shortage of indicators pointing the other way  I will note that in 2000, when the curve  last inverted, the stock market soon slumped, credit spreads began a sudden widening,  and the dollar was appreciating  In this cycle, these other indicators are not flashing  warning lights just yet  The dollar tripped up many forecasters in 2005 by  appreciating  But as shown in the top panel on page 3, more recently the dollar has  depreciated against most currencies, including a few Asian currencies whose  exchange rates against the dollar had been somewhat sticky in the past  Equities have  been rallying globally, especially in countries leveraged to the global economy, such  as Korea in technology and Brazil in commodities  Even the Nikkei has recovered  from its Livedoor-inspired swoon and the curtailment of trading on the Tokyo Stock  Exchange due to problems in processing large volumes  Credit markets continue to  be favorable  As shown in the bottom left chart, the volatility on the S&P 100 rose  from very low levels recently but has already come back  And Treasury volatility— shown on the bottom right—is low and recently has drifted still lower      Moving to page 4, the top panel graphs the high-yield and emerging market debt   spreads  These two spreads essentially moved together for several years and were  viewed as being of similar riskiness  As shown in the top panel, there was a  divergence in mid-2004 when emerging-market yields blew out about 150 basis  points  In mid-2005, the divergence cut the other way, with emerging markets  outperforming and spreads narrowing to new record lows  While some commentators  ascribed the narrowing of emerging-market debt to the search for yield, rising risk  appetite, and “excess liquidity,” others pointed to improving fundamentals driven by  higher commodity prices, better fiscal performance, lower inflation, and higher  reserve levels that insulated these countries from external shocks  The pie charts  below attempt to explain, if not justify, the benign explanation  The two middle pie  charts show the ratings distribution of the high-yield index as of October 2002 and  again as of year-end 2005  The rating distribution of the high-yield index is nearly   January 31, 2006 9 of 106    identical  The two pie charts at the bottom of the page show the rating composition  of the emerging-market index as of the same two dates  Note that the share of higher- rated BBB or investment-grade assets in blue grew from 29 to 38 percent   Meanwhile, the share of low-rated B and CCC paper, which accounted for 33 percent  of the index in October 2002, shrunk to only 11 percent at year-end       In short, the ratings composition is higher for the emerging-market index relative   to the high-yield index in absolute terms, and the trend has been toward relative  ratings improvement  Of course, ratings are not the only factor  In a default  situation, bondholders of a corporation can often assert their rights and recover  meaningful amounts in a bankruptcy process overseen by the courts  In contrast,  while countries have the power to tax, the ability of the creditors in a default to  recover in negotiations—as we saw with Argentina—may not be as favorable      Finally, a few words about domestic reserves management  On page 5, the top   panel graphs the fed funds target in blue, the highs and lows for each day in gray, and  the daily effective rate in red  You’ll note that, although the effective rate was  generally close to the target in the maintenance period that covered the year-end,  there was a bit more variability of rates, usually late in the day, with some tendency  for rates to soften  Part of this was related to normal year-end noise  Note also the  drift higher in the effective rate ahead of the December FOMC meeting  This  reflected the market’s anticipation of the new target rate and the tendency to move the  funds rate from the old to the new target rate days before the meeting     The middle panel looks at this phenomenon more closely  It graphs the difference   between the market (effective) rate and the target fed funds rates in the days before an  FOMC meeting  To make a cleaner comparison, the sample includes only those  periods in which the FOMC meeting fell on the first Tuesday of the two-week reserve  maintenance period and periods in which there were no high-payment days through  the meeting date that might have influenced market conditions  It should be noted  that, in all these maintenance periods, the market had come to fully expect a 25 basis  point tightening move by the start of the period  The blue line shows, for the 2004  sample dates, the drift higher in the funds rate as the FOMC meeting date gets closer   On average, the funds rate was about 7 basis points firm on the Thursday preceding  the meeting and rose to be 21 basis points firm to the old target on the Tuesday  meeting date itself  In our 2005 sample, the anticipation effect was even more  pronounced in the days ahead of the meeting, with the funds rate 15 basis points firm  on the Thursday and the expected move almost fully priced in on the day before the  meeting      The bottom panel underscores the difficulty that the Desk faces when it tries to   lean against expectations that are so widely held  This graph shows, for the same  sample of periods, the amount of average excess reserves in the days leading up to the  FOMC meeting  It also shows what more-typical levels of excess reserves look like  over the first four days of a maintenance period, based on reserve levels from periods  in 2004 and 2005 in which there was no policy change and in which there were no   January 31, 2006 10 of 106    high-payment dates in the first four days  In 2004, the Desk was already providing  much higher levels of excess reserves than normal in the days leading up to the  FOMC meeting during these periods, in order to mitigate the anticipation effects   And these anticipation effects became even more pronounced in 2005, despite our  having increased the levels of excess reserves even further  We tend to believe that  the higher anticipation effects seen in 2005 reflected a learning process on the part of  market participants since the start of the tightening cycle in mid-2004, as buyers and  sellers tested their ability to arbitrage their reserve holdings over more days in the  maintenance period around the expected policy change  It’s not clear what the natural  limit is to this process       Mr Chairman, I am happy to report once again that there were no foreign   operations in the period  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations  Debby  and I are happy to take any questions       It’s the RPIX     Well, my reason for including this detail at the meeting really is because that’s   the anecdotal feedback that I’ve been getting over the past few weeks and months  And, in a sense,   the UK experience caught a lot of portfolio managers here by surprise, and it has made them   rethink their assumptions about the effect that a change in pension rules would have on our long   end  And that, I think, is exactly the point that you’re making     I think what we’ve learned from the UK case is that it can be  In a sense, the   thirty-year gilt in the United Kingdom became disengaged from the rest of the curve some years   ago  And we had an upward-sloping curve to about ten, and then it became inverted because of   January 31, 2006 12 of 106    these pension effects—or that seems to be the prevailing consensus  So some participants in our   markets are trying to think ahead over the next five, ten, fifteen years about what changes in pension   rules would do to the shape of the curve  What will be the demographics that will drive it?  And it’s   making them rethink their assumptions about demand driven by demographics, as you say, versus   other kinds of demands that might increase supply because of fiscal factors  So you might get an   ironic effect in which you’ll get more supply but the demand is even higher because of what’s   happening     I think it can be looked at  I think the other point that you hinted at, which is   very important, is that it’s not just US managers looking at US TIPS but European managers   looking at US inflation-linked securities  It’s a very good point  I think it’s worth studying     I have heard a few anecdotes regarding CEOs who have been very surprised and   become angry when they saw that their unfunded pension fund cost them earnings over the past few   years  They basically directed the CFO and, in turn, the pension managers not to let this happen   again  Thus, regardless of legislation, there has been a shift at the margin from equities into debt   with matching duration  "
